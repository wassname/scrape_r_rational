    This story made me feel the feeling. What you've accomplished here is incredible. You have so much to be proud of here.

    On an unrelated note, you're lucky you're not where any of us can throw anything at you.

    I am equal parts appalled and pleased that my shitpost was actually relevant.

    One day I'll crack what 'gazemaize' references. One day.

    Thank you -- even as someone who was expecting this to all be one big leadup to a punchline, my expectations have been exceeded.

  Last chapter, I reacted to the pickle puns by calling you an “absolute son of a bitch”. I would like to retract that statement, and apologize. It was inappropriate and misinformed of me to say such a thing.

  *Now* you are an absolute son of a bitch.
  ```

  Edit again:

  >"Why did my dad immediately become nicer after he woke up?"

  >"Banksy II sent him a dream while he was sleeping in the non-citizens hospital."

  I wonder if Banksy II is the successor to the BFG as well as the well-known subversive graffiti artist. Banksy II got mentioned in the first and last chapters-- they're responsible for launching JUROR's career as well as changing Chili's heart. Perhaps it was Banksy II who is responsible for Mahuika's vaping, too?

  Edit:

  I was so wrong with my guesses lol.

  I really ought to have figured out what Mahuika's best course of action was. It was pretty heavily foreshadowed in chapter 21 when Mahuika vaped. And in chapter 20 when Mahuika vaped. And in like one or two other chapters.

  So, my bad, but not _that_ hard to miss.

  ---

  Went back searching for "juice" in previous chapters and stumbled on something else. I don't know if anybody else figured it out, but the BFG is the one who makes the better vapes than Wonkaland.

  >"Because! That moron in Happiness Central makes better vapes than me and everyone knows it! Whenever I invent something, it is almost always best! I have the best chocolates! I have the best ice cream! I have the best dirt! That giant jerk is the one exception, and he makes the only two products I cannot beat! His vapes are one of them! Why, I should go up to him and give me a piece of my-"

  The BFG is totally putting dreams in the vapes, so that's pretty rad. Dunno what the other product would be, but I wonder if it's also dream related.
  ```

  - u/SciresM:
    ```
    I had assumed Happiness Central was peachtown. Is the BFG living there, then?

    I had also assumed, maybe incorrectly, that the other product Bucket's beat at are suspenders, since we know Urkeldelphia is the number one exporter of them (and human suffering).

    In retrospect, it's also amusing that Charlie's got Urkeldelphia beat for suffering -- just not the export of it, and not human.
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      I dunno, I'm delirious at this point. Maybe the peach juice makes for better vaping. Or maybe Happiness Central vape juice is magic peach juice mixed with some dreams. (I'd vape the fuck out of that.)
      ```

      - u/SciresM:
        ```
        You and me both, man.
        ```

- u/SciresM:
  ```
  I love that "vape the pickle" was about as accurate a description of what followed as one could have given.
  ```

- u/callmesalticidae:
  ```
  It is currently 10:28 PST, and the chapter was posted 56 minutes ago. 

  This sets a constraint for "4:00 a.m. Wonka Land Standard Time," for those of you who were curious.

  Damnit.

    yahweh*

    I didn't know what the anti-semitism was about and [wiki'd it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Dahl#Reputed_antisemitism). Seems blown out of proportion, but still a stinker of a punchline.
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      I mean, he may have been have joking but he literally said he thought Hitler had a point.
      ```

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        He really doesn't seem like he was joking; it seems he was bitter about the atrocities Israel perpetrated and he fell victim to stereotyping + outgroup homogeneity. The wiki explains the context, but his exact quote was "There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity. I mean, there’s always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no reason." Not a kosher statement, but not quite Hitler apologism either. Hitler had a point (to scapegoat someone) but it wasn't because Israeli Jews were killing people.
        ```

        - u/wren42:
          ```
          >There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity. I mean, there’s always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no reason.

          this is racist. straight up anti-semitism, no qualifiers. 

          I don't like isreael either, but that's not what he said. he said jews as a race have a character trait that provokes people, and that implied that this is what provoked hitler to murder millions of them.  

          It's racist as fuck.
          ```

  ```
  Loved the entire story. 

  But, can someone explain it to me? I don’t understand the final sentence.

      How did Chili know that? And Keerthi would have to know it too for him to convince her.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        He knew that the road dill hated juice because it rejected Hogan for having juice dripping from his face. It all totally tracks.
        ```

      - u/SciresM:

        Keerthi wouldn't have had to know it, only Chetan.

  Wow I think I came [pretty close to calling it](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/go9y95/rtffwip_chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_chapter/frenbjq/?context=3). 

  Is this what it feels like to feel the feeling?
  ```

- u/royishere:
  ```
  God

  Fucking

  DAMMIT

  I cry-laughed.
  ```

  - u/royishere:
    ```
    Ok but I'm still peeved it was a pickle and not lentils.

- u/Flashbunny:
  ```
  You are the *worst.* I did giggle.

- u/jordroy:
  ```
  All that for a punny punchline. You have got to be kidding me.

- u/josephwdye:
  ```
  Fuck you sir! I did chuckle for a good minute.  Thank so much for the story.

  Is there anything we do help/support/show our appreciation?
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  This is both [exactly what I expected](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/go9y95/rtffwip_chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_chapter/frgytfz/) and the exact opposite of what I expected.

  This is officially the longest, most convoluted feghoot I've ever seen.
  ```

- u/Meriipu:
  ```
  Did you give up on the initial direction the story was going if it had one?

  These last few chapters feel a bit rushed.
  ```

  - u/SciresM:
    ```
    I disagree. These chapters feel to me like they've got the same energy and planning as usual. 

    Chapter 20 in particular has so many dahl references it's hard to believe it wasn't done very carefully. Just look at /u/gryfft's post in the last thread about all the references in Teavee's items.

    The pace of releases (which is happening after a month in which there were suspiciously no posts) reads to me like gazemaize took a month to write the entire climax sequence, and has been posting the stuff he wrote in that month in quick succession.

    So much of the content here has been set up tens of thousands of words in advance, lol.

    >"Wait," said Keerthi. "I want to ask again. Mr. Bucket, why did you invite us all to this factory?"
    >
    >"My reason is simple," said Mr. Bucket. "It is all for a gag."

    Way back in chapter 14, for example.

    And the pickle was first set up in chapter 5, even enough we couldn't link the two until recently.
    ```

    - u/royishere:
      ```
      I think the ending has been planned from the beginning, but there are a number of plot threads (Chetan misleading Keerthi about "vermicious", Fantasticer Fox's identity [assuming that the dead fox in Teavee's house was the real Fantastic Mr. Fox], Peachland, the person who made Mahuika want to vape, etc.) that seem as if they were dropped. Also the whole witch subplot did technically get resolved but it was rapid and glossed over for the most part.

      Then again, we still have the epilogue, so we'll see what happens to the rest of our lingering questions.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        I mean random lingering questions are an absolute Dahl-ism. Most things aren't explained, and half the things that are explained are nonsense.
        ```

      - u/I_am_your_BRAIN:
        ```
        Charlie or Teavee were the ones who wanted Mahuika to vape?
        ```

        - u/gryfft:
          ```
          It was canonically not Teavee, Bucket, or the pickle who made Mahuika vape. From chapter 20:

          >"You lived your life. When you were five, an unknown entity intervened in the GAG and managed to add a fact. It wasn't the pickle. It suddenly became a true fact that Mahuika vaped. This made you a character."

          >... 

          >"I had my suspicions," he said. "It was you who made her vape."

          >Charlie laughed. "Mike, you don't know anything. I didn't do anything to Mahuika."

          My musings...

          If the street pickle is the avatar for the original creator of this universe... someone salty, bitter, aged, and ~~racist~~ prejudiced against liquids resulting from squeezing fruits.... then perhaps... perhaps...

          Perhaps vape juice... something conventionally sweet or fresh, newfangled, kind of subversive but also generally regarded to be something enjoyed by weirdos...

          Maybe... gazemaize was the juice all along.
          ```

  - u/thomas_m_k:
    ```
    Actually, to me it feels like these two last chapters (and the first chapter) had been the only ones planned and it was the middle part that wasn't very well planned and had developed a life of its own, which ended up making them *more* interesting than the originally planned ending.
