    >This explains a lot about the in-game nature of trainers getting harder and explains why Blue thinks it's possible to get a Badge so soon: They scale in difficulty.

    Yeah, it's something I think bothered a lot of people about the games, but was fairly easy to rationalize.

    >I liked this chapter. I'm glad that Blue lost; I feel that if he had won it would have sent a message more of the challenge being trivial more than of Blue's skill being exceptional. Mainly because he wasn't at all exceptional with how he prepared for that fight.

    Yep. I felt a bit reluctant to include that Blue already fought Brock in the chapter with Red, since it kind of killed the suspense with the previous chapter where he's fighting through the underlings, but I hope some people picked up on the "fought" rather than "beat" in what he told Red and realized that he's not assured victory: as someone commented on FF, I'm not a huge fan of stories where protagonists win on pure willpower, and even being an above average novice, Blue was being far too reckless.

      It's great - most of the best Pokemon stories go with what you might call the ubermensch theme:  if you are determined enough and morally deserve it, you can gain powers beyond any other.  It's common in japanese stories; there are some legendary characters who stand out because they're *just better* (eg Itachi from Naruto, Red, etc.).

      I think your story is deeper for leaving that behind, and I like it.

  Excellent stuff. I loved the characterization of the battlefield, really helped paint a specific picture versus the generic "room with dirt" setup. 
  I also observed that this chapter stand very well on its own; an outside reader wouldn't need to know anything else about this fanfic in particular to follow and enjoy the events. I shared this particular chapter with some friends, trying to get them hooked; I felt it could do the job really well without making them feel lost. The only bump in that road would be Aeosus, but a quick explanation of what it was fixed that easily. 

  Keep it up!

    Thanks, glad you enjoyed it! I find the idea of good stand alone chapters interesting as well: I tried to write the Interlude with Brock and Janine as types of "short story" chapters that would be easy to read for those that haven't been following it yet. Curious to know what your friends end up thinking of this one!

  just one told here.


  Was a good chapter. I liked seeing Blue react to Brock's tactics, how the leader taught as he battled, the references to pokemon biology and how moves are used you sprinkled into the story as it progressed. Think you even references the different game generations at the end with how Brock once taught Bide but now hands out Rock Tomb TM.

  Any reason you've gone for lowercase for species names and game titles, such as gym leader?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:

    Fixed, thanks!

    In my view, species names are non-capitalized when not referring to a specific pokemon the same way animals in our world are non-capitalized. There's no reason to consider pokemon names proper nouns other than the convention set in the games.

    As for titles like gym leader, they're capitalized when they come before or after the name, again like in our world, but not otherwise. Or that's the theory anyway: I might have been inconsistent somewhere, and if so that's a typo :)

    Glad someone caught the TM change reference too!

      I wonder if gym leaders hand out the same TM to any level of challenger. Is Rock Tomb really as useful to some-one who just earned their 7th badge, or would they get something more rare/valuable/powerful. This assumes that their isn't some kind of "copyright" held by Brock for Rock Tomb, but I can't imagine that as something a near-to-post scarcity world could really enforce.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Not a copyright as such, but there are some techniques that are considered too risky for trainers that haven't proven their ability to handle. Bide is one of them, while Rock Tomb is relatively safe to hand out to anyone.  The more experienced challengers are more likely to qualify for learning Bide instead/in addition.
        ```

  ```
  I’m curious. You wrote something like "He was sure of victory in the future, ans he already saw a path to it." and later outright "path to victory."
  Is that a shout-out to the webserial Worm? I mean, it doesn’t necessarily have to be, but at the same time it isn’t ludicrously improbable, either.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Given that Lung was mentioned earlier, I think the phrasing was a Worm reference.
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    It is and it isn't: I have read and loved Worm, and half the time I see the phrase "path to victory" I think of it now, but it's been used in other contexts before as well, both as a superpower and just as a phrase :)
    ```

    - u/Aretii:
      ```
      Pretty sure it shows up in Ender's Game. The concept certainly does, even if the exact phrase does not. 

      The Miles Vorkosigan books have it too, come to think, particularly The Vor Game.
      ```
