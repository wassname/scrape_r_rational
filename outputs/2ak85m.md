## [D][Q] What would you do with (near) absolute power?

### Post:

So I'm currently working on a piece of rational fiction were at the beginning of the story 5 billion people are given the power to transmute energy and matter of any form into any other form. There are two downsides to this though.

1. Should you over commit and use more energy than is currently in your possession the spell will start to draw on your internal energy and mass.
2. You can only move 2.1*10^15 joules of energy per second and 25% of your starting energy is irreversibly removed from the local system. 
3. You can only control/move energy and mass in a 500 meter sphere around yourself.
 
This is the kind of thing that I feel is right up r/rational's alley so what would you do with the power? 

Become a one man solar panel for the planet alleviating a large amount of our energy consumption needs? End world hunger by directly transmuting fat muscle and all other necessary material for life into people and circumventing bodily needs? Become a dictator by destroying everyone who opposes you by unleashing a death ray with near unstoppable force (who am I kidding this is /r/rational you'd find an easier and more energy efficient way to rule the world)?

edit: slight clarification of the rules.

edit2: size limit

edit 3: Just a thank you to everyone who posted here. I've got a ton of new reading to do, new equations to run, and you've helped plug up a few of the holes that I was trying to fill. My hat goes off to the lot of you.

    I didn't say it was locally released as entropy. Without delving to far into the lore it might just be easier to say its removed from the local system rather than released as entropy.

      There are *five billion* people with this power. It only takes *one* crazy person to decide it's a good idea to create an antimatter asteroid on a collision course with Earth. (You create it in space so that you have plenty of time to build up its mass before it blows up.)

  I'm going to need a whole bunch of clarification on the rules here.

  1. What does it mean to say that energy or mass is "in your possession"?
  2. Can I convert matter to antimatter?
  3. Can I in any other way exceed the joule limit by producing two kinds of matter that react to create more usable energy?
  4. How much control do I have over the end result of the mass I create? Could I convincingly create organic matter (like wood, for example)?
  5. I kind of suck at physics - what does the energy limit imply about my ability to transmute matter?
  6. Is it possible to erect defenses that have a consistent drain on my power limits?
  7. How much thought and focus does it take to use my power?

  From a story standpoint, I have to wonder why so many - the majority of the population gets this power, which means it's going to be really hard to actually be a dictator, since there are equally powered people that can stop you.

  - u/Threedoge:
    ```
    Oh boy alright lets get started.

    1. The power recognizes you (your body and everything inside of it like food, body heat, nerve electricity, bacteria, and air) as well as anything made of matter by the power, unless you declare that it is outside your possession.
    2. Yes you can, though I'm rather curious as to why you would.
    3. No you can not.
    4. You could create organic matter, but you would have to understand its cellular construction down to the atom.
    5. It implies that you can work with one ounce of matter at a time. It also implies that I'm a moron and that the wording needs to be tightened up on the second rule.
    6. Yes and its one of the basic spells that is built into the power.
    7. Basic speech should be enough to concentrate you mental focus.

    And from a story stand point your right, it would be bloody difficult to rule over that many people. But if you did control that many people with that kind of power they might make a pretty good army against a foe that can devourer raw energy and matter to make exact replicas of themselves. Or it might end in everyone dying.

      In the first second, launch myself into space (keeping myself alive with my power as per 6.) to escape the future cone of EY's foom. Can I examine matter in my sphere of influence at the atomic level in order to copy it? If yes, copy myself. Does my copy have my power? If yes, we're identical. One of me discards arms and legs. Still powered? Remove body parts until some low-hanging minimum is reached, then replicate exponentially for a few minutes. Research less low-hanging minima, then replicate some more. Send a few trillion of me back to Earth to see if everyone has kept everyone else from fooming; if yes, immobilize everyone (assign two of me to instantly reversing all power use from each non-me) and sit down for a few years to work out that FAI thing. If no, this becomes an *interesting* battle of titans that I, author of less than a decillion minds, cannot quite predict. (Although it's improbable that the logarithms of our power differ by less than 10.)

        I like this, its exactly the kind of thing that I would expect from you guys once you got over the fact that you could accidentally blow up the planet. However I think your over estimating how fast you can think in a clear logical patter.

        You have to supply each spell with the exact information on what you want done. You can create "functions", if you will, that are large spells tied to a short word combination, but you would still need to set up a function that is tied to each kind of cell in your body. 

        If you wanted to brute force the spell and list out the exact molecular placement of each individual molecule of your body, that would take a much longer period of time than if you created a set of functions to create a "generic" of each one of your cells.

        Also while you could scan your entire body rather quickly (the spell would probably be as easy as "locate and identify the exact atomic and energy composition of my being with relevant data points being particle locations, amount of energy in joules and relative direction each particle is traveling in.") you would have to store that information somewhere, and I would recommend against uploading it to your brain directly, as I could see that frying your brain in short order.

        There are a few other minor things like setting up livable conditions in space, the fact that you can't directly interact with anyone else who has this power since they are in their own possession, nor could you directly interact with their constructs. Most of these are just time limitations and should be easily circumvented with enough thought through.

          I could store it in more matter directly next to me, as the scans purpose was copying anyway. I assumed that the defenses as per 6 included things like keeping oxygen levels above a critical treshold and counteracting violent pressure.

          As for acquiring possession of other people, please. I merely have to arrange for their matter to pass through the inside of one of my bodies.

          By the way, can I implement [Maxwell's Demon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon) to slowly generate arbitrary amounts of energy? If yes, scratch the sending back a trillion: I should be able to build some apparatus whose power output grows with the square of the energy I have available (for example, invest half in a superheated plasma contained by magnets, and the other half into me-bodies playing Maxwellian gatekeepers) in order to acquire infinite energy. You heard right, not arbitrary energy. [This differential equation is scary.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=f%27%3Df^2)

          Talk about a literal singularity.

            Ah the protection spell could be specified to set up to prevent depressurization and the the traumas that rapidly leaving the earth's atmosphere would induce, but it won't just conjure up air. You'd need to consistently create some and keep it nearby.

            And no, Maxwell's demon only shifts energy from place to place creating a pocket of high energy and low energy, it doesn't spontaneously create energy. 

            Lets say that we did have Maxwell's two chambers and demon set up. You then proceed to pull out all the heat energy from the high entropy side but then the system as a whole has lost that energy. The demon could constantly switch out the molecules for ones that now, comparatively, have a higher amount of energy but at the end of the day you would eventually run out of raw energy in the entire system.

            Now lets say your in the system and use the entropy that you have created and sort out high and low energy. Your still losing a quarter of the energy irreversibly, it is fundamentally being removed from the system.

                ```
                The idea behind the basic built in protection spell is that there is a framework set up so you just have to list what kind of traumas you wish to avoid and how much energy your willing to invest in avoiding them.

                Setting up an CO2 to O2 spell would also be trivial, but you should probably augment it with some energy from local radiation, since we are in space, theres going to be a lot of that.

  So I get 23 grams of matter per second, or half a megaton of TNT worth of bang. 30 Hiroshimas per second. With antimatter, I can double that to 60 Hiroshimas per second. Per person. For *5 billion people*. Oh that's not going to end well.

  I don't understand the rules. Say I transmute 23 grams of nitrogen in the air into 23 grams of botulinum toxin. What exactly happens? Do I end up with 23 grams? Or 17 grams, after 25% vanishes? Since I'm "using" energy beyond what is "in my possession", do I lose 23 grams of fat? Or 31 grams of fat, 23 vanishing to fuel the transmutation and 25% of that 31 vanishing just because? Or do I lose just 6 grams of fat, 25% of the amount I'm transmuting? Do I get to choose between losing 6 grams of fat or 6 grams of nitrogen? Or do I lose an arm and a leg, 25% of my *total* starting mass-energy? Does the resulting botulinum toxin count as "mine", able to be transmuted without further losses beyond the 75% efficiency limit?

  What's my range? Can I transmute nitrogen on the other side of the planet? North Korea's nitrogen, say? Or Washington DC's? Or your lungs'?

  If I dump 4.5\*10^12 joules of kinetic energy into a 1 kg rock, how fast is it going? If it started with 0 and I pushed it to 4.5\*10^(12), then it goes from rest to 0.01c. But from the reference frame where it started at 0.5c, it started with 1.4\*10^16 joules. My push is several significant digits down, and now it's going 0.50007c. That reference frame would say that its initial rest frame now sees it going 0.00009c, not 0.01c. Different reference frames disagree on changes in kinetic energy for the same difference in speed. Do I just always affect things in my own reference frame, or in theirs, and let relativistic observers see me violating the joule limit?

    I love that everyone assumes that people would imminently start trying to kill one another with this power. They sure as hell aren't wrong, and I can most defiantly see some well meaning idiot scientist wanting to see just what would happen if they transmute the limit into local heat radiation.

    Now then as for the questions:

    1. If you were to specify that you wanted to use only 23 grams of nitrogen to create 23 grams of botulinum toxic (an interesting choice in toxic as well) it would use some of your heat energy ( exact number is a bit difficult to calculate, the power tries not to kill you and will only take as much as you can spare) and body fat to create the rest of the 23 grams, so a little less than 6 grams of fat will be lost. And yes now that botulium toxin counts as yours and, unless you give up your possession of it, it can't be affected by another person with this power.

    2. Your range is inside a ~~500 yard~~ 500 meters sphere with you in the center. And yes the air in an average person's lungs is fair game, but not one who as the power.

    3. The power is personal so it would be affect from your personal frame of reference. It would assume that you wanted to add 0.01c of speed from your frame of reference and it would continue to pull energy until, from your initial rest frame, you see it going .01c. If you weren't holding it still, however, the object would leave your sphere of influence before it was able to build up to to .01c. (Sorry I don't have a strong enough understanding in absolute relativistic frame works to be more accurate. You have given me quite the reading list though so I thank you for that.)

    Edit: because the imperial system is what will get someone killed.

      > that people would imminently start trying to kill one another with this power.

      This isn't it.

      What people are saying is that this is the equivalent to giving 100 monkeys matches and letting them swim in a lake made of gasoline. It only takes one idiot to figure out some combination of actions that kills everyone else, especially when experimenting with an unknown power and not thinking about having proper safeguards.

      Which most of those 5 billion people would not.

      It takes less than one line to say "Find an atom and convert it to carbon, go to start." and that's the end of the planet.

      You have made everyone a paperclipper.

  I'd find the nearest source of iron, gather about a ton around me, and use its rest mass to propulse myself to the moon (or Venus) as fast as I could.

  As people mentioned, there are billions of people on this planet, if they are all holding megaton nukes I want out of here fast. A ton of iron can be converted into whatever I need while keeping enough momentum to reach the moon easily (I assume the power can be used to keep something like a bubble of air around me, otherwise it's always possible to use the iron mass as a shell).

  Once I'm convinced enough time has passed that unstable people have blown themselves up and the rest can be more or less trusted, I can come back.

  Another cool thing to do would be to have a billion people go to Venus, and propulse it to the Goldilocks zone.

  2.1\*10^15 joules per second * 5\*10^9 people * 2\*10^7 seconds (approx 7 months) = 2.1*10^32 Joules, or the gravitational binding energy of the earth.

  On second thought, organizing the complete destruction of the Earth, so thorough that not even gravity would reassemble, it is a bad idea, and probably overkill anyways.  Dropping it into the Sun seems easier.

  How fine a control do I have over my powers? Can I create working copies of myself? Or complex mechanisms such as a computer? Or even fictional things such as a time machine? Do I need to know how something works to do that, or just know of the thing? And, if I can clone myself, will those clones also have powers? Because if so, I would create a clone army and see what me and clones collectively could come up with to do next, as copying myself so many times is bound to increase the number of good ideas I can come up with
