  "The monsters can have a society, play, use tools, wear clothes, understand the significance of a crown, and build structures...but they totally aren't intelligent and self-aware, so they aren't people, so it's okay to kill them and take their stuff." --Ameliah

    Depends on how much of that is following akashic instinct and how pathologically hostile they are to everything else in existence. Crowns aren't signifigant for apes who live in a cave, so they had to get the idea from somewhere, and being drip fed it by the system seems much much more likely than completely reinventing the concept from the stone age. Wasn't there a royal slime with a crown?

      Sure, maybe they are p-zombies being puppeted around by the nature of magic.  Simplest answer is that they are intelligent albeit primitive beings.

        They are likely animal-level intelligent, but clothes, tools, crowns, etc. are more likely to be system shenanigans, as poster above said.

    Are we reading different stories?  The linked chapter only says diplomacy is not an option. It says nothing about their intelligence or lack thereof.

    Considering these things tore the feet off a chicken-like mob and made a party out of just watching it suffer she's significantly more likely to be right than wrong in that assessment.

      > Are we reading different stories? The linked chapter only says diplomacy is not an option. It says nothing about their intelligence or lack thereof.

      I don't want to quote the full context because it's long, but it's the six paragraphs that start with "Tallheart blinked. “A normal monster might recognize a weapon and choose to keep it, but not a mere stone. It would perhaps use it as a tool, but then it would discard it."  The clearest part is here:

      > **The chapter said:**
      >
      > The implications were unsettling. The existence of a hyper-violent pack of roid-apes was horrifying enough without them having learned to make tools. It raised terrifying questions about just how intelligent a monster could be. A few months ago, Rain might have had qualms about killing such creatures, but no more. He didn’t trust the opinion of just anyone, but he trusted Ameliah. If she said diplomacy wasn’t an option, then it wasn’t, end of story. The smarter a monster was, the more urgently it needed killing.

      > Monsters were monsters. They might act like they were alive—eating, sleeping, even playing and forming complex social structures—but they weren’t. 

      It's true that what I wrote is a meme and not a literal quote, but I think it's a fair representation. Rain, Tallheart, and Ameliah are in the deeps, far from any human settlement that might be endangered by the Hababas, so they don't have the "proactive self-defense" excuse.  Our heroes are here solely to kill things in order to level up and they are keeping the deepstone club heads from the Hababas that they killed yesterday.  Therefore "it's okay to kill them and take their stuff."  

      As to the 'all it said is that diplomacy is impossible'  element, if that's the only part one leans on then that just makes it worse.  Try substituting it with a different group:  The ~~monsters~~ African tribesmen can have a society, play, use tools, wear clothes, understand the significance of a crown, and build structures...but ~~they totally aren't intelligent and self-aware~~  diplomacy is impossible, so they aren't people, so it's okay to ~~kill~~ enslave them and take their stuff."  See how it becomes much more obvious that this is not okay?

  I think I'm at the point where I just have to drop this. There's been far too much naval gazing for so long, too much dragging the story by bogging down the chapters, and we finally get another blue and it's underwhelming because we've already been told that nothing will happen without certain levels being reached, so we know we're about to have to sit through more of the same stuff again, and I just can't get excited for the weekly chapter of this anymore. I think I'm just going to sit on this until next year before I bother picking this back up. It's got so much potential waiting in the background, I just don't want to sit through the most boring training arc ever, especially since it's taking place in the title-naming location and it's somehow still boring

    Yea delve is too slow for its own good, how it's written with details are nice for getting to know characters, but by now i hope people already know them so we don't need his every stray thought written out, we need progress and drive.

      A lot of people say that, yet somehow the author still has 2200 patrons (meaning probably about $7,000/month) and an incredibly active comments section and discord server. 

      Shoot, I even agree with the statement, yet I just finished reading the chapter and now I'm in the comments. I was a patron for a while before finally giving it up because I just didn't care that much about the story and got tired of being teased. I left it for a long time then went back when it popped up here on r/r.

      What is it about this story? Large, LARGE sections of it are incredibly boring, the pacing is glacial, there's no particular conflict, the protagonist isn't particularly proactive and hasn't had much of any character evolution, the worldbuilding hasn't evolved much in fifty chapters...yet somehow we're still reading. Seriously, what's going on?
      ```

      - u/Banarok:
        ```
        I'm reading because it's free and sunk cost fallacy kind of, it's also not awful, it's just too slow to be especially interesting, meaning i'd never recommend this to anyone and i'd probably give it 3 stars right now.

        basically it's not bad, but it have fallen to mediocre due to shooting its pacing with a shotgun and forgetting it was a thing that ever existed.

        i like how the system is build up and how the world works, but its too slow for me too feel the author will ever do anything with it, honestly if i dropped this and found it again in 2 years i'd be like "sweet something nice to read", and then be disapointed by the fact 100 chapters just amount to them doing a half delve in this dungeon.

        many novels do have the opposite problem where they are too fast and keep escalating until the world no longer make sense, that is also bad, the middle road is usually the best one.

        ```
        I think the worldbuilding (like the DKE, Empire, Lightbreaker etc) and system was great for a RR LitRPG. Thing is that the pacing is so horrible that what makes the story exceptional isn't actually in the story, at least, I feel, not for another year or so.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          That's an excellent point.  The system is very engaging and the political setup had a lot of promise...it's simply not being used.  That's what drew me (and probably everyone else) in at first.
          ```

          - u/PriestofNight:
            ```
            Also the protagonist pick what at first seems like a support build. Sadly it devolved into a generalist one,  dispite the MC rant about spicialising in ONE role...
            ```

            - u/MilesSand:

              Tbf he's never once succeeded at any role besides support, except against trash mobs at half his level.

              You mean how he's aiming to get a bunch of damage auras so that he can be combat effective?  Valid point, although I'd say he's still a strong support (Force Ward, Essence Well, and Winter), it's just that now he also wants to be secondary DPS.

              My question is, after he reaches level 26 and gets his 10x damage boost, will he be able to keep up with dedicated DPS builds of the same level or will he still be in the same "not good enough" role but at a higher level?
              ```

                > You mean how he's aiming to get a bunch of damage auras so that he can be combat effective?

                He's not really doing that to be combat effective, right now the reason he's going to be picking 3 more damage auras is simply that he already picked two, and by the rules by which he expects rare classes to work, he absolutely has to pick 3 more or he shoots himself in the foot.

        Slice of life depends on developing a parasocial relationship with a tribe. This is actually an essential part of all fiction - most shows on TV work better when the reader can pretend they're part of the group. As humans, [the tribe is the thing our brains care most about when basic needs are met.](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html)

        If you're still reading this far and aren't more invested in Rain's, Deerman's, and Steve-o's zinc experiments than leveling up by whacking goblins with a sword, ehhhh you'd be in some kind of hell, really.

      What’s especially annoying is that a lot of time is spent on these characters that just aren’t interesting or well-written and are annoying. I don’t remember half of the people in the group and they all feel like background characters, yet there’s multiple chapters dedicated to these characters that I doubt many, if any, care about. Honestly, there’s a lot of other really puzzling pacing issues. I guess we’re just all deluding ourselves hoping Delve will eventually return to what it was like in its initial chapters, me included.
      ```

- u/TheTruthVeritas:
  ```
  How much does Rain’s combat ability increase with a new level cap of 24? I know 25 is where things start to skyrocket, but 24 with some additional metamagic skills and other abilities should still be quite the improvement.

  The info about monsters, abberants, and unique names was really interesting. I wonder why such special monsters would eventually be named by what is essentially a facet of reality itself, and what’s really the truth of the system. And I don’t think it’s a planet-sized energy harvester this time.

    I mocked things up on an old sheet.

    It's a decent 50-100% all-around bump but nothing major. Suppression is a good addition. Max DPS without Extend goes from 3.5k to 5.7k at 18m radius.

    In contrast, level 26 has a max DPS without Extend of 586k using the combination of 5 elemental attacks at once, at 62.5m radius, with Wards and Suppression active. This does exhaust his mana in a single second but it refreshes multiple times a minute.

  - u/danielparks:
    ```
    If we wants to unlock the higher skill caps in the maximum of five trees, he has to take skills in offensive and defensive wards next. (See “Legendary Monolithic” in the [class table](https://bestspellever.fandom.com/wiki/Class#Monolithic_Classes)) So, we won’t see new metamagic skills until he passes level 25.

    Prismatic Intent and Ethereal Aura ([skills list](https://bestspellever.fandom.com/wiki/Skill_Compendium)) are going to make him much more effective on a team.

    Also, it looks like he won’t be able to unlock the fourth tier of the skill trees until he’s past level 25. If XP progression continues as is (unlikely) he would be able to at level 29.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      My understanding is that he can't take Prismatic Intent until level 26 actually. I don't recall if it's a requirements limit or a build design thing, but I've seen it floating around several times.
      ```

      - u/danielparks:
        ```
        Ha ha! Right, that’s what I was trying to say. I just… didn’t do it very well.

        At level 25 he has to take an offensive or defensive aura so that he has at least 5 skills in each of 5 trees. He already has 6 in the Aura Metamagic tree, so he has no wiggle room.

      Point out the fact that if rain keeps to his plan, he gets nothing amazing before level 25. >!Convenient that the blue is 24 so nothing actually changes.!<
      ```

      - u/Dragfie:
        ```
        IDK its a big jump ahead, and will get him be actually useful when hunting further down, wouldn't be realistic for the team to find anything bigger right off the bat anyway. 

        Just gotta wait a couple more weeks. 

        At this point tho I kinda feel unless he jumps to lvl 50 on the next chapter ppl will not be satisfied no matter what happens XD
        ```

        - u/HantuAnggara:
          ```
          I think I would actually be satisfied if the blue was exactly level 25.
          ```

      - u/danielparks:
        ```
        I was trying to figure out if he gets much more useful in combat before 26, when he can take Ethereal Aura. If so, then it may be to his advantage to get a blue under 25 in that it allows him to upgrade so he can deal with a blue over 25.

        The only real advantage he gets before 26 is getting to choose new offensive auras.

        Maybe being a walking blender (Shear) will be amazing? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

          He could have taken Darkness, that darkens the environment but can't cause mage burn
          ```

          - u/danielparks:
            ```
            Yeah, that’s a good point.

            I went back and looked at the [fight with Hegar](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/chapter/627111/133-breaking) and I think he might have been able to kill Hegar if he had Shroud/Radiance/Ethereal Aura. He does 10k DPS for 2,700 MP and it brings Hegar [down below 6k HP](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/chapter/631237/134-unbreakable). I suspect if he weren’t worried about mage burning himself he could have opened with 2 seconds of 10k DPS, which looks like it would have killed Hegar outright.

            Anyway… I also forgot about the synergy skills. Aura Synergy will go from an 80% boost to a 140% boost at level 24 (with maxed aura skills), which ain’t nothing.
            ```

            - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
              ```
              I wonder what level Hegar was, Rains build in theory should be quite bad at 1v1 since auras are specialised at AoE. I always assumed Rain's primary advantage over Hegar is equipment and just outlevelling him.
              ```

- u/WantToVent:
  ```
  I did try to follow Delve, but surprisingly there is a lot of dislike for the story to be posted here... Shouldn't those that do not like, just downvote and let the process sort this out?
  ```

  - u/GhostWriter52025:
    ```
    I think a major problem a lot of us have is that it's good for a lot of it, then it just starts dragging for no real reason. There's so much potential for a great story, but it just feels like the author is bogging the narrative down. I think people complain because they want to see improvement, a return to form from earlier parts of the story where there felt like actual progression after a dozen chapters, rather than the same internal monologue on repeat for weeks on end. I feel a downvote isn't needed if it still fits into the category of the subreddit, which it does, and would only serve to discourage the author or make them double down instead of seeing that many people have valid criticisms that we hope get addressed
