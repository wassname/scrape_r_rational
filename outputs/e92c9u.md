    Don't worry.  Evidence suggests that our universe has been inoculated.

    >"We could immediately terminate and suppress all memetics and antimemetics research worldwide," Hughes says. "We would have to systematically dismantle the whole scientific field forever. Stop all the experiments, scrap all the research, brainwash all the researchers. If nobody actively researches this field, nobody will ever find SCP-3125. It stays buried in the farthest reaches of ideatic space indefinitely, like radioactive waste." He looks up at the ceiling. The problem is interesting. "Ironically, the most practical way to do that would be to develop an artificial meme. One which encodes the idea that memetics research is intrinsically worthless and harmful. Enrich it with religious or pseudoscientific virals and release it to the general public. A year after it got out we'd be tearing our own labs down."

        Only if we genuinely start memetics research on that level. I’ve seen fictional descriptions of memetic weaponry and deadly memeplexes, but recognizing them IRL always includes thinking of “memetics” as a fictional field.

        Besides, taking a step back from the Fortean thrills of the Watsonian view and nestling within the comfort of the safe and skeptical Doylist view, *the SCP and all it describes is fictional.*

          >I’ve seen fictional descriptions of memetic weaponry and deadly memeplexes, but recognizing them IRL always includes thinking of “memetics” as a fictional field.

          I think of it as a real field, albeit one not often studied under the name "memetics". But engineering ideas specifically to spread, get inside people's heads and affect them a certain way isn't anything new or fictional; it's what advertisers are paid to do. As memetics slowly becomes more widely accepted to exist, I expect we'll slowly edge closer to genuinely dangerous memetic hazards, though I doubt we'll see anything on the level of the stuff on SCP wiki.

          Antimemes are probably also technically real, but only very weak ones. Antimemes by their very definition inhibit their own spread, and so they work towards their own destruction. Thus, any significantly effective antimeme would be too short lived to notice even if we COULD work around its antimemetic effect in order to realize it's worth paying attention to. But technically, all you have to do to make a weak antimeme is just be boring. If I post hundreds upon hundreds of random characters here, that text is probably less likely to spread than other "ideas" because there's no meaning to it and no reason for anyone to talk about it or bother remembering it. We are more likely to remember things that interest us, and less likely to remember things that don't.

          This is why none of the antimemetic SCPs are pure antimemes, they're real objects (or mostly-non-antimemetic memeplexes, etc.) that have antimemetic properties. Because if they exist outside of just being ideas, they don't have this same restriction; destroying all knowledge of an idea kills the idea, but destroying all knowledge of an object leaves the object extant.

            This is only true if the antimeme needs to be remembered in order to exist. In the real world we have problems that get neglected for no reason other than being boring such as malaria or some of the more obscure political processes and lots of of people end up dead.

  The idea that there were originally three Abrahamic gods, and that the Foundation has slain two of them unbeknownst to us, takes on a rather different meaning in an Anitimemetics story...

  The revelation of >!the germ retaining Hughes's mind even after his bodily death!< is ingenious, I have to say. Well-foreshadowed, but I didn't expect it at all until it happened.
  ```

  - u/serge_cell:

    >The idea that there were originally three Abrahamic gods, and that the Foundation has slain two of them unbeknownst to us,

    There is a scholar opinion that there was [female consort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah#In_Israel_and_Judah) to Abrahamic god, which was purged out of scriptures later. There is also evidence that there was possibly *three* Abrahamic gods.

      YHVH, Elohim, and Asherah are the suggested identities, usually? I have a different proposal, but it’s part of a memeplex I don’t want to debut here.

  This chapter makes part of [We Need To Talk About Fifty-Five](http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five) funny in retrospect.

  > There is a very long pause while both O5-8 and his assistant react to this. In fact, they pass through a long, discrete sequence of reactions.

  >

  Marion forgets what happens after the fact, so she just assumes that Bart died in some unspeakably horrible way instead of >!being shot by an ordinary gun!<.

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    "It would happen to you as well," sounds like she thinks SCP-3125 got him.

  Great chapter. I love all the buildup we've had until now that led to how important this one is, and the ending maintains that tension wonderfully.

  My only criticism is that >!I wish SCP-3125 solely manifested through compromised human agents. The "arachnoform" attacks are a great bit of horror, but they cheapen the threat for me.!<
  ```

  - u/DuplexFields:
    ```
    But >!I figured the arachnoform things were just a tool of compromised humans.!<
    ```

    - u/redrach:
      ```
      That's entirely possible, but >!those attacks seem so far out of the norm that one wonders how they gained that ability. My mind just naturally instead thinks "Oh this is just some power this vast, incomprehensible entity has".!<

    That would fit with 

    >"You look terrible," he says. "There's something inl fleth your neck. Do you see that?" He points at her throat, then taps the same spot on his own.

    >"What?"

    >"On your neck. I nefth hlai you've been infected by whatever was in there. We need to act quickly." He reaches for his keyring and unthreads a Swiss Army knife, and unfolds a short, gleaming blade. He does this in such a methodical, ordinary way that Wheeler almost forgets to react when he leans down towards her to cut her throat.

    ```
    3125 always destroys those who know about it, and destroys those who know the most about it first. It is, in fact, its own antimeme.

- u/None:
  ```
  This chapter of this story really helped me today. I read it during lunch and was inspired to write an email to myself: "Something that you can't do, but something that you must do, a mission whose failure would destroy you."

  Later, and not for the first time, I read something devastating in a book I had turned to for help. It felt very much as if I had opened the door to my sealed bunker, and exposed myself to the monstrous oppression breeding outside. It shouldn't bother me so much, but it does.

  I hope this story ends well. I hope that I can live out here with the monster. What good can I do if I'm trapped in a bunker?
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  I like that every time the story manages to almost make you feel like the good guys have a shot at winning... and then it completely dashes those hopes, and laughs at you for believing anything else could happen.
  ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    I dislike it. At this point, every chapter ends the same place it started. No progress, no real exposition, even. Just extraneous details which are unlikely to go anywhere, piling up the grim.

    Antimemetics has been grimdark more or less from the start, but the last few updates have pushed it solidly to "grimderp"; grimdarkness which doesn't actually accomplish anything in either a Watsonian frame or a Doylist one.
    ```

    - u/darkflagrance:
      ```
      This chapter does seem to be a set up for how Bart Hughes can be alive despite everyone thinking him dead - and while he lives, there is some hope.
      ```

- u/VorpalAuroch:
  ```
  I'm honestly getting sick of Antimemetics. We keep getting flashbacks which do nothing but repeat a "maybe there's a chance - haha no fuck you" over and over. It's dull. I don't even see any point to it from a Doylist perspective.
  ```

  - u/reaper7876:
    ```
    I can't say I agree. Yes, 3125 keeps doing things that screw them over, but I consider this chapter optimistic--the attempt to neutralize Hughes failed, ultimately, and he's the key to getting the irreality amplifier up and running. Progress is being made.
    ```

    - u/Papa-Walrus:
      ```
      Agreed. Many of the Antimemetics stories follow the "maybe there's a chance - haha no fuck you" without much deviation, but a few (including this one and Ara Orun/Unthreaded, following Adam Wheeler) and with a hope spot. Bart Hughes and Adam Wheeler both survive their encounters with SCP-3125, and they're each uniquely qualified to play a role in killing the thing.

  I have three sets of thoughts on this, and one is so long that I'm going to make it its own post (can I do that here? Is there a better place?). The other two are: 

    · My reaction and few nitpicks about this specific story

  Really enjoyed it! I love the spooky but very on-theme backdrop of the SCP remains as the containment chamber. It follows the broad structure that makes SCP entries so satisfying: the lead up of paranoid containment procedures to produce suspense, the reveal of the situation (in this case where this story falls on the antimemetics timeline, and a chilling example of how fragile the counteroperations are), and additional flavor and twists. Very solidly executed. 

  The main thing which bugged me was >!the timing of Li's assassination attempt. If he had access to a "thick report" authored by Hughes himself saying that he's the only one who can do this, he wouldn't need to confirm it with him in person. He could have done it more easily and without blowing cover any number of other times and ways (as Hughes's direct superior).!< Having it happen "onscreen" was very cinematic, but I think a few details could be mentioned/changed to make it more logically consistent. 

  · My thoughts about the merit of the antimemetics stories in general and responses to a number of the comments here

  I saw some criticisms about how grimdark it is and the lack of progress (go easy on the "diegetic", juniper), but personally that doesn't bother me, at least so far. A story can have merit and be interesting without promising or offering hope of a resolution. There are plenty of tragedies structured around the audience knowing it won't end well and just seeing the process, or watching the characters struggle and fail due to circumstance or their own flaws. There can also be smaller victories which make interesting stories within greater losses - I think this is particularly common with stories like this one where it's essentially a prequel. We already know that Anakin will become Darth Vader. The amount that a prequel or side story can "progress" the main narrative is necessarily bounded. 

  For my part, I enjoy the mental contortions involved in combating antimemetic threats, the types of dramatic reveals the setting almost uniquely allows, and the sense of slowly getting more pieces of the puzzle over the course of multiple works.

    The thick report may be out of date; best to check with the principal to see if anything's changed, at a time when the principal will be grasping for any possible solution to the problem and will be most willing to spill knowledge of other people at his level of ability.

  Interestingly enough, it seems to me that the best technology to counter the threat would be to create improved transhuman humans with improved ability to handle amnestic effects and the ability to separate parts of their own brain like an integrated version of the germs that can be discarded once it begins to be compromised.

  So many of the core issues stem from the simple fact that they are but humans with no real enhancements.
  ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    I'm not sure how viable any of that would be with biological neural networks, but it definitely seems extremely challenging. Furthermore, the time required to grow, test and debug such approaches would likely be centuries at least, even if you set aside the ethical concerns regarding such experimentation.

    A better approach might be to have an extremely high-density FPGA-based artificial neural network serving as a brain emulator. [This study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2018.00213/full) was able to model 2.6B neurons in real-time on a Stratix V FPGA. A cluster of 32 of those would just about get you to the number of neurons in a human brain, and a cluster of 64 would just about double the number of neurons. While it seems possible to emulate human brains with current technology, it's definitely too pricey to implement on a wide scale at present (~$6K/Stratix V), but within the next two to four decades at current rates of development we will probably have affordable FPGAs with enough programmable logic blocks to emulate human brains. From there, theoretically all you'd need to do is learn to reliably install neural interfaces and then use the data from volunteers to train the neural networks to act as brain emulators, taking the same sensory inputs and learning to produce the same motor outputs.

    Once you have viable brain emulators, it should be fairly easy to add a secure backup/revert system, and challenging but probably feasible to add monitoring systems to identify certain conditions which would require a revert and then carry it out automatically, as well as the possibility of emulating drug effects or carrying out specific brain modifications. For one easy example, this kind of setup could conceivably enable the detection of a seizure within milliseconds and then revert to the last backup from 5 seconds ago while adding the effect of an anti-epileptic medication as if it were immediately administered prior to resuming brain function. You'd then get a little popup in your visual field indicating that you just recovered from a seizure and lost 5 seconds of memory, but at least you're not dead or injured.

    In the hypothetical scenario of overwhelmingly potent and rapidly-acting mind-subversion memes, the sudden and drastic changes in the mental model between backups should make it relatively easy to identify and trigger an automatic revert. Slower and insidious changes would still be a threat, as they always have been with cultural memetics, so that's a far harder problem to address in a reasonable manner.
    ```

      They already started something like it with the old Olympea project, it simply doesn't have any sequels.

      The addition of the anomalies and the technology that descends from them could no doubt cut off a lot of the work. Some of the anomalies *are* explicitly beyond-human level artificial intelligences with promises for reverse engineering.

      Even the soul-based robots could make for a substantial upgrade to a researcher willingly undergoing the process.
      ```

  - u/vimefer:
    ```
    In reality, antimemetic effects are extremely limited and flimsy, mostly they work by stimulating the kind of pathways that biobrains use to pre-process visual input more quickly - the same pathways that optical illusions toy with. It's a kind of "invisibility through inconspicuousness". And the conscious slow-circuit thought completely bypasses it so it's immune to such effects by default. So not only do the anti-memes only work mostly 'by accident' they fail as soon as you are aware they exist.

    As for retro-active deletion, like affecting your memories of having been consciously aware of something, it's nearly infeasible AFAIK because the brain stores memories along the processing circuits in a distributed way, and not in separate neurons dedicated to the task. It means you'd have to suppress the processing of the signal to make the memory of the specific signal go away, and as I understand it the only working method for such suppression is to create an encapsulating memory that actively reminds you you should avoid remembering. That's typically how [people with eidetic memory](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160125-the-blessing-and-curse-of-the-people-who-never-forget) manage to "forget" things: by remembering they ought to to not remember that thing. It requires conscious effort, and cannot be done unwillingly.

    Aside from these considerations, one can teach their own brain to purposefully ignore or emphasize a specific signal, through auto-hypnosis. I've been toying with this, experimentally I can consciously skew or outright reverse the result in those "subconscious/implicit bias tests" that were popular around last year. By willingly hijacking your emotional responses you can literally train your brain into memetic immunity or extra-sensitivity for *anything*.

    The autohypnosis thing is temporary (it lasts for as long as you maintain the conscious effort to divert), but if you repeat it often enough it can become permanent - e.g. I trained myself to un-notice Youtube adverts and click-bait titles, it's pretty trivial to do. Now my eyes glaze them over reflexively and after they're gone I cannot remember fnord their content even if I try. I know I can reverse the effect by consciously placing special emphasis on those things, a couple weeks of this and I would be seeing them again.

    Any computerized systems that mimick / simulates accurately those biological systems would also be affected by those same features and quirks.

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    > is that sort of handwavium plausible in SCP stories?

    Yes, I think, especially at O5 level. The Foundation usually doesn't exploit anomalies directly, but it's entirely plausible that this is the result of them reverse-engineering one of them.
    ```

    - u/MutedUnderstanding92:
      ```
      Yep, more than possible. Part of the whole mission of containing and researching anomalies is to hopefully render them non-anomalous in the future- if the science fully catches up, than it can no longer be considered supernatural. If I recall correctly several storylines and solo wiki entries imply that things like radioactivity, among other fields of now-known science, were formerly considered anomalous- it's one of the key merits of the Foundation's approach over those of groups like the Serpents' Hand and the UN-GOC. 

      If you don't neutralize the anomalies, you risk letting something run amok that you can't control or defend yourself from. If you do, you stymie any progress or knowledge that could have been gained through its existence. Solution - Neutralize anything that is immediately catastrophic, contain and analyze everything else, and when something becomes so adequately explained as to be mundane, introduce it- as safely as possible- to the public. The best of both worlds- eventual anomalous freedom, with an ample safety buffer. Hopefully.
