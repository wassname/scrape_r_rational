## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So I found a quote from Tim Minchin's Storm "Throughout history, every mystery ever solved has turned out to be not magic." This got me thinking, what if this wasn't the case. What effect would that have on the development of science. So what if some important part of the world was explicitly magic, and the world was indeed created by magic. However ordinary physics does work normally. Also, I need to add that while it is perfectly reasonable to say try to figure out magic, this is in setting difficult for the reasons that the magic has gone away as history progressed by which I mean the ability to make new enchanted objects, but old one continued working.  I personally think this would effect things on the basis the concept of a universal law would be harder to come up with as some objects clearly get an out. Also, why make up naturalism if it plainly doesn't work?

    What are some example magical objects? Things for the natural philosopher to investigate include whether magic and the world look as though they were designed, and if so, by what sort of character. If culture has changed through history, does it look designed by a modern or ancient character, or neither?

      we can currently explain some very interesting things. a thing is magic when we cannot explain it, when we have no idea how to begin to describe a thing beyond do A, get B. 

      if the world is a simulation, it would be easy for it to contain things that only exist because an admin had added them to the simulation.

    You could look at neurological sensory antagonism. Like how human color photoreceptors encode and deliver color-data as levels of "red vs. green" and "blue vs. yellow." We perceive those as primitive axes to split the world along, only because our brains have been built to measure the two quantities against one-another. It's similar to, but distinct from, the idea of [neural categories](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yFDKvfN6D87Tf5J9f/neural-categories).

    (Anyone know of other features the brain perceives using this kind of antagonized measurement?)

    I feel like you could totally world-build a setting where the categorical duals in the world are inferred from the antagonized features embedded in the neurology of the magical sentients perceiving the world, rather than the other way around.

    Have you read about chinese philosophy? Because the unified meta duality sounds a lot like yin and yang.

    >Yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity, and night time.

    >Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and daytime

        The concept of yin and yang runs very deep in Chinese culture, in mythology you have the Dragon and Phoenix both embody yin and yang but they harness the opposite types of energy, the Phoenix, a yin symbol, is made of flames, while the Dragon, embodiment of yang, harnesses yin energy and creates rain. The soul of a person is yin while the body is yang. 
        There's also food, which can be divided as yin and yang, or hot and cold, not the temperature but in terms of your body, for example if it's hot outside you would eat foods that are yin/cold, or if you have fever you eat yin food.
        Eating too much of one type of food is not considered good as it can create imbalance in your body and you may get sick. This hot/cold food is not just limited to China but Japan, India, Pakistan (where I'm from, and I hear my mom always talking about this)etc.

    > A more interesting example would be Sun and Moon magic opposing each other by being concerned with tangible things (because daylight = visible) and conceptual things (night = imagination) respectively.

    These don't need to be opposed.

    A computer is a tangible thing; the software that runs on it is conceptual only. Yet they work together in perfect harmony.

        Hmmm... considering it further, you don't even need HEX (or other fantasy computers) to show this inversion. Humanity does it already - we are both our corporeal bodies and our conceptual minds. Any physical thing that thinks, or does something like thinking, is a mix of both sides.

        (Ghosts, on the other hand, are pure Conceptual).
