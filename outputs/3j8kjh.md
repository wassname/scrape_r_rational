  Seems like this falls into the trap of assuming that "everyone is the hero of their own story" means that everyone is *actually the good guy*.

  If they're motivated by Pure Evil, why do they have to be mindless? Why can't they be like Pact's Imps, killing and maiming in order to weaken the greater fabric of society/reality/what-have-you? Why can't they be pursuing some utterly alien goal that requires getting humans out of the way so they can't oppose it?

  If they're motivated by greed, why should they have been "duped"? Why can't they have been hired by a neighbouring Evil Empire? Why can't they have realized that raiding and plundering has good returns, like ugly green Vikings?

  If they're motivated by revenge, why should humans have invaded them first? Why wouldn't it be based on a cycle of mutual aggression, us raiding them because they raid us because we raid them, like most such conflicts in real life? Heck, why can't they have a completely alien concept of "Justice", attacking us because we refuse to move our villages and let them take over in the traditional nomadic way, or because we've offended against some religious or cultural *more*?

  *tl;dr:*

  What *do* orks want?

  * **To be evil:** These Orks don’t have names.  They don't have personalities. They don’t have hopes, dreams and aspirations. They’re fantasy filler. These Orks have no plan or strategy except to hook up with some bigger creature, like the mini-Boss Ogre, and kill.

  * **To make cash:** Someone is paying the Orks, and paying them enough not only to stand the infinite boredom of waiting for the young Murder Hobos to come along, but to get slaughtered at their hands when they finally arrive. Hiring bands of Orks isn't cheap. Someone is getting a decent rate of return on the investment for his goals.

  * **Justice and vengeance:** The Orks launch invasions of villages from their marginalized existence to wrest back what was once theirs. They invade dungeons to right their ancient wrongs, and take mini-bosses with them to kill any who try to stop them.

  * **To settle and farm:** When the Orks find a place that's good to farm and not yet inhabited, they found a new village and move their farmers. If the good place to farm is already inhabited, the Orks plot how they’re going to take the village. To them, the current residents are simply in the way; the Orks need to feed their people.  Food is a greater motivator than glory or power or conquest. Nothing else matters.

  * **To build empire:** These Orks burning far-flung villages are not the main bulk of the Empire's army. They are scouts, probing and sending back reports on defenses. The true army--the dangerous army--is a world away, with thousands of armed Orks laying siege to isolated, culturally-remote golden Elven cities. And, when those cities fell, the Orks sacked the buildings. They moved in and began ruling over these Elves. They assimilated Elven understanding into their own Empire.

  No one is what he seems, and everything has little pull-able threads that unravel into a tapestry of background, story, and tale.

  I ran a one-off that turned into a three-off about a group of goblins, exiled from their tribe for political reasons, taking up residence in a haunted barrow. The players were their gang's leadership: The mightiest warrior, the old chief's witch, and the old chief's daughter. They set to rat hunting/trapping/farming, exorcising the zombies and skeletons they couldn't use as de facto guards, dealing with a yellow mold infestation, and trading with the greedy, stupid, racist kobolds who lived in the connected natural cavern.

  Then the (staggeringly powerful) level 1 adventurers started showing up... and the goblins had to come up with plans based on superior knowledge of the map, relationships with its hazards, and what patchy information their scouts provided.

  I cannot recommend it enough if you've got a crew who'd go for that sort of thing.

  [Order of the Stick] (http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots.html) explores this in a couple of sections, but this is more in-depth.

- u/notmy2ndopinion:
  ```
  This sort of fantasy trope exploration is initially why I liked the webcomic Goblins. (I still read it, but it has deviated from its initial story arc of rationalizing the CR 1/2.)

  I notice that "To rid the world of existential threats" (i.e. humans) is not on the list... why not make Orks the fantasy version of UFAI?
