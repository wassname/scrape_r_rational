## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  As a cryonicist, I'm drafting out a text describing my revival preferences and requests, to be stored along with my other paperwork. (Oddly enough, this isn't a standard practice.) The current draft is [here](https://www.datapacrat.com/temp/Cryo%20Revival%20Preferences%20-%20draft%200.1.1.txt). I'm currently seeking suggestions for improvement, and a lot of the people around here seem to have good heads on their shoulders, so I thought I'd ask for comments here. Any thoughts?

  I've found that it seems like a awfully large number of people seem to hold very similar theories of consciousness to me and yet I've never really found anything that espoused my particular position in much detail.     
  I'll link to this thing I wrote so I don't have to keep repeating my position: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KkJL_8USmcAHNpdYd-vdtDkV-plPcuH3sSxCkSLzGtk/edit?usp=sharing
  I would really implore you to read that brief link before responding, since the point of it was to state my actual position.

  I'm interested how many people hold similar views and in where else people have seriously talked about this position. I can't really seem to find much on it by googling, so i'm interested in what else you can link to me. This comic is somewhat relevant to my position http://existentialcomics.com/comic/1 (however I don't think sleep is actually a cessation of experience).   

  I'm happy to hear any criticisms of this position, and haven't really gotten to hear any good one's. I've mostly heard the tired old non-argument of "Oh but that would mean you die everytime you sleep"     
  I've heard this position mentioned a great many places, and yet people never seem to seriously delve into it; frequently they just seem to stop when they get to the point where they think it would necessarily imply that you die every time you sleep (even though that's not an actual argument against it).    

  _Note:_ This is something which has large consequences; like whether you think cryonics could actually save a person (though even if you think it wouldn't, you might have other reasons for wanting a clone of you to exist in the future). It also raises questions as to whether anesthesia is a horrifying prospect.    
  So I don't think this is just a minor philosophical nitpick, _this is quite literally life or death_ so I would hope that you really think about it seriously.     
  The primary purpose of this theory is to actually make predictions about anticipated experience; whether particular things are likely to result in a cessation of experience.

    To me, the most glaring problem with the 'sleep must mean death' is that it sound prescriptive instead of descriptive.  It sounds like saying that, even though people cry at funerals but not at bedtime, that you should really cry at bedtime because the two are no different.  Whenever I hear something like that, it sets off warning bells to the tune of 'you're trying to force one thing to mean the same thing as something else, and there's evidence to the contrary.'

    At the same time, the 'clone teleportation' concept brings up a different issue.  If you take the same pattern of atoms and construct it the same way multiple times, neither instance is 'not a person', but they stop being the same person.  What I'm trying to get at is what I'm thinking of as a 'soul' assumption of identity.  Not in the sense that a soul literally exists and identity stems from that, but that the identity is like a soul with respect to how it is a discrete value that persists from birth to death.  If you hold this assumption, anything that interferes with the identity must be a 'death'.  If you deconstruct a person in a teleporter and simultaneously reconstruct them twice in two different places, it's obvious that something has happened to the identity.  Even if both clones gain the same identity, they must immediately diverge, so something must have happened.  Therefore, death.

    Something I've been considering, as a way of framing things, is the notion of every time you refer to someone, write their name, speak it, think it, every reference to their identity, it came with a timestamp.  "Greg [April 1, 2006] didn't like that prank so much."  It would help get past the idea that they're exactly the same person as they were back then.  You aren't like you were as a child, if an identical replica of your childhood best friend as they were back then met you today, even disregarding the physical differences of your grownup age they wouldn't see the same person as your past self.  The perspective I'm looking for, I think, is identity not as a soul that persists from birth to death, but a continuous spectrum of 'who you are' and 'what you're like'.  An infinite sequence of births and deaths with every passing moment that adds information to your brain or memory that passes out of your grasp.

    So why would we cry at funerals?  Why do we feel like our identity is a constant, a soul of sorts that makes me the same person from birth to death?  Well, imagine your friend nowadays.  Each time you see him, he's a little bit different.  He woke up differently, knows some new things and forgot some old things, but he's close enough to the person he was yesterday that it really makes no difference.  We adjust to the incredibly minor differences and are calibrated for the next minuscule change in our next meeting.  If you meet up with a friend you haven't seen since childhood, and they're all grown up and you're all grown up, the differences are much greater and you don't feel like they're the same person you played at recess with.

    If it's an infinite sequence of births and deaths, those are hardly the right terms to describe it.  They carry too much weight, make us think we should be feeling things we have no obligation to feel.  It's better, I think, to use 'beginnings and ends', since those are general enough to not demand reactions from us.  Your childhood self is ended, your best friend's childhood self is ended.  Yesterday's you ended, tomorrow's you will begin after you wake up.  These are all different identities, regardless of the shared memories, and your friend from your teenage years might feel melancholy about the you and him back then, those ended identities that were so different from today's you and him that it feels like a little death for those identities to not exist nowadays.

    If you are deconstructed in a teleporter, and reconstructed twice simultaneously, each version of you diverges in identity.  One may discover a fascination for a new genre of music, another may fall in love with a certain type of food.  The composition of what 'makes you you' diverges, and so do their identities.  But this isn't a death for deconstructed you any more than teenage you died as you slowly became adult.  If one clone stays in the same life and the other goes to a Mars colony for a new life, to anyone else in your original setting it's like nothing happened.  Your best friend still sees the you ever so slightly different from how you were yesterday, everyone else you know recognizes the same 'identity' because 2016 you hasn't died like 2015 you died, and like 2014 you died, and so on.  We cry at funerals because instead of a minuscule change every day, where you can look a thousand days back and say 'what a different person' and feel like a little death has happened, real, funeral-type death is an abrupt change from 'everything that makes you you' to a lump of flesh, and nothing more.

    Truth be told, I couldn't say I properly understood half of all that until I set about trying to tell you what I thought, but that's basically how I view identity these days.  Not as an immutable 'soul' with your name on it from birth to death, but a continuous spectrum of little changes each day that result in the end of old identities and the beginning of new identities, as if every time someone referred to you, the mention came with a time stamp of what you they're talking about.  Well, now that I've said all that, what do you think about the concept I rambled around in this horridly long post?
    ```

  - u/bassicallyboss:
    ```
    If I understand your view correctly, you are essentially saying that you believe that in general, consciousness is identical to an ongoing process occurring in the brain; and that specifically, your consciousness/identity/self is associated with the process occurring in your own brain.

    Given that, I don't understand why continuity is so important to you.  Assuming you're a physicalist, you believe that your mental state at any given time is completely determined by the physical arrangement of particles in your brain.  So, suppose that you could pause time just for your body, while the universe continued as before.  Your experience would have ceased until time was unpaused again, but you would notice nothing at all except for a sudden change in surroundings.  So, your experience is discontinuous with respect to the passage of time in the universe (let's call this t), but continuous with respect to your perception of the passage of time (let's call this t').

    Insisting on t'-continuity means you have to bite some rather strange bullets, which I'm happy to share if you would like to hear them.  But t-continuity seems to be a much stricter criterion than what we would ordinarily demand from a physical process, and without a good reason, it seems arbitrary and unsound to subject stricter demands of consciousness than of other physical processes.

    In either case, though, it seems strange to object to anesthesia when you don't to sleep.  If it's missing time you're worried about, then I don't think there's really a dividing line between sleep and anesthesia--personally, I've had non-REM naps and even full nights of REM sleep that felt like like lying down and then "suddenly being awake with no sense of the intervening time actually having happened."  And though I'm not a neuroscientist or sleep scientist, I expect that there are periods during nightly sleep when your brain's activity is essentially identical to what happens under anesthesia.  You can resolve that as a self-death happening in both cases or in neither case, but at least given my present knowledge, it seems very strange to worry about one but not the other.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      Ok first off anesthesia: I think anesthesia is _potentially_ a cessation of experience whereas sleep is not, because anesthesia is somewhat different from sleep. You can be vaguely aware of stuff during sleep, you can be woken usually easily and _most_ people don't feel like they skipped forward in time when they wake up, unlike anesthesia*. I just think anesthesia can't make as good a case for you having experiences during it as sleep can. A brain under anesthesia has less stuff going on than one in deep sleep.   
      *However it's not the sensation of skipping time that worries me; it's whether or not that's what you would see if you could theoretically watch someone's experiences through some weird qualia viewing machine. For an individual things are much harder to appraise due to all the problems I brought up with memory.

      http://academic.pgcc.edu/~mhspear/sleep/stages/nrsleep.html here's a link about non-REM dreams. I'm really trying to drive in the point that we have a considerable amount of experiences which we don't remember. I suppose this is going to be harder for you to swallow since you remember far less about your unconscious experiences than many it would seem.

      As for the bullets you think my position would force me to bite I'll be glad to hear them.     

      Ok so as for why I care about continuity, I don't think should the internal experiencing process stop that any future process can make any more plausible claim to continuing your experience than any other. Remember I don't think anything about the mental process except the experiencing bit matters in this scenario, so that bit is what i'm calling you in this circumstance.    
      As thus I don't think there's anything about any future process that would make it more you than any other, I think the only thing that makes your current process you is just that it has been running continuously.     

      As for stuff to do with pausing time, well I'm not sure actually _pausing time_ is possible and anything less won't have _totally_ stopped from the perspective of the rest of the universe and poses no difficulty to me model. However that whole line of questioning might be total nonsense for all I know since simultaneity, order of events and that sort of thing get all weird in relativity. In fact even theoretically the idea of totally stopping time might be impossible due to weird complications with infinity.
      ```

      - u/bassicallyboss:
        ```
        You seem more informed than me on the matter of sleep vs. anesthetized brain states, so I'll defer to you there.  However, I find it *very* interesting that you don't seem the sensation of time skipping, since it's essentially having (retrograde) amnesia for the skipped period.  I suppose that if you think it's something that happens to some extent every time you sleep (maybe less for you than for others, given your frequent lucid dreaming), I can understand how it would be less of a concern for you.  On the other hand, any degree of retrograde amnesia violates t'-continuity, so under that criterion there is no difference between anesthetization and forgetful sleep.

        If you have objections to the time-pausing thing on realism grounds, consider it instead to be suspending the execution of a 1-to-1 scale simulation of your brain.  The effect is the same.  Most of my other weird things are also more applicable to software emulations of your brain, but that shouldn't be an issue if the process and continuity really are what is important.  But as far as I can see, a theory that requires t' continuity and nothing further should also endorse:

        -That (as before) if you are suspended and resumed much later, this should not worry you, existentially.

        -That if you are suspended, copied, and resumed, both copies are you

        -That if you are suspended, copied exactly, and the original is destroyed, the copy is you and the original should not consider this a problem, so long as the copy is allowed to resume.

        -That the above holds even if, say, the original is your biological brain and the copy is a computer simulation.  Aside from body dysmorphia, you should feel no apprehension about becoming a computer copy that you don't feel about becoming ordinary future bio-brain-you.

        -That this is still true even if the "computer simulation" is some guy performing computations by wheeling file folders around a warehouse on a hand-truck instead of a processor moving electrons around.

        I think I had some others, but I don't remember them.  Anyway, these are the sorts of conclusions that I find sufficient to reject the idea of you-as-process, and which you will have to handle somehow should you keep your present view.

    The problem with arguing about theories of consciousness is that we have no evidence to support our positions. Since we don't know what the self is, we end up adopting a view in line with our philosophical interpretation of reality. I'm a theist so I believe in souls, but new evidence merely changes my beliefs regarding how souls work because the evidence cannot falsify my philosophy. I presume it works the same way for atheist materialists.

  Recently started playing Pathfinder, and have quickly discovered that the other players simply don't take it very seriously. They pay attention, so it's not as bad as it could be, but then they blunder into combat, make poor choices and almost die. 

  This is all well and good, but the part that bothers me is how little effort they put into their characters (roleplay-wise, not rollplay-wise), which leads to me dominating the conversation and planning portions, even though I'm not spec'd for it at all. I've become the leader by default. How can I subtly (or not so subtly) get them to step up their game while participating? The groundwork and tools are all there, they just won't use them.

  A fighter with 11 CHA really shouldn't have to take point all the time, guys.

    The most important thing about this kind of situation is not to be adversarial. You're all playing together, and you should all be honest with each other if you are to have fun. So don't try to game the other players, set them up and/or punish them for not doing what you want, ESPECIALLY if you're the GM.

    Otherwise, this is something you should talk about, first with the GM, then with the other players. Try to get on the Same Page, understand why they're playing the game and what they expect of it. If all they want is mindless violence and dungeon looting, your expectations might be too different for you to enjoy a game together.

    If the other players are open to more roleplaying, try to get the GM to encourage it, with diplomacy hooks in combat encounters (that can be as simple as having a goblin about to be stabbed by your rogue beg for mercy, making things evolve into a hostage situation with its friends) and other incentives. If the "responsibility" still ends up on your shoulders most of the time, the GM should probably try to focus more on setting up a dialogue with other players, and give them personal incentives for good roleplaying (this merchant has the item your mage needs, but he wants something in exchange that the mage isn't ready to do / give; what to do?).

    I'd talk to the GM, ask them to put in some subtle challenges that can't be beaten by rolls alone. Ideally non-fatal ones that leave the others time to learn. I don't think this counts as unfair meta, because GMs are supposed to consult players about how things are going. And make a point to show them how fun this is. One of my funnest campaigns was as a lawful-evil combat-averse Negotiator Bard. I made it look fun, so a couple of them made similar characters for our next game.

    Your problem sounds like an engagement issue. I've experienced this from all three sides: as a GM dealing with unruly players, as an unruly player in a game, and as an exasperated player in a game with a bunch of unruly players, and it's definitely one of the most difficult problems to solve in a tabletop game.

    From the unruly player's perspective, the issue is disconnect. They don't care about the outcome of the conflicts in the game, either because they just aren't particularly interested in the plot or because they don't feel their actions matter. This usually means that they either take a backseat (making their actions matter even less), start treating the game as a board game (avoiding the elements that bore them in favour of a more impactful pure-mechanics experience), or deliberately derail the game (making them more engaged because their actions have a noticeable impact, but at the same time making the disconnect even worse).

    I've tried a few solutions, mostly trying to filter for people more likely to start and stay engaged, but none of them have really worked. Broadly speaking, I think it's mostly about making the connection between action and consequence as clear as possible. What definitely does *not* work is forcing the players to engage by punishing lack of it, either by forcing roleplaying encounters or by directly punishing failure to roleplay.
    ```

    - u/Cruithne:
      ```
      One thing I'd like to try some time is a campaign where the players' preferences are explicitly stated before the game. Either everyone goes off the rails, or everyone engages with the story, or everyone agrees to treat it like a board game.

      I also want to try an alignment matched campaign. All the ones I've done so far have been kinda same-y in the way that if you add every spice in the cupboard to something, you won't get an interesting flavour. I get that the conflict between a ruthless action and a just action can be interesting, but I think most interesting debates happen between people who agree on a lot, so the within-party conflict would benefit from players having similar outlooks.
      ```

    The real question is why you're not playing a better RPG.

    But in response to your question, you've just gotta talk it over with the GM and the other players to find out what they're trying to get out of the game.  You can't force them to be super into the game if they don't want to be.  It might just be that you need to find a different group if you're not getting what you want out of the game.
    ```

  - u/Loiathal:
    ```
    Mostly, I see this with players that are more interested in the combat side of D&D, and much less interested in roleplay. They'll be super into the planning for a fight (or the fight itself) against a dread lich and its armies, but in the King's Court afterward when they're presented with their rewards they're checked out again (at least, until the loot gets rolled). 

    Are you sure the other players you're with are INTERESTED in that kind of D&D experience? Or are you taking up the mantle of leader because no one else wants to do it, and you're just willing. The kind of campaign the GM is running may just not be the kind of campaign the other players want to have.

  A couple of weeks ago, /u/EliezerYudkowsky [asked me](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/519svm/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d7anofx),

  > Sounds like you're part of the 5-20% of the population that's immune to exercise. Why are you still trying?

  As of today, I have a new answer:

  Another of the reasons I was, and am, still trying, is that I was not very confident that I /am/ "immune to exercise".

  I've been keeping track - and while I'm starting from near-zero, and my progress is near-zero, it isn't /actually/ zero. Today, I was able to perform a ridiculously minor feat which I wasn't able to do two weeks ago. (Hold my weight up on a pull-up bar for 1 second, more than once.)

  There's an old engineer's saying that the difference from 0 to 1 is much larger than the distance from 1 to 2. I am no longer at '0'. The rest is just working out the details of how to maximize the slope.

  This comment will contain massive spoilers for the game *Life is Strange*. If you are playing, or want to play the game, then I would heavily suggest you avoid reading this comment. Normally, I'd spoiler-text it but then the entire comment would be pretty much black and I don't want to do that. So I'm giving you fair warning here. Spoilers lie ahead. 


  Ok so, long story short, Life is Strange is the story of a small town girl, the protaganist, who somehow acquires time reversal powers (think Prince of Persia time rewinding as opposed to *Back to the Future* type travel) and rewinds time to save her best friend, Chloe, from being shot in an altercation in a school bathroom, which you do in the early stages of the game. It's a game sort of like Heavy Rain, so more of an interactive movie than anything else. The game's heavy on allowing you to make your own choices about things, and will give you stats on how you chose compared to the other players.

   As the game progresses, Chloe dies several times (with you rewinding to save her each time) in increasingly far fetched (though nothing straight out supernatural) ways. Think Final Destination. Each time, you have to go further and further to save her, compromising your morals just a bit more in some scenarios. The game's climax is a standard "fate is real" sort of thing. Chloe was meant to die in that bathroom at the beginning of the game. Time does not like you mucking with it. Cue supernatural superstorm coming to wipe out your hometown. The game gives you the choice: Go back in time and let Chloe die in that bathroom or allow the storm to wipe out the town. The implication is that, once the storm wipes out the town, the universe will be satisfied and Chloe's fate will 'reset' so if you save her, she'll actually be saved. No fatalistic trolling. So...what choice do you make? 

  To me, as I'm sure it is to most rationalists, the choice is clear: **Let Chloe die.** There's simply no way to justify sacrificing hundreds (possibly thousands) of lives for one. However, literally every single person I've asked this question of in my life (3 close friends, 4 coworkers who I'd call acquaintances) said they'd save their friend and let the town die. Once I added the caveat that we would assume everyone you know in town is elsewhere and so left inside it are just thousands of people you don't know, the hesitant no's became resounding yes'. And this perplexed me. 

  I understand the impulse; from a human stand point, we suck at caring for things that aren't right in front of us. I know this. But I just thought, intellectually speaking, everyone would be able to suck it up and rise above their basic nature. And....I was swiftly proven wrong. And also called a bad friend for not being willing to sacrifice hundreds of innocents for my own selfish desires to keep my friend alive. GG. 

  I mostly wrote this to see what some of your opinions/insights on this would be. And also what you would choose in the scenario.  Actually, any and all discussion that could branch off from this is cool with me. Go nuts!
