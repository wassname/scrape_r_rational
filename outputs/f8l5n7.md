## Any Work That Deals with Religion or God?

### Post:

I'm generally speaking an agnostic. But to say the least, I've always been fascinated by religion and the concept of deities. Are there any pieces of rational fiction that explores the topic well?

  Unsong might interest you http://unsongbook.com/

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Note that Unsong is NOT RATIONAL FICTION (but it's super awesome and well-written and entertaining and appeals to the same sorts of people who like rational fiction).  It's like that one freerunning video that keeps getting upvoted even on pure parkour forums.

    (It has some of the *trappings* of rational fiction, which is part of its charm, but in many cases it has those trappings just to subvert them.)
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I am somewhat aware. I've been told before that while Unsong isn't exactly rational, the author very much did his research while writing it.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Yeah, the religious doctrine and history it plays with is impeccably accurate.
        ```

      I'm curious how you arrive at such a strongly held opinion that Unsong isn't rational fiction? At the very worst, it is rational-adjacent, but mostly in that it avoids the tropes about turning the protagonist turning the plot on its head by tangential attacks on the central problem.

      &#x200B;

      Is it because that the in-universe context is so irrational? That is a feature of the universe, like math.

      I would argue that it is as least as 'rational' as MoL, but I have difficulty forming the specific argument without knowing the objection. The classification seems self-evident on initial inspection.

        I haven't read Mother of Learning, so I can't speak to

        a) whether Mother of Learning is above the threshold for being considered rational, according to the standard definitions of the genre (separate from whether it's *socially popular* among lovers of rational fiction)

        b) whether Mother of Learning and Unsong are *comparably* rational, regardless of whether either meets the bar

        The universe being irrational is a large part of the objection.  Possibly the central defining characteristic of rational fiction is that the universe is sane, consistent, and sensible—that it's lawful, even if the characters or the reader don't know the laws.

        Unsong very specifically doesn't do this, by throwing two dozen *different* ways-the-universe-might-be-lawful into a blender, and having them co-opt and controvert each other.  There's spell-casting, narrativemancy, placebomancy, Uriel's metamagic, random throwaways like Walldrug and the cactus thing, the laws of judgment resulting in people going to heaven or hell, etc.  The end result is "pretty much anything could happen; the author can introduce fundamentally brand-new magics three-quarters of the way through the plot and the reader has to update their little mental suspension-of-disbelief document."

        The other contender for "the central defining characteristic of rational fiction" is that the *characters themselves* make sense—that they think and react the way real intelligences think and react; that they pursue their values at least somewhat sensibly and agentically; that they munchkin at least as much as real people munchkin, etc.

        Unsong *does* meet *that* bar.  It's full of people who are, in fact, actually trying (although some of the actually trying is sort of disappointingly first-level obvious and cliché).  People do in fact exploit advantages in the way that a capitalist market encourages them to; the organization UNSONG itself is a central example.

        IMO, though, you need both in order to qualify as rational fiction.  And I'm sort of a stickler for making sure to maintain the boundary that lets rational fiction remain something special and different—I don't want us to slip into calling things rational *just because they're well-written and contain good munchkining.*  Similar to how I think it's important to maintain the boundary between parkour and freerunning—freerunning looks very similar to parkour, but it in fact subverts parkour's central (and *only*) defining principle, so blurring the terms destroys the only meaningful distinction.

          Ah. Thank you for the cogent explaination of your position.

          I would substantively disagree with the supposition that the universe itself needs to be rational for a work to be considered rational fiction. This is disctiction between 'the universe' and 'the aggregate actions of nonspecific characters populating the universe'. The universe merely *is*, it does not need to be consistent, it needs to be metaconsistent. It needs to obey the rules set for it, which may conform to constraint criteria which do not exist within its own framework. In the context of unsong, the very meta-rules that operate the universe are of inconsistency, that many in-universe physical and logical constraints can be broken on a regular basis. 

          In contrast, the aggregate actions of characters in unsong are, as far as I can recall, consistent. They operate within the physical rules of the universe, as disconnected from our own as they may be.

          The other argument that I would put forth is that purity arguments are counterproductive. Unsong may be subtly 'not rational fiction', but it is definitely close enough under any definition to not warrant warning people off of reading it for fear it doesn't meet a purity test.

          PS: I love your work.

            Just to be clear: nobody was proposing a purity test, and nobody was warning people not to read it.  You didn't accuse me of doing that, so maybe I don't need to mount a defense, but it's explicitly not what I was doing, and I don't think anyone else in the thread is, either.

              Agreed

          Just a heads-up, MoL has now been completed, if you were considering reading it.

          >Possibly the central defining characteristic of rational fiction is that the universe is sane, consistent, and sensible—that it's lawful, even if the characters or the reader don't know the laws.

          And do you think, say, HPMOR meets that standard?
          ```

          - u/TK17Studios:
            ```
            Absolutely.  It's specifically not Word-of-God, but I've heard Eliezer offer his headcanon-as-author about how the magic system came to be, and it makes perfect sense and holds together even in "normal" universe terms.  Not to mention the fact that magic which is shown to work once within the fic always works the same way.

            There are certainly places where HPMOR could be better, but I believe it clears the bar.  I am less stoked about e.g. the end of Metropolitan Man—my interpretation of the earlier parts of the story is that when Superman is moving at super speed, he's also superperceiving and superprocessing and thus is invulnerable to "surprises," but this is not borne out by the conclusion.
            ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        I'd say UNSONG and Practical Guide are equally rational, in that both follow the stories of characters using the laws of the worlds they find themselves in to solve their problems. The only reason these stories may seem irrational is because the laws of those universes diverge heavily from ours, mostly through the action of narratives on events in the world.  But the fact that their world runs on narrativium is explicitly known by the characters, and they rationally exploit this fact for all it's worth at every opportunity. That makes the protagonists rational.

        Unsong isn't really something that is concerned with religion so much as it's concerned with using religion as a setting if that makes any sense to you.

  [Answer to Job](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/) is one of the funniest and best solutions to theodicy that I've read. It's a short story, and only takes a few minutes to read, but I highly recommend it nonetheless.

    >!See, I find this response unsatisfactory. If simulation theory is correct, then just by knowing about a universe is equivalent to that universe existing (given perfect omniscience).  So when god differentiates between a good universe and a bad one, both the good and bad exist as perfect simulations in god's mind.  Therefore, just by virtue of being omniscient, all possible evil worlds and good worlds and every world in between exist. Or so it seems to me.!<

Because, yeah, obviously, why would he do that?!<

      >!If I myself can imagine the *concept of* the existence of a Bad Universe, in the abstract, without personally modeling every subatomic particle of any particular one, surely God can avoid accidentally simulating universes that are truly not worth the processing power.!<

  [A Modern Myth](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/) hasn't been mentioned. It's also by the guy who wrote UNSONG. The main characters are Greek gods. Religion isn't really part of it though, except that the gods used to get their power from sacrificing rams (which doesn't work anymore).

  The Two Year Emperor has a few gods. Though very little religion.

  Harry Potter and the Natural 20 has gods, though only one participates in the story (not including the gods preventing anyone from using the Candle of Invocation exploit, or one that could be used to get the first candle, but hasn't been). It's just a single deus ex machina, which is kept as minor as possible. Religion doesn't seem to play any role.

  Have you seen the TV show or read the book Good Omens?

  If yes, I want to recommend [this superb fanfic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593). It's about Crowley (the main demon character) going to therapy after the events of the tv show. And it's absolutely beautiful. I laughed. I cried. I loved and hoped. Read it.

  I know With This Ring by Mr. Zoat is fairly popular on this sub (despite not being strictly "rationalist"), and deals with numerous religious and philosophical themes. In the DC universe every religion is true in some fashion or another, and as you can imagine that has *huge* consequences. 

  This is my favorite bit, from the MC in a TV interview:

  > "There are any number of more powerful beings out there. Refusing to believe they exist when you have good evidence that they do is simply… Foolish. Instead, what you get are materialists. People who believe that there's no… Fundamental difference between 'higher powers' and lower ones, merely a difference *of* power."  

  > "What I find particularly amusing about it is how painfully logical such philosophies tend to be about moral utility. If a normal man or woman dives in front of a bullet to stop it killing someone else, they are performing an exemplary act of self sacrifice. There are few acts more worthy of praise. On the other hand, if someone bulletproof like me does it, we're not really sacrificing anything. If I step in front of a regular bullet I probably won't even feel the impact. Rather than being an exemplary act of self sacrifice, it's merely a good deed. To that way of thinking, the more powerful you get, the more you have to do to justify praise.”  

  >"To that philosophy, anything that wanted people to directly worship it had better either be doing a lot of good in a non-self-serving way, or actually require it to accomplish a particular thing. An omnipotent being is of no interest to such a philosophy, because it would be trivially easy for it to do anything, and as such there is nothing it could do that would be worthy of praise."

    Note that that's from the Renegade timeline, where he is himself a low-level god. Which simply means that his soul has been designed to hold more magic than normal (and to gradually gather more), and he can instinctively use that magic to affect things around himself without structured spells. Plus some side benefits like enhanced strength, toughness, poison resistance, and regeneration (although those are a bit mixed, because he can no longer rebuild his own body via power ring).

    Edit: Another tidbit from the Renegade timeline:

    >"Don't pretend to be nice. What are you doing on this planet?"  
    >  
    >"Before you got here? I was baking a cake."  
    >  
    >He narrows his eyes. "I'm sure it was an **evil** cake."  
    >  
    >"It was for a local religious event which commemorates the birth of a man whose sole purpose in life was to suffer and eventually die in incredible agony as a ritual sacrifice to stave off their god's wrath. The religion's practitioners wear a symbol of the mechanism used to execute him around their neck."

  You might enjoy [The Dark Night](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5330602/1/The-Dark-Night), which is a short story. I won't spoil anything but it only takes about 5 minutes to read.

  Also [The Last Temptation of Christ](https://web.archive.org/web/20180101160950/http://squid314.livejournal.com/324957.html) is pretty good, and has a unique take on how you could tempt a (potentially) immortal, (maybe) omniscient being.

    I've tried reading along time ago, but I didn't exactly enjoy it. It's a bit too military fiction, I'm more looking for exploring the concepts behind the religion, rather than simply having angels and devils as characters.
