## [Q] Consistent Dragons (D&D 3.5)

### Post:

I am trying to think of a consistent version of D&D dragons that matches the information found in the Draconomicon as much as possible. The problem is that I simply do not know enough biology or physics to determine the right answers.

According to the book, Dragons are essentially mammals that lay eggs. (Yes, some mammals do lay eggs.) Their physiology is a mix of large cat and bird with scales added.

One of the problems of the book is that dragons are supposed to be able to fly without direct magical assistance. This seemed problematic, so I wanted to know whether it was reasonable or whether or not magical assistance really was necessary. According to the book, dragon bones are very light and hollow on the inside (like birds), but are very strong (think carbon nanotubes). The muscles of the dragon are extremely strong and gain their energy from a magical organ.

A mature adult silver dragon (200-400 years old) is a huge creature, capable of flying at 25ft/s. The wingspan is between 75 (max) and 30 (min) feet. The dragon weighs 20 000 pounds. Given this information, how fast would the dragon have to beat its wings in order to fly? Also, how strong would its muscles and bones have to be to withstand that level of activity?

  I'm visualizing traincar-sized hummingbirds. Actually, that's terrifying.

  Not a biologist, but ...

  The largest flying animals were the [pterosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pterosaur_size). At 500 lbs, that puts them at roughly the size of juvenile to young, depending on species. Given that pterosaurs definitely could fly, we're in the range of plausibility for Medium-sized dragons. The problems start to arise when we increase their size; the square-cube law says that as we double the size of a dragon, we square the area of it and cube the weight.

  Here's a simplified chart (taken from the page for black dragons):

  Size       | Wingspan |  Weight
  --|--|--
  Tiny       | 8 ft.  | 5 lb.
  Small      | 16 ft. | 40 lb.
  Medium     | 24 ft. | 320 lb.
  Large      | 36 ft. | 2,500 lb.
  Huge       | 60 ft. | 20,000 lb.
  Gargantuan | 80 ft. | 160,000 lb.

  Note the problem here? Weight is increasing *really, really fast*, as we'd expect from the square-cube law. Each size category is effectively doubling size, quadrupling area, and octopuling weight. The problem here is that the surface area of the wing is being outstripped by the weight in a major way; we would not expect a scaled up dragon (pun not intended) to be able to support its own weight with its wings. We *really* shouldn't expect them to get more maneuverable or faster. Going from Huge to Gargantuan increases the wing area by ~70% (assuming invariant wing shape), but weight increases by ~800%.

  You can fudge some of the numbers with non-magical materials that are equivalent to the best that humans could ever make, but you *really* need to work on the weight problem; dragons should be as light as possible. Their fuel source obviously can't be meat either, though that's already canon.

  (It should be possible to work backward to work out how much power a gargantuan dragon needs to put into its wings in order to take flight.)

    Good points. It is your last point in brackets that I really want an answer to, but the cube-square law is a very good point to bring up.

      If you want to estimate the power required for flight, consider that most planes have a glide ratio of about 10:1 (gliders can go much higher, 50:1 or more). So with no power our dragon will descend 1m for every 10m forward. Power is P=Fv and the force of gravity is F=mg, so the power required to fly level is P=mgv/10 where m is mass, g is gravity (10m/s/s at ground level on Earth) and v is the maximum level flight speed of the dragon. (This is all ignoring magic)

      Once you have your power, you can work out how much the dragon needs to eat by multiplying the Power by the seconds spent flying per day and dividing by the energy density of their food.

      Of course if dragons are mostly gliders this changes, now, so long as the air rises at or above 1/10 the minimum flight speed of our dragon it will fly. (100ft/min is usually available during the day up to 500 or 1000ft/min depending on weather. On Earth) You can make the number smaller to match bird or man-made gliders (1/20-1/50) but that limits you to a glider-type shape, long thin wings, very aerodynamic body. BTW minimum flight speed is roughly related to wing loading (weight/wing area)

    > the square-cube law says that as we double the size of a dragon, we square the area of it and cube the weight.


    I think you mean as we double the size the area multiplies by 4 and the weight by 8, according to 2^2 and 2^3

    Probably just being pedantic, but there's always the chance someone'll read that and believe it for years.
