### Post:

A lot has been happening, Eight whole 'episodes' in since last I posted. if you've not been keeping up in my various posting places sorry about not posting here, got buried in a bunch of other things and it slipped my mind. More of the universe of the reef has become revealed, more mysteries have been hinted at. We are making progress to your second port.
Catch up and enjoy the alien shenanigans and xenofiction silliness.

    As the post below said, but mostly it's an extended world-building exercise and the world being built is both fascinating and truly alien
