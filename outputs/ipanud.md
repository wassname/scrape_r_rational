  The author is a long-time participant in the rationalist community, so I think this story belongs here. Again and again, it poses the question: should one prefer the cynical truth, or ignorant happiness? In this fic, Luna represents the colder side of rationality, the temptation to say emotions don't matter, that even a child can and should be burdened with the most terrible facts of the world. Celestia, meanwhile, is an incrementalist. Their battle-by-proxy over a single person is one that shows the advantages and the downsides to both approaches.

  If you're interested in this, it should be noted that the story hasn't been updated since 2017â€”though the author is still active, so there's always hope.

    I always felt the opposite. If no one has heard from an online author he might just have a writing hiatus. But if a fanfic author has moved on to multiple other stories then I have little expectation that they would return to ideas from years ago after having since much improved and found new interests and fandoms.

  I remember this story being pretty good.
