  I don't know how you guys feel about reposting comments onto the reddit part, but I figured out how to "solve" their physics last time and I wanted to post it somewhere other than five comments from the bottom.

  Instead of actually isolating each letter, all you need to do is come up with reactions that produce extra of each letter, and use them together. For example, if you want to make a cat, you use (crab -> bar + c) + (bead -> bed + a) + (tart -> tar + t) = crab + bead + tart -> bar + bed + tar + cat.

  This can be further improved upon. In this case, you’d need to put the bar, bed, and tar into the nanofab afterwards to get another crab, bead and tart. Consider the e-producing reaction axe -> ax + e. Since ax is a synonym for axe, you can just keep using it, and get as much e as you want.

  Unfortunately, you probably won’t find synonyms that nice for every letter. You can use combinations to get letters, but that would seem to be too difficult.

  Then I realized you just need matrices. For each pair of synonyms, you make one row in the matrix by subtracting the letters of one from the other. For example, axe = ax gives (0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0). Couch = sofa gives (-1,0,2,0,0,-1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0). Hopefully, you get an invertible matrix. If it isn’t invertible, just remove the linearly dependant synonyms and find some more. Once you have the matrix, just invert it.

  Now each row represents a reaction that takes a certain set of objects, and produces those same objects plus a letter. You can produce capsules for each letter so that you can stick them together to produce whatever it is you need. Alternately, you can make a vector representing the number of each letter in whatever you want to produce, multiply the matrix by that, and use the given reactions to produce that object.

  To stop the world from ending, couldn’t he just have used the reaction sound + grin -> ground + sin? There doesn’t seem to be anything forcing the reaction to go in a particular direction.

    It seems to me that creating SIN as a means of averting the end of the world is just asking for a bad time.

    Do synonyms exist (as anglophysical reality)?  Somon gave the True Names as "rock" and "wheat", not "rock or stone or granite or pebble" and "wheat or grain or seed or food"

    EDIT:

    >We tried the experiment again with a zinc vial – zinc because it was implausible that there was an ZINC + E anagram lurking out there – and ended up with a mat of eels. Through this whole time, we had been debating the problem of ambiguity – who was to say that our granite was GRANITE rather than ROCK or even STONE – and the answer seemed to be that Dr. Adwell – or whoever was watching Upstairs – was mostly sympathetic to our efforts. Well, the sympathy ended when we started trying to isolate single letters. ZINC became METAL and thence EEL MATs.

  In case anyone might prefer this story in audio form, the HPMoR podcast read it while waiting for new HPMoR chapters to come out.

  Also check out the interactive fiction game [Counterfeit Monkey](http://emshort.com/counterfeit_monkey/) by Emily Short if you like settings that run on linguistics. 

  You can play it online [here](http://iplayif.com/?story=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifarchive.org%2Fif-archive%2Fgames%2Fglulx%2FCounterfeitMonkey.gblorb), but the standalone gblorb emulators like Gargoyle are less laggy.

  Since the last time this was posted to the subreddit was two years ago, and we have UNSONG (by the same author) constantly being posted to here, I thought this was worthy of a repost. Also if we are going to read a story about traveling to a world with drastically different rules of physics, then [Eliezer's rant](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hq/universal_fire/) is mandatory reading.

  Side Question: Does anyone know of any off-line copies of articles from Scott's blog? I've been thinking about making my own copy of it, but I don't want to go through all of the work to make a nice version if one already exists.

    Might as well link the last discussion thread we had on it. Doesn't seem like 2 years ago

    I like his rant, but realize that in the context of this story those flaws are handled by how the world apparently works off of the English professor's subconscious. Basically, "it works because it should."
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Eliezer's wrant is just wrong, though. In Norse World, people still work, presumably through the power of an animating force, rather than through chemical reactions. It makes perfect sense for a chemical-human to be translated to an animating-force-human, and and for the chemical-match to be translated to a just-wood-match. Presumably people would be perfectly fine if they were placed into a vaccum-sealed chamber, because they never needed oxygen in the first place.

    The rant is completely inapplicable unless something in the story shows that animating-force-people can't survive in vaccum-sealed chambers or such, but that seems unlikely.

  I just have to say, just to feel normal again; holy shit! Can you imagine if this concept was actually real? And there was some way to verify that it was the guy's ascended conciousness running the show in  his new world? Not only would this resolve the Fermi Paradox (the creator of our world imagined an inhabited planet in a universe, not a universe filled with inhabited planets) but who would want to stay on Earth when you could, theoretically, essentially upload your mind to a new universe on your deathbed?
  EDIT: If all of the above was true, what would you do?

  ```
  I see some foreshadowing of Scott's current Unsong story, with the word/name magic. 

  Mh. ... I'm not sure why their nanofactory can cope with the weird physics when they can't even get matches to work.
  ```

  - u/abcd_z:
    ```
    Things work on a conceptual level there.  A nanofactory is something that works exactly the way a nanofactory is supposed to.

    The more relevant question is, "Why didn't the nanofactory eventually reduce to something else?"
    ```

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      Nanofactories are resistant to being reacted, in much the same way as AI is resistant to being created.
      ```

    - u/Arancaytar:
      ```
      I did an anagram search and found, eg., an ACORN, a TOY and a FAN.
      ```
