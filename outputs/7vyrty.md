## [Comedy] Piss off /r/rational in one sentence. Go!

Let's see if we can learn a valuable lesson about ourselves or if I can hit negative post karma on my account.

      Non-specifically, the idea that suspension of disbelief for one thing (like the existence of werewolves) means suspension of disbelief for a totally different thing (like a plot that doesn't make sense). It's fairly common to see that line of argument used (I have a few guesses why).

      More specifically, and what I was thinking of when I made that comment, there were a  few episodes of a popular fantasy series ([show's name](#s "Game of Thrones")) where the producers played fast and loose with the established speeds and travel times in order to make their dramatic moments happen, and that particular line was one that I saw a fair amount, because that show has big honking dragons.

        Indeed, and this is also what really makes the difference between hard and soft sci-fi. You can write a hard sci-fi story in a world with a lot of fantastic and exotic violations of known physical laws, if the world and the plot is consistent. 

        You can have the weirdest magic, you can have literal gods literally walk the earth, the suspension of disbelief can work if your story sticks to the rules it set up. I could imagine some pretty hard and rational fic in a D&D setting, even if it makes fun of many of its ridiculous features, mainly because how well-established the rules of magic are: it is well known and well described what every spell can and cannot do.

    Now I kind of want to see a story where magic exists but is completely inconsistent.

    ```

    - u/iceman012:
      ```
      One story I've really been wanting to write is in a setting where magician's strengths are inversely related to how well they understand magic. So you discover you have the gift of magic, start playing around with it, learning its powers and limitations, write down the system, and suddenly you can't do magic anymore. Meanwhile your buddy, who also developed the gift but who is as dumb as a rock, continues to throw fireballs and enchantments around despite having no clue how it works.

      I've read one about a world with fixed and well understood laws of magic, and a society built on them, until it turns out that there are previously unknown "metamagicians" who can, with effort, replace each law with different variations on the theme. Eg changing from the Maxim of Persistence: Perfection is Eternal, which requires exactly accurate performance of rituals, to the Maxim of Perseverance: Repetition Unto Success, which doesn't care about accuracy but requires the rituals to be done hundreds of times.

      Cue societal chaos.

        [Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/) is almost certainly the other one you're thinking about, and is arguably a better example than  Ra, since Ra's particular brand of magic is mostly consistent even though it deliberately flies in the fact of most known science.

        Unsong, on the other hand, has a world where rational materialism is literally breaking down in favor of metaphysical symbolism and abstract theology. So of course megacorporations start manipulating this by using sweatshops to brute-force discover the setting's magic.

      ```
      Ell Goonish Shive has something sorta like that, Magic is intelligent but not in a way we would recognise and the rules are "built?" with narrative causality in mind, they thus can be slightly inconsistent and with exsploitabilities and flexabilities but this is fine due to the cultural circumstances this iteration of magical law surrounds, if Magic can't remain in it's cultural context or it's fundamental laws are called into conflict and it cannot be resolved with minor subtle changes I.E. a magitech civilization limited by hideously expensive elemental aluminium finds a way to mass produce it or something philosophically important to the Magic like the distinction between organic and inorganic becomes irrelevant or like in the stories case fundamentally secret magic becomes public then the whole thing is rebuilt from the ground up, this principle works in reverse too, if the removal of some particular laws means that a race that uses shapeshifting in their biology can no longer shapeshift and would go exstinct then those laws are less likely to change. That said it's not that big a part of the story, if you want something much better then try reading Fine Structure, it quite different, rather darker, more complex and definitely "Sci-Fi"er and has a mechanic like that quite centeral, I shant say more.

        > avoid death by boredom.

        I was thinking more likely madness, with the brain conjuring up fantasies of what's not physically possible in order to entertain itself. There's bound to be more physically impossible things than physically possible ones so living in one's imagination would probably become easier. Sort of like how people start to hallucinate when sensorally deprived -- someone would have experienced pretty much everything there is to experience, many times over, so anything outside their fantasies might seem effectively like white noise to them, or close enough to encourage the same symptoms.

        Either that or maybe just "death" by wireheading. I'm not sure burning out pleasure receptors is something that can get boring.
        ```

        - u/silver7017:
          ```
          I don't know that madness and the exotic sorts of creativity one might need to develop in that circumstance would be all that different from an outside perspective. hopefully the presence of other such immortals which are themselves increasingly strange will keep actual reality interesting enough to prevent us from descending into eternal fantasy.

  I'm going to steal a gem from a true master of the art:

  "Do you realize what genre cavets and aesthetic trappings are? They're the things you put in a story to evoke a feeling that 'this is cyberpunk' or 'this is high fantasy' or 'this is a coming of age story'. Things like, megacorps which don't very much care about you, or not wanting to grow up and become an adult, or a strange new world that doesn't exactly operate according to your rules of logic (for example, strange wizards who do things in strange ways?). These are things that settings live on. If you drive a monster trunk full of your 'logic and reasoning' over these things, you are failing to understand what makes these settings evocative and inspiring in the first place."

    - u/genericaccounter:

      I will be honest. This one is one of the most annoying quotes in this entire post to me. The reason is that it was clearly written by someone who has some clue of what they were talking about but somehow missed the obvious reasons for rational fiction. A logical world with people acting with human minds has many advantages. The magic system or whatever is special about it sets as a different world, whereas the reasonable villains and others show that people are still people. The consistency of the world helps with immersion, and lets people speculate ahead regarding the plans of the characters. All of these are positives that require the logic the author of this quote hates. This person said something that sounds reasonable unless you think about for a minute and that annoys me the most. A consistent world with consistent people is plus whether you like exploring people or exploring worlds.

    I think there are a lot worse things you could say to upset Worm fans like me:

    “Worm is poorly-paced, poorly-edited edgelord schlock.”

    “Worm is for obsessive nerds who think a million-plus-word slog is just warming up for a sequel.”

    “Taylor is a terrible protagonist and the story goes out of its way to excuse her horrible behavior.”

      There isn't a good reason for Taylor not to have joined the Wards before
      her first night out. It is dismissed in one line as bad because of 
      teenage drama and scheduling but then she is so desperate for affection
      that she joins the undersiders with more teenage drama and problems. You
      can say unreliable narrator and someting about her father but her
      father her is basically a non-entity.

      There are obvious problems with going undercover in a group with
      a thinker called Tattletale and expecting that cover to last long term.
      There are obvious problems with going undercover in a group when you
      have no official backing and indeed official disapproval. Taylor 
      approaches Soverign Citizen level stupidity which drains a lot of 
      sympathy.

      Conflict keeps getting propped up by one dimensional villain charachters
      like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse Nine. 

      The Leviathan fight is some bullshit. Armsmaster's plan was bullshit 
      and shouldn't have worked at all. Leviathan may have great mobility
      but that shouldn't prevent Legend or Eidolan from keeping up with it
      and providing updating location reports.  Armsmaster plans to and does
      fight Leviathan one and one. That is completely suicidal given how
      dangerous Leviathan and the other endbringers are stated to be. I don't
      care if he can predict or has the halberd to damage it. Leviathan should
      have still wiped the floor with him immediately just on its strength
      and speed. 

      At the hospital they lock Skitter into restraints because she
      is a villain including her broken arm. Then she gets out (no one notices
      her swiping the keys with bugs and the bugs are able to unlock her restraints)
      and moves into the next room over to find unmasked Shadow Stalker (They 
      keep heroes and villains right next to each other. Shadow Stalker's mask
      is taken off and kept off for some reason. Shadow stalker is set right
      next to Skitter). Then she is caught by the heroes and then her team
      mates show up immediately (She gets restrained to her cot but not them
      and nobody questions this)

      It has a lot more flaws but I don't want to reread it to find them.

        Bear in mind Taylor is a child, and not one prone to making good decisions. She’s also much more put off of the wards by her experiences with authorities like the school, whereas the Undersiders were decidedly more anarchic, as she subconsciously likes. Also, Lisa’s a pretty excellent manipulator.

        None of these are “good reasons” if your standard is “a protagonist who never makes mistakes.” They are absolutely good reasons if your standard is “people doing things consistent with their character.” A protagonist who does things because of their flaws is not the same thing as a protagonist who does things for no explained reason at all.

        “There are obvious problems with going undercover in a group with
        a thinker called Tattletale and expecting that cover to last long term.

        It drains sympathy… because none of us have ever been arrogant, stupid, anti-authoritarian teenagers? Armsmaster is 100% correct when he raises every single one of these points to her, it’s one of the earliest indications we get that Taylor is indeed an unreliable narrator.

        “Conflict keeps getting propped up by one dimensional villain charachters
        like Bakuda and the Slaughterhouse Nine.”

        I wouldn’t call some of the Nine one-dimensional, but whatever. I suspect you’re using morally ambiguity as a shorthand for “depth” here, but I think one can absolutely be both evil and still be a well-developed character. And, not to put too fine a point on it, but shallow people and serial killers and the like absolutely do exist. Not everyone is particularly complicated.

        “The Leviathan fight is some bullshit. Armsmaster's plan was bullshit 
        and shouldn't have worked at all.”

        Did you miss the part where it emphatically didn’t work at all? Armsmaster expected that his Nanothorns would be able to cut through anything, and they didn’t. He expected his predictive software to work, and it didn’t. He got his arm and leg torn off for his hubris and nearly died. Worse, Leviathan wasn’t even deterred. It took Scion’s arrival to drive him off.

        Look, I get it if you don’t like the work, you’re entitled to your opinion. But your nitpicks don’t even make sense.

        Well, 1 and 2 are entirely subjective criticisms (which is very annoying when they are levied against fans of the work with the attitude that these opinions were objective and everyone else is just wrong), but I wrote 3 to be just plain wrong (which is a different kind of annoying). Basically the whole point of Worm is that we’re supposed to see Taylor as an extremely unreliable narrator making questionable choices, and the plot/story absolutely do not try to justify her decisions.
