## [META] Rational Fiction 101?

### Post:

I have a bit of an interest in rationalist fiction. I'll admit to being a skeptic in general and a giant raging science nerd. Unfortuneatly, I'm at a bit of a wall. I know where to start. I've read the tvtropes page and have read some of HPMOR. (In my defense I have ADHD and can't finish a goddamn thing.) Basically can I get some recommendations for someone newer to rational fiction, and preferably that of the shorter variety.

  Not to toot my own horn too loud, but if you wanted something short, finished, and rational, [Rules of Wishing](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439/chapters/10575111) probably fits the bill quite nicely.

  Slatestarcodex has a bunch of short and interesting fiction.
  ```

    ```
    Slatestarcodex fiction is more "stuff that /r/rational likes" than rational fiction. Stellar, but not what OP is asking.

    Ohmygodthis. It's perfect when you feel distracted but want to read something that makes you think.
    ```

    I'd especially recommend [this](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/) and then [this](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/)

  Have you tried all the fics on the wiki section of this subreddit? Because if not then just try that, nearly everyone else is just going to recommend things from that list, or just tell you to check the wiki yourself.

    Well it looks life I'm going to be busy for a while
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      Oh man that stuff kept me busy for like a year, there's just so much amazing rational fiction.
      ```

  - u/Zephyr1011:
    ```
    I think asking for the best things from that list is not an unreasonable request, since the wiki has a great deal of stuff not in sorted order
    ```

- u/Amonwilde:
  ```
  Try Mother of Learning. That's a fun one...
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    It's not short though...nor finished. I highly recommend it as a story, but for the specific criteria given, maybe not so much.
    ```

  ```
  Ted Chiang's [Exhalation](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/) is a short story that is a solid example of the genre.
  ```

  - u/appropriate-username:
    ```
    All his short stories are pretty good in general, though I'm not sure how rational they all are.
    ```

  ```
  [The Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) is a complete rational Superman fanfiction from the perspective of Lex Luthor, which I found excellent. And reasonably short for a full story, at 80K words
  ```

  ```
  Yeah, the [community wiki here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index) has a bunch of popular ones. There are also links to [our recommendations threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/monthlyrecommendation). Some are longer than others!
