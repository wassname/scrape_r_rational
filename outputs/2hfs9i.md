  ```
  Bluntly, both characters appear to already be dicks, which may make it hard to read. Unsympathetic viewpoint characters are hard to make enjoyable stories with.

    I... uh.... can't argue with that. Yeah, they're pretty much dicks. I would say "Well, there are more viewpoint characters, and they aren't as much of dicks," but I should probably have started it with one of them, shouldn't I?

    I apologize for starting my book with dicks. Do you feel it's a major enough flaw that I should change around chapter orders?
