## [Q] Is there a group on fanfiction.net for rationalist stories?

### Post:

I assume there are probably more than one, but is there one you would call *definitive*?

  [Close](http://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/lesswrong), but no cigar.

    I always find this utterly hilarious.  On LessWrong itself we all talk in this ultra-dry, wannabe-academic tone, as if trying to imitate Quirrellmort.  And then 183 LWers compose the only *actively labeled* LWian fiction group, which is distinctly devoted to pony.

      Ya, I spent a minute checking if I was missing a filter or something.

  I've set up one. It seems a bit slow to update, but I'll add all the fanfiction from this subreddit to it so in a couple hours we'll have one.

  I've included these so far. I dunno when it will update. It seems to have a character limit too so it looks a bit weird at the moment.

  The feed seems to show the list, in a weird code format. I've updated it with luminosity too.
