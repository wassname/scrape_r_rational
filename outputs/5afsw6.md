  Hey, humans. Apologies for the hiatus, as always! This story began as a NaNoWriMo project, but it currently sits at about 45k words. Since November begins a new tomorrow, it seems I won't have made National Novel Writing Year, either. But I'm still pleased to release a chapter today, namely, the new opening chapter I've been meaning to write for a while. There are still some decisions in this chapter that I'm fairly shaky about, and it was quite rushed, though, so feedback is appreciated. Let me know how you feel this serves as introduction, regardless of whether you're a returning or first-time reader; although I think it's definitely more engaging than the previous beginning, there's definitely still room for improvement. Also, please tell me if the formatting seems (unintentionally) off on your device. Further updates to come, some day. Thanks for reading, as always!

  And finally, Happy Halloween. >=3
