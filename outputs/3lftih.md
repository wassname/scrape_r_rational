## [BST] Exploiting teleportation?

### Post:

What are some clever and creative ways to exploit teleportation?

(You can teleport anywhere you can imagine, you can bring some amount of matter and even people with you).

P.S.

Somewhere on this subreddit, a guy summarized all cool tricks and ideas from the Jumper novels, but unfortunately I can't find that post.

  **Spoilers for all of the *Jumper* series (which I think are worth the read):** [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2sgf95/mkbst_teleportation/cnpjlqs) is probably the one you're thinking of.

    Yes, exactly, thank you very much!

  Universal transportation like this is probably most easily exploitable as a means of setting up space infrastructure.  Make a deal with NASA or ESA or your local space agency of preference, to take payloads up to geostationary for even just a tenth or a hundredth of the cost of a rocket (get lower and start taking on 'charity' jobs once you have enough money to be comfortable the rest of your life,) and you'll be rich beyond your wildest dreams while helping humanity explore space and colonize the planets.

  If teleporting into the middle of something doesn't kill you (let's say that it causes you to swap places with a person-shaped piece of whatever you're teleporting into) then there are obvious applications here for deep-core mining, asteroid mining, and espionage if you absolutely _must_ lead a life of danger.

  Depending on how much matter you can take with you, this may also be a means of practically creating negentropy/infinite energy: Take a big heavy thing, make a generator with some sort of bucketed vertical treadmill that can take the heavy thing and turn its fall into electricity, and teleport the heavy thing to great height to let it fall over and over again.

    But don't forget your space suit.

      Obviously that's part of the deal, and it's why you go to them instead of opening up your own business.  Because they already have space suits to give you, and have people (probably) smarter than you to figure out all the little details and possible problems.
      ```

        When messing with exotic abilities, it's best to think carefully about anything that might impede your continued survival. Because the other guy might be a little less motivated to be thorough.

        Of course, consulting with smarter people is probably a good idea too.

          Mmhmm, and I'm glazing over a lot of detail and carefulness in favor of laying out general goals.  

          Like, how would you _test_ whether you can safely teleport into matter?  I'd probably do it by first seeing if I can teleport 'in place' (For example, see if I can teleport from a sitting position to a standing one) and if I could, I would try teleporting myself so my hand has the tip of its pinky inside of a small rock.  Worst case scenario, it hurts like hell and I need minor surgery.

          If it works, see if it works on larger scales; try intersect-teleporting a couple of fingers, then a hand, then a leg, and so on.  Test everything _carefully_
          ```

          - u/Geminii27:
            ```
            Given that you can apparently take matter with you, teleport so that the tip of a long thin piece of wire you are holding ends up inside solid matter (aerogel, to start with. Then glass, so you can see the result). And that there is a lead shield between you and it, with radiation detectors on both sides.
            ```

            - u/drageuth2:
              ```
              hmm, good idea, in case the matter annihilates or is violently torn up by electrostatic force or something, yeah?
              ```

              - u/Geminii27:
                ```
                Yup. Teleportation isn't exactly a well-known science; the result could be anything.

                Well, nearly anything - presumably teleporting into a volume of air doesn't make you explode or become fatally radioactive. The most likely scenario is that you swap volumes, so teleporting into solid matter would just mean that you get embedded in it and a statue of yourself appears at your source point. (And if you teleported into a load-bearing solid, you might get crushed because you've removed a critical volume of concrete or steel holding up tons of pressure.)

                Likewise, probably not a good idea to teleport into extremely deep water (pressure) or hostile environments without a suitable environment suit.
                ```

    - u/redrach:
      ```
      What if the teleportation always leaves you nude? Say, because the process involves regrowing you from scratch at the destination and copying your memories over.
      ```

      - u/Sceptically:
        ```
        That would count as forgetting your space suit, so don't do that then. Unless, of course, you're really really really good at breathing vacuum.
        ```

  Like many of these questions, it all depends on the rules of the world you are in, and on things you haven't specified, like:

  1)  What happens when you port to somewhere that changes your potential energy? (i.e. nearly everywhere)

  2)  What happens to your velocity vector when 'at rest' where you arrive is different from where you left?

  3)  Do you have to touch things to bring them with you?  Can you port part of a solid object?

  4)  What happens to air/water/solid objects in the volume you are porting in to?

  You'll get whole families of different things to do based on different answers to these questions.

  For a few tricks by a teleporter in a story I'm currently working on, see what Journeyman does here: http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/128307010576/the-makers-ark-chapter-9
