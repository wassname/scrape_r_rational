  Kiiiiind of proving her point there, Saint.

  The Saint might outfight Cat, but Cat out-sassed her through and through, still greeting Cat with the finger-through-the-neck salute is so hilarious.

  The insult Ping-Pong between Cat and Malanza was great, hopefully she lives to tell the tale.


  Cat right now is reminding me of caesar, tring to squeeze every possible advantage of the situation, the crusaders are hungry, without capable middle managment and tired. (edit, looking at the comments in the blog i remembered that the crusaders should not have more than a handful of scry capable mages after zeze did his thing. even more advantages)

  will the next battle be the Princes' Graveyard?

    It will depend quite a lot on whether Cat's plans are ready or not. And from the vibe I got so far, I don't think they are. So I feel like she will have to keep the empress happy, and thus spare the proceran royalty. This is probably the Battle of the Camps, since both parties have now set up camps in the battlefield.

    I love the way erraticerrata names things. They all have this sort of grandeur or epicness attached to them.

    Calling it now - new love interest.

    Or the Battle of the Camps

  Did Harrow was ever mentioned after the !demon !fight?


  Did the heroes remove it from Creation?

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Fuck.

  - u/Sarkavonsy:
    ```
    If so, that's a breach of terms!

  ```
  > Saint: You suck 

  >Cat: no u
  ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  Something I've been wondering about since the revelations of the last chapter: given that sappers are taught the spreads for goblinfire on various types of ground (with magically significant numbers in it), and that keeping notes on demons affects the surroundings, is diabolically charged alchemy the reason the sappers are typically perceived as mad, or the demonic essence is diluted enough to be safe in that regard?
  ```

  - u/Rheklr:
    ```
    There could be an element of that, but it's because munitions are *highly* volatile extremely dangerous explodey things, so you have to be mad to even start working with them in the first place.
    ```

- u/Dent7777:
  ```
  This series is so tight; the pacing, the dialog, the politics, the action scenes from battle tactics to millimeter dodges.

  This story has that 'it' factor. It stands well above most rational fiction serials.
  ```

- u/tantalum73:
  ```
  Gods Below I love this series!
