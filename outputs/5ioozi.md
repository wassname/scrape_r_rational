## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I was watching House recently, and got to the third season. I was reminded very much of Quirrell's lesson to Harry on losing. For those who don't know, in the third season, House gets revenge on a clinic patient who's admittedly rude to him, but by inserting a rectal thermometer and leaving him in the room. Massive overkill. The patient was a detective, who then makes House's life hell by taking him to task over his malpractice and Vicodin addiction. House, of course, responds by constantly escalating, even when the entire situation would have been solved just by giving an admittedly fake apology. If he would have just learned to lose, he could have saved such difficulty.

  This actually lead me to a minor realisation: I think the reason people are so fascinated with House as a character is that for all his brilliance and love of rationality, in his personal life he's actually quite irrational. He dresses in the garb of logic, but uses it to rationalise and post-hoc justify utterly irrational actions. I think the paradox and contradiction there is what interests people.

    Not me, I think he's just an asshole who specifically chooses to be an asshole. I never got into the show because I just hated him so much. I don't care if that's the intention, I do not want to watch a show where a man (verbally) abuses people for personal pleasure and gets away with it because he's good at his job, which he does purely for personal pleasure.

    He's not irrational, he just doesn't care about anyone and has no excuse for it. Sherlock and Sheldon Cooper have mental disorders that keep them from empathizing with people even if they don't see that as a problem. Archer and Tony Stark are selfish jerks, but they still fundamentally care about people and doing their job despite their personal flaws.
    ```

    - u/HeirToGallifrey:
      ```
      He's definitely a tremendous asshole, but there is the rare moment of humanity he shows—and in his own, selfish way, he does care for his friends. He tested Cameron for HIV since she was too scared to. Asshole move? Definitely. But he did it because "knowing is always better than not knowing." He also kept Cuddy's 'auditioning' Wilson a secret from Wilson. Granted, he needled her about it for months, but he did do a good thing by keeping her secret.


      He's an ass, but he does help people.

      And he's tremendously irrational—at least in our world's definition of rationality. His world seems to operate on the principle that "If House is a miserable jerk, things work out." So maybe he's figured that out and maintains the status quo because it works out best that way.
      ```

    - u/Anderkent:

      Living in constant pain is not an excuse? House makes much more sense than Stark.

    > for all his brilliance and love of rationality, in his personal life he's actually quite irrational.

    That is a pretty common thing among many people. It's why conflict of interest is such a big deal when you're talking about lawyers or doctors. People *suck* at separating their emotions from themselves and making the objectively right choices that would improve their lives. For example, there are millions of overweight people (myself included) that understand the risks and downsides of being overweight. Yet....we're still overweight. We don't have the necessary willpower to make what would be admittedly simple changes in our diet and workout regimen. Of course, not all overweight people are in this category but the vast majority are. 

    So with House, he's ruled by his basic emotions. He's hedonistic and childish, and that shows in many of his actions. He's ridiculously intelligent, objectively, but he will also make decisions that are so recklessly stupid, it could only happen on TV (prime example: taking a drug for his leg that had only one success in one rat for a few weeks. Instead of waiting for more clinical trials to be done. And then, proceeding to do major surgery on himself instead of going to his competent coworkers because he was *embarassed*.)

  Been watching videos on this [guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g)'s channel.

  I learned that a dyson swarm, for example, doesn't need any new technology. It's just pumping out satellites after satellites until you have enough, and the sheer scale of such a civilization is just mind boggling to contemplate.

  It makes all the space opera I watched or read about puny in comparison. 

  Star Wars isn't big at all. It's positively tiny.

  Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [Handy discussion links and previous threads here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing).

  Ugh, this week was intense, and not all in a good way.  Between the [destruction of the first armed and fully operational keepstar in Eve Online](https://imperium.news/assault-m-oee8-keepstar/) and the grand finals of the Boston Major and the subsequent release of version 7.00 in Dota 2, I got nothing useful done over the weekend.  And then on Tuesday I started coming down with a bug, and I’m only just now returning to work, so nothing got done during the workweek, either.


  However, on the lone day I had available (Monday) I did get some work done on an automated logging tool for Discord, to help streamline that process.  That tool is about 85% done, and I will probably get that done in the coming days as I slowly recover.


  Once I have fully gotten back on my feet, I expect to continue finalizing the design document of the game.  If there are any features you feel have been neglected, or any critique you’ve been sitting on as you sit from afar, please let us know!  My goal is to have at least the list of features more or less frozen by the new year, with everything after that concerned with implementation.


  ----


  Feel free to leave any comments or questions below. Also feel free to join us [on the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server](https://discord.gg/sM99CF3) for brainstorming and discussion.  It’s a great group, really, and I would highly recommend hanging out, even if you’re not in it for this project itself.  There’s tabletop groups, Dota 2 partying, and [puns](http://i.imgur.com/j3jRmMZ.png) like you wouldn’t [believe](http://i.imgur.com/8cUkzoGl.jpg).  Come join us!

  I've been thinking about coffee, lately, and whether I should start drinking some.

  On one hand, I generally feel that taking any mind-altering substance on a regular basis is a horrible idea, with potentially disastrous consequences.

  On the other hand, I'm not actually sure this is true, and lately I've often felt tired and weary when I need to be productive, even when I sleep more, and "drink some coffee before you start working" is the advice I've heard most often. I'm not sure drinking coffee would address the problem or just remove my awareness of the problem; I'm not sure what the problem even is. And coffee is hardly a strong nootropic, so it's not like I would be putting my life and my health on the line.

  So what do you think? What does coffee even do, and should I start drinking some on a regular basis?

  For that matter, does anyone know what the deal with ego depletion is yet?

    I don't drink caffeine, but the author of my favorite webcomic does: http://www.egscomics.com/egsnp.php?id=347

    > I've now given up caffeinated beverages twice. The first time lasted a LOT longer, and eventually came to an end as a result of very early morning programming classes. More recently (as in, the day before I posted this comic), it was because the side effects of not drinking it proved far worse than the side effects of drinking it. It's been awful for my productivity and general mood.

    > I imagine this wouldn't be the case if I were more in shape and more active, but that's not where I am right now. That's a separate thing to aspire to. Besides which, that might not work. I've heard that caffeine can alter brain chemistry over time. Dependency on it might just be a thing I'm stuck with.

    > That said, I AM sticking with not drinking coffee. This is mostly because it's not practical to brew just one cup as one needs it, and there's more caffeine per cup. It's really easy to make more than I wind up wanting and feeling compelled to drink it anyway (a bit silly, but it's a strong compulsion). With tea, I can just make it as I want it with little issue, and there's much less of a kick per cup.
    ```

    The problem with daily caffeine use is that tolerance builds, and eventually you're exactly where you were in the first place.

    Caffeine is not a *long-term* solution to energy problems. If you use it sparingly, you can get an energy boost. Otherwise, it just becomes a return to normalcy, which isn't necessarily bad, if you like the taste of coffee.

    Personally, I've found that when I do have a lot of caffeine (triple my normal daily dose), I'll end up crashing 5-6 hours later, and then staying up a couple hours later. Still, it's sometimes worth it when deadlines are approaching.
    ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      > Caffeine is not a long-term solution to energy problems

      I'd rephrase this to 'caffeine is not a solution to constant energy problems'. It's a good tool for temporary and occasional energy surges.

      So if you start drinking coffee every morning just to wake up, you're going to be at a baseline very quickly. But if you drink coffee once a week because you have an important meeting after a full day of work, it'll work much better.

  *[Testing the Limits of Magic](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11984396)* is a very nice [Refuge in Audacity](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Refuge_in_Audacity) story. The summary baldly states:

  > Involves the best elements of every great Fan Fiction I have ever known of.

  However, in spite of this "everything but the kitchen sink" intent, it's surprisingly fun to read, and has fairly good English. It reminds me of [Perfect Lionheart](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1318171)'s stories!

  To my chagrin, it seems that the development team of *neither* of my two favorite mods for [Paradox Development Studio games](http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza) can be trusted to hold historical accuracy over moral outrage...

  In *[Europa Universalis IV](http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4)*, the player can expend abstracted "military power" in order to make an army of his attack the natives of a province, resulting in the natives' extermination if the army is large and advanced enough. The extensive MEIOU & Taxes mod removed that button on the grounds that "the M&T team does not endorse genocide". Later, the modders attempted to backtrack by calling it "an ahistorically easy to push genocide button"--but, when pressed, they admitted that their rationale for the button's removal was "mostly" moral.  
  [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/YFMnM5Y.png)

  In *[Crusader Kings II](http://www.reddit.com/r/crusaderkings)*, the player can torture imprisoned characters, though he risks gaining undesirable traits (Cruel, Impaler, etc.) in the process. The extensive Historical ~~Improvement~~ Immersion Project mod has not adjusted the decisions that are available for torture, and has left them at the somewhat-arbitrary levels of vanilla CK2. When a player suggested ways to make the torture decisions more realistic and historically-accurate, the HIP modders expressed "zero interest in touching the vanilla torture/mutilation options to do anything other than remove them outright".

    I've really grown to hate that guy over the years, lol. Purely because of what he did to Chunin Exam Day. Not knocking your story rec or anything; I'm just taking advantage of the admittedly rare chance to talk shit about PL.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I can sympathize, especially with the HIP modders. Historical accuracy or not, I wouldn't be especially eager to spend time developing and balancing a realistic, developed torture system in any kind of video game.

    I don't know how the HIP team works, but if they're volunteers, they're mostly going to work on things that interests them, and if they don't like the idea of organizing and maintaining a torture system, they're just going to leave the system as it is, and work on systems they're more interested in.
    ```

    - u/ToaKraka:
      ```
      The *entire selling point* of these mods, however, is that they're *vastly* more realistic than the vanilla games, which often are derided as mere "map-painting simulators" by players of these mods. *Actively reducing* historical accuracy is *reneging* on the *central promise* of these mods.
      ```

      - u/chaosmosis:

        The CK modders made it clear that they will be leaving the system intact. I agree it would be good if they added the torture stuff. But you can't force them to.

        The EU4 situation is bullshit, though.

  When I first heard about raising he sanity waterline and how it was frequently framed as promoting atheism, it made me nervous because I am a spiritualist who isn't willing to give up my ontological beliefs that aren't epistemically supported. Now, however, it has occurred to me that the waterline isn't high enough to even consider debating what is a rational worldview.

  We as a civilization don't even agree that science, critical thinking, and education are predominantly good things that should be trusted more often than not. [There are people](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/5igpgq/in_your_opinion_is_antiintellectualism_rising_in/db871ud) who genuinely believe that anti-intellectualism is a good thing because they think academia and higher education is either factually wrong or conspiring against them the majority of the time.

  We've spent so much time discussing rationality with each other that we've become ignorant of people who fundamentally distrust rationality. With populism on the rise throughout the world, it's only gotten worse in recent years. Our priority should be raising their sanity waterline up to ours, not raising our own up to an ideal.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I think that's what "raising the sanity waterline" means, at least as far as EY's original article went. Personally, I've always seen it as less of a guideline (go out and teach them, my children!) and more of a reminder that, even if it feels useless on a grand scale, trying to teach a particular person is always useful, trickle-down-style.

    That said, I feel like you're advocating the exact general principle that fits you specific interests. You're saying that there are people out there who don't like eg science, critical thinking and education, and it could be fixed if we just raised the minimum rationality level; but you don't want the minimum rationality level to be raised so much that you have to abandon your religious/spiritual beliefs; I think there's an inconsistency there.

      I'm not just protecting my own belief system, I'm rationalizing it by pointing out how much more dangerous other belief systems are than mine. I'm just the hypothetical scientist from [Outside the Laboratory](http://lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/) who's in agreement with materialists about how observable reality works, anti-intellectualism is much less compatible with rationality than dualism.

        Well, getting you to abandon your spirituality is pretty low on our collective to-do lists, I think ;p

        The same has been debated before. Should CFAR focus on making a few people more rational n the bay area, or sending missionaries to Elbonia?

        By focusing on the bay area, they've managed to become self-sustaining. A few very-competent people might be more useful then a bunch of middling-competent people (when you include "being born in the first world" as a form of competence).

        That being said, Elbonia is a big country and I have no doubt we could get some very competent people there. They'd just have less access to resources on the global scale. And supporting missionaries is *hard*.

                Are you saying that such an effort *wouldn't* be likely to improve their lives? Where "they" is any large group that has shown willingness to be proselytized to before and that has a low sanity-waterline.

                Or just objecting to tone? Because fair enough.

                  I think I'm mostly being contrarian. Sorry about that. I guess that my point is that "any large group willing to be proselytized with an easily-raised waterline" is actually pretty hard to find, whether or not the country you're in has a high GDP, but I'm not actually that confident in that assertion.

  Little bit late, but if anyone sees this what are your views on alcohol/drinking. I was invited to and went to a party where there was quite a bit of drinking last night. I don't drink. I'd even go as far to say that drinking is mildly immoral. Here's the argument I'm planning on posting to Facebook on the subject.

  I'm generally what's called an utilitarian. Briefly this means I believe in doing those things that cause the most good for the most people. Like almost any philosophy there are some problems with it, but I'll ignore them because they aren't relevant to this context other than to say I'm more of a Rule utilitarian this means that rather than looking at each individual case and trying to decide the right course of action based on the total change to society I believe in coming up with a set of rules that if followed with improve the world.

  Let's look at drinking then. Positives are that it's a bonding experience. It also has some medical applications but there are both better options now and I'm trying to focus on recreational use. To me the chief negative is that it causes one to lose control of themselves. A huge number of violent crime is committed by or on people who were drunk.  About 9,967 people die every year due to drunk driving in the US. And here is the crux of my argument. I'm not sure if I can blame them. Yes I believe in legal manner we can and should, but on a personal level when they made the decision to drive they often couldn't legally or morally make any decision. Critically I see no reason to believe I couldn't or wouldn't do the same thing in their position. The only actual mistake I can see them making is drinking in the first place. Similarly most crimes committed by drunks are committed by people who didn't choose to commit any crime, their real mistake was drinking. Again not trying to say anything about legal culpability.

  Given all this my basic argument should be clear. By drinking you're essentially taking the choice of committing terrible crimes and entrusting it to chance. It's a low chance sure, but still a chance. Personally I'm not willing to take those odds and I think looked at this way few people would be. I don't think trying to ban alcohol is the right choice (it just doesn't work), in fact I'd support lowering the legal drinking age, but I think the world would be significantly better without drugs in general. Anyway I'd really like to hear others opinions. I don't have all the evidence and trying to assign value and weigh multiple factors this way is really hard.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I was surprised when I searched Less Wrong for posts about alcohol and found nothing big. I always thought that community like that would be quite averse to taking drugs. Then I remembered the "I notice I'm confused" thingy. I thought about it for some time, tried to see it from the other side. I think the main arguments against total abstinence would be something like:

    - Drugs, when taken in moderation by someone who researched the topic, can make for a nice experience/have good effect on you. So it's better to make a case for responsible drug use rather than abstinence from them.

    - Like you said, for someone who knows what he's doing, it's only low risk. So if it can benefit you, you should take the risk anyway, I guess.
    ```

  - u/rttf:
    ```
    > Here's the argument I'm planning on posting to Facebook on the subject.

    Please don't do this. Utilitarianism already has a bad enough reputation. There's no need to make it worse.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    If you drink enough that you lose control of yourself, then yes, that has serious problems. However, though I don't drink myself, observation suggests that drinking in small amounts (e.g. a glass of wine with a meal) does not impair decision-making ability to the point where one would suddenly decide to drive. Especially if one has made plans (e.g. hiring a taxi in advance) to ensure that the simplest decision will be *not* to drive.

    So, I agree with you that the consequences of *losing control* are a massive negative, and firm steps should be made to try to prevent people losing control. But I don't think that losing control is an inevitable result of drinking in moderation.
    ```

    - u/space_fountain:
      ```
      I think part of where I may be failing here is that I don't have great examples of responsible drinkers. Neither of my parents drink and most of the people I'm exposed to who do drink are college students. Hardly a demographic known for their good decisions.

      On the other hand I don't know that there's some hard line between loosing control and merely having had a few drinks. I think it's important to realize that their is this continuous gradient because it makes us realize we are really trying to solve some sort of system of equations. If we could decide how much benefit drinking has per unit of alcohol and how much harm than it's simple to see that you should only drink until damage(x)=benefit(x). I think the crux of the argument I'm trying to make is that damage(x) is much bigger than benefit(x) for practically every X. Maybe there is some x (some amount of drinking) where the benefits outweigh the damage, but I'd think it would have to be really small and on a personal note I don't like the taste.
      ```

      - u/zarraha:
        ```
        My parents are responsible drinkers, on the rare occasions that they actually have some sort of alcohol (maybe once a month?), and so that's always been what I considered normal.

        If I have one or two drinks I start to feel light headed but in a sort of vaguely pleasant way.  It's slightly harder to think, but more so in that it just seems to take longer.  My personality doesn't really seem to change, although I'm sort of weird anyway so that's hard to measure.

        I've never done anything I regretted while drunk (or buzzed, it's arguable that I've never truly reached "drunk" depending on your definition)  I've never really made any decisions other than dialogue choices while socializing, and also choosing to stop drinking once I felt like I'd had enough.

        So yeah, it's possible, in fact, easy, to drink responsibly if you know what that means.  Given my (extremely limited) experience, I think it's reasonable to say that at least 90% of cases of drinking have the benefits outweigh the damage, because there literally is no damage.  It's just that in small number of cases the damage is so severe it outweighs the benefits.

        It's sort of like playing the reverse lottery, except it's not really random.  It's just the dumb people ruining it for everyone else (like they do with everything else)
        ```
