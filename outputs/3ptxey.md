  Just want to clarify that this was part of my "30 First Drafts" project of November 2010 and was probably written in about two hours flat, making almost no use whatsoever of the backspace key. This is the reason for those strangulatingly bad run-on sentences.

    Do you have any plans for NaNo 2015? I really enjoyed 30 First Drafts; it's hard to believe that was five years ago.

    To be honest, I *kinda* liked some of those run on sentences. Most of them.
