## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  repost from last week's thread because i timed it wrong and posted on friday and as a result i only got one reply ([which was, granted, amazingly well-thought-out](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cn6yfq/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/eww5y3c/)).

  hi yall, i'm writing a crossover fanfic between [wildbow's worm](https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Worm_Wiki) and the ['long earth' series by pratchett and baxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Earth). i'm posting here to harness the collective intelligence of this subreddit for two things:

  * **brainstorming:** what are the short and medium term economic, political, and social consequences of parallel universes (the vast majority uninhabited, but some inhabited, but separated by long distances) being accessible by ordinary people, and how can different rational agents (corporate and government) adapt to this new landscape? who are the winners and losers? (i've been exhaustively thinking through this for the past month and i'll list the most important things i've thought of just to get the ball rolling).

  * 'long earth' canon is really, really vague in some areas (i will discuss these below). **my scientific and technical knowledge is limited and i'm not sure how to fill in the gaps in a way that's both specific and narratively satisfying.**

  **the background:**

  * in the long earth, 'steppers' are lightweight held-held boxes that can be assembled from components you can find in any electronic hobbyist store. they require a potato or a tuber as a power source.

  * they move the user in one of two directions (east and west) into a parallel universe. nearby universes are identical except modern humans (and their close relatives) never evolved.

  * special constraints: **1.** in order to use a stepper, you need to have been involved in the final stage of the assembly of a stepper (any stepper, not necessarily the one you're using. it's basically just twisting some wires around, nothing too hard). **2.** you cannot move iron (iron compounds like haemoglobin can be moved, but not alloys, etc. - *this is an area of vagueness*) between worlds. **3.** their use causes very intense, debilitating nausea that lasts for about five minutes - multiple uses in succession make it much worse (there is an effective rate-limit on their use). **4.** clothes and things you carry are moved across, but not just anything you happen to be in contact with, but you can step two people across sometimes - *this is another area of vagueness*. **5** you can't step into a solid object - air is okay, i don't know if water is.

  * about one in a thousand people can step without a stepper (natural steppers). they don't experience any nausea and can step at a rate of around once every 3 seconds. conversely, for about one in ten people, stepping is lethal (phobics).

  in worm's canon, we're made aware of two earths: earth bet (the main setting) and earth aleph. 

  * earth aleph is nearly identical to our world. earth bet isn't, because it diverged from ours around 1982, and the butterfly effect has created several big differences (for instance, in earth bet, china is the 'chinese imperial union' and is ruled by an emperor. different administrations, different borders, and so on.) 

  * aleph is generally preferable to bet (it's richer, has less parahumans/supervillains, and doesn't have cataclysmic terror-monsters - have a look through worm's wiki if you're interested in the specifics). 

  * if you're born before 1982, there will be a copy of you.

  * earth aleph is located in the 'centre' of the multiverse, earth bet is located on east 27. as a general rule, it takes 4.5 minutes for a natural stepper to go from A to B, and maybe a good part of a day for a normal person. the schematics for building steppers became public in 2016, the current year is 2020. 

  * there are other inhabited universes further away, but the closest is east 1013 and kinda impractical to visit. it's very weird and probably implausible and diverged in the late 1930s. if anyone is interested in it, i'll sketch it out in another comment and history nerds can help me either steelman it or tear it to shreds (i don't mind).

  * stepper schematics were uploaded to the internet in early 2015, the current year is 2020.

  what are the...

  * economic implications

  * political implications

  * religious, social, religious, legal, technological etc. implications?

  of having two similar parallel worlds within reach of one another, that would intersect with the general story (outlined below)?

  ***

  **so, here's what i've thought of**. i might be completely off the mark, so you may not want to read it to avoid polluting your own thinking. i would recommend thinking things through beforehand and then reading what i've written.

  **implications i've thought about**

  * obvious stuff, but stuff that still opens up a lot of questions.

  1. **safe areas are no longer safe.** you can step east, walk a while, step west, and end up in fort knox, or the white house. therefore: movement of valuables underground for protection, increased security costs for protecting adjacent worlds, location secrecy has a higher priority. in the short term, crime, terrorism, and prison breakouts jump. it's harder to keep people in prison once they're in there, and harder to arrest people.

  2. **land and mineral prices collapse.** farmers tend to their fields in universes adjacent to them. there's some depopulation, but the only people who move to live in an uninhabited universe permanently are generally people who are okay with not using any technology with iron in it forming the first wave. i.e are you okay with being a hunter-gatherer? the second wave would be in the process of unfolding right now, as basic infrastructure gets set up in uninhabited universes & they become more desirable (especially in population-dense areas in third-world nations). there's probably a long-term decrease in inter-ethnic and inter-religious conflict, following a short-term burst.

  3. **muddled property & criminal law, difficulty collecting taxes, bureaucratic headbutting, and competing organisational jurisdictions hobble governments and other administrative entities.** supply-chains for the very general and widespread electronic components used to build steppers are probably too global for national governments to prevent people from building steppers entirely. 

  * preventing movement of people and goods becomes very difficult to enforce in practice - so that has implications for border controls, drug trafficking, and so on. my thought are that the dynamic would be something like: governments and corporations would initially nearly bankrupt themselves trying to dramatically scale up and gain a first-mover advantage, and then over time would begin to delegate and decentralise to local organisations & operations - mafia-type groups who enforce property lines and collect taxes, roving white supremacist groups who patrol borders, etc.. interdimensional regulatory agencies would emerge but bet-aleph cooperation would still be in its nascent stages after five years - there would likely be police cooperation and information-sharing, i think.

  stuff that isn't immediately obvious:

  * i've assumed that some corporate lawyers found loopholes in aleph and bet's merger laws, and that there is nothing stopping 'identical' corporations operating in bet & aleph (say, general motors) from merging. **so, there's an initial glut of intellectual property since bet and aleph won't have invented exactly the same things, and a burst of innovation from technological synergies.** i imagine the winners would be tertiary-sector / infotech companies that can effectively leverage operational synergies whose business models are based around intangible goods, or in general benefit more from economies of scale. heavy industry, and fixed capital-heavy 'immobile' industry loses out (i think). 

  * there's probably going to be some currency fuckery happening as well. if my gut sense is right, there'll probably be a trend of convergence over time as more people find areas for arbitrage and the market self-corrects.

  maybe this is too open-ended but there are creative people here who have very deep and domain-specific knowledge, what do you think would happen?

  for the vague areas i talked about, what do you think would work in a narrative sense?

  ***

  *the following isn't strictly necessary to read*

  this is really, really general question, so i'll narrow the search-space to things that would shape the narrative if it helps (i don't mind if it's relevant or not, though): in the fic, the main character (taylor hebert) lives on earth bet, in brockton bay (a hollowed-out, high-crime, post-industrial city in the north-west united states - at least, it was before the invention of steppers, i don't know how the city would change in response). 

  she works at a convenience store owned by her aunt that mainly now services people who step regularly. she gains a 'tinker' power focused on body self-modification using the creation of advanced interdimensional technology from mundane components (not the main focus here, i think i'll do a future thread), one invention she makes allows her to step at a supranormal rate - up to twenty times a second.

  she moonlights at a 'grey logistics' company (a kind of black market amazon, transporting anonymous [probably illegal] goods and data from A to B).

  eventually she falls on the wrong side of the law, has her arm twisted, and agrees to set off on an eastward voyage by airship (sponsored by both aleph and bet) with other parahumans. there are a multiplicity of interests behind the mission broadly is: symbolic force-projection, making diplomatic contact with inhabited worlds, cataloguing worlds and gathering knowledge before anyone else can, and finding trading opportunities. the original long earth got boring & i'm trying to create a more compelling narrative.

    I recommend that you read the worm fanfic called Amelia, it tackles some of the political issues with multiple dimensions. 

    I think that the safety against steppers are going to be somewhat silly. You essentially just hang a ton of transparent soft plastic pieces within any room you want to secure. Any material that is considered solid but is soft or bendy enough to only be a minor nuisance can be used. That said I do think that there'll be change to the justice system and I imagine that the death penalty or a continency measure will have to be implemented(i.e. a collar that inject something if it doesn't receive signal from a localized transmitter).

    The terrorism is fairly political so I'm spoilering it: >!Terrorism is a non-issue. According to ADL out of the 387 people that were killed by extremists in 2017 only 3% were Islamic, the rest were left or right wing extremists. And frankly when more people die of autoerotic asphyxiation, it's really not worth the attention it's getting and is an obvious votemilking by politicians and powergrap by government. !<

    The prompt says that people can only bring what they are carrying but your prompt about food and mineral prices seems to imply that people can bring across significant quantities in containers that aren't iron. Assuming that moving mass quantities isn't an issue I would expect that our world becomes much cleaner as we dump all our waste, including nuclear waste, unto other worlds. 

    Expect a plummet in people without work as companies will be looking to hire people to explore new dimensions/ harvest useful minerals. Expect the stock market to crash due to unexpectant loss of mass money, having ripple effects that may or may not be mitigated by new economy. Expect wars to happen as countries start fighting over territory.

    Have you read Ward, the Worm sequel? Interdimensional portals feature more heavily than in Worm.

    [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bkm1pn/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/emhx2i0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) and [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bgvpq8/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_and_writing_thread/elo9q2x?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) discuss very similar scenarios. In particular, how do steppers interact with moving reference frames? 

    Carrying cargo between dimensions is a job with extremely minimal requirements, and this job can't be automated. I think this would have a significant impact on unemployment and the minimum wage, and in turn on the crime rate and gang situation.

    Because of the economics of steppers, I think the Dockworker's Union will be ascendant in this situation by providing a population of vetted employees to use the steppers. Becoming a de facto stepper's union seems likely, too. How will this affect Danny, and his relationship with Taylor? He would have a better excuse for throwing himself into his work following Annette's death and he'd be able to achieve significant successes there. Perhaps this would increase his alienation with Taylor, hence her working with her aunt instead? 

    If it only takes a day for an ordinary person with a stepper to get from Bet to Aleph, that's a lot easier than most refugee journeys. Perhaps the main flows of people would be from Bet to Aleph rather than between different countries in Bet. 

    In terms of cape culture, steppers would have a big effect on the unwritten rules and the idea of cops and robbers. Having a fourth spatial direction to attack from makes defending even harder, so capes might come down harder on those who attack off-limits targets. This also means that breakouts from prisons would be easier, so perhaps captivity would fall out of favour as a punishment and be replaced by unmasking, tracking anklets, tattooing with details of the crime, and other penalties that can't be stepped away from.

    Steppers make it easy to escape a losing situation. Each step, you've got a 50% chance to lose your pursuer if you choose randomly between up and down. With sequences of steps, it becomes like the probability of two random walks intercepting. Containment foam would probably not have nearly the same prominence, or at least it would be used in conjunction with a method to disable steppers. 

    The PRT might add an additional rating specifically for stepping capabilities, or perhaps fold it in under Mover. Cape teams would have to keep in mind the need for countermeasures to stepping, such as members on the natural side of the stepping scale for pursuit, tools to disable the electronics or tag the opponents for subsequent tracking, or choosing locations where the environment on either side prevents stepping away.

    The Endbringers would likely lose some of their impact due to the existence of steppers causing the population to become more dispersed between different Earths, as well as people evacuating more easily with steppers during Endbringer fights. What about if the Endbringers exist on every dimension at once, so they'd be in the same place making the same motions on every world? That would make the fights unique, as steppers become much less relevant, as well as providing a clue to their incredible durability.

  What consequences do you imagine from the following prompt: Classical fantasy gameish world suddenly get 'invaded' by players from our world who consider their world to be a video game? Assume that players grow in power faster than natives, respawn if killed, and can log out.

  I imagine that the powers that be will realize that players should be catered to early to foster loyalty, that players make excellent scouts since they respawn and can log out to ask other players on gameboards about information. You can't punish players in the traditional sense since they respawn, so punishment largely consist of long term containment. I am uncertain whether we would see any significant numbers of players in armies, yes players are powerful but also unreliable. I also imagine that players would be willing to take quests for cheaper than usual because for many players it's less about the monetary reward and more about the XP/adventure.

  My predictions following that is that you see a rapid decrease for natives in jobs related to escort, gathering resources in high risk areas, killing entities. I imagine that you would see some decrease within the guard and a shift towards a bounty hunter system. Since players aren't that reliable you might also see adventuring guilds popping up to work as a central for players to find tasks. You would see a lot of secrets come to the surface due to offline sharing. You would see religious justifications to why players go back to life.

  As a result of that I imagine that you would see groupings of resentment towards players due to the loss of jobs. You would also see a decrease in monster/human population as players usually murder a ton of shit very quickly.
