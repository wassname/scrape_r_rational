  I mean... you'd get in trouble for animal cruelty, depending on where in the world you live.

  Why would you kill the birds instead of, I don't know, putting funny hats on them? That would go viral for sure, and you wouldn't have to worry about PETA sending a hit squad after you.

  Depends on where you are, what the bird is, who *you* are, and how the bird dies.

  If the sparrow lands in your hand and expires naturally, well, that's a weird coincidence.

  If you're personally snapping the neck of the Bald Eagle on National Park property while displaying your ID, then, yes.

  If you have a hunting permit, it's goose season, you're in a hunting-legal area, and you're calling geese to hand before shooting them with a legal gun for hunting, that's a legal but weird flex.
