  >Not having deadlines means a lot of burden removed from my shoulders. I think from an income/readership standpoint, it would probably be better to have a consistent release schedule, but I think it's worse for my enjoyment of writing, the quality of the work, and production speed. 

  I'm glad he's in a position that allows him to prioritize the quality of his art over the money he'd get by writing at a more consistent pace.

  For anyone who is upset with me for getting their hopes up at seeing a WtC post and finding out that it's not a chapter, I have good news!

  The word count [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing) says new chapters are being posted today! Patreons have already seen the chapters yesterday.

    I'm confused, are you extrapolating based on previous word counts, or saying that you have some sort of tool that detected alexanderwales posting a new chapter on Patreon?

    EDIT: Oh, I just read the FAQ, it's the second one. Nice!
