## What work of Rationalist Fiction would you most want to see made into a Netflix Miniseries?

### Post:

Every other sci fi related forum has asked a question like this (except usually involving movies). So, I'll ask it here, because I'm curious.  What work of Rationalist Fiction would you most want to see made into a Netflix Miniseries?

### Comments:

  A miniseries? Probably The Metropolitan Man. It is the right length for a miniseries and introduces a lot of really tough rational concepts. It's also a gritty super hero story which seems in vogue right now.

    To be honest, I dont think it would work outside of fanfiction. Like, its definitely a great fanfic, but one of the most significants part of the fic is the thoughts of the characters, which cant even be replaced with dialogue >!because of how the characters had to adapt to Superman's super hearing.!<

    Dialogue is also another problem >!for the same reason considering how at one point the majority of it is replaced by talking in foreing languages, using signals with their hands and writing things down.!<

    Together these would result in the series being both voice over heavy and with a lot of subtitles, neither of which is very popular.

    Some things >!like what happened to the Governors Children or Superman's murder of Falcone could also be received very badly,!< because it's not the kind of thing people easily accepts as being part of a Superman story.

    Edit:spoilers

      You should probably add in some spoiler tags.

      There would be a number of changes that you would probably want to make in the course of adaptation, some of which were considered during the course of writing *Metropolitan Man*.

      If there are rights issues, you can always go for an obvious Superman expy, a la *The Boys* or *Brightburn* -- there are so many Superman stand-ins that it's almost standard practice. When I was originally writing it, way back in the very first draft, it was an unoriginal Superman copy for a few chapters, but I figure if you're going to be writing a story that's talking about Superman, better to just talk about Superman unless someone is stopping you. (And you're right that Superman is a divisive figure in part because people have their own interpretations of the character, which makes a movie/show with a decidedly non-standard Superman a risk. Especially in the post-Snyder era.)

      As far as other potential edits, there are changes that you could make that would appease some people but (IMO) blunt the story somewhat. I tried drafts where Superman doesn't >!kill Falcone!< but instead >!stands by while the governor publicly murders him!< or >!essentially oversees Falcone get hanged by a lynch mob!<. I think those are both much weaker, and you'd probably have to weaken the rest of the plot as a consequence, but they're more in keeping with Superman's traditional character.

      There are also edits that you would *likely* have to do for content, but that's easy, because you can say everything with implication, having the actual reality of it off-screen or only communicated to the audience in how the characters react.

      ----

      In terms of showing thought, I actually think that's easier to do than a lot of people give credit for. Breaking Bad did it really well, with a general formula of silently showing setup, planning, and preparation that's divorced from the desired end result, leaving the end of the scene as the culmination of the plan which reveals what all the planning/thinking was about. This *generally* works, so long as the thoughts are resulting in an actionable plan, and I don't actually think that *Metropolitan Man* has that many moments of thinking that *don't* result in some plan or contingency going into action. Almost all of Lex discovering that lead blocks Superman's x-ray vision can be done without Luthor speaking or writing, as an example.

      I think more of the problem is with Lois, actually, since *her* thoughts don't often result in action. Lois being scared of being flown, or not wanting to hurt Superman's feelings, would have to be communicated almost entirely through acting, which is a hard thing to do while also being plausibly non-obvious to Superman himself.
      ```

      - u/sheikheddy:
        ```
        Music scores could be used for Lois, maybe? Making a tense, anxious atmosphere would definitely help give the intended impression.
        ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        As if series don't sometimes do stuff like break the fourth wall and talk their thoughts to the viewers. Like Daybreak for a recent example. The MC just starts talking to the camera.

        There is no problem with just talking the thoughts as long as it's clear that it's internal. Or voiceover the thoughts while the character looks like she is thinking.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Other workarounds for the speech issues could be used, like some sort of bunker or other macguffin. If the time period was moved up closer to present day, Lex could be actively tracking Supes and conversations could be implied to happen only when he was out of earshot - is his hearing range limited or was that only his vision?
      ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Yeah, my thoughts too. It'd be perfect. It's rationalist but it's not in an *intrusive* way, if you know what I mean - it just works as a great alternate viewpoint Superman story, which also happens to have rationalist themes, and a general ethical discussion about the implications of the sheer existence of overwhelming power, whoever wields it, that I think many people could find very relevant. On one hand, Luthor has a point, on the other, ironically, he doesn't realise how much he himself is causing harm with *his* equally disproportionate power to save the world from Superman's.

        Team Four Star, the guys doing Dragon Ball Z Abridged on YouTube. They're great - though they don't have a kid Goku voice because they started with Raditz.

            Anyway, this also reminds me that in the original Japanese Goku, Gohan and Goten are all voiced by Masako Nozawa, who definitely deserves kudos because if there's an image funnier than a voice actor screaming their lungs out in the recording room every time one of those three powers up, it's knowing that voice actor to be the most nice looking Japanese old lady ever.

    I would love that so much. In my opinion that fic is one of the few rational stories that would translate perfectly to video format because it has a well-paced mix of action, interpersonal drama and intrigue, and the plot doesn't rely on train-of-thought monologues to carry the important exposition.

  Worth The Candle.  

  It would be really hard to do, but it has so much Hollywood loves to do.  A zombie fighting opening as a "hook" for non-genre fans.  Those flashbacks that have been all the rage since "Lost".  An excuse to use attractive twenty-something actors playing High School kids.  Some parts of it could come off really spooky if well done in a visual medium.  I could see it as a David Lynch project.    
  And that whole "what is real?" thing that annoys me in written mediums seems to bother me less in movies.  

  I want to say "Mother of Learning" but that could come off very generic, and I'm not sure how redoing the same day shot in different ways would work on TV.
  ```

  - u/Mingablo:
    ```
    Yeah, I love MoL a lot but generally those types of sequences are taken care of in a montage, really quickly, because the repetition does make them boring. While reading we don't really "see" the scenery being the same every time in the book but I'd bet we'd get tired of it in the show. Also, the ticking clock aspect would be difficult to pull off. It didn't matter so much in the book but having the characters tell us where all the time skips were would get pretty (show don't tellish) old fast. 

    The most successful (i.e. only) movie or show I've seen with this premise is groundhog day and that's because it used comedy to make the repetition itself funny. 

    I didn't really like worth the candle because I got sick of the stat based litrpgs pretty quick. My housemate can't get enough of them though.

        There is nothing like *Worth The Candle.* It combines several elements that don't go together.  Wrestling with grief, hard magic systems, existential dread, discussion of Campbell's philosophy.  I can think of stories that do any one of them.   Which part appealed to you?  It would make it easier to come up with suggestions.

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    Worth The Candle has a really solid âmystery boxâ (the nature of Aerb and the DM), that presumably has a good answer (I assume alexanderwales has worked out something interesting).  A lot of mystery boxes ruin shows when the writers canât think of something worthwhile to put in them... (I think lost is an example of a letdown mystery box, although I havenât seen it myself.  For a more recent example, the new Star Wars trilogy suffers for not having an answer to Reyâs backstory planned out and foreshadowed ahead of time.)

    Worth the Candle also seems to be fairly extensible in its middle sections if the show runners want to pad out a season.  For instance a side quest or two could be added before the Name of the Beast plot gets kicked off while they are relaxing.  Or another side quest or two right before Raven shows up for the first time.  Or have the Dragon ask for an additional side quest in the most recent arc.

    Mother of Learning would be an amazing long form series but it needs to be planned start to finish and they need to commit to at least 3 seasons for it to not suck. It wouldn't fit a Miniseries in my opinion.

    ```
    > I want to say "Mother of Learning" but that could come off very generic, and I'm not sure how redoing the same day shot in different ways would work on TV.

    IMHO MoL would work, with some heavy reworking. It definitely should be cut down in size, removing a lot of the details of the training and magic. But a TV show about a time-looping wizard fighting a vaster conspiracy? I think that stuff would work. You just pick and choose the scenes to adapt and suddenly it becomes a lot denser and thrilling, with a cliffhanger almost every episode. Sure, the setting may appear a bit generic, but more to experienced fantasy purveyors than the general TV audience, and anyway that'd just be a way to get you quickly into the setting so you can focus on the story itself.
    ```

    - u/EdLincoln6:
      ```
      >. It definitely should be cut down in size, removing a lot of the details of the training and magic.

      I feel what makes Mother of Learning great is the execution more then the idea...and thar could easily be lost.    


      If Holywood wasn't faithful to the book it could esily turn into cheesy cut-rate Harry Potter.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        You need to keep up the spirit, but a lot of MoL feels like... the literary equivalent of grind, I guess. I get why it makes sense but you could try to cut it to the essential stuff that better translates to the screen, for example

        >!obviously Zorian's mind mage training is essential and you need to get a feel for how it works, and that's also easily a fun thing to show thanks to him having entertaining teachers like Enthusiastic Seeker of Novelty and Xvim. However I think the stuff that would be really interesting to convey and wouldn't feel boring even to a more general public IMHO are the high concepts about slowing down time, the loop and its meaning and purpose, the dilemma of Zorian killing his old self by inhabiting his body, all that stuff. And of course his personal progress as a functioning human, his fucked up family life, and so on. There's plenty to keep from the novel while adapting it so that it isn't for 90% mages sitting around in a lab talking magic.!<

      A bit of an overestimate. What's written of *A Song of Ice and Fire* is a little longer than Worm, but they hit the end of book content by season 6. Also, a lot of Worm's filler comes from fight scenes, which are faster in motion than on paper. (Assuming this isn't Dragon Ball)

    I could actually see stuff like that really happening. Mother of Learning too. I mean, in Japan many web novels have gotten turned into light novels and then anime in the space of a few years. It's not without precedent, they're original works, acquiring the rights would probably be pretty cheap, and both superheroes and fantasy are hot genres right now in TV and movies.

        I *do* agree that a Worm series could become the next Big Thing, but not before Wildbow manages to get Worm traditionally published -- which, by the way, anyone's got any idea of how's that coming along? -- Unless some big executive is secretly a fan I don't think it will be given that much of a chance by studios if it remains only a webnovel. Both because of how big in lengh and production it would have to be and also because a webnovel is more likely to be dismissed than a traditionally published one.

- u/None:

  I'm really not sure how to do that stuff well on TV. A *big* draw of rationalist stuff for me is seeing the main character lay out their thought process, how they arrive at their conclusions and decisions. On TV, that'd have to be done by voiceover, and to such an extent it'd get obnoxious.

  But then again I'm a grouch who barely watches any movies, so maybe that's different for most people.

    ```
    > On TV, that'd have to be done by voiceover, and to such an extent it'd get obnoxious.

    Ah.  Here we get to one of the issues about what you want out of rationalist fiction.  Do you want a character quietly being reasonable, the absence of moments when you want to throw stuff at the TV?  Or do you want a character loudly being logical and rational?  I tend to go for the former myself.  I've encountered to many characters talking a good game and then acting like idiots.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I think without the explanations it wouldn't be *rationalist*, it'd just be *rational*. If I understand the definitions used in this subreddit correctly, the defining characteristic of the former is that it attempts to teach the reader rationalism through the story.
      ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Quietly reasonable requires the audience to understand and to an extent to agree with the main character's goals.  This requires lots of exposition, to the point that the usual more subtle techniques of exposition delivery will fail. Books have better means of exposition delivery available so you can get away with more.
      ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      I think "show, don't tell" definitely should always be the way to go, and if anything, all adaptations from page to visual media tend to ditch a lot of internal monologue and replace it with subtler cues. If it's really necessary, you can always make it so the protagonist has someone else to bounce their ideas off, so their thinking process doesn't seem completely obscure. That's what adaptations do.

    I ~~might be~~ probably am in the minority, but I really wouldn't mind watching a film or series that was heavy on the thought-process voiceovers.

    A lot of thought can be presented visually, anyway, e.g. the character is thinking "if I do X then I would fail because Y" the film could show us that scene as the character imagines it--it doesn't just have to just show us the character sitting in a chair the whole time.

      "Show don't tell" is how the really good writers do it...but I've seen so many mediocre writers try it and fail, leaving us with no idea what is going on.  I'm willing to put up with infodumps and voiceovers if it is the price for an original setting.  Voiceovers worked fine with Dexter and The Wonder Years.

    Well, good news!  I have zero pull with Netflix.  :-)  


    It used to be all adaptations were terrible.  Lately things have changed...streaming services and HBO will occasionally do an adaptation that is actually good for "street cred".  A Geek Street Cred project is the only way a good adaption of these things could happen.    


    As far as the community getting too big..., yes, at some point a community gets too big.  We are a long way from that.  Do we really think a Metropolitan Man TV series on Netflix would draw in enough people to make this group too big?
