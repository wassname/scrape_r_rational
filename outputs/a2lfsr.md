  As above, so below? I'M READY.

    ```
    Was my immediate thought as I read that title as well, some of my favorites smack down moments in fantasy have been accompanied by those words, I hope to see it again. I'm saving up chapters to read them at the end of this arc, checking in here to see if things are ready, this arc seems pretty great by the comments

  I think this is the first main "pivot" for setting up the Wandering Bard as the Big Bad against Cat for the final book. Correct me if I'm wrong, but today's chapter might be the current most biggest narrative event where Cat is vocally rejecting the Gods Below, with Cat already rejecting the Gods Above.

  With how things are going, I'm guessing the next book will focus a bit more on Cat rejecting the Gods, slowly putting her head-to-head against the Bard and making her allies with Hierarch and Bellorephon, Shining Jewel of Democracy. I also think that Black's death will be the final nail that hammers Cat's conviction against the Gods, but it's just speculation.
  ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  By "father", does Cat mean Black, or does she actually mean her biological father?
  ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    Black. She's been calling him her father for a book or two now.

    Even after stabbing him.
    ```

    - u/Mountebank:
      ```
      I'm sure Cat cares for Black and all, but I wonder if her starting to outright call him "father" is another subconscious move on her part to influence the narrative.
      ```

    - u/swaskowi:
      ```
      That makes the most sense of all explanations but calling Black less then he could be is a very odd description. Black is the perfect embodiment of whatever he is at the moment, he could be something else I suppose but he is very much what he has chosen to be. Normally "less then they could be" implies some failing of character or will.
      ```

      - u/CaseyAshford:
        ```
        I would say that "less than he could be" refers to the fact that Black decided to accept the Sovereignty of the Malicia and the Tower which consequently prevented him from making truly meaningful changes in Praesi.
        ```

        - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
          ```
          I thought she was referring to the way he has carried his crusade out against Good, instead of flipping the game board and telling all the gods to go fuck themselves like she's trying to do.
          ```

- u/FeO_Chevalier:
  ```
  If Cat’s not going to use Winter mojo to keep the drow in line, how is she possibly going to bring them to Callow without it resulting in a bloodbath?  I can understand disliking the drow pseudo-enslavement due to its potential to backfire narratively, but it’s not like she has a lot of options or like the alternatives are any better morally.  She can let the dwarves slaughter them, but that’s not really an improvement for the drow.
  ```

  - u/kmucha31:
    ```
    Maybe she relents and lets Akua take over the mantle of Queen of Moonless Nights, thus transferring all the oaths to her. Though that seems unlikely when she was so adamant she wasn’t going to give Akua more power. Then again, all the interrogation she did against Akua and made her forget might have convinced Cat it is a safe(r) play.
    ```

    - u/Thebes165:
      ```
      There is no mantle anymore, since Winter has been nearly eaten whole by Night. Catherine even remarked Winter as an independent entity was dead.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Its quite possible that she just loses at the end of this book.

    No drow, no Winter, no Wild Hunt, not even a Name. Archer and her high tail it back to Callow without even Winter.
    ```

- u/swaskowi:
  ```
  The fact that Cat tries sooooooo hard to commit to cooperating here (despite having it backfire on her) makes me wonder if her not knuckling under to Cordelia was more Winter mediated than I thought at the time.

  I'm really curious to see Masego or Grey Pilgrim take a look at her soul. Cat being more "Cat" now implies that whatever metaphysical damage the Winter construct did seems to be revertible back to her "core" self (also ignoring the fact that her soul was rent by Sve Noc).
  ```

  - u/zehguga:
    ```
    Actually, she tried super hard to get Cordelia to a deal. Hasenbach was the one who wouldn't bend an inch.
    ```

- u/RUGDelverOP:
  ```
  I was doing some rereading, and came across this:

  >As for the last trick, well, it had very specific requirements. I wasn’t surprised it hadn’t gotten me out, though I’d need to have Hierophant take a look at the overlay as soon as possible. We were pretty sure it wouldn’t kill me if it triggered by accident, but there were always risks in turning yourself into living munitions.

  Sve Noc has Cat's body, which is still (mostly) living munitions, right? Be a shame if there was some goblinfire.
