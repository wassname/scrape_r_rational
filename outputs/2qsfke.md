  I am going to be doing [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/2qrex5/fanfic_tuesday_fanfics_week_0/), which means this fic will be updating every Tuesday, and it will probably be updating there, not here. As such, I consider this the last week for pandering requests. If you want Korra to get a pet bunny that shoots lasers out of its tail, now's the time to say!

  Try to solve the definitely rational plot ahead of time, guys. Who blew up the hospital? When will Korra figure out who her party is? When is Zolt going to totally kill Mako like he is gonna? And when will we be seeing some Korrasami lezphysics action dammit.

  OH AND THE SHOW'S OVER CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW IT WAS [Spoilers](#s "SHIT")

    Can't disagree. See /r/TrueAnime's [thread about the ending](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAnime/comments/2q6a58/tuesday_nonanime_discussion_thread_1223/cn3chxj) (not that it's actually an anime, but nevermind).

      Meh, I liked it. I think that a lot of what people have a problem with is the romance stuff, which seems like a stupid thing to focus on, especially given how much of it is subtext, and how unimportant it was compared to the three or four plots in play.

        As an ace bra I find the virtual war over shipping baffling (I think they say the three things not to discuss over dinner are politics, religion, and shipping), but I don't really care who the characters end up with. Everything else sucked too (and I wanna bitch about it).

      Even after searching, I see no threads on the ending. Link?

      I've been reading [this](http://ikkinthekitsune.tumblr.com/) for some counterpoint to the insanity that's been happening on tumblr. (Why do people even use tumblr anymore? It's only good for madness and pornography.)

        The key words are *madness and pornography*.

  That said, it's a bit... ham-handed? or perhaps cheesy that you reference the Sequences by name. Not that I am complaining, it works form an in-world perspective, just not from a meta-textual perspective.

    Y-You know, the ancient mystical airbending sequences....

      ```
      Yeah xD It is kind of funny, just startled me a little.

      And making airbending into rationality is surprisingly smooth and convincing. Like, really, really convincing. It's almost disturbing.

      I laughed. Loudly.

  What happened to this fic? Remembered its existence yesterday, decided to check for updates today, and now it doesn't seem to exist on ff.net....

    Author wiped it since he's "done writing fanfiction" and doesn't want to leave his half-finished work up. You can read it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/wiki/other/focxxu?v=4c1f644a-b64e-11e4-934a-22000b680f3d) if you want, but it's maximally dead.
