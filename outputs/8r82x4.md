  I find the contrast here between political narrative and Story here really interesting, especially with Cat's ability with them. A prince pinions her pretty effectively by leveraging his understanding of the *political* narrative, and she takes the hit without contesting it much. But as soon as the Pilgrim speaks, she goes full-on analysis mode, swimming through the shapes of stories easily.

  I wonder, is this the influence of Winter on her or just her natural knacks and experience?

  Also, what the fuck, Cat. Biting of your goddamn tongue. Think about what that looks like. You have to stick your tongue out into the space behind your lips and *bite*. There's no way to make that subtle, in a diplomatic situation where everyone's watching carefully. She was pretty clearly aware on some level what kind of intimidation factor that had - exploited it, even - but she barely even noticed it in her thoughts. Just sort of... *did it*. Never change, Cat. Your attempt to be less cheeky and shocking by biting off your tongue was probably the cheekiest, most shocking thing you could have done, and leveraging it to your advatage came so easily you didn't even think about it.

  I love the idea of her making that last pronouncement with lips and teeth still stained red with her own blood.

    I think its her natural talent at storytelling. She was twisting narratives and slipping into gaps her opponents left her well before she ever met a Winter Fae.
    ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      Moreso it's very very unseelie/winter thing to do: casual body horror combined with a polite, malicious approach and everything focus on the bargain or her alien (to the heroes) goals.

    Part of it is that she's in a better position on the political side than the Story. She can win the slow logistics game even if the agreement isnt great, but if there's a Pivot during the negotiations she's stuck with it
    ```

  - u/BlackKnightG93M:
    ```
    You can see she was Black's apprentice. The Carrion Lord is infamous for being so not-smug it loops around to being smugness par excellence.
    ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  Let's look at the potential impacts of this...

  * Malicia is definitely going to find out about this, but the question is whether being it's a signatory constitutes rebellion or whether the intention itself can be interpreted as such... Both Cat and Malicia have *some* room to maneuver at least, so that's probably fine, but definitely puts Malicia in an advantageous position with regards to Catherine. She can't really do much with it at the moment (Thanks Ashur!) but it will definitely come into play in their next scrying and Cat will have to be very careful treading these waters.
  * Black and Malicia's current relationship is also similar to Cat and Malicia, which means he will eventually be an independent power in Calernia (assuming he survives the battle of the Vales). Cat's action here might give him precedent to do something similar with the Papenheim, but that's going to be difficult to pull off. Black views things practically so he probably would only see the joining of the alliance as a textbook "villain infiltrates heroes to gain advantage, maybe betray them later" move by Cat. He would approve.
  * Tyrant would definitely not approve. He might even end friendship with Catherine and go for a new friendship with Black or Malicia. (Edit: Everyone missed my attempt at the "friendship broken" meme, FeelsBadMan).
  * Hasenbach's position has just come under a powerful attack by that single line from Catherine. She will definitely have to reconsider a *lot* of things about Catherine, decide whether she can even enter the alliance, and deal with the consequences of either decision. Both of which seem quite bad for her. Declining the request here and now rejects a potential villanous redemption arc and that would horribly weaken their side narratively. But allowing her in her Alliance also means acknowledging Callow as an independent entity and all the political bullshit that comes from it. Her life just got a lot harder.
  * Army of Callow... she has their trust for now, but that will definitely see some shaking in the coming chapters. I'm guessing this is where the story will focus on, the loyalties of Cat's minions to her and the impact of this decision on it.

  All in all that was a **bold** move by Cat. Can't wait to see how this plays out!
  ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    It works well in the Story as well, because if they refuse to let her into the alliance it reinforces the narrative she's built up by repeatedly offering peace, only to be rebuffed. Which firmly puts the invaders into bad guys territory. So it might be even better for her if they refuse to let her in
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Good point. "The good guys magnanimously let in a supposedly reformed villain who later betrays them" is a Story, and "The good guys magnanimously let in an actually reformed villain who becomes a steadfast ally" is a Story. But I've very rarely seen a story where the good guys outright reject a villain's offer to join their side, and when they do it's usually a mistake.
      ```

      - u/akaltyn:
        ```
        Indeed. And the latter allows her to shift it to "invading army claims to be doing it for noble reasons but reveals their hypocrisy and real motives by refusing a reasonable compromsie "
        ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    I could totally see Cat stonefacedly saying she's a member of the alliance, and also in a separate relationship with Praes. She could probably dig up some precedent with individual principalities, or cities in the league, making their own side deals
    ```

    - u/BlackKnightG93M:
      ```
      Malicia's reason for keeping the Gestalt was to have a means of getting to that negotiating table since Procer will never deal with Evil otherwise. Cat's background puts her in a perfect position to try to work a lasting peace between to forces of Good and Evil. Before Callow was merely the stage for the East and West to kill each other. Now, Callow may yet be the stage where Good and Evil finally settle their differences and seek a condition where they can prosper together. 

      ... Psssshthahahaha, yeah like that would ever happen. The agents above and below demand blood and the grooves are too well worn into Creation. Still, narratively speaking, it would be a very nice ending to Cat's story if she could broker peace between the Principate and Praes.
      ```

  - u/ahd1903:
    ```
    Depends. If the tenth crusade ends early, and the eleventh crusade is declared against the Dead King, then Callow and Praes might be inducted into the Grand Alliance on the Vader principle.
    ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    I feel that the Army of Callow's loyalty to its warleader is not to be underestimate. 

    She has lead them through hell and come out victorious, time and time again.

    She is the final great hope for Callowan independence.

    She, as the inheritor of Black's legacy, has orcs in important positions of power within the (often victorious) warband, and within her inner circle.

    She has allowed the goblins to settle in Callow, and is close with several. 

    You've got something for every party in there, and enemies of Cat within the army will have to keep their heads so far down they come out the other side.
    ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      It's more the "joining with the enemies who have killed our brothers" that I'm concerned about. The army has lost a lot, and their Queen is talking about eventually joining the alliance that has invaded their country? I'm pretty sure there will be some voices that express dissent and want to tear up the crusaders.
      ```

      - u/Dent7777:
        ```
        I think it would be a serious concern, if Cat gone any farther than signaling her intention of join the alliance.

        She's not joining the crusade and marching against Praes. She's not even joining the alliance with any sort of alacrity.

        Cat has a full year to go back, or to spin this choice to her people. We don't know what she intends to make public. 

        What exactly is going to motivate an assassin?

        Edit: I think you'll see dissent, and perhaps plenty of it. But if you look at what her actions will be doing, especially in the short term?

        She beat the invaders down, with a numerical disadvantage. She defeated a crusading army, and forced them to leave without a speck of Callowan land.

        Who exactly is complaining? The Army knows how badly it would have gone, to keep fighting.
        ```

        - u/cyberdsaiyan:
          ```
          No one yet, because we've just seen her say it, but the regals in Callow will definitely see this as an opportunity to expand their influence. Also remember that a mob of soldiers aren't really the most rational people during war. Orcs especially are unpredictable and I'm curious to see what they make of this.
          ```

          - u/Dent7777:
            ```
            The thing is, it isn't just a mob of soldiers. It's an experience army of veteran officers and blooded soldiers.

            Even if the lowest ranks didn't know the precarious situation they were in, the officers certainly did.

            The orcs are well represented in the command structure, and above all their culture recognize skill and savagery. Cat has shown herself to be skilled, savage, and wise.

            Cat has the One Virtue in spades. She is the inheritor of Black, and his orcish legacy. She has a group of loyal and competent named.

            Her threat in the coming chapters will not be internal.
            ```

            - u/cyberdsaiyan:
              ```
              You make a solid point. I'm hoping it's true, but I'm also kinda interested in seeing what her dissenters (if any) think.
              ```

              - u/Dent7777:
                ```
                As am I. I think you're going to see some objections, especially from Praesi sections of the officer core.

                The loyalty of an army to its leader, especially an undefeated leader, is not to be underestimated.

                I think you will see a group of Praesi object, but not with hatred or vitriol. I do wonder if we will see a lone wolf assassination attempt, and who it would be from.
                ```

                - u/cyberdsaiyan:
                  ```
                  Hune might be a dissenter considering her setup. Or she might be supportive if it leads to eventual peace. The others I think will be generally supportive. They will *definitely* ask her what she intends to do though.
                  ```

                  - u/Dent7777:
                    ```
                    I think Hune will voice dissent if it is about the Army more generally. 

                    The classic Hune objection is over the great loss of life and leaving the mortals to face down the heroes alone. The rate of attrition frankly has been unacceptable. 

                    What makes me think that any immediate objection won't be coming from Hune is the fact that Cat went out of her way to sue for peace, when from the outside it may have seemed easier for Cat to press her advantage.

                    Might even win some points with Hune for it (fat chance).

                    Sooner or later though, the Praesi loyalists (to what extent anyone is loyal to the tower system) will need to come to terms with the fact that they serve a Callowan.
                    ```

      - u/serge_cell:
        ```
        Orc's brothers are his clan. And legioner's clan is their legion. Cat's orcs  swear fealty to her as their Warlord. If Warlord turn on on other orc clans it's nothing  new, normal interclan warfare.

    > Tyrant would definitely not approve. He might even end friendship with Catherine and go for a new friendship with Black or Malicia.

    On the countrary, Tyrant love twist on the stories and cat being good just give him another person to betray, thing he would probably do anyways.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    > Tyrant would definitely not approve. He might even end friendship with Catherine and go for a new friendship with Black or Malicia.

    Disagree, Tyrant acts mad to pursue long term unknown goals. Also, he loves wrecking shit(which may be is actual long term goal, similalr to Cat that way). Cat loves wrecking shit too and this statement was a giant wrecking ball. I don't doubt he'll mock cry about the betrayal, but he at least recognizes Cat as a player of the game of the highest order.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    I think Tyrant will absolutely love this move if Cat spins it (in strict confindence, of course) as deliberately throwing sharpers on the fire just to see what happens. That's his entire motivational structure, after all.
    ```

- u/18scsc:
  ```
  Cat is pulling a godzilia. An unstoppable rampaging monster who we are kinda okay with cause it fucks up worse monsters.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Hopefully if she can get a foot in the door that way, she can gradually transition into a more stable position. Like "redeemed former villain, now a trusted ally of the good guys, whom they recognize as a legitimate ruler and are no longer trying to murder on principle." Pull a Zuko, Cat.

    I bet she could even get the Heavens to look past the whole "Winter abomination" thing. She'd just have to deliver a lot of tragic monologues about how her past recklessness cost her her humanity, she regrets it but she knows she brought it on herself, all she can do now is try her best to protect her friends and the people of Callow, etc. Boom, now it's a cool antihero backstory instead of a blight on Creation.
    ```

    - u/BlackKnightG93M:
      ```
      The Angels would demand penitence and redress in the form of servitude or something similar should she want what you said to be more than a farce. Remember she did mug an Angel and did claim one of their own (The Stalwart Paladin). Sins the Angels would be inclined to forgive if she would make appropriate redress. Given her nature we can be assured that is not going to happen. 

      There are no antiheroes in Calernia. The closest approximation to an anti-hero is a Neutral Name like Ranger for example. So no, either she becomes completely good, in which case she'd need to swear to a choir or she becomes a neutral entity.
      ```

      - u/serge_cell:
        ```
        So Cat could be first(?) hero who are mandated by Above without Angels mediation. Or mandated by both Above and Below.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Hmm that kind of narrative would probably have her lose the mantle. She needs that power if she's going to stay "Practical" and not beholden to the Gods Above.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        Nah, antiheroes don't lose their tragic backstory thing. That would be like Zuko getting his scar healed, or Batman's parents coming back to life.
        ```

- u/Yes_This_Is_God:

  Oh ok so the sequel to Practical Guide to Evil is Practical Guide to Good.

  At least there’s alliteration this time.

    Practical Good. . . isn't that enlightened self-interest, or ethical greed?

    I have Always said that for cat to be able to do evil right she would need to be able to dabble on both sides, Good and Evil, and with this she may be able to use what she needs from both sides when she needs it.

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  > If he was spying on the leaders of the northern crusade, that was a possible angle for Thief to exploit. Turning him seemed unlikely, but if his spying apparatus could be infiltrated… Something to discuss with her later. I made a note to have Vivienne dig deeper into the man, as there was apparently more to him than his reputation.

  We know from Pilgrim's interlude that Arnaud is a sociopath. I don't know if that would make him less likely to be fazed by the intervention of a Named, but given that Rozala knew *something* disturbing enough about him, the investigation may well bring (or tie up) a minor plot thread.

  > We also knew, from Masego, that they were at least a decade behind Praesi spell formulas when it came to that, which meant they couldn’t do relays and their range was limited: they could chain the reports manually, but that was tricky business. 

  Didn't Klaus mention in the very first Interlude of this book that at least the mages sent with the Ashuran fleet were there as relays? That's a foreshadowing of Catherine trying to capitalize on the delay and getting blindsided if I ever saw one.

  > I had beaten her, or at least she believed as much. According to the sack full of razor blades that was Praesi philosophy, that meant she was my follower now.

  That, and I suspect some of Catherine's personality might have bled over from using Winter, given how it was described. I mean, just compare the tone of something like [interlude Crescendo](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/villainous-interlude-crescendo/) and [Kaleidoscope VI](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/kaleidoscope-vi/): the shift isn't from just Akua *playing* a more herosic role, or from being in a less powerful position, but also from a different perspective on using her power as simply a means to a broader end rather than part of the plan. Well, and from more self-awareness too.
  ```

    ```
    Would you say that Prince Arnaud's emotions are... Absent?

  That was unexpected. All but garuntees the ‘Five Heroes’ thing Saint and Pilgrim were talking about contains Cat and Masego, I think.

    ```
    I really don't think so.
    ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    I doubt you can be part of two five Named bands, though I still think it would be a sharper twist for a redeemed Diabolist to join it, especially since the heroes didn't swear not to use devils.
    ```

    - u/ianstlawrence:
      ```
      What would be really interesting, and I don't know if the text contradicts it, because i don't remember the exact wording of what Pilgrim said, but what if the 5 heroes was the Woe? This is more of a fun thought experiment than something really serious though, but that would be quite a sweet twist. : D
      ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  Which chapter has talked about Cordelia's Grand Alliance before? Because depending on the terms of its establishment, joining it doesn't necessarily mean renouncing Evil or even turning traitor against Praes. Helike is an alliance of city-states of varying alignments, right? So joining together doesn't mean everyone has to be on the same Side.
  ```

- u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
  ```
  Isn't this whole thing still foredoomed to end in the Princes' Graveyard? I'm calling it that by doing this she bends the Named into an impossible position and Pilgrim sacrifices himself by breaking truce, to prevent either becoming her mentor or some worse fate. She ends up killing the lot of them, but has to make good on the follow-through with the Grand Alliance and somehow ends up in the group of five with Saint. Buddy-cop tale of the year!
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It’s more likely that this is the Battle of the Camps mentioned before the Prince’s Graveyard in the same quote. Would mean that there have been either three battles or two.

      - u/None:
        ```
        The camps are still there. Until the two armies separate the battle isn't over yet. But if you meant the crusade overall then yes that will probably end in the Prince's Graveyard.
        ```

- u/ForgottenToupee:
  ```
  Do Wrong... Right?
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  ...

  WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

  There's no way she can pull that off without antagonizing Black, the remaining Calamities, Aisha, Juniper, and a good portion the Praesi and Greenskins in her army.

  I mean, sure, if she joins a crusade with overwhelming numbers she can beat them all, but that's a lot of friends and former allies she's going to slaughter.
  ```

  - u/soonnananadnaanssoon:
    ```
    To add on to that, Cat didn't mention breaking off from the Tower nor agreeing to attack Praes. She's implying that Callow wants to join the Grand Alliance against Evil. 

    My guess? There's one more Evil north of Procer, the Dead Kingdom. Cat is going turn the Alliance's force towards the Dead Kingdom instead of Callow & Praes. This brings the battlefield away from Callow to Procer, keeps the ties between Callow & Praes, breaks the story of Praes being Evil (and hence Black's motivation) and adds to the reason for the Dead King's awakening at the end of Book 3.
    ```

      It could end up like the league of Free Cities where there are both Good and Evil nations operating together

    ```
    Or not. Right now, it's a narrative that leads straight to backstabbing former friends, though she can seize that to topple the Tower, sit on the throne and say "Look, I'm the Dread Empress now". Her Praesi allies would applaude at how beautiful it would be, but I doubt that's the plan.

    Of course, if it were to turn out that a certain Dead King is getting involved in the crusade at the invitation of Malicia, well, Catherine has all the excuses she needs to frame her move as "Lesser Evil cooperates with Good to stop Greater Evil gone batshine bonkers". Which is her preferred narrative from the very start.
    ```

  - u/notagiantdolphin:
    ```
    She's got two options here. The first is that she's rebuffed. Good narrative. Queen tries to be good, good guys sneer and send her off. Not part of 'their' crowd but she tried. Sticks to her own kingdom, her own people. The Queen in Callow rules her people and doesn't take sides. She's 'good' or at least 'neutral' which should fool the Hashmallim. Probably the best she can hope for unless she's got Ranger hiding in a pocket to crash the negotiations.

    Second is that she does join, and god only knows where that leads.
    ```

- u/imyourfoot:
  ```
  Sort of a random question, but was it ever explained what lead Black to choose Cat as his Squire?  

  I would say her two biggest strengths are her ability to work with Stories (as demonstrated in this chapter and elsewhere) and her charisma, but I have trouble thinking of any cases where she demonstrated those traits before Black chose her.  I know Black had her (among many others) under observation, but she was pretty much a loner at the orphanage and I don't know what she would have done that would indicate Story adeptness to Black.
  ```

  - u/Sarkavonsy:
    ```
    I think it was just him caputalizing on a narratively obvious opportunity. He needs to break Callow and Praes's stories, and tie them together in a way that will outlast him. What better way to at least start down that path than to train a villain born in Callow, with ties to both nations?

    In hindsight it all looks like he planned her rise to power, and at least by book 2 it seems like that was his long-term design, but i think early on it was just him seizing a fateful opportunity.

    ...in fact, i wonder if the Gods Below *arranged* for Black to show up in that alleyway? Hmm...
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      There was an extra benefit in choosing an ambitious orphan of the conquest for this role. Cat's backstory basically set her up for a heroic Name. By choosing her as his successor, Black got the Callowan villain he needed while simultaneously depriving the Gods Above of a potential tool.
      ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Here's the assessment from,[book two chapter 44](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/11/16/chapter-44-victory/):

    > *“Does not show traditional heroic talent for forging strong friendships but considered a leader by her peers. Responds aggressively to threats. Displays continued recklessness and an aptitude for thinking on her feet. This agent recommends disposal before she can turn into a legitimate threat to the peace of the realm.”*
    > – Report ‘for the eyes of Lord Black only’, concerning the Imperial ward Catherine Foundling

    I'd say it's a combination of natural charisma and a heroic potential, coupled with the fact that Black needed a Callowan to be promoted in the imperial hierarchy for his plans to work.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      > Does not show traditional heroic talent for forging strong friendships

      Guess that one was latent.
      ```

      - u/AntiChri5:
        ```
        She just needed the right *kind* of friends.
        ```

  - u/DarkArchon_:
    ```
    `“I chose you,” he mused, “because I remember what it’s like, that feeling in your stomach when you look at the world around you and you know you could do better. That if you had the authority and the power, you wouldn’t make the mistakes you see the people who have it make.”`

    \- Black, way back in chapter 10.

    He saw in her the same drive to change things that he has. It's been said a couple times I think that she is a cross between Black and Ranger. The same motivation without the cold calculating outlook
    ```

  - u/ianstlawrence:
    ```
    Also very important to note that Cat was saving up for the express purpose of joining the Legionnaires. Meaning she had already accepted the idea of working with Praes, to a certain extent. When you add in the Orphan thing, and the specific situation in that city, which Black said would have given rise to a hero, well, his plan with Cat not only created the answer to a short term problem (in case the long term didn't work out) but helped to create conditions that would solve one long term problem, a hero rising due to the narrative function of an orphan in Callow stops an oppressive and evil dictator (despite the details of Black being so heavily involved.
