## A movie idea about a rationalist alien species encountering earth from signals.

### Post:

The nearest Goldilocks planet to us is inhabited. They have a rational society, sadly, it's a planet of the apes fallacy, because we need humans to be the actors. (Unless you've another idea, perhaps a Jim Hensen's Dark Crystal idea)

And the movie is about their society discussing a transmission they received from Earth, with a message of peace, and all the normal information that we send.

They go about their ordinary lives, as a Type 1 civilisation, and every level of their society is discussing the possibility of talking with us, the first sapient species they've heard from. Before the movie started, they sent out a ship with a few scientists, politicians, doctors and engineers to make contact.

All throughout the movie various people at the street/shopping/working levels of their society, are talking about the exciting opportunities. There are even a few dirty minded people talking about interspecies sex. (for the laughs)  

When their ship lands, we've destroyed ourselves.  

It's kind of a sad ending, but after all of that build up, and everyone expecting an epic first contact...  
I thought that's how it should go. No more humanity to greet. Just a beacon at what used to be a combined NASA/ESA outpost to turn off.

Maybe, on the moon.

*Fades to black*

Guy in the outpost - "You sure we should just turn it off? What if other civilisations need to see this? What if some of them left, and come back?"

Girl in their ship - "No. You saw that. No-one escaped."

Guy in the outpost - "But to just turn it off, to end them. It seems cold"

Girl in their ship - "You saw the signal, the vast majority of them had death rituals. They appreciated closure, let's give it to them."

Guy in the outpost - "Okay, but, I uh saw a poem in their signal. It was beautiful, and it seemed apt."

Girl in their ship - "Good man."

Guy in the outpost - "Goodnight room  
Goodnight moon   
Goodnight cow jumping over the moon   
Goodnight light   
And the red balloon   

Goodnight bears   
Goodnight chairs   
Goodnight kittens   
And goodnight mittens   

Goodnight clocks   
And goodnight socks   
Goodnight little house   
And goodnight mouse   

Goodnight comb   
And goodnight brush   
Goodnight nobody   
Goodnight mush   
And goodnight to the old lady whispering "hush."   

Goodnight stars   
Goodnight air   
Goodnight noises everywhere. "

*Credits roll silently*

The movie wouldn't go into what humanity did or didn't do. The aliens would just arrive right near the end of the movie to see that we were gone, and check, conclusively, that we were indeed gone. But I got the idea from in part from HJPEV's idea that a true wizarding war would be an extinction event, and while it wouldn't be discussed in the film (because how would these planet of the apes fallacy aliens know?) what does wipe out humanity in the end, is a Quirrellmort/HJPEV war (HPMOR) where, for whatever reason, Harry wasn't holding back.

The other seed of the idea came when I was thinking about what the starscape of that nearest habitable planet would look like compared to ours. Would it share most of the same features, only, with some small differences? Then I wanted to explore that planet. I also like imagining a pan narrans civilisation that favours rationality over the stories we tell ourselves to be less afraid of the monsters in the dark. 

Then the idea was "What would earth and human civilisation look like to outsiders, to rationalists  from beyond?" Even if they come from a story telling society as well. 

And that's the story (fan fic) I wanted to tell.

What do you think the society should look like?

  If you want to think about how the aliens' civilization might work, it could be worth it to look at EY's April's Fools post.

  First of all, why do we need humans to be the actors?

  Second, how is this a fanfic?  Sounds like an original to me.

  Third, you've posted the entire story -- why not just have written it instead?  It will depend on the surprise ending for its punch, and you've ruined that, at least as far as the readers on this subreddit are concerned.  You should change your title to include a [SPOILERS] tag.
