## There is Nothing to Fear (Harry Potter AU - Gryffindor!Voldemort)

### Post:

I'm posting this again because I've finished the "oneshots and occasional multishots" phase of this series. 

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

This is mostly a For Want of a Nail-type story, with everything proceeding as expected up until the Sorting Hat is put on Tom Riddle's head and makes an observation, and an argument, that it hadn't made in canon.

Future updates will be biweekly from here on out: First, an interlude, and then the first chapter of a 15-20 chapter story. 

The series can be found on Archive of Our Own [here](https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368), on Sufficient Velocity [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.49249/), and on Spacebattles [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/). If you're interested in conversation beyond the subreddit, then there's more of that on SB than SV.

  I can wholeheartedly recommend this work. It's something I've enjoyed enough to do a reread of everything out so far, which I very rarely do with how much stuff I have on my "things to read" list. My only points of concern I could bring up would that the shift into a focus on Harry and away from Tom could have issues, there haven't been any pre-teen characters interacting with kids their age yet that dialogue could end up off in those interactions, I don't know yet. And my second point is that posting about your work one week into your two week update schedule got me all hyped that I'd misremembered it and looked for an update only to be disappointed. Dick move.

  Anyway, read this work.

    Thank you!

    *Very* possible, and something I'm going to be trying to keep an eye out for (also, a reason that I won't be spending much time on the pre-teen years).

    Sorry. :( My usual practice is to post first on SV/SB, then wait a week in case anybody's caught an egregious typo or something else needs to be rewritten, so Ao3 (and consequently my reddit posts) are always a week behind. 

    Anyway, I gotta make up for that, so check your PMs for what I'm posting on SB/SV next week. :)

      Oh wow thanks, I read it on my phone in some downtime and its really interesting, I'll give you my thoughts proper once I've got time later. Let me know if you decide to start a Patreon by the way.

        Thank you! 

        I do have [a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks), sort of, but it's currently on hiatus (mostly because COVID, and now because I'm building up a buffer of non-fanfic works to release) and probably will be until January 2021.

  This is one of the better stories I’m following right now and in contention for the second best HP fanfic I’ve read behind HPMOR. Some of the one-shots are brilliant and just full of feeling.

  It feels to the HP world a little like what Game of Champions was to Pokémon, at least tone wise. 

  It’s not marked as rat fic but my guess is that’s out of an excess of caution or to prevent sparking off a “is this rat fic?” debate, because it reads much like a rat fic.

    Thank you for the kind words and the glowing endorsement!

  Absolutely chilling. 10/10, great literature, reimagining a logical grimdark HP without being preachy.

  Interesting prompt! Thx for the rec, for want of a nail is my favourite type of fanfic prompt.

  Really like the writing, the story, the transparency behind the writing decisions in the footnotes is amazing, I've been following since it was first posted here and have really enjoyed the first phase. Thank you and keep up the good work, and thanks for the schedule! A lot of great and chilling moments.

  (SPOILERS)

  I have just one complaint so far and that is Dumbledore should have entered the duel with riddle knowing the children would be put in danger and willing to strike Riddle down.  It is a terrible cost, but it is the only path to victory, to ignore the terrorist's threat and strike true for the safety of future children at the risk of those here now.  He had to trust in the capacity of the other instructors to save as many of the children as they could from the basilisk and fight all-in.   This is too great a weakness I think in someone running a war with these stakes.  


  Edit: Failure 2 - knowing he will lose, intending to lose, he brings the elder wand.  this is double stupid.  If he intended to lose or die he should secure it elsewhere.
  ```

  - u/RiOrius:
    ```
    I think your first point is a good one: I'd expect the Hogwarts faculty to be able to take down a blindfolded basilisk, especially with initiative on their side.

    But as for your second point, I'm assuming based on his dying thoughts that the Elder Wand is part of Dumbledore's bigger plan. That he's not the true master of the wand and is giving Riddle a defective weapon. Although that's maybe too close to canon to be interesting...
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      possible.  he thought about mad-eye, maybe moodey defeated him in a surprise duel to transfer ownership in case it got stolen.
      ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    Don't the last two canon books make it pretty clear that death ≠ defeat, for the purposes of transferring mastery of the Elder wand?

    Yes, just like in canon, Dumbledore was going into his final encounter with the intention of dying, but, just like in canon, his death would be according to his own plan, and thus it should not give Riddle (or, in canon, >!Snape!<), mastery of the wand.

    On the other hand, whatever Riddle seems to have cooked up for *after* Dumbledore's death might change matters.

    As for attempting lethal force against Riddle...  I have to agree that that is probably the tactically correct decision.  However, I don't think I can blame Dumbledore for being either unwilling or unable to commit to it, "weakness" though it may be.  These children have been entrusted to his care, and it would take a certain ruthlessness to weigh lives the way you're suggesting he should.  Dumbledore is many things, but I don't think ruthless is one of them.

    Please appropriately spoiler tag this. Click "formatting help" to see how :)

    I know you got SPOILERS up there but that still may not be enough for a quick/idle eye (aka mine just now lmao)

    EDIT: It's not under formatting help but it's in the side bar: 

    Spoiler tags are written > ! like this ! <. Just remove the spaces I have in between the<> and ! symbols.

  It really seems more like In Spite of a Nail than For Want of a Nail.
