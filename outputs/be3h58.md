  I wonder how historians in this world ever make sense of the things that happen, because the narrative and the events happening are two entirely separate things. Here, the allied army attacks, is pushed back by the Drow, and then "wins" a crushing "victory" once Pilgrim used his miracle. But the narrative is that Cat just stabbed him with a metaphysical knife, and that's such an abstruse move that it'd be difficult for an outsider to understand, much less study.

    The story is what Historians will have.   

    &#x200B;

    The story will be about the fall of a righteous man who went to hell on a road paved with good intentions.   

    &#x200B;

    The Story is about the fall of the Pilgrim who so valued fighting Cat that he ignored the Dead King.

  Ah yes, nothing quite as romantic as the two heirs of feuding families laughing together in the snow, bathed in their own blood and surrounded by the corpses of their allies slaughtered in a deadly fight against the terrors of the night.
  ```

  - u/bubby_cat2:
    ```
    Is the heir to Malaga dying now? The leadup to that fight sounded like he was basically declaring he'd die for the Slayer's Blood to get the kill. Which, yes, he could have survived, but that's a weird payoff in a book about the power of stories.
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      He only took an injury to the shoulder, and narratively that's about as lethal as losing a toe, especially when he got said injury after poignant introspection and selflessly helping an ally slay a terrible monster.

      He'll be fine, maybe with a gnarly scar or a mild disability that buys him more respect than lack of ability. Hell, he might even get a Name out of the deal.

  Something occurred to me when talking with a friend about the story, and the Drow in particular...


  Cat has a unique fighting force, rarely seen in any form of fantasy or sci-fi.  Namely, she has a military unit that does **not** get weaker as individual members are killed.  Because of the way the Night works, any 'losses' that occur amongst the Drow here don't really matter in the grand scheme of things.

  Let's pretend there are 50,000 Drow, all as strong and skilled as baseline Human soldiers (we're lowballing here, for good reason).  We'll call this their 'combat level'.  Let's say they fight against 50,000 Humans, who obviously have the same 'combat level'.  Let's say both sides lose 10,000 combatants in a fight.

  At the end of the day, the Human fighting force has a 'combat level' equivalent to 40,000.  4/5ths what it started with.  But the **DROW** have a 'combat level' equivalent to **50,000**, the exact number they started with.

  The Drow's losses, while important from the perspective of repopulating their species, are meaningless in the terms of military conflict, so long as they have access to the bodies of their fallen, and thus their Night... which includes their magic powers, their memories, and the skills they acquired over their lifetimes.

  Of course, their numbers do give them obvious benefits, like being able to split the numbers into smaller armies, etc, etc.  So having 1,000 of them each equivalent to 50 Humans each might have some drawbacks, the concentrated Night opens up more possibilities as well, that weaker troops can't match.

  Also, when it comes down to fighting the Dead King, the Drow are perfect for the job.  We know that memories and skills are part of the Night, and so when those are harvested, any corpses raised as Undead by definition can't be the sapient kind, and at best would be some common mindless zombie.  While losing Drow is not ideal, doing so does **NOT** advantage the Dead King at all, and instead makes the remaining Drow *that much harder* for him to kill.

  ---

  **TLDR**:  Cat can tolerate the losses of her special Drow troops **far** more easily than any other fighting force on the field.  This will come in quite handy when fighting the Dead King as well, since if the Night is harvested, the corpse is functionally useless--no skills, no training, it's nothing more than an empty meat puppet, and all the living allies of the new Undead are that much stronger.

  Going to the Everdark was possibly one of the best, most game-breakingly awesome decisions Cat ever made.
  ```

  - u/Mountebank:
    ```
    Don't forget that the Drow can grow the Night by harvesting from creatures they kill. That's how they get new skills in the first place. They've also mentioned that it works on the undead as well, so they're especially well suited to fighting the Dead King since they'll get stronger every time they kill one of his former Named revenants.
    ```

        - u/ProfessorPhi:
          ```
          Haha, ability to sass in the saint's language.
          ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      I haven't forgotten this, it simply hasn't happened yet.

      Cat has *talked* to people about the possibility of this, and it has been stated as being *possible*, but we as the readers/audience have not actually seen it done 'on camera', as it were.  So, until we do, it stays in the realm of the hypothetical.

      However, **if** it is true... well, then they are even more OP then I had originally thought, and you are right in that they aren't just one of the best counters to the Dead King's forces, but perhaps the *best* counter to them.  

      Lesser Drow could potentially gain in strength fighting and claiming the Night of the lesser Undead, while the greater Drow would do the same hunting down the ex-Named.  It could easily snowball out of hand and turn on the Dead King quickly.

      Even better, his usual approach of "Kill it, then make it mine" won't matter too much so long as Cat or another is designated "First Under the Night", AKA, High Priest(ess) of the twin goddesses.   Because we **have** seen Cat use their power to strip all the Night from a living Drow.  Even if the Dead King manages to get his hands on a Drow and convert it to undeath, the First Under the Night can simply take all its Night away and leave it powerless.

      I must admit, I originally thought the Everdark excursion was simply 'filler', but recently it has turned out to be one of the key lynchpins to Cat not just surviving, but perhaps pulling off a win over the forces arrayed against her.  Fortunately, I am quite happy to be wrong about it.
      ```

      - u/hayshed:
        ```
        Hmm. Cat disappears for months and comes back with the perfect counter for the big bad? That's a hero story.
        ```

        - u/Trezzie:
          ```
          Unless the Dead King knows about the drow and the Night and has a counter.

            ```
            He warred with them before, so that's a certanty. From [book IV, chapter 53](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/09/07/chapter-53-gloom/):

            > “Speak not of the Hidden Horror,” Ivah whispered. “For its crown is dawn, and that pale light is the end of all things. Only the mad would enter the eye of the Host of Death.”
            ```

  - u/Keyenn:
    ```
    Actually, it's even better than that, because when you fight, you improve. In a classical army, this experience can be lost (if the guy kills 5 opponents before dying himself), in a drow army, it doesn't. So the result at the end of the day for Drow isn't 50000, but something like 55000 due to the experience gained (and even more if you consider that drow will also harvest opponents).

    &#x200B;

    However, it's not exactly true either. Because some of what which make someone skilled will be shared by everyone and thus, won't give anything to other. If, for instance, your army is composed by guys who have at 100% the exact same skillset, then, you won't gain anything by harvesting them. You won't because twice at good at holding a shield or using a sword if you harvest someone who hold the shield or use the sword in the very same way than you.

          That's what I guessed the well narratively would be used for, at least from the Pilgrim's interlude. It makes sense as a super weapon, anyway.
          ```

- u/MisterCommonMarket:
  ```
  The letter of surrender is such a master stroke on so many levels. Not only does it stab the Pilgrim with a metaphorical knife, it forces the Tyrant to act and make sure the surrender does not actually happen. The Tyrant wants a peace conference afterward and that cannot happen if there is a decisive victor.
  ```

- u/Nic_Cage_DM:
  ```
  > Catherine Foundling was offering unconditional surrender. It would be a great victory, if he accepted. Victory.

  >Gods damn that vicious child.

  So what are we looking at here. If he accepts, it breaks the rule of three narrative he'd built and leaves the armies under her command as POW's they have no way of holding, and if he rejects it then he's probably consigned to a narrative that ends with defeat in this battle and long term narrative advantage for Cat.

  Either way I feel like I'm missing important factors at play.
  ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    The armies under her command are the Wild Hunt and maybe Callow. The Legion of Terror and the Drow are not under her command. Grem and Rumenra hold command respectively.

    Plus don't forget the Callowans are Callowans. They might not lay down their swords just because Cat surrendered, especially if they don't believe its a real surrender. Surrendering isn't much of a thing in the nation of the Long Price.

  - u/panchoadrenalina:
    ```
    If she delivered vivienne's letter at the same time. Her armies are stil not pow. They are the armies of callow held by the new queen to be.

    It doesn't break the rule of 3 it just means that the next fight is going to end in a draw. Which is what Cat wants.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      Isnt the rule of three "evil wins -> draw -> good wins". Doesn't providing a victory to good after the evil victory break this rule?
      ```

      - u/Mingablo:
        ```
        I might have gotten the wrong impression. I thought the rule of three was a win, a loss, and a draw. And the order wasn't that important to the story as a whole.
        ```

        - u/bubby_cat2:
          ```
          I think it's outcome -1 : +1, then outcome 0 : 0, then outcome +1 : -1 for some pair of people. The Pilgrim (and Cat, to some extent) seem to believe that they have to happen in order, and that's the narrative trope so I bet that's how it works in-universe. Thus, this would break the three, meaning Pilgrim isn't guaranteed a win in their next encounter, meaning he loses his knife.

          Thus, I don't think this is the knife; this doesn't guarantee Cat anything, it just means she ISN'T guaranteed a loss. Unless this starts a NEW rule of three, and the next encounter will lean to a draw and the last one will be a victory for Cat...
          ```

          - u/Mingablo:
            ```
            It's rules of 3 all the way down.
            ```

    - u/BaggyOz:
      ```
      It does. Pilgrim is trying to build the rule of 3 already and you cant have it happen twice. This pattern was started at the camps.
      ```

      - u/narfanator:
        ```
        Yeah, I think if you start a new Rule of 3 you don't actually, you just become a recurring nemesis, and then you're both more or less immortal at each other's hands baring Major Plot Developments. Because Guideverse narrativium is based on IRL narratives, and AFAIK that's how the tropes work.
        ```

- u/notagiantdolphin:
  ```
  The bit about the broken oaths tipping the scale is interesting. I know the title isn't 'a lie', but if the unconditional Surrender somehow turns out to be both a lie and correct (say, the unconditional part, or she just legs it later) that evens the scales, breaks the possible pattern of 3 and sets them back to 0.

  And the Saint is such bullshit. Worm's Contessa with even more 'i win' powers.
  ```

  - u/jderig:
    ```
    Disagree. Yes, Saint has made herself into essentially a living weapon that can tell reality to go F itself. However, when you live in a world of stories that sort of tale is begging for a reversal. I feel that this manipulation has made Saint stronger against almost all opponents, but more brittle against the wrong (or from our perspective, right) ones.
    ```

    - u/ATRDCI:
      ```
      I mean it's not like Cat has in the past turned Named into artifacts to be used.

      Oh wait

      (For bonus story symmetry, Pilgrim took the soul of Cat's mentor and is wielding it as a bargining chip.  So Cat takes the body of Pilgrim's companion and wields it as the sword it is?)
      ```

      - u/Trezzie:

        There was that drow she used as a mace...

      >*I feel that this manipulation has made Saint stronger against almost all opponents, but more brittle against the wrong (or from our perspective, right) ones.*

      A sword that swings itself even when its wielder doesn't want to is not a good sword. Swords cannot broker the details of peace deals or weave stories, that's why they get beaten into ploughshares.

      Saint's weakness is basically that she leaves all the thinking to the Pilgrim and everyone else. She just cuts things up, even if it ends up for the worse for "her side". Might end up kissing a pillow held by the Pilgrim if she goes too far.

    - u/YetUnrealised:

      All they need is somebody who uses a domain to coerce reality into believing they are a pen. Maybe the Scribe? As we all know, the pen is mightier than the sword.

    Cat has specifically crafted a weapon to strike at the sword of the Saint of Swords, but it turns out that Saint has spent DECADES telling creation she IS a sword. That's not Contessa levels of "I win," that's having Contessa on your ass levels of "I'm fucked."

    Best part is, Cat put it all together without ever knowing about Saint's cutlery cosplay, she just worked with the narrative she saw.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      if the sword that shes been crafting a weapon to counter is actually the saint herself, that seems like a pretty sweet deal for Cat.

    As Cat said in chapter 30, he will not accept since he won't get his draw (and worse, he will not be able to get it anytime in the futur).

    &#x200B;

    The unconditionnal surrender is not a lie, it's the knife, because it will be refused. And because it will be refused, the well against the sun will not end in a draw, but in a crushing victory for Cat since there is no narrative weight for the Pilgrim anymore. And the best part will be at the conference latter "why you didn't accept my unconditionnal surrender?" Malenza/the levantine "You refused Her WHAT?"

  Also, I hope the next person who thinks they can wield the Sun against Catherine reads their recent history. Two for two, at this point.
  ```

- u/swaskowi:
  ```
  So if this is the knife, Vivenne's the bet and Kairos is the lie? It makes sense but if anything seems too simple, I'm wary for some inversion. [Cat repeats the order, knife, bet, lie, both before and after dictating the letters, to Kairos, Pilgrim, and Vivienne, respectively.](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/04/08/chapter-31-fall-or-flight/) I can't see the shape of it yet but it makes thematic sense that that's the order the letters are written in as well*. Can't wait til Friday.

  *I realize on the face of it that there's a bunch of logical reasons why that order doesn't make sense, but for story reasons, the apparent lay of things makes TOO much sense and we're already mostly aware of it so Narrative makes me suspicious it can't be that.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    I mean, if she follows through with the unconditional surrender, her "full power and influence" is null and void. She just needs to draw Kairos closer so the crusadres stop focusing on her.

      She still is the drow high priestess. And leader of the hunt. Those are not tied to her black queeness
      ```

  - u/MisterCommonMarket:
    ```
    You forget that the parts influence each other. The letter is in many ways also a bet. The Tyrant needs a peace conference and he can't get one if the Callowans surrender. The letter among all the other things it does, forces the Tyrant to act and make sure the surrender does not happen.
    ```

- u/thatsciencegeek:
  ```
  Anyone else feels worry over Wandering Bard not appearing for a long time? I have a bad feeling about the lack of exposition of the damned Intercessor.  I feel like she is secretly pulling the strings and Catherine and everyone else is unwittingly dancing to her tune. My thought is that she caused Hasenbach to think that she needs to engage the Army of Callow (by deceiving Augur), and all that unfolds is the result of this. It also seems to me that she has her hand in nudging Tariq towards his conviction that Catherine is a danger to Calernia and needs to be exterminated. Does anyone else feel this way?
