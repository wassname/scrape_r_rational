### Post:

## Last Week

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3hnau9/weekly_challenge_science_is_bad/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Science Is Bad". /u/MugaSofer is the winner with their story ["Fantastic, or, Reed Richards is Useless"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3hnau9/weekly_challenge_science_is_bad/cu9ilab), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/MugaSofer! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

##### This Week

This week's challenge is "Dueling Time Travelers". Two people, with access to time travel, in some sort of conflict with one another. Your choice of [time travel model](http://qntm.org/models), though it's highly recommended that you keep it rational. Yes, you can include more than two people in conflict, or just have one person in conflict with their past/future self. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, September 2nd.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

    Pretty interesting. Really curious as to how these cycles get resolved if you have two opposing factions who both have access to time travel. Is it a question of who runs out of resources first? Keeping in mind that these resources would need to transcend time somehow.

    I feel like I would have understood a good deal of the story better had I played any Prince of Persia games, especially sands of time...   This was still an entertaining read though.

      Yea, it definitely would've been more enjoyable but I tried to write it so that you could still appreciate the story even if you'd never played the series. I guess I was partially successful? :P

    Not... really sure what was going on. I got some of the gist, but it didn't draw me in enough that I want to spend time reading up and down the wiki to understand the rest.

    Speaking as a die-hard Sands of Time fan.. fantastic. Loved the loop twist and the perspective of the vizier. It feels more appropriate for fate to manifest like this instead of Dahaka. Insidious.

    And using those lines to end it like that - it was perfect for the story.

      Thanks! I found that ending paragraph really impactful in the game, and just had to work it into my story. Glad to hear you enjoyed the read.
