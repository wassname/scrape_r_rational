## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Does anybody know of any system apocalypse stories without the apocalypse? By that I mean a lit-rpg like System is given to everybody on Earth but society manages to largely carry on. I think it'd be really interesting to examine the changes a System would introduce to our society if it wasn't destroyed overnight with no nation states, infrastructure or technology.

    Since you haven't gotten any other replies, I figured I might as well plug the tangentially similar anime [Log Horizon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon) and the fanfic I wrote for it,  http://archiveofourown.org/works/6785857

    The premise of log horizon is that people enter an MMO world SAO-style, except it's not a death game and there's no clear objective, so the main characters spend their time talking economics and figuring out how to create a civil society that prevents human rights abuses. The premise of my fanfic is that the people isekai'd find a way to open a portal back home, which ends up propagating the game mechanics to the real world.

  I would like some recommendations for podcasts to listen to. Preferably mystery/horror/thriller. Something like The Magnus Archives that will keep me on the edge of my seat and with an overarching plot.

  I've already listened to Borrasca, Mistholme, The Storage Papers, A Voice From Darkness, Wolf 359, The Dead Letter Office, and Archive 81.

    [The Left/Right Game](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-left-right-game/id1498806952)? Pretty short, in comparison to the others.

    Have you read Harry Potter and the Natural 20? It's a fic where a rules-as-written munchkin from a world where the PCs are aware of the game mechanics like Order of the Stick gets isekaied to the world of Harry Potter. Among other things, the protagonist has to work out how to fake being a Harry Potter wizard through clever use of his Vancian casting. 

    There's also the other glowfic stories set in the Lintagolarion reification, but I'm not aware of a good index for them.

    >Any other Pokemon or similar stories you'd recommend?

    [Farla](https://archiveofourown.org/users/Farla/pseuds/Farla/works?fandom_id=448284) is a great author for pokemon fics. Read the summaries and PAY ATTENTION TO THE TAGS though. A lot of what Farla writes is pretty classic "dead dove, don't eat" stuff.

    I'd also recommend [Broken Things](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/broken-things-pokemon.753136/#post-57786820) (ongoing) and [The Envy of Eden](https://forums.thousandroads.net/index.php?threads/the-envy-of-eden.351/) (complete).

  Any recommendations for stories that deal with psychics in some way? Especially regarding telepathic consent. 

  Two stories I enjoy that fit this already: are minor story spoilers >!Pokemon Origin of Species!< and >!Mother of Learning!<.

  Both have MC's that don't realize they are psychic at the start of the story. Both get very good with their abilities and face some heavy ethical dilemmas regarding how to utilize these.

    It's not telepathy, but [Quod Olim Erat](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15449/quod-olim-erat) spends quite a bit of time on the sanctity of the mind - or lack thereof. The main character is a starship AI in a human frame, but everything about them, up to and including their memories, is still property of the government that made them.

      I read the first volume of this awhile ago and enjoyed it.

      Are there other stories in a similar vein on RR (or elsewhere)? Searching the "sci-fi" tag comes up with a lot of fantasy-adjacent scifi, and I'm hoping to find more of either super-futuristic space or AI related stories.

        Ah, thanks. Didn't even notice.

        If you like AI / Sci-Fi stuff, [The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/) is a story about a warship AI waging a one-man (one-AI?) war against an alien race that defeated humanity long ago. The story starts with the ship lurking in space, feigning death, and its discovery by a scrapper team. Reads like Stellaris meets Dead Space. Very fun.

        If you want like actually real people literature, *Ancillary Justice* the first book in an award-winning Sci-Fi trilogy about another 'ship AI in human form.'


        Back to webnovels, [To Inherit The Future](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/to-inherit-the-future-mass-effect-nier-automata-crossover-fusion.504556/) is a Nier Automata / Mass Effect crossover, where humanity (Nier Spoilers) >!is extinct.!< The story focuses on the Androids joining the galactic community, and is a bit of a stand-out by taking place during the Krogan rebellion.

        [Starwalker](http://www.starwalkerblog.com/startup-sequence/) is about a warship AI that knows she is more than she should be, and is trying to figure out what exactly happened before she was activated. I haven't read it, but have heard generally positive stuff, but also that it gets weird around book three. 'Weebshit,' to be precise, but given your username that might not be a problem lmao.

  I'd like to rec
  ride of a lifetime by Robert iger
  It's a not bad collection of anecdotes of the CEO of Disney leading into the role then during his role. 
  I'll be honest I don't tend to read biographies nor non-fiction in general, but I while reading this I couldn't help but think of the unreliable narrator trope as well people doing what others think is irrational either due to
  A) insufficient/flawed information
  B) different thought processes /experience resulting in a different conclusion.

  Also nonfiction tends to miss the omniscience that fiction has, there were so many things I wanted more detail on, but of course offers some very real (hah!) characters/stories that you can relate to.

  I think it's very interesting to try reading this as if it were a fan fiction (since we all know bits of the Canon) and contrasting with what it does well VS poorly. It clearly reminds me I love fantasy./sci-fi for the amazing worlds/narratives you can get caught up in

  Anyhow I'd like to ask for any biography recs or non fiction anecdotes thank you :)

    Not a particularly rational work, but The Disaster Artist was an instant favorite for me. I got the audiobook and only stopped listening to it for an hour to have an exam on the same day I started and finished it, despite it being almost 12 hours long. It didn't lose my attention for even a single chapter.

    The full title of the book is "The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made". In case you (or anyone reading this) are not aware, The Disaster Artist is the autobiographical retelling of the Behind the Scenes experience of Greg Sestero, who plays the best friend of the protagonist (played by Tommy) in Tommy Wiseau's famous disasterpiece The Room. The audiobook is narrated by the author himself and that adds a ton of value to it (his Tommy impression is also on point).

    For more Disney stuff I really recommend Disneywar by James B Stewart. It’s well written and chronicles the downright Shakespearean rise and fall of the previous CEO, Michael Eisner.  For more corporate politics I’d also suggest Bad Blood by John Carreyrou about Theranos. It’s by the investigative journalist who broke the story on them in the first place and worth a read too.

  I'm looking for somewhat rational Xianxia. I got hooked on Memories of the Fall and then it went sideways so I'm looking to scratch that itch. What I particularly liked about Memories was the detailed worldbuilding and how the plot grew from that naturally.

        "If the adventurers that delved it were analogues of its goblins, what did that say about the larger world? Certainly nothing good. It was all meat to be fed into the grinder: raw resources to be exploited to continue a cycle. Where in all that was the meaning? Its goblins had desires, maybe, and they were crude and childish ones. Were the adventurers all that different? Grinding their starting levels in its dungeon, before moving on to greater things — but where were those greater things? Higher-level dungeons? A ceaseless upward climb, to what? To have the largest numbers? To make oneself secure against any other with higher numbers? Surely there must be some meaning beyond that."

    Per skepticism, I would *highly* recommend checking out [Zhuang Zhou's *Zhuangzi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi_(book)), particularly the recently published [Ziporyn translation](https://hackettpublishing.com/zhuangzi-the-complete-writings). >!Also available on libgen, if you can't drop 'philosophical classic' money at the moment.!<  Not only is it a good entry-point to non-western philosophy, if you haven't dipped your toe in already, but it's very productive if read against the Roman/Greek skeptics (Sextus, etc.).

    Both are engaged in a grand, radical sort of skepticism - Is it possible to know the truth? Is it possible to know the Good? (are these the same question?). As well, the knock-on question - how do you go about living your life if you've posed this sort of totalizing skepticism, as a person engaged in whatever major and minor practical, philosophical, and moral problems will envelop you? Zhuangzi uses skepticism as a tool and method, and ends up putting together a skepticism both based on, and potentially finding resolution in, the multiplicity of *perspective.*

    Of course, since this did end up being one of the founding texts of Daoism, and a major pillar in Chinese Philosophy, there's no shortage of secondary literature to be had, whether it's readers and guides or more academic articles and papers on particular questions and points of argument. 

    It's also, frankly, a pretty fun read.

    ----

    **edit:** For like a solid half hour I had a few hundred words on Pyrrhonian/Cartesian skepticism down here but then couldn't decide whether to say Descartes' demon was purely *external-world* skeptical or a problem of *grounding* judgements, not actually being concerned with the external world as such. Let me boil down the practical aspect of what was deleted: If you wanna know what the Greeks thought, the Greeks (well, the Greeks, as interpreted and relayed by the Romans) put it best. Sextus' [*Outlines of Pyrrhonism*](http://www.sophia-project.org/uploads/1/3/9/5/13955288/sextus_pyrrhonism.pdf) is a relatively simple read. Similarly, the best place to start with Cartesian skepticism is the [*Meditations*](https://yale.learningu.org/download/041e9642-df02-4eed-a895-70e472df2ca4/H2665_Descartes%27%20Meditations.pdf), specifically the first three - Descartes ends up just buliding a non-skeptical metaphysics in the rest. After that, if you choose to go into the pro-External World Skepticism analytic philosophy from the late 20th/early 21st century, well, go with God.
    ```

    - u/TumbleweedOk8510:
      ```
      *Zhuangzi* looks quite interesting, I think I will definitely read it soon. >!As for libgen, it's quite a double-edged sword. It's existence incentivizes me to download as many books as I can (by virtue of it being easy, and well, free) but I somehow never get around to reading most of them.!< 

      Radical skepticism doesn't seem to have many modern adherents strangely enough, aside from Unger and Fogelin. But I will see what I can scrounge up, after getting a foundation in Pyrrhonism and Zhuang Zi-ism. 

      Thanks for the detailed reply.
