## Is anyone willing to beta Sodium Hypochlorite?

### Post:

So I've got to the stage now where the first story arc is plotted out and I'm starting to write chapters.

Unfortunately I'm fairly new at this so my writing leaves a lot to be desired.

Basically, I need someone to read through the chapters as I finish them and tell me what they did and didn't like.

Any of you up for the job?

EDIT: okay I now have 3 betas. I think that's probably enough.

  Nooooooo! I missed out on being a beta for a new rational story? Obviously the solution is to obsessively-compulsively check /r/rational even more!

  Good luck with your story.
