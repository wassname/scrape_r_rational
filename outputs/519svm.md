## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  There is some potential for crazy shenanigans on the horizon.

  You can buy a home CRISPR kit now: http://www.the-odin.com/diy-yeast-crispr-kit/

  And there is a 3D printing "open source laboratory equipment" movement building to help supply 3rd world hospitals: http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_Lab

  At some point in the near future (5 years?) it will be pretty feasible to set up your own private lab with an expensive 3d printer and use easily acquirable reagents like from Sigma-Aldrich or similar to essentially conduct your own biotech experiments or replicate those recorded in the literature/patents. 

  I have no idea how this will be regulated but hopefully someone smarter than me has already thought of this because there would be some risk for exponential harm to ecology if, for example, someone uses documented methods to reproduce a GM crop without putting in terminator genes to sterilise the seeds. You could have super competitive, insect and pesticide resistant crops let loose to outgrow anything else, potentially hybridising those traits with other species of plants once in the wild and irreversibly changing the world we live in.

  Someone is going to try using CRISPR or similar on themselves. Try to change their eye colour or something. 

  I predict many scary stories of "mad scientists up to no good in their basements" in the media sometime soon.

  Edit: now with fewer superlatives.

    I feel like the mad scientists don't belong in quotes. Sure it's a bad name for it, but this is seriously something that should be scary. Something I've thought about a lot recently is that there's kind of a built in assumption about the way a lot of us think about the future that the power to prevent destruction (the powers of stability) will at a minimum of scale as fast as the power to do harm. The problem is that I can think of nothing that actually means this has to be true.

    For example imagine tomorrow we discover a way to using only transistors, capacitors, etc and household AC to produce anti-mater in meaningful amounts also imagine we have some way to contain it. Obviously none of this has happened or will happen but ignoring physics there's no reason it couldn't happen and something like it certainly could.

    What would this discover do to the world? I'd posit humanity would be pretty much gone within 10 years. Luckily anti-mater isn't and can't be that easy to make or contain, but what if it becomes that easy to make a super virus? What if it becomes that easy to build von neumann machine? I'm kind of scared to think that we might live in a world where anyone of moderate wealth can build something with a level of destructive potential inline with a nuke. The world is already getting cheaper and cheaper to destroy. It took the US an insane amount of resources to figure out how to build a nuke. Now regardless of politics it looks like Iran could have made one on a fraction of the budget. 

    What do we do when the budget needed gets down about 100k?

  Work has officially begun on my boat.

  Whoever last worked on it did a pretty bad job. There are holes in the roof that aren't seeled well enough, and that's letting water in between the fiberglass layers.

  I'd like to document the process. I like tumblr, because of its "ask" feature. But there's so much else I dislike about it. Basically every way they do things rubs me the wrong way.

  I guess I have 3 options

   * Create my own blog platform

   * Use my old wordpress blog (traverseda.wordpress.com)

   * Use tumblr

  Ultimately my goal is to build a record showing that I'm experienced with this kind of thing. In the longer term, I'd like to help people move onto boats, which should be a lot more practical with oneweb.

  Boats are a good way to experiment with alternative economies/governance. A lot of the technology developed should help with colonizing less hospitable environments. Like space, and deserts, and earth is some of the pretty-bad predictions about global warming are true.

  **Exercise**

  In previous attempts at exercising, I've never lost weight; never gained in strength or dexterity; never even gotten a second wind. I've never met any significant exercise goals. But in the long-term, exercise is still worthwhile. So I'm trying something new: Changing my self-conception to Someone Who Exercises Daily. No expectations of any gains, rewards, or second winds. Just someone who slogs through the painful routine each day, every day.

  I've picked a routine that can be done anywhere, with no equipment: Burpees, in descending sets (ie, for 15, do 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; for non-triangular numbers, add at the start, ie for 17, do 7, 6, 3, 2, 1), adding 1 per day. (Supposedly, burpees work all the major parts of the body, etc, etc.) If-and-when I make it to 30-descending, I'll consider changing it up.

  Today: Did 5 burpees.

  Also today: Set up https://twitter.com/DPR_exercise to semi-publicly keep track. (Or, as an RSS feed, http://twitrss.me/twitter_user_to_rss/?user=dpr_exercise .)
  ```

    When you were exercising with goals, what were your routines? Judging by your claim that you've "never lost weight; never gained in strength or dexterity; never even gotten a second wind", then with very high probability you were doing it wrong. I don't believe having no goals would help much. If you do not know where you are going, why would you expect to arrive some place that you like?
    ```

    - u/gvsmirnov:
      ```
      Uh, now I recognize that the previous message might come off unfriendly, discouraging and condescending. Please do not treat it as such, I definitely did not mean it that way.

      Actually doing it and not giving up is the most important part of it. Even getting up and performing 5 burpess is something that deserves respect, so keep it up!

      That being said, would you clarify what you wanted to achieve by posting here? I'd love to help, I am just not sure what the best way to approach it would be.

    If you have not tried it yet, I suggest you check out /r/bodyweightfitness and try their [Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) ([or here as a website with instructional videos](https://www.fitloop.co/routines/bwf-recommended-beginner-routine)), 60mins/day, not more than 3 times a week. As far as I can tell, the subreddit has a lot of knowlegable, rational people who have optimized the routine over the last years.

  Man, for as much as I read (that's a lot a lot, like regularly reading 200,000+ word fanfics), I have NO idea how to critique my own writing. Sure, I can do technical edits here and there, and improve phrasing and whatnot. But beyond that it's foreign to me.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:

    I've thought about ways to become better at critiquing my own writing, and realized that it comes down to appropriately modeling how readers would respond to it. 

    Which I feel like I'm *absolutely terrible* at.

    A general mass of strangers isn't so bad, but individuals are complicated. Modeling my friends isn't too hard in most circumstances. But when it comes to book recommendations or what aspects of stories they like most... I can give a rough estimate of whether most will like or dislike a story, but the oddest things always catch me by surprise. Things that might bring me close to tears they might find tacky, or vice-versa.

    For example, I recommended Worm to my step-brother. I thought he'd love it. He did... until he reached the interlude with the Travelers backstory and stopped reading.  He said the interlude was just so frustrating to get through that he'd rather not finish Worm.

    I don't grok that. It's just outside my mental model of what a reasonable person's response would be. Like, I understand that he just doesn't enjoy the interlude's characters or plot, that's fine. I enjoyed that interlude myself, but I can see why it would be annoying to someone who just wants to get back to the main story. But to dislike it so much that he'd rather just stop reading than even just skip it, despite my assurances that he can without ruining the rest of the story?

    I just don't get that. I updated my model of him accordingly upon finding that out, but the existence of such bizarre (to me) perspectives makes it hard for me to critique my own story from readers-like-his perspective. Am I writing interludes so offputting that some people are just going to stop reading? I hope not, but my step-brother is a live example that this is the way some people work, and I don't understand why enough to stop my own story from hitting those same problems, other than "don't make them too long." My interludes are just a chapter long, so hopefully that's not too bad, but it's still a worry of mine.

    I think getting better at critiquing your own work comes from receiving lots of detailed critiques from individuals and keeping each in mind as a lens through which to critique your future work. Blending common feedback together from anonymous readers is useful too for sure, but that's not as dynamic.
    ```

      Thank you very much for this. I get what you're saying with regards to the difficulty in modelling individuals. There's certain somewhat-meta aspects of games and stories (namely, Undertale and Homestuck) that I really enjoy that brings other people out of the narrative. 

      Basically, what I'm getting from this is to just keep writing and eventually, when I'm comfortable with the quality of my writing through my own ham-handed editing to publish it and integrate feedback. Which is reasonable and obvious enough, I suppose. :p
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        Also consider finding up to three people who can act as volunteer editors, giving you early feedback *before* you post it publicly.  

        I don't write much prose, but it's very useful to be able to bounce ideas off someone throughout the process... and it can be painful if you polish something before people have a change to give the basic feedback.
        ```

        That's about the size of it, yeah :) Unlike a lot of professions, writers don't often have teachers or mentors, especially not individual ones. We learn from the writers we read, and the readers of what we write.  

        There's only so far you can go on your own, and coalescing all that information into actionable changes in how we practice our craft is a tougher challenge than in other activities that have more tangible and objective metrics, which means the more open you can make the channels of communication between yourself and readers, whether friends/family who are willing to beta or reviewers online, the better. Publishing authors have the advantage of a dedicated editor to go over their work with a fine-toothed comb and help iterate draft after draft, and to make up for our lack of that, we need to expose our work to strangers and listen to what they have to say.

        It's an interesting topic, and we'll probably do a Rationally Writing episode on feedback and integrating it sometime soon :)

      Another option is read the stories of others, make your own critique of the story,  read the published critiques of those stories and then try to find similar flaws in your own work that you can improve on.
      ```
