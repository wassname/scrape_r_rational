## [meta] Can you recommend any completed works?

### Post:

I like the genre, but it turns me off that the huge majority of things posted here are amateurishly written and incomplete. 

For example, someone linked me Mother of Learning, and I went through 65 chapters only to find out that the book is incomplete and the author probably has no idea where he's going with it, considering the lack of character and plot development.

  The author of Mother of Learning knows exactly where he's going with it. He planned it all out before he started, and it shows, with a very complex mystery and lots of foreshadowing. I'm loving every chapter, and I know many others do too. If you thought it was amateurish, I'm not sure what I can recommend to you.

  MoL is without a doubt THE most popular piece on this Reddit, based on upvotes. If you disliked it you might want to look elsewhere. 

  Out of curiosity, you say that you like the genre but not the things that are posted here. Where were you getting your refs from before this? It might make a good source for us as well.

    Worm, Twig, Shadows of Limelight, Metropolitan Man, HPMOR, someone said that the SCP stories belong in that genre, and I just finished "CORDYCEPS: Too clever for their own good", which was short, but absolutely brilliant. 

    Probably missing a few others as well.

      Can I presume that you've read [Yudkowsky's other fiction](http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/)? Three Worlds Collide is very thought-provoking.

      If you like SCP stories, then you should look at the [SCP stories](http://www.scp-wiki.net/qntm-s-author-page) written by the author of Ra. Most of them are about antimemetics which is a very interesting topic to most readers here.

  Apart from methods of rationality which I cant recommend highly enough (even after taken this sentence into account), my favourites are the stories of Alexander Wales. A bluer shade of white, metropolitan man, for a bit more long-form his shadows of the limelight are rather good.

  Lack of plot development? Huh?

  I'd advise you to stick with it; the author updates fairly regularly, and as someone who's been following it serially, plot development happens quite often and unexpectedly.

  Web serials are basically the logical conclusion of a series-- Instead of giving you a fraction of a story at a time, then waiting years for the next part to be ready, you just get updated chapter-by-chapter. Referenced to non-web-serials, MoL is a bit more than 2 massive doorstopper books in.

    It's a pity that it doesn't seem possible to use an OR condition (eg complete OR rapidly updating OR slowly updating, rational OR hints of rationality).

  Ted Chiang's [short stories](https://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1931520720/) are worth a read, especially if you're looking for something with a more professional written tone.

  [The Fall of Doc Future](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) is interesting... though the romance in it feels a little bit like wish fulfillment to me, which turned me off a bit. But the main premises and the way powers are taken to their logical conclusions is appealing. 

  I'm not sure if you're okay with fan fiction, but you might want to check out [The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/) (a Naruto story). I found it to be well written and it's complete.

  Also [Friendship is Optimal](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal) is a very good take on the rise of General Artificial Intelligence that uses aspects of the My Little Pony Frienship is Magic universe (though it's set in the real world). Don't let the source material turn you off, because it's not important at all to understanding the story and the way the author integrates it into a real world setting is quite interesting. I'd never seen an episode of MLP before reading this and I loved it.
