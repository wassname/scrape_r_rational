## Pyrebound 10.5

### Post:

Another chapter ended.  Let me know what's good, what's bad, and what's ugly.

PB is an original fantasy novel set in a semi-Mesopotamian world (it resembles Sumer about as much as Middle-Earth resembles medieval Europe).  The cosmos are broken, life is tough, and somebody has to wind up on the bottom of a very harsh and unjust society.  Our hero Rammash doesn't care for that.  If that sounds interesting, the story starts [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thanks for reading!

  Just finished reading the story so far. I quite like it. The worldbuilding is interesting, and seems pretty deep, albeit it doesn't feel quite as deep as it seems to be. I like the ubiquitousness of broken systems. Not just the system of the society, but the magic system itself is stuck propagating a cycle of injustice. Defeating evil empires is easy compared to building  good ones, and all that.

    Thanks!  That is generally what I was going for.  Could you elaborate, though, on "doesn't feel quite as deep as it seems to be"?  Do you mean that the story's scope or our perspective is too limited, for example?

      We only get to follow one perspective. I don't think you could advance the story like you have, keeping a strong pace, if you tried to cram more worldbuilding detail in. Certainly not with the same word count.

      Someone like Brandon Sanderson has multiple perspectives and a ton more words to explore his worlds. Word for word, your story's plot moves quicker. I think every author has to find where they are happy.

      For a web serial example, Delphic spends a lot more time world and character building than you do, and thus the plot advances much more slowly.

        Ah.  I considered doing interludes at first, but realized I didn't have anything interesting to say in them.  It'd just be villains, etc. dropping exposition, or irrelevant scenes.  Thanks for chipping in.
