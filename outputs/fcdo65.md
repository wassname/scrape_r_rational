## I'm writing a novel. It's called MAZE - The endless quest, and I would love some feedback!

### Post:

 The story is about a world where a game-like system is the norm,  Everyone has a level, status and even skills are a common thing.

If your stats are good you can even become an explorer, someone that ventures inside a place called MAZE, a dungeon of sorts filled with monsters creatures and things that the regular world is missing such as magic.

The story follows Hera, a woman who wanted to be an explorer but her status were too low to become one. One day she wins a raffle that allows her to level up for the first time giving her the chance to achieve her childhood dream.

I love the system setting and my idea was to make something easy to read and fun. It's more about how things work and what you can do with them than about power or revenge.

The rhythm might be a bit slow for some but that is the idea. I want to give sort of a slice of life feeling to most of it.

The name is MAZE- the Endless quest and here is the link

  Seems fairly generic so far, which is a common failing of the genre. Sure, you've told us that it's a LitRPG setting where everyone has stats and such, and the characters certainly talk like that, but I didn't see any signs of it being a magical world beyond the closed circle of explorers... or indeed, anything that would indicate that the civilian world is anything but perfectly mundane.

  If you want to stand out, do something interesting with the premise. Show us what the widespread availability of magic does for the economy. Show us extreme daredevils doing crazy things to level up. Show us crafting powers being used to create an alternative to factories. Show us magically boosted competence outside the traditional adventuring circles. Show us adventurers working in law enforcement, who have to be able to handle magical criminals. Generally, show us why people who aren't adventurers care about adventuring, since if the Maze's effects aren't relevant to the wider mundane world, exploring it is just a weird hobby.

    Thank you for the feedback! 

    I do have some plans on how the world is affected by the presence of magic and magical items, but I was worried about overwhelming the reader with worldbuilding lore and making them lose interest.   
    As time goes by (and the number of chapters goes up) I intend to show some more "mundane" use of magic items and how the levels affect the overall workforce and civilian life.  

    The closest one I can give a tease of will be on her first day off from training, it's time for the Olympics! 

    Right now, the world feels more mundane because of the low number of explorers. This translates to a low rate of magic items being available to general audiences. 

    With all that said, the novel will have a really slow pace so it will take some time to show those things. If you feel like this story is too basic, simple or just uninteresting I completely understand if you decide to drop it. But I do appreciate from the bottom of my heart you taking your time to read ang tell me your toughts about it!

      Yeah, it's tricky to convey world building info to the reader without bludgeoning them to death with a textbook. The trick is to fit it in naturally; like the difference between a ten page essay on magical economics and taking Harry Potter to Diagon Alley to get his school supplies.

    Thank you so much for the feedback. 

    I know my grammar is subpar and I will do my best to improve it. Even if English is not my first language that is no excuse. I just hope everyone can understand the story even with some mistakes. 

    The reason she quit her job before going there was more an "I'm removing the safety net so I can't give up" mentality. It's an impulse decision and she still needs to realize how much of a risk it was. 

    Hera is very timid and tries to avoid confrontation. However she never consciously fighting thought about fighint the bouncer. She wanted to stop from being escorted out and call out Helena but her skill activated by accident and that led up to the "fight". But yes, all the options you mentioned were valid things to do, but again in that that she is a bit too hyper to have good judgment. I might have not made this clear enough but since it's a novel sadly I can't go change previous chapters. I will try to make her mindset more transparent to the reader going forward. 

    For the world-building, question. It's about weapon enchantment and how stats affect the world. If your strenght is high you can deal more damage with melee weapons. But that doesn't translate to firearms.    
    Enchantment and such can change that but they are rare and more expensive. All this will be explained e a bit more details during the training  


    Thank you very much for the feedback, I will do my best to make the whole world as grounded as possible, even if we are dealing with magic and such.

      I just want to point out that you can *absolutely* change published chapters. It is very common, and in fact recommended.
      ```

      - u/tandertex:

        Really? I've talked about it with a few authors and they told me that aside from grammar corrections and minor clarifications enhancements I shouldn't change published chapters. Mainly because that can change the story for a reader that just started and a reader that is following since day 1

          That may be true for some serial webnovels & their communities, but I think you'll find /r/rational much more forgiving. The authors of both r!Animorphs and The Elemental Arena recently made major changes to published chapters, and were universally applauded for it on here. This sub appreciates quality content; I don't think anyone would complain about you putting in effort to improve the quality of your story so long as you make note of it so folks know to go back and reread.

          Wildbow, in Worm, kept notes and then made the changes some time after the last chapter came out. Then he did it again a few weeks before starting the sequel, Ward, to plug up continuity issues.

          Some RR stories I follow did it just in the middle of things. In each case the author announced the changes where current readers would be likely to see it.

          I wouldn't do it frequently but I've never thought it was a big deal when an author changed things.

          APGTE had some reader speculation that whole chunks of the story were going to be removed because >!a creature that can erase history frim having ever existed became a likely future opponent for the MC.!<

  Is there anything stopping people from bypassing the maze by tunneling over, under or through the walls?
  ```

  - u/tandertex:
    ```
    The MAZE is not actually a physical space in the world. It is not like one specific city/country. 

    Each room is a pocked dimension and together they form the big dimension called MAZE. So bypass it is not possible.   


    Again this will be explained a bit later on during the training but in broad strokes, the door/portal/gate is a form of teleportation magic.

  u/tandertex LitRPG != Rational / Rationalist. Does your novel fit the definition on this subreddit's sidebar?

  I'm not saying the work is bad (I haven't read it), I just want to know if it should be in this subreddit or not.
  ```

- u/MilesSand:
  ```
  I had to stop after a few paragraphs.  Your sentences have waaaay too many words between the start and the point. Maybe that's just a language mastery thing in which case it'll naturally get better as you read, write,  and interact in English.
