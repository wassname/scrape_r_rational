## [RT][HF][FF] Update: "The World is Your Oyster, The Universe is Your Namesake," will be updating rapidly over the next few days, starting today.

### Post:

[First Chapter](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3808279/chapters/8485900)

[Most Recent Chapter: 39 â€” Whoopsie Daisy](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3808279/chapters/10280859)

Since I have again accrued a backlog of chapters totalling over 10 000 words, I shall refrain from spending five hours uploading them all at once.

Instead, I will try to upload them every one or two days, and I will drop a notice on this subreddit.

For the uninitiated, TWiYOTUiYN is a Steven Universe fanfic. It requires familiarity with the source material and starts after the 57th overall episode, *Reformed.*

The pitch is thus:

> Steven happens to ask the right questions.

> Why are the Crystal Gems so isolated? Can Gemtech be used to improve the human condition on a global scale? Why has Steven never gone to school?
