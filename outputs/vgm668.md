## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  I recommend this underrated superhero story on RR: [Delphic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54450/delphic)

  The premise is that the protagonist is a man with the power of... basically supercharged google earth, which he uses to be an international information broker. If you liked the parts of Paranoid Mage where the protagonist stayed anonymous through techniques like using burner phones, using aliases, etc. you might like this. It does have a bit more handwavy-ness about how exactly the protagonist stays anonymous, but I do think that it's reasonably done. The protagonist felt like he had a good balance of rational reasoning and also being mature. For example he understands the importance of having a social circle and being in touch with family, and so being slightly less anonymous is something he's happy to give up to have better social skills. He understands his own feelings of wanting validation and recognition from fellow superheroes, and while he won't go looking for it, he does enjoy it to its fullest when it happens. It's little things like that that make the protagonist feel more like a 20-something adult instead of just another teenager aged up. 

  Overall it's quite solid.

    Oh, is Delphic being worked on again? I read what was there years ago and was looking forward to more, but the story seemed to be dead so I had forgotten about it. Seconding the recommendation, I remember enjoying it.

  [Modern Patriarch](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54068/modern-patriarch) is pretty good. Only 21 chapters so far, but the interesting premise and quality of the writing have a lot of promise. 


  The blurb
  > When Yao Shen, Patriarch of the Heavenly Sky Sect, ascends and regains memories of his past life on Planet Earth, he realizes that he can no longer allow himself to accept the cruel and violent ways of Eliria, the realm of cultivation. 
  > 
  > So he decides to change it. 
  > 
  > It was time to found a new sect. One based on the values of honor and equality over senseless violence and discrimination. A sect where all, from the mortal farmer’s son to a sect elder's daughter, were held accountable to the same rules. 
  > 
  > Welcome to the Modern Sect.

  My only worry in the initial chapters was that about the potential for conflict and an interesting story. Thankfully later we learn about the world and though MC is "op" in the current area, it turns out that the world is vast and there are a number of stronger individuals and organizations in the wider world. 

  Think there's a lot of potential for the story to develop to where we see how his sect interacts with other sects and the conflicts that will arise as they inevitably clash.

    I'm thinking of getting back into this one.  I was kind of driven away by the long and dry exposition on the setting and the different cultivation realms.  

    I get that this is necessary to some degree in any cultivation story, but if all of the setting details are explained in this way it's going to be annoying.  Does the exposition get more natural in later chapters?

      There was a [Worm / Cultivation crossover](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/worm-xianxia-sect.989803/) I was reading recently. The one where post-Worm Taylor has transmigrated to a girl from a sect that specializes in turning poison into Qi... inside unwilling victims like the mentioned girl.

      IIRC, there were some long sections of exposition / speculation by Taylor on the nature of the magic / Qi system and how it all worked. And that lost my interest. I just wanted more of Taylor + Xifeng kicking ass and overthrowing the existing power structures.  I don't know, maybe I'll skip a bit and see if I like it better.
      ```

      - u/steelong:
        ```
        I read and dropped this exact story for the exact reasons you mentioned.

        I get that exposition is tough for stories like this, but enough of them do it right that I get impatient with the ones that have rough beginnings.
        ```

          You're missing out. It is a bit meandering, but I think it has the best xianxia fight I've ever read.

          Honestly, if you have stories in the same genre that you consider better, I'd really love to get some recommendations. I've been looking for more xianxia to read.

          Here's a list of what I've already read so we don't double up: *Ave Xia Rem Y, Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4, Jumpspark, Cradle Series* and the above mentioned *Sect*. There's probably some I've forgotten that I can't think of the top of my head, but that should be about it.

          edit: Right, *Beware Of Chicken* should probably be included, even if I think that it's more of a slice of life piece than a xianxia.
          ```

            > You're missing out. It is a bit meandering, but I think it has the best xianxia fight I've ever read.

            I'll give it another go.

            -------------

            Just as a general comment to authors out there regarding things like this...

            In the case of this crossover fic, the exposition dump came relatively early in the story.

            It would have been another thing if the exposition dump had come much, much later in the story, after seeing a lot of little pieces of it integrated into the story along the way. Like, as a way of tying together different things that had been encountered over the course of their adventures, which explains a little bit more about the world. If I'm invested in the story and characters, this will add to my enjoyment.
            ```

          - u/steelong:
            ```
            I don't have much to add to the list.

            [The Qi to Immortality](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/55416/the-qi-to-immortality) was recommended in this thread.  It's managed to avoid over-expositing so far, but it's a little early to say how good it'll end up being.
            ```

          - u/reddithanG:
            ```
            Here are some top tier xianxia inspired recs: Virtuous Sons, Forge of Destiny, Essence of Cultivation, Memories of the Fall, Millennial Mage. 

            For actual xianxia I HIGHLY recommend Forty Milleniums of Cutivation, Grandmaster Strategist, Sword Dynasty, Ze Tian Ji, The Path Towards Heaven and Lord of the Mysteries.
            ```

      - u/i_dont_know:
        ```
        There was a somewhat interesting fight who’s climax relied heavily on some of that exposition, and then the next chapter was… more exposition. And the author likes to drop 3k+ words of information posts in between exposition chapters. I can appreciate the dedication, but as you said, it’s just too much.
        ```

        - u/Flashbunny:
          ```
          I just straight up don't read the exposition posts that aren't explicitly part of the story, the story has enough already.
          ```

    - u/hi____nsa:
      ```
      Since we're still 21 chapters in there are still parts that consist long passages of exposition to further explain the world. There was more action in the last few chapters with the mc confronting the old powerful families of the sect, but I have no idea if that level of action will continue. 

      I'd wait a couple of weeks to at least chapter 50 before passing judgement since the story just started. Hopefully the long passages of exposition are concentrated at the start of the story since things need to be introduced to the reader at a much more immediate pace.

  I've asked for this before quite a while ago, but I'm still looking for more:

  Dies anyone know any good crossover fanfics in which one or more intelligent/competent character goes from their own less advanced world into a more advanced one. Caveat: The more advanced one should not be too advanced either. Near future compared to the real world at most.

  Last story I read that fit was [The Dragon King's Temple](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7679074/).
  ```

      Would you say that Stargate knowledge is unnecessary to enjoy that fic?
      ```

      - u/Darkpiplumon:
        ```
        Having read what is written, and having no Stargate knowledge beforehand, I would say it is very much necessary. 
        Don't get me wrong, you can manage with just ATLA knowledge, and the setting and characters are at the very least explained, but I found myself skipping text to reach the character I knew and cared about.
        Having said that, I found it pretty interesting for the two worlds colliding perspective and difficulties with communication.
        ```

      - u/kreschnav:
        ```
        Four chapters in with only ATLA knowledge, and so far I'll say it at least requires a good bit of wiki-walking. I will admit it's making me want to watch Stargate, though.
        ```

      - u/lo4952:
        ```
        I would. The fic goes into plenty of detail about the Stargate cast and the aliens they interact with. I went in knowing only the ATLA side, and never felt particularly confused or lost.
        ```

- u/Dragongeek:
  ```
  Two quick requests:

  - Historical fiction with some supernatural elements. Maybe containing immortals who now have to contend with a suddenly rapidly changing world (Industrial revolution?) and mundane humans gaining more power. Prime example would be *A Journey of Black and Red*

  - "Peggy Sue"-esque books where someone's consciousness goes back in time and overwrites their previous self. Bonus points if there are otherwise no/minimal supernatural elements. Prime example of this would be *Re: Trailer Trash*

  Thanks!

    The Baroque Cycle by Neal Stephenson involves characters involved in the Royal Society, Alchemy, and politics in 16th century Europe. There are some almost magical events, though a lot of it is actually science or economics used by characters who understand them while society as a whole doesn’t yet.

    I only read the first book, but “The Mongoliad” is a series of books about the mongol invasion and the first book made some mythology references but was cagey about whether magic actually happened. It was originally published as some sort of multimedia project but became a written series also.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Ha, spot on with the Baroque cycle! I've read *Cryptonomicon* multiple times and I'm about halfway through *Quicksilver-Odalisque* right now. It's good stuff, and almost exactly what I'm looking for. That said, while I adore Stephenson's style, it can get rather heavy at times, and while it's realistic, the amount of suffering and mister misery that takes place in the past is sometimes nauseating.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        The advice I always give with the baroque cycle is to read it at least until the POV changes from Waterhouse to Jack Shaftoe. That's when the story actually picks up and the plot starts moving.

    Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell

    Novel by Susanna Clarke

    Also adapted recently to TV, though I haven't watched the adaptation.

    It's about magic returning to pre-Victorian england (during the Napoleonic wars). Magic used to have a golden age of sorts, some centuries ago, with more interactions with the fey. I don't recall all the details, but it is very long, very period-piece (with talk of gentlemanly wizards), and has a very authentic feel to it.
    ```

    - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
      ```
      Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is so damn good. One of my favorite books. It starts pretty slow, but picks up a bit once Strange and Norrell meet. The prose is great all the way through though.

    For the second one, there's [*Robert Reforged*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14069888/1/Robert-Reforged), an ASOIAF fanfic.

    >King Robert I Baratheon had a mountain of regrets in his final moments. It took dying to lift the veil from his eyes so he could really see what he had become. He did not know what to expect of the afterlife, but he most certainly did not think he would be charged by the gods, old and new, to go back and fix the mess he had created and to prepare the coming darkness.

    There's also [*Weir Dreams*](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/weir-dreams.429697/), where Ned Stark has a greendream about how events in ASOIAF would normally unfold, and seeks to prevent events from unfolding. It's fun, but the writing isn't that great. Lots of grammatical mistakes. And it hasn't been updated since 2019.
    ```

    [*Replay*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341735.Replay) by Ken Grimwood.

    ```

  I've been really enjoying [The Qi to Immortality](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/55416/the-qi-to-immortality) recently - it's a super new fic but has strong Arrogant Young Master vibes. In this case, though, the main character isn't an AYM but rather a mid-level administrator in a cultivation sect, and he doesn't have any sort of litRPG system, so he's just working off of what resources he can scrounge together and general genre knowledge.

  I am about a third of the way through but am enjoying [Left Beyond Quest](https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/qstarchive.html?tags=left%20beyond). It takes place in the left behind universe 900 years after the rapture. An AI accidentally created by TOL (opposition to Yahweh) from their logistics computer has 100 years to defeat God and stop the end of the world. 

  In the left beyond setting there is also a plan where the Antichrist is an idiot, but the people working for his telecom division (CATS) are smart enough to keep the phones and data lines throughout the literal Apocalypse... which means that they are smart enough to ensure that the Battle of Armageddon technically never ends, by tuning out Jesus' power (the Word of God) with a series of sonic weapons and then locking Him in an airless container.

    i read what's out so far. i'm enjoying it, but it has an incredibly noticeable feel of "MHA with the serial numbers filed off". not saying that's necessarily a bad thing, but it's very apparent what your inspiration was lol
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      When I started reading MHA I got a really strong "[Steelheart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reckoners) except they totally missed the point" vibe, so it's definitely a thing that happens in fiction.
      ```

      - u/Jokey665:
        ```
        I don't remember many specifics from Steelheart or the Reckoners in general. What I do remember boils down to "Worm but significantly less interesting". 

        Which is a shame, because I generally really like Brando Sando's books. But man, if you're going to be similar to Worm you really gotta be incredible or you're just gonna be a disappointment.
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          They both start out with 

          - a powerless protagonist
          - who is obsessed with analyzing people's powers
          - and decides to help someone in a powers-only situation despite not having powers

          In MHA the protag is almost immediately granted powers, which like I said feels like missing the point (but also is super on-brand for the shounen genre, so it's not that bad)
          ```

        - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
          ```
          Huh. Comparing Reckoners to Worm is something that literally would have _never_ occurred to me. Now that you say it, I see the similarity (lots of powers, powered people running amok and ruining society), but I still think they are different enough to not really warrant more comparison than from any two random super-power based stories. There are a _lot_ of differences and I think the two stories are trying to accomplish very different things.

          According to a [2017 Sanderson AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/5t9nyy/iamonce_againa_novelist_named_brandon_sanderson/ddlb8fy/):

          > The only [online novel] I've read anything from is Worm, and while I like it, I haven't gotten very far.

          In addition, since *Worm* was finished in November 2013 and the first volume of the *Reckoners* series was published in September 2013, it seems unlikely that Sanderson was influenced by *Worm*'s worldbuilding. It takes many months for a traditionally published novel to go from completion to publication. The underlying secrets of the *Worm* universe weren't revealed until the last couple of arcs, which means that Sanderson wouldn't have known how the *Worm* universe actually functioned.

  I want to recommend *The Three Body Problem*, by Liu Cixin. It's the first SciFi series I have read by a Chinese writer, and it's quite good. It has a more meandering narrative than most Western books, but you do get used to it. It has excellent world building, a plot where it really does feel like it could go either way, and it introduces new concepts that stay with you. It's hard to say more without spoiling things, but... When things are looking up for the characters it feels well earned and satisfying, and when they're looking down it feels very bleak indeed.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    spoilers below etc

    Only read the first book - the best part is the analysis of the politics of people who would willingly sell out the human race to aliens, which does feel rather realistic. A lot of the book seems too straightforward or just thinking about cool ways to use new technology in a movie, like them setting up a nanotech wire just to split a ship in half and kill a bunch of people before they notice. The most interesting part about the aliens is how they describe needing to operate a computer manually, but they mostly seem to be written to compare themselves with the humans, like in War of the Worlds. Definitely was a mixed bag overall.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      I think the second book is the best out of the three. First half of the third one is great as well, but the second book strikes a good balance between following society's progress through a few time skips without moving too far into the future. I also really like the Dark Forest bits. Most of the philosophically interesting bits are in books 2 and 3.
      ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I have a similar criticism with this book. Actually, almost every time I read a story translated from chinese I get that "too straightforward" feeling. 

      I don't know exactly why it is, but one idea I had was that it feels like the authors are bad(or uninterested) in accurately conveying a believable theory of mind in their characters. As in, the narrative or pov character ascribing a mental state to another on the basis of imperfect information in order to predict/understand their behavior and motivations. 

      Too much theory of mind and the story becomes convoluted and "postmodern", too little and the characters and plot feel flat and linear.
      ```

      - u/AezyDesu:
        ```
        The Three Body Problem is translated by another author, Ken Liu, and he has solid works some of which have won the Hugo and Nebula awards. So in this case at least, it is definitely not the translator doing a poor job.
        ```

        - u/sohois:
          ```
          I believe a lot of the directness is a result of the translation. Indeed, most would probably notice a difference between the 1st and 3rd books, done by Ken Liu, and the 2nd which has a different translator.

          I'd say Ken Liu attempts a quite literal translation of the books. Mandarin is a direct language. The cadence of the writing comes across as very Chinese. With the Dark Forest, there's more of an attempt at localization, the book reads quite comfortably in English. 

          But I don't mean to imply that one of the translations is better or worse. It's a stylistic choice. Liu's translations will definitely be closer to the originals.

  I’ve been on a Dungeon builder binge recently, and while unfortunately I can’t say many, if any are rational, I’d like to know if any experts would have some more good suggestions and recommendations. It’s not a genre I read much of, but I’m extremely interested in them, since there’s so much potential for creating your own dungeon putting your wits and creativity against the lives of adventurers, it’s just unfortunate most of the ones I read bungle it up in some way. Here’s what I read and my thoughts on them.

  The Divine Dungeon- the dungeon building is very well done and creative, although the MC is carried a bit too much by his human advantages. The real issue is that the story is a complete mess as it goes on, in fact I’d even say it devolves to garbage. The human adventurer PoV character is awful, the systems are both cultivation, and the romance and humor are like they’re from a teenager. The author, Dakota, makes a joke where his name is randomly said every volume(“Duh, Kota”).

  Bone Dungeon- The dungeon building is great, with genius things like skeletal fight club, although the story also becomes a mess like TDD’s in similar ways. The writing is subpar too. Alright. Very constrictive progression system too.

  Dungeon Core Online: Remastered Edition- Better dungeon building than Bone Dungeon, same author, although it also has an incredibly awful MC, romance, real world side plot, conflict, and sub par writing. It has its brilliant moments too, like Dickens(Demonic Chickens), but it’s downsides drag it down heavily. 

  Dungeon Core Chat Room- Incredibly amazing experimentation and dungeon building, with some real creative stuff, although there’s almost no human POVs. Very enjoyable, although there’s a lot of writing errors as well.

  And then there’s some other minor ones I’ve read as well, No Epic Loot, Dearth of Choice, Lazy Dungeon Master. Averaging around mediocre.


  Any recommendations, especially for ones that don’t go crazy bad in some way near the end? I did some rudimentary searches and got a lot of results like some dinosaur one and so on, but I have no idea what’s actually good and what I should read first. Any suggestions are appreciated.

    Here's the ones that I'm reading (no fancy markdown links b/c I'm on mobile and feeling lazy):

    * https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16679/the-dungeon-calls-for-a-sage: one of the best but unfortunately the update schedule is super erratic. A whole-ass dungeon gets isekaied, and decides that this time it's going to demand that someone come and explain the meaning of life to it.
    * https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48893/the-dungeon-without-a-system: slightly amoral modern guy gets turned into a fantasy dungeon, lots of experimentation around dungeon stuff and misleading people about how old the dungeon actually is
    * https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47118/dungeon-core-nah-i-think-ill-just-get-super-wealthy: isekaied dungeon guy realizes that making money is the best way to advance with this system, and so decides to commercialize. Unfortunately none of his employees have opposable thumbs and also he's nowhere near anyone who'd want to buy anything. Also has a fairly spotty update schedule.
    * https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/53205/a-dearth-of-choice-dungeon-core: another isekaied dungeon guy (it's a theme ok), but the system forces him into having a dungeon full of undead abominations even though he just wants to be nice. He ends up being pretty successful at it.
    * https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54476/dungeon-life: same dungeon guy Isekai setup, and this guy ends up doing fairly well at playing nice with the locals from the start.

    It's a new story but I've enjoyed what I've read of [Goblin Cave](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54904/goblin-cave).

    Very heavy focus on experimentation, no human POVs

    Blue Core is one of the better dungeon core stories out there, although it does have quite a few sex scenes (which are all labeled and mostly skippable). The premise is that the protagonist starts off as a dungeon core but gets an avenue of growth that is pacifistic rather than concerned with killing things to attain power. There's quite a lot of interesting use of physical phenomena to build and do stuff, as well as some interesting magical science. Overall I'd recommend it, although it does get somewhat slow later on where it pivots to more kingdom building than dungeon building. It's completed.

  I've been reading [*Chasing Dragons*]( https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/chasing-dragons-asoiaf.453741/), an ASOIAF AU where Rhaegar, instead of dying, escapes to Essos, and Ned and Robert start a crusade to bring him to justice.

  The story itself is inspired by [*Summer Crowns*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SummerCrowns), which follows the same initial premise, so it's a fanfic of a fanfic, though the original hasn't been updated since 2018, whereas *Chasing Dragons* is still being updated.

  Both fics were inspired by the following quote:

  >*“Let me tell you a secret, Ned. More than once, I have dreamed of giving up the crown. Take ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer, spend my time warring and whoring, that’s what I was made for. The sellsword king, how the singers would love me.”*
  >- Robert Baratheon, A Game of Thrones


  It's really good so far, the writing is great and the characters interesting. I feel like it is pretty close to GRRM's *The Princess and the Queen*, from a storytelling perspective, and it's a bit more black and white than shades of grey like in ASOIAF, but still true to the source material.

  An older story [Stone Burners](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/53578/stone-burners) has just started posting on royal road, and this version is edited and has good grammer. 

  I read this back when it was being originally posted on the wordpress site, and I enjoyed it. I wouldn’t call it rational, but it was a fun read, and this time its been editied.

  Edit: I forgot to specify anything about this, but it’s a superhero story about basically a half dragon woman (that’s how I understood her powers) who has amnesia.

    Is it titled after the stone burners from *Dune* by any chance?
    ```

    - u/Krakenarrior:
      ```
      I think that’s the idea, but I honestly don’t remember the specifics of the stone burners from *Dune*.

        Pretty sure they were just a high-yield tactical nuke. What a more military franchise might have called a crustbuster.

        But looking at the wiki, there's stuff about them not actually being atomic? Weird.

          The were called pseudo-nuclear weapon IIRC. According to wiki they had some kind of nuclear explosive core and shell around it wich turn most of energy of explosion into exotic radiation. Not dissimilar to some types of neutron bombs.
          ```
