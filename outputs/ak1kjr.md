## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  **Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 8: Copper**

  Ok, week eight of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries, for general overview of the magic system, see [part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/). I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 7 can be found here: [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/af85cz/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/edw9q7a/), [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ahmsgc/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eefzs0m/).

  *Spoiler note*: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

  This weeks metal is copper. As always we're interested in what a copper twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial. This is another metal where the allomantic half doesn't do much if no other allomancers exist, so on earth you'd mostly be stuck with only the feruchemic half (plus compounding).

  **Allomancy**

  Allomantically, copper does two things. First, it makes the user completely immune to mental allomancy. If another allomancer tries to sooth or riot an allomancer burning bronze the effect simply fails. Notably, the soother/rioter is not informed that their attack has failed, nor is the copper allomancer informed that someone tried to influence them. In universe this is seen by at least one character as a  major disadvantage of copper over bronze (which doesn't protect you, but does lets you know someone is trying to influence you).

  Coppers second effect is that it makes the allomancer and everyone in an area around them invisible to bronze allomancers. This area is known as a coppercloud. Allomancer using their powers while their centre of mass is inside a coppercloud do not generate the pulses that bronze allomancers can detect. A coppercloud is always spherical and centred on the copper allomancer, but can be shrunk or grown as desired. Copperclouds work through walls and other obstacles and move with the allomancer that is creating it. The maximum area that can be covered by a coppercloud depends on the strenght of the allomancer, but is typically around the size of a small building. 

  Spoilers: >!An exceptionally powerfull allomancer can pierce both the effects of a copperclouds and the mental protection that copper affords its user, but the difference in power between attacker and defender before this can happen needs to be so large that this is not a concern for most practical purposes.!<

  **Feruchemy**

  Feruchemically, copper stores memories. Storing a memory causes the feruchemist to completely forget that memory. Afterwards, the feruchemist can tap the resulting metalmind to recover the memory. 

  The primary advantage of this ability is that memories stored in a metalmind do not decay over time, when a memory is recovered it will be as fresh in the feruchemists mind as it was the day it was stored even if years have passed in the mean time. This is a big deal especially in a pre-internet society as copper feruchemists can carry around entire libraries worth of information on their person. Only declarative memories can be stored in a coppermind (no skills or muscle memory).

  Repeatedly storing and tapping a memory does slowly degrade it, with this effect being worse the longer the memory spends in your mind, so copper feruchemists typically carry multiple copies of vital information in their metalminds (these can, for instance, be made by having someone repeat the information back to the feruchemist after they stored it). 

  Like any form of feruchemy, copperminds created by one feruchemist cannot be tapped by another feruchemist. This unfortunately means that you can't really use this ability for communication, but it also means that feruchemically stored information is safe from being read by others even if they did manage to get a hold of your metalminds.

  **Compounding**

  Burning a feruchemically charged piece of copper lets you vividly relive the memory stored in that piece of copper. This allows you to store more of that memory in a coppermind (simplifying the process of making backups), but it also allows the compounder to review a memory for things that they missed the first time around.
  ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    Small note on copper compounding: The author has repeatedly refused to comment on what burning feruchemically charged copper actually does (leading some people to assume that it is going to be important for future books) so that section is 100% speculation on my part. 

    Next week we start with the enhancement metals. These are a little odd and I feel they have somewhat less munchkin potential than the others (in that some of them don't actually do anything by themselves), so I'm planning on pairing them up and tackling aluminium/chromium and duralumin/nicrosil together.
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      I'd remove the compounding section and just put your comment about how it's unknown in there. The way it's written now makes it look like the vivid recall is the compounding effect 100%, and opening that space up to speculation could be fun. Copperminds seem good, copperclouding ok, but what could compounding do? What compounding that's thematic could be exploited?

    Copper feruchemists may be very good for jobs that involve confidentiality, such as spies or detectives, or even more peaceful professions like doctors and lawyers. You can hire a copper feruchemist to handle your matters privately, then ask them to store away their memories of you into a piece of copper and give it to you. That way it ensures that they have absolutely no memory of the event and your secrets stay hidden. Then you can throw that piece of copper into a volcano or something to keep it that way.

    The main problem is ensuring that the copper feruchemist truthfully stores the memories into the copper given to you. You can hire a bronze allochemist to check whether the copper feruchemist is storing memories, but you wouldn't be able to tell which memory is being stored. You would need some other method of truth detection.
    ```

    - u/SilverstringstheBard:
      ```
      A sufficiently skilled tin savant could determine the truth of someone's statements by examining micro expressions, tiny changes in heart rate, hormonal secretions, etc.

      Admittedly very few individuals have demonstrated this ability and they were generally outliers in some way.

      On an individual level copper could be used to meaningfully play a game of chess or any other turn based game with yourself by having two separate copper minds for each 'player'. Forgetting your plans and strategies for the other side while deciding your move, storing all that away and drawing from your other coppermind.
      ```

      - u/RetardedWabbit:
        ```
        I wonder if memory storage recursion and lying to yourself would effect "truthfulness" to get around this? You would have to have access to a hidden coppermind to try these in addition to the one they actually want you to put the memory in.

        Store it inside a coppermind, asked about it = lying

        Store the memory of storing it = you don't know? Will probably show confusion/unsure?

        Before removing the storing memory think about how glad you are you honestly stored it, remove the storing memory but not that one = will truthfully think you stored it in the right one? Or will that memory retain an inprint that you were lying to yourself?

        Potential munchkin: convince yourself of almost anything? If lying to yourself then storing the truth makes you believe the lie.

        100% innocent acting - if accused of a crime, you actually did, store all memories of it so you react to the accusations 100% naturally and can't slip up during questioning.

        100% perfect acting - create secondary goals then store the primary ones until you complete them so you act and behave perfectly heartfelt. Example: I want to spy on x, create secondary of "I want to become friends with x, then recall y memory" then store the spying motivating memories until you're friends aka when you can truly act on them. This probably requires someone to assign you the spying task so the motivational memories are small.

        Copper feruchemists are also a philosophical/personhood nightmare, chopping off and overwriting their own personalities.

      Ooh this is cool. 

      > The main problem is ensuring that the copper feruchemist truthfully stores the memories into the copper given to you.

      That is a problem, yeah, but if you can trust the other person at the moment they give you the memories, this at least ensures that nobody will be able to bride/threaten/torture the secrets out of them later (and this is also at least some incentive for the feruchemist to give you the real memories).

      > You can hire a bronze allochemist to check whether the copper feruchemist is storing memories, but you wouldn't be able to tell which memory is being stored. 

      While using bronze to sense feruchemy is possible, it's also extremely hard and no one on Scadrial has figured out how to do it yet (at least not in Era 1). 

      I don't believe I mentioned it in part one and two, but metalminds are harder to move with allomancy than regular metal, so you could test that the piece of copper is an actual metalmind by getting a sufficiently sensitive steel or iron allomancer to push/pull on it. That still has the same problem of not telling you what memory was stored in the metalmind though.

    This series really encourages me to pick the books back up to see how our speculations line up with canon characters.

    I have some knowledge of neuron structuring, brain plasticity, and mnemonic techniques and everything I know points towards most munchkin attempts of memory not working but it's a different world so who knows.

    Metacoppermind - anything I can think of depends on the ability to keep memories distinctly separate and organized, in trees of memories you've stored. Create and maintain a system to ensure you know what you don't know (stored) and what memories you should tap in what order to relearn skills.

    Literally Photographic memory - write anything you need to know onto paper in chunks that you can write in a few seconds. Keep those chunks well organized and you can tap, write the info, store, and then read what you wrote with minimal decay. Use the newly written info to create a new storage when it starts getting weak. Effects: perfect recall and restorage of any flashcard sized info so long as you can rewrite it.

    No knowledge decay: store any memories you don't immediately need, ensuring you can perfectly recall them later. You can potentially do this every night with almost all memories depending on how memory reconsolidation and brains work in this world.

    Copper shout spreading - with multiple copper feruchemists you can do some crazy memory spreading, and the scaling is crazy. If you can recall and tell multiple copperminds info you can effectively magnify information recall and spreading. A group can effectively study/research different topics all day then condense practical information into short bites they can teach each other at the end of the day so everyone can store important parts and also learn them to help future research.

    Actual learning research - find the absolute best way to teach a coppermind by teaching them something, testing, having them store everything taught, and repeating with different techniques. Everyone probably learns a bit differently, but this would still be a huge boon to refine general teaching and especially specific topics.

    PTSD/Trauma/Boredom resistance - store harmful memories and never recall them. Anything you can psychologically handle until you get to your coppermind you can handle indefinitely by storing it. You can forget any pain in the past.

    Brainwash yourself - store huge amounts to make yourself a blank slate to become a spy, or remove memories that you believe have shaped you for the worse. 

    Psychological addiction removal - addicted to something? Store every positive memory of it to truly lose the urge to use it. You can even use this to get through withdrawal, just forget what could stop the withdrawls and you won't have to resist doing it to stop the symptoms.

    Looking at my list I believe there's a huge potential to munchkin the selective amnesia abilities of this once you get past the perfect temporary recall abilities.

      > Looking at my list I believe there's a huge potential to munchkin the selective amnesia abilities of this once you get past the perfect temporary recall abilities.

      Yeah, this is definitely one of the metals where storing is a whole superpower on its own. 

      > Psychological addiction removal - addicted to something? Store every positive memory of it to truly lose the urge to use it. You can even use this to get through withdrawal, just forget what could stop the withdrawls and you won't have to resist doing it to stop the symptoms.

      I wonder if that would work, there is a kind of temptation to forbidden fruits and knowing that you once liked doing it enough to get addicted to it might be sufficient incentive to give it another try. 

      I suppose you could erase the knowledge of what you were addicted to, but then you run the risk of repeating whatever started the addiction the first time around. 

      > Brainwash yourself - store huge amounts to make yourself a blank slate to become a spy 

      The downside of this is that you run the risk of becoming the protagonist in one of the most lazy and cliched plotlines known to man.

      Fuck though. Now I want to read a story where we see a feruchemist just going about their life, and they got a whole library of labelled memories, some of which with copies that they know of etc. Then one day they tap something weird or something around the house and just get /phat/ PTSD.
      ```
