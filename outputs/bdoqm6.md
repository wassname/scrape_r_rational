## Worth the Candle Audiobook project

### Post:

Hey all. I've much enjoyed Worth the Candle and loved that  a fan of HPMoR (Eneasz Brodski with others) created an audiobook series of it as a podcast. Would anyone like to do the same with me? I do not yet have any professional recording devices, but if there's enough interest (kickstarter for example) I'd buy equipment to make it higher quality. Would love for help for different voices

  I have a lot of concerns about an audiobook project, partly in terms of quality, partly in terms of the inevitable liberties that are taken with the work in any adaptation. I'm not going to be involved in any audiobook project (no time or interest), so it would be kind of scary to have something out there with my name on it which I haven't vetted and don't control, more so with an audiobook than with something like fanfic, which is more explicitly separate from the main work.

  There's also the question of rights; as others in this thread have pointed out, *Worth the Candle* is a copyrighted work, same as any other published work, it's just that it's also free online, and my legal department is non-existent. The primary concern there *for me* is that proliferation of the work means that it will effectively be impossible/difficult to monetize. It would be a bummer if a professional audiobook couldn't be made because it would be in direct competition with a freely available fan-produced one. (How much of a bummer that ends up being really depends on contrast in quality; in my experience, things produced for free are usually of lower quality than the things that are produced by paid professionals. Yes, that includes *Worth the Candle* itself, which would probably be quite a bit better if it had the attention of an editor that I can in no way afford without a publication company backing me.)

  Okay, all that said, there's no way that I would actively (or passively) stop someone from doing an audiobook, especially when there's no financial incentive for me to do so, and no prospect of me doing a competing audiobook anytime soon, free or otherwise. I'd just hope that every effort was made to ensure that it tried to adhere to the heart of the work and maintained an appropriate level of quality.

  (I'm glossing over the upsides of having an audiobook version of the work, I know, but those are less important than the potential downsides.)

    Well I can't say I'm not disappointed, but I understand your reservations and you make valid points. Is there any amount of money you think you'd be happy for a professional voice acting group to be paid through a KickStarter for you to not be unhappy with an audiobook being created? Alternatively, any amount of money given to you for the liberty of using your work to create an audiobook by this community, to compensate for the money you would receive for a professional audiobook creation (now stymied as you say through competition with the free version)? Perhaps in this case, we'd do the first chapter and before publishing it, get your approval that the quality was sufficient? 

    Thanks for responding, and sorry if this is a headache you didn't want to deal with üò¨

  If you can get decent amateur voice actors, I‚Äôd back a Kickstarter. Not so keen if it‚Äôs a bunch of randos.

  EDIT: also, you obviously need Alexander Wales‚Äôs permission! You need to do some kind of basic copyright course if you think just putting something on the web means it‚Äôs ‚Äúcopyright free‚Äù.

    Agreed

  Have you talked to /u/AlexanderWales
  ```

  - u/AspiringUtilityBot:

    No. Meant to mention this. I assumed because it was on archoveofourown it was copyright free, like HPMoR. Willing to be corrected; don't want to step on toes

      HPMoR is fanfiction; Worth the Candle is original fiction. Technically both have copyright, but since HPMoR is a derivative work, it would be sort of hypocritical for big Yud to be against recursively derivative works (provided they make no money), and indeed there are a number of HPMoR fanfics. WtC, however, being original, confers no such expectation that the author is OK with derivative works, monetized or otherwise. I don't *think* Alexander Wales would be against your project, but you better ask him just to be sure.

        I sent him a DM. Ty for your input

      Free isn't the same as copyright-free.

      When you create something it is automatically protected by copyright. It isn't necessary to register or monetise a work for for the author to own copyright although it may lead to additional protection.

      It varies by country too but the above is usually the case AFAIK.

  I'm trying to get into voice acting so I'm down. What equipment/recording software are you looking at?
  ```

  - u/AspiringUtilityBot:
    ```
    Not sure yet. Was waiting on interest before investing time in research. My friend who does podcasts uses Audacity editing software so I'd try that. Will look up best microphones

  ```
  Assuming we get buyoff from the author, I would be willing to contribute. I've done some voice work and have some acting experience although it's been awhile; I'd be happy to audition if proof of talent is required.
  ```

  - u/AspiringUtilityBot:
    ```
    Thanks for the willingness :) I'll let you know when/if we get permission
    ```

  ```
  I would love to see this done and maybe contribute my voice to it if you'll accept people with no experience.
  ```

  - u/AspiringUtilityBot:
    ```
    Depends on whether it's funded. There seems to be an inclination against people without prior experience if it's funded. Thanks for the interest! I'll keep you in mind if it's a free project :)

  Worth the Candle is on my to-read list. I would love to listen to it.

  I'd love to see this if AlexanderWales approves.
