## Terrible Superpower: Time Edition.

### Post:

Not sure if this is the right place to do this, but me and a friend often have weird little thought experiments, and last night we got on the topic of slowing time powers. Really cool and powerful if they function right, but what if they don't?

I proposed that his power is: Your body and perceptions are drastically sped up, to the point where 1 second in real time is 1 hour to you. Fortunately, you are also rendered ageless. Unfortunately, you can't turn this power off. You are forever stuck existing at this speed.

Now, we typically put things in so that you don't just die from existing, or it'd be pretty boring. So your power effects physics enough that nothing crazy happens there. No spontaneous combustion from moving, no mach punches accidentally shattering your limbs. I'm not sure if such classifications are possible in the real world, mind you.

So basically the question is this:

Can you survive without going mad? Is there a productive and "heroic" thing you can use this power for?

  Assuming that we handwave away things like inability to move, and say that somehow your caloric needs are the same (which is to say, real time, rather than you-time) so basically you just have 3600 hours of free time for every hour that passes in real life, and you don't need to eat, sleep, etc during that time, then we have a start. 

  This will also ignore issues like being able to open/close doors, and so on. We will not ignore issues of computers, though. Computer use will basically be impossible, and you'll be much better off walking to libraries, or doing original research yourself, than using computers for most things.

  The first thing you'll need to do is look up things like abacus and mechanical calculators that are hand-operated. Slide rulers would be good. We're assuming your aura of "this object starts operating by my physics rather than realtime physics" extends to things you're touching (which is reasonable because you need to be able to move your clothes and open doors and stuff without causing instant plasma and fusion). So we start experimenting and looking for the largest objects you can interact with and "pull" into your physics.

  We'll do things to track time within our physics, too. A mechanical watch kept pressed against the skin, perhaps. 

  If we can get a mechanical typewriter working, that's great. With an abacus, a slide ruler, a mechanical calculator (if it works) and a mechanical typewriter, we're ready to get started living. First off, although the internet is right out, there's tons of reading to do. Take all the time you never had to read and learn literature, physics, philosophy, life sciences, and history. Go and see the sights. Do what you want. 

  Take time and read more. Get the equivalent of bachelor's degree level knowledge in all the fields you can think of, and go further in as many as you can. Become the impossible modern polymath. Learn to read and write in all the major languages, and ancient ones, too.

  Read encyclopedias and textbooks. Learn indexing. Learn library science and paper organization methods.

  Begin your career. Write. Write fiction and nonfiction and philosophy and art. Write science. Write your experiences.

  Index everything carefully and present it well. Tables of contents, careful bookbinding, summary papers, documents, and even summary books will be important. If you want, start by translating texts and documents between Mandarin and English. Or just go where your mind takes you. Write a dozen books, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, write until everything has been said, and then some. Carefully catalog everything and make summaries. Make the diligent indexing nature of your work, the process, and the orderliness itself part of your nature. Know that when you lose your mind, you will lose it to order, not chaos. Decree that when you do imperceptibly go over to the madness, you preserve your early works. 

  Let your insanity be the insanity of right angles and catalog cards and preservation, rather than destruction.

  All this learning, all this writing, it's the work of an entire life, more than entire life. You'll be an expert in every subject matter, and have written more than any human ever has. The task before you, the total cataloging and synthesis of humankind's knowledge, is monumental. None would dare even begin to try it alone, armed with only mechanical tools. This doesn't bother you, though. 

  You have all the time in the world.

    Why are you limited to mechanical tools? If a mechanical watch on your wrist functions, why shouldn't a digital watch? If you can extend the time aura over an abacus, why not a calculator? If a mechanical typewriter, why not a word processor on a ~~computer~~ laptop? 

    The *internet* would be glacial, but you can use digital equipment offline. It is possible.
    ```

    - u/blazinghand:
      ```
      I'm assuming you can only directly transfer like, force or something, and winding a watch counts as doing that.

        ```
        That's the idea, yeah.

        Extrapolating, even at 3600x subjectively slower, computer calculations -should- be faster than mechanical ones, right?

        Or is the issue that there exists no interface that would work well for you without it being specifically designed as such? I'm not sure what, say, the response rate is on the fastest keyboard / mouse that currently exists.
        ```

        - u/blazinghand:
          ```
          A high-end gaming keyboard could have a polling rate of like 1000hz, which would be about 4 seconds. If you set that up with a very fast-polling gaming mouse and a fast computer running a lightweight linux (hopefully you already have one, otherwise it's probably faster to steal one) you could make something happen. one keystroke per 4 seconds, or 15 keystrokes per minute, would let you program, but you'd still be very slow. If you were smart about it and planned out your programming carefully, a computer running in realtime could definitely help you.
          ```

            Besides interesting questions about what this does to language choice and the tradeoff between CPU and programmer time...

            I'd be willing to bet that you could get to a 'normal' response speed by throwing enough money at the computer, though it would look like something from a past era.  Custom-built keyboard and mouse.  Lightweight/realtime custom Linux distro.  240Hz monitor for color, and a custom CRT for real-time-to-you monochrome terminal interface.  With care and a good deal of money, I'm confident you could get about a 1995 computer (with better software etc) at 3,600 times normal speed.

              Could you build all of that on your own, though? Right down to the level of the chips? Because if Intel designed a new chip for you and set up a new production line as fast as humanly possible--let's say a year, soup to nuts--that would be about three and a half millennia to you.

                For a million dollars, I could probably do it in a week.

                The core is just standard-but-expensive desktop hardware - it's special because of crazy-high-speed peripherals and special software, which you can substantially write yourself if available options aren't enough.

                    I've recently designed a similar computer tower for my local bio/ecology lab - the brief was "our software needs more cycles thrown at it".  And it actually does need that, being bound by storage, io, memory, CPU, and GPU; it's the kind of hardware that you usually look at and decide there's never going to be a case where the marginal performance is worth the difference.  Except when used for structure-from-motion processing of forest-scale image sets, and VR visualisation for the resulting data, that is.

  ```
  I had a guy like that in a superhero setting that never really got off the ground. His super-speed just sort of got stuck, and the physics of it was such that it just seemed like everything was moving really slowly.

  So yeah, assuming that you can still interact with the world in a meaningful way, then you're golden. My guy set up special computer monitors for himself so that he could view them without the refresh rate making it unintelligible, and of course there are lots of books to read. He used tape recorders to leave messages for people, and special equipment to speed up speech to the level that he could actually hear it. His ability to respond nigh-instantly to local disasters made him a hero - he could rush into a burning building and extract people from it (suiting up in milliseconds to avoid smoke inhalation). He could respond to gunshots as soon as they happened through the microphone system around the city. And he could kill anyone who really deserved it by slitting their throat, which meant that he didn't *need* mach speed punches.

  He didn't actually have an immunity to starvation though, so much of his effort was put towards fulfilling his ~x3,600 dietary needs. His other big problem was staying sane - mostly accomplished through having tons and tons of pen pals (that were, from their perspective, communicating in realtime).

    hm. I guess eating for 3,600 people would be an issue in of itself.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Yeah, if you figure that a person spends maybe $240 a week on food, that means that the food budget for the year is $45 million, which is a whole lot of money. Depending on what the hero does though, he might be worth it (he's definitely worth it if he's the only one with any superpowers).

      Logistically speaking, he needs to eat every eight real-world seconds, which is a bigger issue. I imagine pallets of MREs and bottled water disappearing at a steady rate from his base of operations. The logistics of waste management are also something to consider - the average person urinates 0.8 liters to 2.0 liters per day, which becomes a torrent when it's happening at 3,600 speed. Special facilities are required for our protagonist.
      ```

      - u/want_to_want:
        ```
        Our protagonist needs the same amount of facilities as 3600 regular people. That's not too much. An army base would suit him fine, and in a big city he'd be a rounding error.

        There are other problems, though.

        1) What about breathing? Ambient air pressure won't supply you with enough air in time. Without special equipment, you suffocate immediately. With special equipment, everyone around you is going to experience some strong air currents.

        2) What about heat transfer? The molecules around you are moving 3600 times slower. That feels the same as a near-absolute-zero environment, so you quickly freeze to death. If you counteract that by making your power act as a heat source, then the people standing next to you are cooked in seconds.

        3) What about the shockwaves that follow you wherever you go? Your walking speed is supersonic. Sure, try standing still for a moment. You're still moving your chest when you breathe, and your heart is still beating. That's already a staggering amount of sound energy escaping every second, because it scales with the square of speed. And God forbid you clap your hands!

        4) What about traction? Gravity is 3600 times weaker. Making a normal step throws you kilometers up, and jumping takes you to orbit. You're also leaving large gashes in any surface you try to walk on, even diamond.

        5) What about material objects, like clothes? Let's be generous and say the superpower is transferred by touch, and then cancelled when the touch stops. That means touching any object, including the ground, will create shrapnel that can kill bystanders. At least the ones who are not already dead due to points 1-3.

        6) What about interacting with bigger objects? Pop quiz, what happens when you try to open a door? Depending on how far your superpower is transferred, you might melt the door handle, or rip the lock out of the door, or blast the door off the hinges, or any number of other things.

        All in all, this superpower turns you into a human-sized wrecking ball, which moves impossibly fast and constantly emits deadly amounts of noise, heat, and shrapnel. A kind of self-propelled explosion.

    If he has super efficiency, he doesn't need to eat that much. If he doesn't have super efficiency, he has waste heat that he has to deal with. And if he's not fireproof, you have to keep him at a survivable temperature while draining that much heat.

  Well, it's not entirely your scenario, but the first couple chapters of [this](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/34152071413/flicker-phone-tag) completed web serial do a good job of showing how potenitally powerful this ability could be. Your hero wouldn't be nearly that fast, but some of the ideas still work. In particular, a high speed computer to do google searches for you sounds like a good idea. Building it in the first place would be a pain, but worth after it let you interact with the internet.

  If only my perceptions are sped up, then yes I can imagine going mad almost instantly. Being stuck in a body 3600 times slower than my mind would be intellectually excruciating. A single day would feel like almost ten years. Traveling across a street at a run would take subjective hours.

  Worse, there'd be 3600 times less light with which to view everything... probably less given that visible light would hit my eyes with a frequency like deep radio and what few higher frequency emissions the sun produces, the atmosphere likes to block. Sound would be just as warped and diminished, frequency so low as to be inaudible. Deaf and blind, I'd be sense-limited to taste, smell, and touch. With the temporal difficulties I would find myself profoundly alone.

  Speeding up my body only helps a little, since now my mass would be travelling with great momentum and my blind flailings would be terrifyingly destructive. If I can be destroyed, I would be, by any force for good and mercy the world could manage.
  ```

    You should still be able to see. The retina isn't sped up. The frequency of what effects the photosensitive molecule doesn't change. And I mean, for the sake of the story you have to assume the body accommodates basic sensory and motor stuff to remain mostly functional. (If not, you immediately die of hyperventilation)

    Also, why would you *ever* walk down a street? It's not like you urgently need to extend your life expectancy by exercising, it's already really long in subjective time. (If you must - sprint on a treadmill for 10 minutes and work simultaneously, you've got the motor coordination for it)

     People will accommodate you once they know what you can do. Gadgets to make communication and writing keep up better with your faster motor control. Maybe you can talk to 1000 people simultaneously for company, it won't be the same but it's something, akin to getting several letters  everyday in the mail.

    Except for the extra lifespan, it wouldn't be as good as normal, but it wouldn't be hell either. I'd consider it. Maybe if I work hard enough I can speed up others too, I have lifespans to learn. It would not be fun in the short run but it would be for the greater good.

    I imagine for a personality more quiet and introverted than mine it wouldn't be so bad at all.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      > Also, why would you ever walk down a street?

      It could take days for people to set up your work rig. Do you expect to just sit there twiddling your thumbs for subjective decades while you wait?

  ```
  I imagine with the food budget Alexanderwales mentioned, there would be issues with cost. You would need a lucrative job if you didn't want to steal.

  Government work is an option here. Logistics is your superpower. Imagine if the moment a crisis happened you could instantly upon receiving the information collate all the information on what has happened and get everything needed to all the right people. 

  Basically set it up so in any potential situation needing a rapid response people can contact you through an email or message system. As soon as they get the message off you're on the scene and everyone who needs to knows about it through exhaustively documented reports. It won't probably work for instant disasters like bombs, but it works for lots of other things. Examples are tornados, terrorist attacks, flash floods, wars, espionage, intelligence coordination (You would be terrifying at this).

  Isn't this basically just Quicksilver?

  >So your power effects physics enough that nothing crazy happens there. 

  If what's happening to your body is, subjectively and from your perspective, 'nothing crazy', then something *quite extraordinarily* crazy is in fact going on with the underlying physics. Differential time rates between observers without a substantial gravitational gradient or velocity difference is simply Not Allowed.

  The question I'd be trying hardest to answer is: just what the *hell* is going on with my body? How can it possibly be doing what it appears to be doing? What's the nature of the effect, what is its *boundary*? If I swallow a watch, does it start running 3600 times faster? Is gravity accelerating me downwards at 36,000 m/s/s? If so why don't I hit the ground with unfathomably horrific force from a twelve-inch jump, and if not why can't I [jump into orbit](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28escape+velocity%29%2F3600)? If I spit, does my *saliva* fall at ten meters per second per second or at thirty-six thousand m/s/s?

  The prospect of running experiments with water clocks filled with my own excreta is not an appealing one, but I could easily see it being necessary.

  >Is there a productive and "heroic" thing you can use this power for?

  Ultimately, if you can figure out what makes you ageless and apply it to another person, you have just cured Death. And if you can figure out how to harness and manipulate the time-acceleration phenomenon that applies to you, you've just given mankind an almost unimaginably powerful technology.
