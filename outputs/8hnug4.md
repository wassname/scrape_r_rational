  ```
  I think Sydria is the one who got Dream Eater to put the geas on Seti. DE never said it was a vivamancer who sent her, so she could have been someone Sydria knows.
  ```

  - u/rhaps0dy4:
    ```
    So that she could spend some time with her helpless brother and help him?

    Shit just got real in this chapter. Seti abandoning his family completely? I suppose the life his family provides is really not what he wants, but still. I feel quite bad for Sydria, Seti has expressed zero gratitude for anything she has done for him.
    ```

- u/Draconomial:
  ```
  It got a bit confusing, who was saying what.

    ```
    \^This.

    Also, way too much exposition for one chapter :\(
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      I agree with both points, but overall this was still a pretty good chapter.
      ```
