## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  So, my Pathfinder group in the 'party of Kobolds attempts to become legitimate citizens' campaign (http://i.imgur.com/Ex8ujQW.png) I'm currently running has, almost accidentally, begun the Starfish Singularity. ...Let me explain.

  For context, when they first set out from their dead dragon-ruler's lair, they looted an artifact-grade seed from his treasure vaults, and planted it in the center of their town. Over the months, this has grown into a fairly gigantic tree with the ability to take on and blend together the traits of other plants they graft into it (this is kind of a bio-punk sort of world, where mages can extract traits from plants/animals and hybridized them into others over enough generations, leading to uplifted familiar-grade messenger birds, gryphon-mounted strike-force knights/postal workers/tax collectors, and the whole human/elf/dwarf/halfling genetic clusterfuck. This also explains where half the D&D monster manual comes from). To make a long and world-optimizing story short, they immediately went out and found the largest redwood trees they could and combined them with the artifact-tree, resulting in a 5 mile tall living superstructure that led a nearby pseudo-nation of shared-subconscious-linked druids and awakened animals to be split amongst whether such a sacred thing as this world-tree should be shared by all or cleansed of such interlopers as the party. 

  Now, an insurgency of druids is a terrifying thing when you live amid the roots of a titanic tree - any animal could be about to drop some *fire seed* IEDs or turn into a swarm of bears - and there was no centralized form of government to negotiate with or fight back against. Not all of the druids were hostile or accepting of those that were, however, and some Bardic Knowledge and Diplomacy on the part of the party got some of those they captured around to their side and figured out that convincing enough of the not-quite-hivemind would pressure the attacks into stopping... 

  One of the randomly rolled awakened druid animals they captured was a Starfish. OK, I thought, this isn't too implausible, their town is on a river, they have docks and the like. So they persuade the Starfish to go along with their plan. 

  'We made that pool of healing, right?' Yeah, I say, trepidation growing. 

  'And if a creature that has natural regeneration was placed in it, it would make sense that it could help speed that up, right?' I can't see any reason it wouldn't, I say, my voice cracking as their plan becomes obvious. 

  So they start cutting this awakened, consenting, druid-leveled Starfish into pieces in a healing pool, continually, in order to forkstorm the Druidic collective's value system. I love my players, but FML.

    As one of your players, I feel obligated to point out that we did go out of our way to arrange anesthesia for our volunteer. Also, you forgot about the god that we managed to more-or-less tie into the tree...

    Buahahah! Thanks, that's great!

    Thanks, that made my week.

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    Hmmm....I think I'm missing the point of horror. Is that that they're going to have an endless army of starfishes? And that the healing pool is now an instant heal because the tree has taken on the regenerative properties of all the starfish pieces? Also what does forkstorm mean?

    In hindsight, I think it's just easier for me to admit I know very little about D&D (All of my D&D knowledge comes from reading the 2YE and being a general nerd, never played a game of it in my life). So explain it to me like I'm five, please :P
    ```

    - u/Xjalnoir:
      ```
      The horror here is that they're creating a swarm-mind of an unbounded number of Starfish, each capable of casting Druid spells, and that with all of these additional friendly minds influencing the wider Druid collective subconscious, it'll 'outvote' the other druids. This is what forkstorming is: it's an idea from the likes of Eclipse Phase or other settings where you can fork your consciousness (admittedly, I'm pretty sure I made up the term itself, but the strategy is obvious), and you just do it constantly so that you win (be it votes or fights) by sheer, weaponized *demographics* after outnumbering your opponents 1000 to 1.

      No, they haven't tried grafting the Starfish into the tree, stop giving them ideas!
      ```

      - u/Kishoto:
        ```
        Also cool, I get the basic premise: it would be like if you found a way to indefinitely clone yourself AND argue to the government that each of your clones gets a vote; you essentially now control the presidential election.
        ```

        - u/Chronophilia:

          Exactly!
          ```

      - u/Kishoto:
        ```
        Lmao, it just seems like the logical next step! The tree would essentially become indestructible unless you could take out the entire structure at once, as its regeneration would (presumably) simply go faster and faster the more starfish they graft. And, as you pointed out, they have an essentially unlimited amount of said starfish. Shit is really gonna hit the fan if the pool's regeneration also benefits and they can grow said pieces of starfish at exponentially faster speeds!
        ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        > No, they haven't tried grafting the Starfish into the tree

        Next, they can graft one magical starfish into another magical starfish, creating a magical starfish^2. Repeat until they have have created a magical starfish god, whether that comes in at ^10 or ^1,00,000. 

        That should work, right? >:P
        ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        Also you now have to deal with the first large community of forked minds. Are they going to form their own culture? Will they choose to go through randomly-generated experiences so that the minds differentiate enough that they aren't in constant competition for the *exact same* things? Will some who experience trauma "go rogue"?

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    That sounds like something that would push the most independent hostile druids to cut themselves from the hive-mind, potentially using violent brain altering, or cursing their own magic or something. They would them form an underground resistance movement, dedicated to capturing other druids, and "freeing" them from the conquered hive-mind's influence, "persuading" them to join their worthy cause thanks to the "liberating" influence of Meelef'ik the Banished Elder God.

    Hmm, after reading this, I suppose I can see why /u/AlexanderWales wishes he had named the subreddit /r/rational_fiction. I personally love that the "ulterior motive" of some fiction is to make the world a better place one reader at a time, but I can see how some would just want the literature that this results in.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      I understand that there is a mix in what people want out of the sub, but honestly the sneaky education aspect is a huge draw for me too. Much of what is linked here I just read for entertainment, and what I want to sneak into my own writing is as much about what I consider good political and philosophical values as good habits of reason, but the frank discussion of what makes for good educational fiction is very helpful.
      ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:

      Shouldn't we be able to coordinate a mass-moving over to any sub we choose? If our credo of "doing better" etc is worth anything, such a relatively small coordination problem should be easy.

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    I'm here for the fiction as well, and I would like to thank this community for making me a fanfiction reader. I didn't understand the point before HPMoR; now I do, and I'm working my way through FimFiction and AO3.

    Fanfiction is definitely overrepresented here, but maybe that's just because Mother Of Learning is skewing the data.

      It's a lot easier for someone to see a broken setting and fix it, then it is to come up with an unsullied one from whole cloth.
      ```

      - u/InfernoVulpix:
        ```
        It's also more potent, often.  When you've read the source material, you already have connections to these characters and the world, and caring about them comes naturally.  Original stories like Mother of Learning had to work to make me care about Zorian and Zach, but when I read a Pokemon fanfic caring about our trainer from Pallet Town is like sliding into a pleasant groove well-worn by the games, anime, and the fanfics prior to this one.

        The whole effect is that any inspired person can tap into this groove and make their story satisfying by merit of their plot-writing skills, without needing an assortment of worldbuilding skills to supplement it.  It also attracts an already-existing fanbase of people hungry for variations of their beloved canon, so feedback is easier to reach as well.
        ```

        - u/Aretii:
          ```
          And even Mother of Learning piggybacks on your existing familiarity with high fantasy pseudo-D&D settings, and to a lesser extent with Groundhog Day-style setups and the attendant cliches (cf. Zach's comments about his experience with the different girls in class).

          I'll be honest: I mostly *don't* care about Zorian and Zach (though I do care about Kirielle, and I adore Kana). My investment in MoL is for the plot and the metaphysics.

  Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [Handy discussion links and previous threads here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing).


  ----


  Lots more discussion this week, but less code.  I’m going to set aside the two or three prototypes that are in various states of disrepair and drill down on the design documents.  I wanted to have them done by the new year, which is still a reasonable goal but not if I’m juggling other things at once.  Got to get the border of the jigsaw puzzle done, so to speak, so I know where we stand, before we start filling in arbitrary spots that might not even fit within the whole thing.


  ----


  Spent a lot of time futzing about with a crafting system (which was when I realized the docs should be finished first), which owes a lot to the more abstract tool-property system that /u/Nighzmarquls is designing for his game.  The basic idea is that the player will eventually be able to craft/research their own pokeballs--rather than always buying the same five or six preset balls, different properties can be prioritized (such as lock speed, weight, damage resistance), limited only by one’s engineering skills, materials, and ingenuity.

  What I would *like* is some element of randomized hidden information, similar to the ring/wand/scroll system in Nethack, [which I praised in my rational games document for permitting the existence of a metagame within a single player title](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit).  If a pokeball is made up of, say, ten different components, and on each run through we give them randomized technobabble names and have them affect different stats, would this permit the same amount of Science as Nethack?  Perhaps, but then it raises questions of how the player is able to finely tune a particular component without even knowing its purpose. 


  There’s *something* there, but for now I’m going to just pencil in “crafting/research system” and worry about the details later.  It’s not a *central* system in the game, but it would be nice to permit the player a bit of customizing freedom.


  ----


  A lot of words were typed concerning Ditto’s ability to transform.  As it turns out, there are a handful of related potential powers--one of the Legendaries supposedly in canon has the power to force mindswaps between two individuals, and on top of that the Jirachi wish system could be used to transform the player into a pokemon, if they decide to make such an ill-advised course of action.  All together this tells me that we need some sort of engine-supported means of having one creature basically “wear” the body of another.  

  (This would be no problem at all if transformations were always *permanent*.  In that case you just copy the stats over and you’re done--but if we want to be able to preserve and *revert* to a “true” form, then it demands we organize our code a certain way).  


  As part of the ramifications of this system, all stats are going to have a factor determining how much of that stat resides in the Body and how much of it resides in the Mind.  Height, for instance, is 100/0 Body/Mind, while Defense is 80/20 and Accuracy is 50/50.


  ----


  As a tangent to the discussion on transformation, the subject of Mega evolutions again came up (since it can use the system), with about five different major ways of handling it:

  1. just like canon, temporary, fleeting, and spammable

  2. super boost, wears out the pokemon and they die

  3. super boost, puts them in a coma afterwards, need to recup for a couple weeks and are unusable during this period (thanks to /u/DaystarEld)

  4. mix of 2 + 3: wears them out and kills them if they don't receive medical attention

  5. a permanent 4th evolution


  In the end, I think that option 4 has the best mix of options.  Mega evolutions are therefore exposure to a super-evolution stone, basically, which causes the pokemon to mutate to unbelievably high power levels.  This will eventually kill the pokemon in question, with the time frame available being inversely proportional to how much they use their newfound power.  However, players who first obtain a matching super-everstone will have the ability to completely revert the changes, which leaves the pokemon comatose--but alive.


  In a nod to the canon lip-service about powerful bond (which they had no problem ignoring, but still), we could also say that mega evolutions permanently subtract some of the rapport that you’ve built up with your pokemon--so if you try using it on a brand-new pokemon, you’ll find yourself with an absolutely uncontrollable beast, but even anything but the strongest of bonds will result in a rampage of some sort.


  ----


  Some other miscellaneous conclusions we came to:


  * Types will likely come associated with certain stats.  It might surprise you to find that Onix only has 15 DEF, but because of his 50/30/20 Rock/Ground/Normal typing, it ends up getting a bonus, say 200 DEF on top of its completely type-agnostic base stats.  This is a shift, but allows for things like alternate typing and breeding a type in or out of a bloodline, with appropriate effects.


  * From the beginning we’ve followed the Origin of Species governmental division, with Leaders being essentially the military commander of a city with a separate Mayor who leads politically.  We have, however, decided to merge the two, with the understanding that a Leader typically keeps the old cabinet and administration.  This permits the player the ability to take over a town if they so wish, without needing to build in a weaksauce paperwork simulator as a counterpart to being Leader.


  * Names of some stats have been shifted around: Initiative is no more; SPD now represents how frequently/effectively a pokemon takes their turn, MOV represents how much movement a pokemon has available, and moves are in general being renamed to Actions or something similar.

      The easiest solution I could think of for Ditto's stat copy would be to give each unique Pokemon it's own numerical ID (something you'll want anyway) and just copy the Pokemon for a few turns. (or minutes, real time) Alternatively, each Pokemon has a body ID and a mind ID, which make up mental and physical attributes (is that what you were talking about). That allows you to carry certain other stats, like obedience and intelligence, over between possessions/bodies.
      ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        The current plan is to keep a reference to the true Body and a reference to the current Body, which might be made by copying another Body wholesale as needed. The unit will "be" the Mind (as I can't quite come up with something that is neither body nor mind but has control and reference to both).

  So my mother sent me a link to a video that purports that cell phones are a health risk; specifically that they're causing cancer in people and that big businesses do their best to suppress that sort of research, as cancer is a multi billion dollar industry. I was naturally skeptical of this, as you can justify almost any BS scientific finding with 'Big Brother doesn't want you to know this!!', and have watched the video and am in the process of trying to research some of the things this video claimed.

  [Here is the link to said video.](https://youtu.be/wXax0-MTTsk)

  If any of you rationalists have about half an hour (the video is only ten minutes long but I factored in the remaining twenty for you to think/research the topic) to watch and comment on it, or even just comment on what you already know about the radiation cellphones emit and/or how that radiation contributes to cancer, please do comment and let me know what you think.

  As I said, I've begun doing some basic research and will spoiler tag some of my findings to avoid inflicting bias on you or spoiling the video:

  1. The video claims brain tumors leaked to cellphone usage are the leading cause of child death in the USA. Some basic research will show you that, while cancer has been the leading cause of child death by disease for quite a while, brain tumor rates have remained steady for DECADES. It's simply that brain tumors haven't really seen much advancement in treatment over the past age, compared to cancers like leukemia. So it's remained higher because other cancer death rates have been lowered.

  2. The video, at around 6:10, claims that cellphones are altering human DNA. Several studies on the radiation cellphones emit, being non-ionizing radio waves, have been conducted and the only conclusive effect we've seen of this radiation is the ability to generate heat in tissue. It's why we use these waves in our microwaves.


  3. The video, at around 5:40, makes an erroneous claim that Apple instructs iPhone users to carry the phone at least 10 mm from their body. The video fuzzes the other info and highlights ONLY that sentence when he brings it up. I call this an erroneous claim because, while it does indeed say that, the host purposely leaves out the part where it says to carry it at that range to ensure your exposure remains at tested levels. He also leaves out the part where they did tests with the iphone at 0 mm from your head, aka no separation. They did testing at the ranges mandated by regulation, which stipulates they do testing with it both at 0 mm from your head, aka no separation, and 10 mm from your body when carrying. And simply tell you that, if you want exposure consistent with their testing, carry it at that range. The host also makes a comment about how the text here can't be enlarged, as if it's some scheme by Apple to have this text really small, when in fact it's standard text size and perfectly legible, so that you don't read it. That point overall seemed like a blatant attempt to misrepresent facts and fear monger.



  4. This isn't really a finding, per se, but the host has a segment at 4:43 where he uses a radiation detector to show the radiation emitted by several common devices, claiming that routers and microwaves emit about 800 microvolts/meter. Tablets emit about 2000 microvolts/meter. And cellphones emit about 40000 microvolts/meter. I have two issues with this. One: While I see the 4 among the numbers on the meter, I can't see the tolerance indicator of the radiation detector. What I mean is, as with volt meters, when you're detecting energies that vary so much, you can set the tolerance of the display to be in different ranges. So that the digital display only needs to hold 3-4 digits at any time. So I have no idea whether that 40,000 claim is true there in the video. And two: I can't seem to find any source for that 40,000 microvolt/meter claim. Googling brings up several websites, that all feel very conspiracy theory-esque, that say cellphones give off that much radiation; but it's all based on that documentary, as far as I can figure out. So I have absolutely NO idea if I can trust that stat.

  So these are just some of my basic findings so far. I'd love to hear feedback from you guys :)

  TL;DR: Are cellphones cooking our brains and giving us cancer? And are big businesses letting them, so they can keep bringing in the *dinero*? This video makes that claim. But how much of it is actually good science and how much of it is baseless fear mongering? You tell me!

  EDIT: Removing spoiler tags for mobile-friendly viewing!
  ```

  - u/Kylinger:
    ```
    Without reading your spoilers or watching your videos- my first thoughts are that since it's so trivially easy to detect ionizing radiation that no grand conspiracy could hide the fact that phones are emitting it. It would instead either have to sabotage all commercial radiation detectors and homemade detector blueprints, or sabotage our very understanding of which types of radiation are harmful to humans. 

    Since both of those would be among the largest international conspiracies to have ever existed I find it much more likely that some clever engineers found a way to safely use radiation to send information over large distances.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    There simply isn't enough energy in the waves emitted by cellphones to do any of the things they claim. 

    And, from a sheer utility perspective, a minor increase in cancer risk should not be sufficient to convince anyone not to use a smartphone. I would happily take a 1/1000 chance of cancer to have access to all the information ever all the time.
    ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    About point 3, surely they can't be stupid enough to think that Apple recommends the 10 mm separation because of safety. 10 mm would have an absolutely negligible impact on the irradiation of the head during use.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      They're smart enough to think their audience will believe that. And purport it as if it's a valid point. When they accused Apple by saying "You can't zoom in here, unlike on the rest of the phone", I felt very exasperated.
      ```

      - u/ZeroNihilist:
        ```
        It's thoroughly depressing. If these people were half as concerned about *actual* life-threatening problems (e.g. car accidents, pollution, malaria, diarrhoea, cardiovascular diseases) then they might actually do some real good in the world.

        Instead they're doing real harm. I'm struggling to think of a good term for it, but I suppose I'd say they're misappropriating activism.

        "Fighting the good fight" feels good, especially if you can cast yourself as the embattled victim who never gives up even againt your overwhelming, faceless opponent. It doesn't really matter from an emotional standpoint whether you're fighting against a tangible issue like HIV or a nonsensical one like vaccines causing autism.

        Generally speaking, activism on an individual basis is limited by the availability of three resources: time, willpower, and desire. Faux-activism uses up all three just the same as championing a true cause would, except it has no benefit. It's literally worse than doing nothing, because you can drag other people down with you.

        I really dislike this behaviour, to the extent that I'd be tempted to go on a crusade against it if it weren't for the fact that that in itself would be a dire example of a failure of priorities.

  I've been thinking about the concept of a [Moral Event Horizon](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon) and the question that appears to pop up is if there truly exists any action so irredeemably evil that it can't be forgiven no matter how much good one does before or after.

  I can't help but think it's exactly the wrong thing to ask. It's not that certain behaviors are so bad that we cannot forgive the villain for it. I'm confident that for every horrific action, there are actions which can 'balance' it out. For example, did you brutally torture and kill one million people? No problem, just save the lives of one billion people. If that's not enough, then just by adding enough zeroes to the number of lives saved, one can be 'forgiven' for any horror.

  I have realized that the Moral Event Horizon is in fact a heuristic rather than a commentary on how evil a given action is. If someone commits an evil deed, we can make a guess at how likely the villain will ever do good in the future (or how 'redeemable' he is). If the villain robs a bank but goes out of his way to not harm the hostages, we can probably say that he's not likely to commit genocide. But if he burns down the building a la Joker style, then he's a psychopath who is less likely to ever be a better person.

  This comment is meant to discuss how people should approach Moral Event Horizons in fiction. It's not *just* a statement of how horrible a person is currently, but rather how unlikely the individual in question will do good in the future.

  Note that Moral Event Horizons are subjective and very from culture to culture. For example, being a slave-owner centuries ago wouldn't mean you are a psychopath, but nowadays you would be considered one if you tried to keep a slave.

  Discussion Question: Is it ever justifiable to cross a Moral Event Horizon if you believe it will lead to more good or for the 'Greater Good'?

  I'm of the mind that such actions will have negative effects on the mind and 'damages' a person's own moral compass. Actions change people. No matter the outcome, if someone had ordered a genocide and it worked out to save more people, I still wouldn't trust the person with the same level of authority they previously had.
  ```

  - u/Loiathal:
    ```
    Answer: Sure, but you'd A.) Need quite a lot of evidence to show that it does actually lead to more good and B.) Probably precommit to not going any farther. 

    That last paragraph about losing some of your own sense of what's right/wrong is probably true (or at least, difficult to show that it isn't) as your actions become more normalized, so you should both ensure you can't go farther and probably also take steps to prevent you from getting to make such decisions again.
    ```

  - u/sir_pirriplin:
    ```
    The *Moral Event Horizon* is not really about morality. It's about the sympathy the audience can feel for a fictional character. When a character crosses that line, there is a chance they may still be "good" but no chance that they will be sympathetic.

    If a good character crosses it, they do it expecting to be hated by the other characters.

    In real life the issue is more complex. If you are crossing a *Moral Event Horizon* for the greater good it is more likely that you are wrong about what good is. That would be narratively unsatisfying in fiction (*Unexpected Consequences* is a total cliche and *Well-Intentioned Extremist* has been done to death) but Real Life doesn't care.

    An example of Moral Event Horizon people worry about in real is an AI lying to its programmers for the Greater Good. Eliezer says AIs should be programmed in a way that "If [I decide that] fooling my programmers is the right thing to do, execute a controlled shutdown [instead of doing the right thing to do]."

    I've watched everything but the finale of Westworld. Quite enjoyed it. For an HBO series, there's a refreshing absence of filler.

    I thought Westworld's ideas and twists were all pretty unimaginative and expected given the premise... And then I had a look at /r/westworld and realized I was just looking at the top of the (meticulously foreshadowed) iceberg. There are twists behind the twists. Lots and lots of details that look like they're just minor continuity goofs or awkward lines have hidden meanings. It's a show you can approach like a puzzle. (Possibly the finale unveils them, IDK yet.)

    (You can't approach it like a rationalfic puzzle though. The technology (and [the state of the world](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/01/her-isnt-realistic.html) considering the existence of that technology) does not stand up to [scrutiny](http://theferrett.livejournal.com/2084376.html), so ultimately the mysteries are held together with strings and ductape.)

    I am worried that the show is scheduled to last "up to five seasons" if popularity allows. It's not a monster-of-the-week sort of show at all. It's a story that wants to unravel its key mysteries and solve its characters' arcs and then be *done*, whole world goes up in flames. I *really* don't want it to be dragged on for too long, and especially not for an *unpredictable* amount of time where progress will be gummed up and new mysteries and new character arcs will be forced in. This would have done well as a single movie. \*cough\*

    I think I'm one of the few people who don't like Westworld. The production values are incredible, but I didn't get invested in the story and characters. The pacing was too slow, the plot jumped around too much, the character arcs felt really predictable, and I didn't understand what themes were being explored. The show felt like it was pretending to be profound and tricked the audience into feeling intelligent without actually doing anything special.

      I have to say, I recently finished it and mostly agree with you. After so much praise I was expecting something more, but overall I felt like the show was good for people who weren't familiar with sci-fi rather than sci-fi fans who were already exposed to all the ideas in it. I think the last couple episodes wrapped up most of the problems I had with the show and elevated it  beyond what it started out as, but overall it's not nearly as good as it was hyped up to be.

      And yeah, the only characters I really cared about were Ford and Bernard, and a little bit of William. The rest weren't particularly interesting to me at all, and some (like the two healers who help the brothel madame) were infuriatingly irrational.

      All that said, technically the show was gorgeous. Great acting and visuals and beautiful music. So I get why it's so popular, and overall I'm glad I watched it, since it's just 10 episodes.

        Agree with you there, film-quality acting and production values spent on a story that's been done before and done better. I guess I have to give the show credit for introducing people to new ideas in an accessible way, but as stories about the boundary between AI and humans go I prefer Ex Machina or even Bicentennial Man (why does everyone hate that film?).

        The thing that immediately bothered me about the show was how similar the park was to open-world games like GTA or Red Dead Redemption. The metaphor just doesn't work because nothing in this story will change the way I think about games or the people who play them. It may be disturbing to watch people hurt the hosts, but that's only because we know they're alive.

          Yeah, the mass slaughter at the end was kind of discordant for that reason: we know that they're concious, but none of the people dying do. I made the Red Dead Redemption comparison to my friend while watching it too: if someone went around killing people who play video games because they think the characters are alive, I would be pretty inclined to consider the killer an insane monster.

  I've been going through shifting BACK into game development as a career after a brief stint in education in the american public school system.

  In the mean time I've been building a prototype for a crafting system that focuses more on manipulating, creating and altering properties of objects rather then following proscribed recipes to acquire discrete objects with singular purposes.

  along side a kind of rough and tumble use of rigid body physics, mesh deformations and eventually mesh splitting I anticipate this to make a fun and/or !!!FUN!!! game driven half by the chaos of poking and prodding the world to try and make things work and the hilarity of when they don't.

  shout out to
  /u/ketura for mentioning my help on the pokemon project. And also I'm not sure of which names you use on reddit but to the lovely people in the discord that have helped entertain me with their antics/test the super early alpha builds.

  At DnD last night I used some thinking from HPMOR. 

  A fire giant was magically trapped in a forge, and it attempting to exit wouldn't work as a magic net would stop it. The giant using an anvil as a hammer to damage the walls similarly was halted.

  I asked what about the giant using the anvil as a projectile?

  It turns out that the creator of the ward hadn't planned on the walls being destroyed.

    ... I'm not sure fundamentally different "hit the walls with the anvil" is from "throw the anvil at the wall"?
    ```

    - u/bbrazil:

      The giant isn't in contact with the anvil.

  Couple of questions.

  1) Which Secular Solstice events are people attending?

  2) Does anyone have experience making informative websites?  I want to start a site for helping people gtfo from their countries as we head into dangerous times.  That would include immigration advice, refugee assistance, and crowdfunding/crowdsourcing for dealing with bureaucratic obstacles.

  Oh, and seeing the therapist this week at last was a blessing.  I've got a bunch more appointments lined up.

    Probably none-- I'm in Colorado, and while it does sound like a lot of fun, I don't think there are any within many, many miles of me.

    > Secular Solstice

    That's a new term, are you talking about winter solstice or are you referring to Christmas season and related holidays?
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      It's a reference to the [Secular Solstice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_Solstice).

  I'm considering running a scooby-doo/hunters game on roll20. but I'm not honestly all that interested in systems or stating things out. Any thoughts on systems, or interest in co-gming?

    [Here's](http://www.leftoversoup.com/archive.php?num=759) a link to Leftover Soup where in the linked comic they role-play the characters of Scooby-Doo with DnD dice.

    I'm totally stealing Jamie's interpretation of Scooby for my unwritten rationalist Scooby-Doo fanfiction.
