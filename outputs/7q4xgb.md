## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  TL;DR you have super strength via short-range telekinesis. Try to find clever applications other than punching things really hard.

  You have very short-range telekinesis. Specifically, you can sense the location of and exert force on anything within one centimeter of your skin. The telekinesis isn't particularly strong, but it does give you a really good grip on surfaces that you otherwise wouldn't have a grip on (allowing for very steady footing/Spiderman-style climbing skills). Hair, severed body parts, and grafted body pieces don't count for the one-centimeter rule. The strength the telekinesis can exert is peak human level, so no ripping apart metal cubes with your mind (although you could manifest some sort of cutting edge/drill).

  You can form arbitary telekinetic constructs so long as they're within one centimeter of you, up to some precision that is high enough to let you manifest cutting blades but low enough to not let you reforge molecular bonds.

  I'm pretty sure this doesn't let you fly by pushing against air- you don't have that much air within a centimeter of your skin, and you'd need to push that air awfully fast to fly - although I'd be happy to be proved wrong.

    * **Telekinetic gun:** Imagine a telekinetic tube 1 mm in diameter going down the length of my right arm with a telekinetic storage chamber on my right shoulder. Fill the chamber with air by creating a chain of telekinetic discs which move backward from the mouth of the tube. Assuming I'm limited to about 100 lb. of force, I can achieve a pressure of 155,000 PSI, or about 2.5x the maximum chamber pressure of a browning .50 cal machine gun. Switch that 1 mm tube to a â‰¤1 cm tube, place an appropriate projectile inside, then release the gas chamber to fire. Assuming I can produce about 909 watts of power (sprinter equivalent), I can produce a shot equivalent to a .50 BMG once every 22 seconds (though obviously I'm limited to 10 mm projectiles, I can use heavy projectiles at ultra high speeds).

    * **Flight:** Assuming sprinter levels of work (909 watts), it would be possible to produce 909 newtons of thrust, or about 13 newtons/kg for an average healthy male. Achieve this with constantly moving blades/waves of telekinetic force forming near your head and rapidly moving down over your body until they're fast enough to achieve peak thrust. As long as you're not overweight, you'll be able to fly straight upwards, though you'll be limited to sprinting distances.

    * **Scuba diving:** Create a large pressurized air chamber and then surround yourself with enough rocks/dirt to become neutrally buoyant. Drop the dirt/rocks as you use up your available air to maintain neutral buoyancy. Create telekinetic fins/flippers around your hands and feet to make swimming easier. Don't go more than about 50-100 ft. deep to avoid nitrogen narcosis.

    * **Burrowing:** As with the flight example, you can use blades of telekinetic force to turn yourself into a drill to slide through dirt. As with the scuba diving example, you can take a pressurized telekinetic air tank with you for breathing while underground. Ideally you'll want a very large number of relatively small blades so that your body almost acts frictionless as it glides through the dirt.

    Edit: Corrected my math on the flight section.

    >You can form arbitary telekinetic constructs so long as they're within one centimeter of you, up to some precision that is high enough to let you manifest cutting blades but low enough to not let you reforge molecular bonds.

    I wonder how arbitrary is arbitrary.

    Molecular bonds are on the in the couple hundred picometer ballpark, so if you only had resolution down to the 1 nanometer ballpark (eg 1000 picometer range), then you'd be good enough to construct computers from scratch.

    Which is where 'how arbitrary' comes in.  Because if you can start building arbitrary, purpose built ASICs then you've just become a one man singularity engine with rapid fab times.  God help everyone if you can make the leap to carbon based electronics or 3d chips.

    This changes the nature of the threat from 'guy who can telekinesis things' to 'robot apocalypse and also some guy with them'.

    Random thoughts:
    You can float (in water) and keep yourself warm by creating forcefields to keep air in. Likewise, you can probably swim faster. 
    What qualities do telekinetic constructs have? Are they green lantern types, forcefield types, can I dictate materials for them to imitate? 
    You would be an excellent melee fighter- one inch punches hit as hard as roundhouse kicks from a centimeter away. Also, peak humans can rip apart metal cubes, at least small ones, so similar feats may be possible.

      Telekinetic constructs are invisible forcefields. They can bend/curve, but don't have volume. They inhibit movement in both directions, so you can't use a one-way setup to compress gas. You can wrap your body in one large field, (Glory Girl), or wrap your body in many small, sharp fields (Narwhal). Multitasking probably limits the number of small fields to a couple hundred, and you wouldn't have anywhere near perfect micromanagement.

      If pushing against something bearing down with more force than the forcefield can exert, the forcefield doesn't shatter but moves with some inertia. Parts of forcefields that would be pushed inside your skin or further than 1cm away disappear without causing you harm.

      Floating in water is a very good point - a 1cm bubble of air creates somewhere between 15-20 litres of air, which is more than enough to make the human body buoyant. That's also a bit over two minutes of relaxed breathing - although I haven't crunched the numbers to see if "ideally applied human strength" could , it's probably enough to bring a bubble of air might function in vacuum?

        >Floating in water is a very good point - a 1cm bubble of air creates somewhere between 15-20 litres of air...

        That seems surprisingly large, but I checked the math and you're right. Taking an average healthy adult male (70 kg, 180 cm), the standard [body surface area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_surface_area) formula would yield about 1.9 square meters of surface area. Multiply by 1 cm and you get 0.018 cubic meters, or ~18 liters.

    Aw! *Picks up chopped off hands and glues them back on.*

    >TL;DR you have super strength via short-range telekinesis. Try to find clever applications other than punching things really hard.

    I'm going to assume that since this is telekinesis, you don't feel the pushback from things you push with your telekinesis. Otherwise if you tried punching things really hard, your fist would break from the pushback. 

    > I'm pretty sure this doesn't let you fly by pushing against air- you don't have that much air within a centimeter of your skin, and you'd need to push that air awfully fast to fly - although I'd be happy to be proved wrong.

    Can you just hold yourself up? Like, telekinetically grab parts of your body and hold them up or throw them upwards? 

    > You can form arbitary telekinetic constructs so long as they're within one centimeter of you, up to some precision that is high enough to let you manifest cutting blades but low enough to not let you reforge molecular bonds.

    Can I create fans on my skin? Like a bunch of spinning telekinetic blades, pushing air through them? How fast can I spin them? Enough to generate a cooling breeze? What about wind attacks?

    Using the fans, could I swim at super speed through water? Or if not fans, what about a treadmill like shell around your body, pushing things in front of you to the side and then back behind you? Can you swim through the earth?

    What about heat generation? Rub your telekinetic constructs against each other until they catch fire? Being 1 centimeter from your skin means you get burned too, but it may be useful in a pinch.

    Blood isn't outlawed for extending your reach, as long as there's still a stream of blood between you and the construct it's not severed, and donated blood isn't grafted onto you, so you can use transfusions to extend the amount of blood you can control.

  You are a study group of five that stumbled across the secret of magic. That was your first mistake. 

  It turns out the global flow of magic is finite, it is already in use, and the Immortal Arch-Wizards of Earth are not interested in you burning through mega-thaums of mana figuring out how to light a candle. 

  Fortunately, summarily murdering you is socially unacceptable. (most new mages are friends or family to an arch mage that fucked up the secrecy protocols. So killing out of hand is not on. You do not fit this category, but you still get the standard courtesies. Such as they are.) 
  The standard protocol is instead to toss you into a time line that has a viable biome but no indigenous toolusers. 

  "Resources" you are getting courtesy of... Lets call her Morgana.:

   120 people that will not be reported missing. She mostly procured these by rescuing them from durance most vile and healing any health problems. So, 120 sex trafficking victims, drug addicts written of by everyone and oh yhea, one petrochemical engineer being held hostage by the cartel up until five minutes ago. Yes. She left a major trail of bodies rescuing these people. All of them had it coming. If you want food for a horror novel, I guess you could interview your new tribe. 

  All in literally perfect health, but also you know. Kind of traumatized. 

  A container of hand tools, a lathe,  five computers and enough solar cells to run them. Not gaming machines, but magically indestructible, loaded with a vast collection of reference works compiled with no regard whatsoever to copyright law and locked to you personally. 


  Most interesting, also contains a series of manuals on sorcery. A very *long* series.

  30 geared compound sports bows for hunting. 


  So: Morgana will point the cross time gate at any set of coordinates  on planet earth equivalent you ask her to. The timeline she has in mind is in an iceage. You also have 9 days and 9 hours to collect any additional crap you want showed through. If you want more stuff from earth, you can get it when you chew through enough of the manuals on sorcery to open your own gates. That will take a approximately 300 years. You are under magical compulsion to not say anything to anyone not in your new tribe.. 

  Where do you go, what do you bring.
