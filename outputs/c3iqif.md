  And there we go, that's the conclusion of this act! I hope you guys like it. I ended up editing it and tweaking it quite a lot to try and account for the criticisms I received so far, but in the end, this is how it was supposed to go. On a meta-level, this is the part of the story where the villains have the initiative, where the heroes lose and it gives them the motivation to go "oh shit, we have to get serious", and it just doesn't work to try and spin that in a happy and positive way.

  At the same time, I do get why some readers think there are not enough uplifting moments in this story. There tends to be a lot of grey, which is realistic, but... I can't help but think back to when I was reading stories as a kid, and I'd go "I wish I could write so I could make this story go the way it is *supposed* to." It was so obvious to me that everything could be made 10 times cooler just by having more awesome things happen, and I wonder if maybe young me had a point. That maybe there's this artistic urge to make your stuff deep and complicated and to kind of sniff your nose going "well obviously you can't just give your readers what they *want*, only a pleb would do *that."* I dunno.

  &#x200B;

  Anyway, I'm officially through all of my pre-written stuff now. There is one last epilogue-type chapter coming and then there'll have to be a bit longer wait again as I get the new act together. I'm really excited to get this story completely off the canon rails and see where that takes us.

  In the meantime - please read and enjoy!

  Edit: Oh btw, if anyone has any ideas for Patreon rewards that I could do, or if anyone has any special requests, please let me know!

    This is basically over the Despair Event Horizon for me.  The Sand people seem so utterly psychopathically fucked up that I can't imagine any happy ending that doesn't involve them dead as an end in itself.  Making peace with a rabid dog isn't rational, it's just delusional.

    Some of the Konoha people are decent enough, but everyone else should be given the treatment HPMOR Dumbledore urged for Voldemort - kill them asap, then forget they ever existed, because even their memory is pure poison.

      Well, I mean, that was basically Danzo's argument in both canon and in this story. But everyone hates Danzo and thinks he's evil when he says stuff like that, and yet I get the feeling that many of the readers who want Naruto to just unleash hell and [kill all the sand people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_60Jfwsylb8) also think Danzo is a monster for thinking the same way. Heck, in this very chapter, Rasa and Chiyo explicitly mock the Third and say he is a fool for not killing them.  So are they wrong to think so, or should the MC try to be more like them? Because I do think you can't have it both ways.

        It's not about "being more like the sand".  It's not like they're just murderers, or treacherous or anything *mundane*.  You're portraying them as almost a relentless train of horror for the sake of horror.  There seems to be *nothing* redeemable about them, they don't even seem to have actual *self-interest* as a lever to pull on.  It comes off like it would be more reasonable to ally with the *kyuubi*.

          I am really not sure where this perspective is coming from. The actions of Suna seem to be well within the limits of what rational actors would decide to do on both a personal and grand strategic level.

          It is perfectly rational from a grand strategic perspective for Suna to preemptively attack Konoha in order to counter their efforts to steal clients in Sand and to generally damage Konoha enough to ensure that the balance of power between Sand and Konoha does not shift in such a way as to overtly favor Konoha. Attacking another nation when they pursue a course of action that is damaging to your nation is a course of action that almost every country in the real world has pursued. 

          It is perfectly rational from a personal perspective for the Kazekage, Chiyo, and the Kazekage's children to support this attack on Konoha as they all possess a very strong motivation to avenge their loved ones. This is not a particularly nice motivation, but is perfectly rational for them to possess it and allow it to strongly influence their behavior.

          I find it really disturbing for someone to consider the actions of Suna to be at "kill them all" levels of evil when everything that Suna has done is well within the bounds of what states and individuals in the real world have done. Do you really consider a preemptive attack on an enemy to be an offense worthy of Genocide? Is it really so hard to understand that people may want to avenge their murdered family? 

          I would also like to add that Naruto basically use two ideas (1: In order to protect my precious people I must preemptively destroy my enemy before he can strike, 2: It is okay for me to violate the rules in order to protect those that threaten or harm my precious people) to justify his murder of Gaara. These ideas are essentially the same as the ideas used by the Kazekage and Suna to justify their attack on Konoha.
          ```

          - u/Iconochasm:
            ```
            A pre-emptive strike can be reasonable and rational.  Turning people into flesh-puppets ensconced in a nightmare torture cage, and then cackling about how much the sight must torment their friends is Hellraiser-tier horror-for-the-sake-of-horror.  It would help if ay any point the sister, purportedly the saner of the siblings, ever tried to rein in her brother's hammy, try-hard Exemplar of Evil schtick.  Instead she acts like this is all perfectly normal for a day that ends in 'y', and even a good thing because someone killed the insane serial killer brother who scared the shit out of her with his relentless, deranged psychopathy.  Even the care for Gaara feels like informed ability, or just playing a role.


            The grand strategic level also seems like it wasn't emphasized enough, if that's the rationale we're going with.  My impression was that Sand attacked Konoha specifically to avenge Gaara, but really so the old lady could avenge her children.  And again, the care isn't really developed, it comes across like disutility monsters pantomiming human emotions.

            The net effect is that the Konoha characters feel like actual humans, while the named Sand characters are demons in human guise.

                >  An analogy would be how a military can use napalm to kill many people without actually being comprised of monstrous serial killers who like to burn people to death. 

                Napalm and *animated iron maiden torture suits* are nothing alike, *especially* from a point of view of warfare.  Napalm is generally used to cause damage to objects in the area, and incidentally also happens to get the people, too.  If your enemies are hiding in dense underbrush or buildings and don't care about collateral damage, or you want to bomb a place and ensure that it catches fire and does more damage to the area around it (in which case collateral damage is the whole point), then napalm is a great solution to your problem.

                What possible military purpose does it serve to put a person inside a suit filled with 300 poisoned metal spikes and throw them against their loved ones?  Would you *honestly* claim this was OK in the real world, if a nations military did that to another nation?  You would actively support such a thing?

                > The general idea is that using Monstrous tools should not necessarily make their user a Monster.

                Tell that to the people who actually used the napalm or other monstrous things in the *real world* and were psychologically affected by it.  Now compare them to this version of Kankuro and tell me that he is perfectly sane and not a sadist.

                > He could have quite easily killed all of his hostages in a horrific manner at any point.

                Ah, so the fact that he *didn't kill them in horrific fashion* makes him a good person, and/or him hideously torturing his enemies and using them as pawns makes him a *better person* than not torturing them to death, and so it's all good?

                How about, instead, he has a specific mission to get revenge on the guy who killed his brother (Naruto), and instead of being a torture happy psychopath who delights in making the other Leaf ninjas suffer instead concentrates on his goals and either kills or incapacitates his foes instead of acting like a monster?

                See, I don't mind him being written as he is in the story, but don't try and claim he's not a monster because he *could* have been *more* monsterous, and therefore it's OK.

                  Kankuro is monsterous - but we have seen him driven by revenge. 

                  If we find this is how he does things all the time, then we will see him in a worse light.

                  If he does that to random people for no reason save his own amusement - then he is a much worse monster.

                I actually have no familiarity with canon, which might be a major factor here.  I've only read a handful of the fanfics that get recommended here.  I thought I had a decent grasp of the world from that, but there are almost certainly massive blindspots.
                ```

        - u/Sophronius:
          ```
          Hah, Naruto certainly wouldn't want to be speciest when it comes to the prospect of allying with the Kyuubi (though he does have a tiny amount of common sense standing in the way), but either way I don't think that's entirely fair. Yes, Gaara was a literal psychopath, and Kankuro is more of a psychopath wannabe poser, but Temari and Rasa at least are both acting out of genuine grief. That doesn't justify their actions, certainly, but you can't say they have \*no\* redeemable qualities. Rasa also had a certain sense of honour in not wanting to go to war until Chiyo swayed him, refusing to go after the Third's son, and wondering briefly about the chunin/jonin in the guesthouse he had just killed.

          Also an odd thing I've noticed: Characters who do evil things for irrational reasons tend to be much more hated than those who do evil purely for the sake of evil. Heck, Bonesaw and the Joker both have fans even though I see them as horrifically evil, and I still don't really get why the former was accepted as redeemable.

          Anyway, all of that is ignoring the more important point that even if all of the named Sand characters are evil, that doesn't mean that the shinobi fighting for them are. You can see at the end of this chapter that the others seem to be afraid of Rasa and Chiyo, and for good reason. So even if you think these specific people are pure poison, that doesn't justify a genocidal war against the entire Sand.

            > Characters who do evil things for irrational reasons tend to be much more hated than those who do evil purely for the sake of evil.

            I... honestly don't see the difference between these two.  Evil for its own sake is inherently irrational.

            > why the former (Bonesaw) was accepted as redeemable

            You've got me, I have no idea.  How they were totally cool with her Heel-Face Turn is beyond me, and it was one of the major dissonance moments for me when reading it.  Same with "Valkyrie".

            > So even if you think these specific people are pure poison, that doesn't justify a genocidal war against the entire Sand.

            Yeah, but see, the biggest problem is that until those high-ranking Evil Overlords are put down, the soldiers are just going to do their jobs and fight.  Especially if they fear their masters more than you.  So unless you have a strategy that avoids all normal warfare and instead targets the leaders by specific groups of highly experienced individuals trained and selected for the task (ie: What I assume warfare would be like in a world full of Ninja, warfare "Salarian style"), you're invariably going to have to harvest a lot of regular soldier guys on your way to the top.

            While pure genocide should be off the table, there's no way their *nation* should be allowed to survive in its current form.

              >I... honestly don't see the difference between these two.  Evil for its own sake is inherently irrational.

              I mean more people who do evil knowing it's evil. Card carrying villain types tend to be more well-liked, for some reason - perhaps just because they're more obviously a fantasy and so don't register as a threat. People are much more likely to have personal bad experiences with irrational idiots than with hammy supervillains, so the latter is seen as harmless, or something like that. It's always been interesting to me how some people can write apparently sincere articles about how Thanos or Killmonger or Scar is actually the hero of their story, while at the same time thinking of their own politicians as unforgivable monsters. It's an odd quirk of human psychology.

              >While pure genocide should be off the table, there's no way their *nation* should be allowed to survive in its current form.

              At the risk of bringing politics into this... didn't we learn from recent history that regime change is usually a terrible idea? If you think of the Sand as fantasy Iran, assassinating their leadership doesn't seem like nearly as good of an idea. The Third in this story has basically been doing the only thing he can do - try to improve relations with the current ruler to prevent the whole situation from becoming seriously worse.

                > Card carrying villain types tend to be more well-liked, for some reason

                I'd say it's probably because readers/viewers can feel alright hating them or enjoying when they suffer.  Since the character crossed a line into a territory where they aren't realistic *people* anymore, it's OK to hate them, whereas in the real world that might not be morally acceptable.

                That, and the hero's "goodness" is a mirror of the "evilness" of the villain.  The nastier the villain, the more you root for the hero.

                > how Thanos is actually the hero of their story

                That's honestly how Infinity War *actually went*.  Thanos was a villain protagonist with a goal he honestly believed in.  The fact that he retired to a farm at the end instead of doing more murderdeathkill shows that he honestly believed what he said.  The other two examples don't fit as well, as Scar was simply selfish, and Killmonger was all about destruction and not working out a better system.

                > didn't we learn from recent history that regime change is usually a terrible idea?

                *Looks at post-WWII Germany and Japan.*

                No.  Regime change, properly done, can improve upon an otherwise hostile and belligerent nation.

                What your describing is the more modern, lazy method where chopping off the head of the snake and then leaving while saying "Victory!" is the standard operating procedure.  Of course, all it really does is create a power vacuum that causes even *more* ruthless people to take over what's left and the process has to continue again.

                Really makes you wonder if it's on purpose.  But that's enough politics.

                Allowing an enemy to completely screw you over and murder your people, as has been done here, will make the situation much worse.  Absolutely nobody's view of the Leaf will improve from this except a few high-minded idealists, and absolutely everything will be harder from them.  Furthermore, the *people* of the Leaf are always going to wonder when it will be OK for someone else to raid and murder them and get away from it without repercussion.

              It's not hard for me to see why people found Bonesaw redeemable; she was a fundamentally innocent child forced to become a monster to survive, while being put through constant psychological and emotional abuse. The only agency you can really argue her having was choosing not to kill herself at ~8 years old before Jack could basically brainwash her.

              Because both of them had the general backstory of "traumatized child who can't be held entirely responsible for their actions", plus had a remorse & redemption arc.

        > that was basically Danzo's argument in both canon and in this story. But everyone hates Danzo and thinks he's evil when he says stuff like that

        To be fair, when you have a militaristic pragmatic rationalist express his opinion and put his methods into action, a *lot* of people get squeamish really quickly.  Even, or especially, if their approach is probably the best possible solution.

        > Rasa and Chiyo explicitly mock the Third and say he is a fool for not killing them.

        And they are right.  They have just butchered many of his people, led to the deaths of several of his most powerful supporters, and have shown zero remorse for what they have done.  It's not the first time they have betrayed him or set him up in an almost impossible position politically in an attempt to bring him down.

        And then he just *lets them get away with it*.  No concession or agreements on their part aside from "stop attacking us now and we'll not attack you".  Of course they laugh.  Hell, *I* laughed when reading it, and still can't believe him.

        > Because I do think you can't have it both ways.

        Sounds like a false dichotomy to me.  We're talking about Naruto, right?  Who, even in canon, is almost always the guy to Take A Third Option?
        ```

        - u/Sophronius:
          ```
          Oh, I don't think Danzo is the good guy actually - not canon Danzo, certainly. But a big part of what I'm trying to do with this story is show how the exact same actions can either seem horribly evil or totally fine depending on who does it to whom, and from whose perspective it is shown.

          * Canon Danzo argued that the other nations are evil and that the Leaf should do a pre-emptive strike, and he was called a monster for it. In NTBS, he says the same thing... except he kind of ends up being right.
          * Canon Sarutobi was all about tolerating horrific evil in the name of peace. And yet, everyone saw him as the good guy, even when the Head Torturer was standing right there next to him, because he was the Good Guy (TM)
          * Canon Naruto was all about forgiving seemingly irredeemable enemies, such as Gaara. But when he does a much less extreme version of that in this story (not killing Temari and Kankuro) it doesn't feel so right. It feels like injustice.
          * Canon Itachi slaughtered his entire clan, and most of the readership still see him as a hero, because he was cool.
          * Canon Temari casually tossed Tenten onto a pile of her own knives and Shuriken after she was already unconscious and defeated, because... she wanted to show how superior she was, I guess. But it's okay, because she turned good later.
          * Canon Kankuro trapped his opponent in an Iron Maiden and impaled him from every side at once with spikes, and he never stopped grinning and taunting even as his victim screamed and begged to be released. And we were \*okay\* with that because hey, Kankuro was on \*our\* side now, and he was doing it to one of the bad guys.

          That's the point of this. I wanted to show what it looks like to argue for canon Naruto's philosophy of forgiveness in a world that isn't specifically tailored to make that worldview look good. That was the idea, anyway. That doesn't mean Naruto can't still find a way to make it work, somehow - but it can't be as easy as him forgiving Gaara in canon. That simply would not work in a rational story.
          ```

          - u/RynnisOne:
            ```
            I wasn't saying he was good.  I simply said he was a militaristic pragmatic rationalist.  From his point of view, that's the best thing to do.  

            And honestly, he's still right either way.  Even aside the fact that he's actually 'right' due to the plans of the other nations, he exists in a world where standing armies aren't a thing as much as *every army is composed of tiers of various levels of special forces*.  Pre-emptive strikes are the *only* real way to wage war in such scenarios.

            Sarutobi may be the 'designated good guy', in which case people will tend to see him as much.  That's more of a storytelling trope.  But, being rational here, that doesn't stop them from being horribly wrong or outright stupid.  If "Peace" is your goal above all costs, you will either force everyone to stop warfare entirely if you are powerful enough, or you will quite peacefully lead yourself and your people to the noose if you are *not* powerful enough.

            Oh no, when Naruto does it in the series, it feels like injustice too.  I mean, maybe it's different for other people, but I find it hard to believe.  The difference is that in the show he's one of the protagonists that does their best to *befriend the villains* and show them a better way through his own actions (Tenchi Muyo comes to mind as being one of the archetypal anime that pioneered this approach).  Now, realistically, this is *not going to work on hardened killers who grew up being child soldiers*, but nothing else in the world seems to run on logic anyway, so that's just one of the powers of the protagonist, I suppose.  Still, it doesn't have to be *justice*, it just has to be *reasonable*.  I can see him letting Temari off the hook here, as she was blinded for 'justice' for her brother.  But I can't see Naruto, the guy who cares about his friends more than anything else, letting this version of Kankuro off the hook.  If anything, he'd come to rightly believe that the man has at least a sizable portion of his brother's madness.

            I hate Itachi and Sasuke.  And like this version of Naruto, I see absolutely no reason why anyone would be falling and fawning over them in admiration.  Even the guy that wrote Sasuke started with him being a "calm cool kung fu genius" type and reverse-engineered his flimsy 'personality' from there.  Their characters are some of the *most irrational* in the original series, and that's saying a *lot*.

            The Canon Kankuro example seems more like the previous bit about the enemies being dehumanized.  If they're so over-the-top evilbad, then we cease to see them as humans.  I'd find his actions disgusting and unproductive either way.  Emotions aside, it's impractical to do such a thing, because either the enemy is too weak to be a threat to you anyway, or the enemy is strong enough to be a threat and you are *just giving them more time to escape or survive*.  If the latter, just knife them and be done.

            > That's the point of this. I wanted to show what it looks like to argue for canon Naruto's philosophy of forgiveness in a world that isn't specifically tailored to make that worldview look good

            Now *THIS*… *this I like*.  Canon Naruto's philosophy in the series is just stupid, given everything we know, and it only works *because* he's the designated Hero Protagonist and everything works out for him in the end.  It's like an extremely proactive, offense-based version of Plot Armor.  It'll be interesting to see if *this* Naruto finds a way to make it work rationally, fails at it and has to adapt to the world as it actually is (as he did against Gaara here), or finds some reasonable middle ground in between the two extremes (what I'm guessing will actually happen).

              Well, canon Danzo is just empirically wrong because his actions are the cause of 90% of the problems in the series. Heck, he was actively hurting his own country for most of the story, nevermind the rest of the world.

              NTBS Danzo... we'll see. He'll definitely have more screentime in the next act, so should be fun. :)

              But he didn't let him off. He was actively trying to kill him and Temari until he revealed Shikamaru, and then he was in a position where he had to bargain for Shikamaru's life. That doesn't mean he has forgiven Kankuro, it just means he cares more about saving the living than avenging the dead. Like a rationalist should.

              Technically, he could have attacked Kankuro immediately after he released Shikamaru, but A) this would be out of character for Naruto and B) the rest of the Sand's army was rapidly approaching, so that wouldn't have been a good idea at all.

              He did the sensible thing in cutting his losses, IMO. But I get the impression that some people think Naruto just doesn't care - because he tries very hard to make his decisions based on logic rather than emotion - and that isn't true at all.

                I'm pretty sure Canon Danzo isn't the cause of 90% of the problems when you have other actors who are themselves actively trying to mess with them.  And in the Shippuden arc you have Akatsuki messing with everyone.

                Should be interesting to see how this version turns out, though.

                You mean like **Naruto** should.  A rationalist would reasonably weigh the life of his (possibly already going to die) friend versus the friends he *could* be losing in the future if this enemy manages to escape.  And as this enemy is quite wiling to meat puppet and torture his allies for his own ends, it's pretty much certain he will have to deal with him again.  Rationalists care about the future as much as the past.

                **EDIT**:  In addition, Naruto has revealed to them the ultimate secret behind familial ninja techniques.  Eliminating both of them seems like it should be a high priority.

                > A) this would be out of character for Naruto

                Out of character for Canon Naruto, sure.

                >  B) the rest of the Sand's army was rapidly approaching, so that wouldn't have been a good idea at all.

                He doesn't know the details of that, and even if he didn't know, the Leaf ANBU were then surrounding THAT group's leadership.  And, honestly, Naruto wouldn't have much of a challenge against their common grunts.

                > because he tries very hard to make his decisions based on logic rather than emotion

                Except, of course, that logic only leads to the same results when it has the same inputs.  Fail to provide all the pertinent inputs, and your output will be flawed.  Sometimes logic and emotion can agree.

                  Yes, but he inspired Nagato to go superevil in the first place, so everything Akatsuki does can kinda be traced back to him. Also, everything Itachi does. And he was actively working with Orochimaru, too. And even Madara only got resurrected because of Kabuto, who was Danzo's spy until Danzo tried to have him killed. So yeah, he was indirectly responsible for at least 90% of the bad things that happened during the main plot of Naruto.

                  He has no reason to think that. For a meta-perspective, sure, you can think "we haven't seen the last of that guy", but from Naruto's perspective Kankuro is just one potential enemy among hundreds, and one way or another the guy is not likely to be in Konoha for long, which hugely decreases the chances of them running into each other.

                  >**EDIT**: In addition, Naruto has revealed to them the ultimate secret behind  familial ninja techniques.  Eliminating both of them seems like it  should be a high priority.

                  No he didn't, they were not present for that part. Naruto did teach Temari how to summon people (and indirectly, how to puppet people) but it wasn't at all clear how much those two already knew. They are the children of the Kazekage, after all, and probably had access to quite a few secrets already.

                  Either way, Naruto definitely wouldn't go around assassinating people just because they know something about how ninjutsu works. I don't think defaulting to murder is rational at all.

                  >He doesn't know the details of that, and even if he didn't know, the  Leaf ANBU were then surrounding THAT group's leadership.  And, honestly,  Naruto wouldn't have much of a challenge against their common grunts.

                  He saw the Sand army, but didn't see the Anbu. Considering how Kankuro and Temari were actively falling back towards the bulk of the Sand's forces, and considering how Naruto's orders were to evacuate himself and Sasuke, retreat makes perfect sense. Yes, he has agency, but he also knows how badly things can go wrong when you try to take matters in your own hands - especially in an uncertain and dangerous situation like that.

                  And with regards to common grunts not being dangerous... it doesn't work that way in NTBS. There are no hitpoints or power levels. Literally any genin could have a forbidden technique that just so happens to perfectly counter your own. Or they could be Uchiha Itachi in disguise. You just don't know. And as you could see from Kabuto's fight with Sakura, that kind of attitude could get you killed.

                    Yes, but what was Nagato's motivation to make the organization that way?  And does an inspiration mean the guy is responsible for the others actions?  There's a difference between indirect and direct causes.

                    > He has no reason to think that.

                    You're kidding, right?  He has *every* reason to think that.  The whole reason Tamari and Kankuro attacked him and his friends *in the first place* is because Naruto killed Gaara.  They ceased to get their revenge on him.  It's is 100% likely that, if they are left to their own devices, they *will* come back to fight him again, and they *will* have no problem torturing and tormenting his friends if its means they can get to him.  His performance in this battle shows he is willing to go out of the way to save his friends, directly proving that they are correct in their assumptions as to how he will act.  Rationally, they will *have* to go after him again.

                    > which hugely decreases the chances of them running into each other.

                    The odds are pretty much 100%, because they will actively seek Naruto and his friends out.  Sure, if Naruto stays in the land of the Leaf for the rest of his natural life, he might be somewhat successful in avoiding them in the future, but that requires he take all his hopes and dreams and chuck them in a dumpster.

                    > Naruto did teach Temari how to summon people (and indirectly, how to puppet people)

                    OK, so one critical secret instead of one ultimate secret.  Everything else still applies.

                    > Naruto definitely wouldn't go around assassinating people just because they know something about how ninjutsu works.  I don't think defaulting to murder is rational at all.

                    Good thing no one is making that argument that he's 'defaulting to murder' then.  Sure, Naruto won't go around assassinating *random people* for that reason.  But *specific* people who hold a grudge, murder and torture his friends, are political enemies to his homeland, and have critical secrets and are *right there* fighting against him or trying to get away?  Yeah, he'd at least consider it seriously, and realize it will be a future problem if he lets it go.

                    >  Considering how Kankuro and Temari were actively falling back towards the bulk of the Sand's forces, and considering how Naruto's orders were to evacuate himself and Sasuke, retreat makes perfect sense. 

                    We've had battles where things are determined in *seconds*.  I'm pretty sure he's got time to make the attempt.  I mean, it's not like they don't just wander off on foot afterward slowly while Naruto, Sasuke, and Shino all decide to have a chat and perform some battlefield triage on the fallen.  Naruto and Co didn't really retreat, they just sat there and let the sand leave.  I'd agree that if the Sand ninja were like *right over there* making a commotion and flashes of light and sounds of battle were getting closer, they might have some urgency.

                    The only *real* argument for him not trying to kill at least one of them is whether or not his rather rational rant toward them was heartfelt and he was thinking it reasonably likely he could convince them that they shouldn't fight because they were being played.  In that case, it's more him making a gamble on being merciful helping convince them he's serious.

                    > And with regards to common grunts not being dangerous... it doesn't work that way in NTBS.

                    That was painfully obvious with the "Hokage killed during a training exercise" bit, which I appreciated.  But you've also had scenes where it's pointed out the low tier genin and chunin just got *mulched* by their vastly more experienced opponents, so I find that strictness of this rule rather questionable.

                    There aren't power levels in the conventional sense, but there are certainly 'tiers' of threat, and most of those common dudes aren't anywhere in Naruto's weight class, just like he's not in the division of the leaders or sanin.  In any event, those threats aren't even visible or anything to him, and there's as much odds that Leaf ninja are in the retreat path as Sand.

                    > And as you could see from Kabuto's fight with Sakura, that kind of attitude could get you killed.

                    Yes, but I'm referring to *running away* prudently when you're obviously outmatched by a visible threat.  You're referring to *trying to solo someone* arrogantly because you think you are better than they are in every way.  That's not a character flaw this Naruto has.

    I feel like this move by the Hokage comes off as irrationally stupid because there's absolutely _no_ punishment here. Even the part were Gaara was killed was still within the established ninja rules, and Sand broke the rules when they started the attack, and now they've gotten away with it completely scot-free.

    This move is a military and diplomatic blunder by the Hokage, since none of the main assets of the Sand (other than Gaara) have been neutralized, they and whoever else can twist this into making Konoha look very _very_ weak. I can estimate the ripple effect this will have on the different forces at play -

    * For the other villages : (Akatsuki/Enemy sponsored) Headlines to the tune of "Leaf village elder assassinated, perpetrators escape from right under the Anbu's nose.". Konoha viewed as weak, naive, an easier target. Sand village more respected/feared for pulling off this massive assassination on the head of state of the most powerful country and getting away with it.
    * For Konoha's enemies : Have more of a reason to come together, cooperate, be more aggressive, be much more demanding of Konoha. Impression of Konoha becomes that of "weaker village" Overall, more confidence to enemies.
    * For Konoha's remaining allies : Shows weakness, taboo in ninja world, shows that even if you betray them they're gonna be fine with it. More likely for some countries to become neutral or lose trust of Konoha's capabilities as a result of this.
    * For Konoha's shinobi population : Blue balls their vengeance, no thought given to what they might think about the whole situation. Makes all the powerful people gathered there look like fools, why did they even come there, if they were just going to let the Sand go? They were retreating anyway, so why the whole theatre? Many prominent clans have lost their children, when they find out that the Hokage simply let their killers leave, I'm not sure they will trust the village leadership anymore. Quite a lot of them could become more drawn to Danzo and his "kill them all" mentality. The village unity will be either be broken into a thousand pieces, or become united in revenge.
    * For Sand village : Shows that Konoha needs them as allies, even after they pulled off things that would've made them enemies for generations in the ninja world. Shows them that there's a bigger enemy that Konoha is fighting, but (what a wonderful blunder) doesn't convince them that this is Sand's enemy as well. Shows them that they are willing to let them get away with pretty much anything as long as they help fight this greater threat, giving the Kazekage leverage akin to a leash on Konoha.
    * For Akatsuki/The Enemy : Great news! Konoha is regarded as an absolute weak/naive nation on the world stage. Our subverted ally Sand has not lost any significant force (except Ichibi, which we have the means to recover). Much easier to convince some of the more neutral villages to side against Konoha, as they want to survive, and our protection became much more valuable than that of Konoha.

    Trusting the Sand village to act in the interest of a better world, after they have been fooled twice (or possibly more) by the Akatsuki is absolutely not rational, it's just plain naivety. It's akin to acting like a person with normal values in the middle ages.

    Alternate Konoha move -

    * Capture all sand forces, kill those who resist. Try to convince Kazekage about akatsuki in prison, if agreeable, release them a little later --> now you have two villages that can cooperate against Akatsuki! Also let the news spread that Konoha didn't let the perpetrators get away. (Likely to fail, as Akatsuki is simply going to assassinate the Kazekage and try to subvert the next one).
    * If convincing the Sand elders fails (which is likely, as they have already been fooled twice) keep the entire leadership in prison (or kill them idk, your choice), take over sand village yourself or install a puppet ruler (easier). Now you have a whole new village infrastructure and resources to use against the Akatsuki/Enemy!

    After this chapter I'm actually very surprised that the other villages aren't sharing information with each other. My assumption was that each village would want to keep it's failures (Akatsuki's victories) hidden to the others, and so communication regarding that was impossible. But here the Hokage apparently doesn't care about any of that, and is willing to, idk, meet the Sand halfway regarding Akatsuki involvement? Strange, because not once were the Akatsuki mentioned by the Hokage...

    I can guess that you, perhaps, wanted to show the audience that this is where the change starts, this is where the inter-village violence starts its decline, where the unification against Akatsuki starts, and a new age of world peace will eventually dawn because of this one move. But you decided to do it at the absolute worst time and place, and with such a drastic action. The sand has broken a treaty, betrayed an alliance, murdered your civilians and _children_ in cold blood. And you just let them go? In a feudal environment? It's the wrong move on so many different levels.

    Change comes from slow steps, years of effort. It's never going to be doing or saying one thing, the other villages going "GASP!" and everything becoming sunshine and roses.

      >I feel like this move by the Hokage comes off as irrationally stupid because there's absolutely *no* punishment here.

      No explicit punishment, no, but as Baki noted, they have lost half of their fighting force in this attack. They sustained far worse casualties than the Leaf (it is implied), Chiyo lost her arm as well as half of her puppets, they expended every last one of their explosive tags, and Rasa's son is still dead. It's simply not true that this attack did not cost them anything.

      Are you right that this move makes the Leaf look weak? Of course! That's what Danzo has been saying right from the start - that the Third has made the Leaf soft. The Leaf has had that reputation for ages now, much to his chagrin (this is true in canon as well). The Third doesn't care about this because he \*wants\* to spread a message of forgiveness, and more to the point, he simply doesn't see the Sand as his real enemy.

      Here is the Third's (apparent) reasoning: There is only one fight that truly matters, and that is the one of good vs evil, of light vs dark, and The Enemy appears to be actively trying to pull the world towards the latter. He has realized at this point that the Enemy \*wants\* the Leaf and the Sand to fight, that all of this was engineered just so that the two allies would kill each other... and so he simply chooses not to do that. It makes sense, in a way.

      Now, as Rasa points out, what he \*should\* be doing is asking for hostages. Rasa would never permit himself to be captured, but the standard feudal thing to do in this situation is to hold his children hostage in Konoha while he goes back to the Sand. Thus ensuring loyalty. And perhaps the Third would have done that, except... he knows that even if the enemy is not literally right there in the village, they've still been actively manipulating things, and there's no guarantee that they couldn't kill Rasa's children to start the war all over again. And since the Third appears to be dying and things are slipping out of his control, he just wants the Sand out of the Leaf before someone like Danzo goes ahead and takes matters in his own hands. There's no time to discuss, no time to think, just do this one thing that he knows for sure his enemy doesn't want him to do.

      >Change comes from slow steps, years of effort. It's never going to be  doing or saying one thing, the other villages going "GASP!" and  everything becoming sunshine and roses.

        You're answering the wrong question man, they lost all of this because of Konoha defending itself, not because Hokage told his ninjas to punish the Sand. Then only AFTER all the fighting ends, does the trial and punishment phase begin, but that never happened. There was no visible *punishment* for this act of betrayal, murder and destruction. Horrible optics and an extremely negative hit to the morale of Konoha's prominent shinobi, who watched all this happen live.

        > Third doesn't care about this because he *wants* to spread a message of forgiveness

        This is, once again, extreme naivety on his part. How much do you allow yourselves to be rolled over and still forgive those who do so? Is there no limit to this forgiveness? Isn't this an open invitation for Leaf's enemies to attack and do whatever they want without repercussions?
        Also, from what I can see, this mentality is not shared by the majority of the city. And now the Hokage is dying, and in his last breath, he has performed an action that would piss off every single one of the families that had someone die to this attack. Who do you think they would follow as the next leader of the Village? Someone who talks about peace with the killers of their family? Or someone who preaches about strength and vengeance against this treachery?

        > he simply doesn't see the Sand as his real enemy

        You see, here's the problem with that. By attacking the leaf, they are *aiding* the real enemy. And from the text, Sand doesn't know it yet. Even in these last moments, The Hokage makes absolutely no mention of a real enemy that they both know about, that are hurting them both, and so the Sand goes back to their lands, still ignorant, still a tool of the enemy.

        > He has realized at this point that the Enemy *wants* the Leaf and the Sand to fight, that all of this was engineered just so that the two allies would kill each other... and so he simply chooses not to do that.

        This helps me understand a little bit more, BUUUT again, it is completely wrecked by the fact that the Hokage does not even SAY that The Enemy is involved. He just offhandedly mentions that this could've been engineered by "one of their enemies" which doesn't really inform the Sand about the gravity of the threat.

        As far as the Hokage knows, the Sand still think of Akatsuki as either neutral or on their side. Naruto telling Temari and Temari telling her father about them is, as far as I can tell, not known to the Hokage.

        And even if he did know, the Hokage simply namedropping them and reinforcing that he understands what is going on, might allow the Kazekage to at least understand that they had been played. But the Hokage didn't say _anything_. Even though we know he was thinking it, and was making a huge decision based on that knowledge. Why hold back this knowledge from the Sand if he thinks they are not the real enemy?

        I re-read the chapter again, and this stood out -

        > “Order everyone to stand down. If anybody so much as touches the Sand ninjas they will answer to me – understood?”

        The people around him, Ibiki in particular, are holding back so much anger at this decision that I'm actually surprised they're still following the order, considering that the Hokage is dying and won't be around to be answered to anymore. But I guess they still have respect for the office, if not the person holding it. But do you really think they will simply let the Sand get back to their village in peace, with the alliance intact? How much distrust would there be, between the Sand and Leaf villagers? How would the alliance even continue, when Sand traders and shinobi will be viewed with suspicion in the leaf?

        Also, even for the Hokage's own goals (peace, I guess), this move seems stupid. Once he dies, Danzo will rally the entire village with the promise of strength and vengeance, and the cycle will continue. As far as I have read, the Hokage doesn't really have a plan in place to counter Danzo's influence.

        > I take all criticism to heart, but I think you're literally the first person to say that this story is too much sunshine and roses :P

        Hahaha, I meant more along the likes of the Hokage thinking like that, and why that is so jarring compared to what is happening around them. Obviously it won't be easy that :P

          Yes, all of that is true. Like you said, you can tell how furious this makes Ibiki - but the Hokage is Hokage and his will is law, while he's still alive at least. He's part of the loyalist anbu faction after all. Regardless, this decision will be a major plot point / point of discussion in the next act, so this isn't just some random weird thing that happened for no reason.

          This is not the first conversation the Third and Rasa had together. In [Sarutobi's POV chapter](https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2018/01/10/chapter-30/), he and the Kazekage discussed the threat of Anbu together, and Rasa very definitely saw them as the enemy:

          *“Mercenary?” Rasa turned his head and spat  onto the ground. “Call them what they are: Criminals and traitors. They  staged a coup in the Hidden Mist and killed the Mizukage – one of us,  Hiruzen! Now, never let it be said that I was a great admirer of  Yagura-” In fact, this had never been said by anyone. “-but it still  sets a precedent. With Yagura gone, which of us shall be the next to  fall? For all that we speak of our Lineage and you of your Will of Fire,  those concepts only hold power for as long as people believe in them.  If the world starts to see us as mortal…”*

          Sarutobi might not have told Rasa about the Enemy (for the same reason that Naruto never talks about it - they're ninjas, and you never know who's listening in) but he's effectively using Akatsuki as a proxy here to alert the Kazekage of the threat. Rasa knows they're both being targeted, and the Third is obliquely referring to that.

          I've edited his dialogue in the new chapter a bit to make that more clear. He now refers to "our mutual enemy", and the strategic necessity of allying against them.

          >How much distrust would there be, between the Sand and Leaf villagers?  How would the alliance even continue, when Sand traders and shinobi will  be viewed with suspicion in the leaf?

          It was only ever an alliance of convenience, so that doesn't change much. They're ninjas: Nobody ever trusts each other. The point is that The Third needs there to be another Kage who is in the know and willing to fight against Akatsuki when it comes down to it, and his own death only increases that need. Especially after Mist effectively had a puppet ruler installed by Itachi, and considering how Stone was funding Akatsuki:

          *“As Yūra was saying… we are starting to get  an impression of Akatsuki’s organization. We count their inner circle  at nine so far, plus whatever assistance they may be getting from other  countries.” Left unsaid was that the Hidden Stone was almost certainly  supporting the Akatsuki by hiring them as mercenaries, if not worse.*

          >Hahaha, I meant more along the likes of the Hokage thinking like that,  and why that is so jarring compared to what is happening around them.  Obviously it won't be easy that :P

          Well, bear in mind that you're seeing this from Rasa's point of view, not the Third's. Certainly it looks like naivety to *him*, but an equally valid explanation for the Third's actions is that he's just really really desperate. Just because you attempt something with a low chance of success doesn't necessarily mean you don't understand probability.

            Re-read the chapter and yes, it's a lot better with that clarified, yet still opaque reference. I still think this action was insanely naive and risky when there were alternatives, but I guess you have all the connections in your head, so I will wait for things to be slowly revealed.

            Well, the option of killing and replacing Raza is still open to the Akatsuki. And considering Yura is probably an agent of Akatsuki, it wouldn't even be that hard. Hopefully Raza is savvy enough to maneuver through the murk.

      Honestly, I could only see this working if the Sand pulled off its plan but was then **immediately** betrayed by the Akatsuki in such a way that they lost something of importance or great value.  Then the Leaf could point out how they were both betrayed, and they could make the excuse that it was another group, and then these two 'enemies' who had this conflict choose to visibly unite against a common foe, which begins a start of a long road toward village and national unification.  

      Except that this didn't happen, and the Kazekage even *laughs* at how naive the Hokage is being by going this route.  I have to agree with the guy.

  Konoha is in shambles. They just got betrayed invaded, and lost a lot of important characters. Almost every main character introduced so far has just sustained some serious trauma, or is going to when they find out what happened to their friends. Gai is going to come back from whatever he was doing to discover that both Lee and Ten-Ten are dead. The same can be said for Naruto and Sasuke; Sakura and Kakashi are both gone. And Kiba and Shikamaru and the rest just spent the majority of that invasion being tormented - I can only imagine how they are gong to react to all the horror they just endured. 

  And then the Third went and did what is probably going to go down in history as the most stupid move in his entire political career. He didn't punish the Sand ninja. Sure, the Sand lost stuff in their attack; but that would be like arguing its not right to press charges against the person who tried to murder you because you broke their arm during the attack. The Sand accomplished their goal (making the Leaf look weak so that they stop stealing their clients) and then made their escape - their overall plan went off without a hitch. They assassinated the leader of the 'strongest village in the world', and in return all the Third did was, basically, tell them to go away.

  The Third just pulled a Jon Snow. He's so focused on the big picture that he's forgetting the people around him (especially his subordinates) are human beings with thoughts and feelings. Jon Snow was so focused on facing the Others and saving the Wildlings that he forgot the Night's Watch had been fighting the wildlings for generations, and many of his men had lost brothers to the people he was protecting (say what you will about the character, Olly was justified in his rage). The Third is so focused on facing the Enemy that he seems to have forgotten that his ninja just went through literal hell; just had their homes attacked and their friends butchered by a supposed ally... and then he just let them all go. This is going to blow up in his face spectacularly, and I can't wait to see it; the only sad thing is that the Third probably won't live to see how monumentally catastrophic the consequences of his blunder are going to be. 

  I could not see an easier way to make everyone support Danzo, than for the Third to let the Sand go without forcing any reparations. He's put the Leaf in a position where they need to be aggressive; they need to reestablish themselves as a force to be reckoned with, and they need to do it soon. I can only imagine what Cloud, or Stone are thinking, watching Sand get away with such a blatant attack on their most hated rival. Konoha is in such a precarious position right now that I'm honestly worried for the Village.

  But anyways, to get back on track.; I'm fine with characters like The Third having flaws. I just hope this actually gets portrayed as just that; a flaw in his judgement, analogous to Jon Snow thinking he could just let all the Wildlings through the Wall without any consequences whatsoever.  This may be the kind of move that might be good for The World/bad for the Enemy, but that doesn't mean that it's the right move for Konoha, and ultimately the Village should be the Third's first priority. He seems to have forgotten that mercy is a privilege of the strong; you can only afford to be merciful if you look/are strong - otherwise its just called weakness. The Third hear doesn't look strong to his own populace, much less the world.

  This is why I prefer binge-reading. The fallout from all of this is going to be incredible, and having to wait to read it is going to kill me :(

  And one last thing- When Sasuke talked about keeping it in the family, was he talking about some obscure canon fact that I've forgotten, or is this fic actually going somewhere different with Naruto's heritage/what Sasuke thinks Naruto's heritage is?

    Oops, I hadn’t responded to this yet, but the family thing wasn’t meant to be some kind of big reveal. It was just Sasuke’s way of answering Naruto’s question, “what am I to you?” And yes, there’s the double meaning that the Uzumaki split off from the Senju and the Senju and the Uchiha both descended from the Sage, so in a sense they are brothers - just not a literal sense :)

    I’ll try not to make you wait too long with the updates.

  What about on the fan fiction website?

    Sorry. I normally put the FFN version up a bit later as it's the most annoying one to edit afterwards, so it's easier to fix any last-minute spelling errors in the other versions first before doing the FFN one - but in this case it was already late so I left it until next morning. It's up now. :)

  I think my favorite piece of imagery this chapter was the Kazekage hallucinating the Akatsuki members and them resolving to be the Anbu. That sense of paranoia and betrayal were beautiful. I like how it sets up in Rasa's mind that this was part of a set up. Not only for Leaf but for them too.

  And possibly some foreshadowing about Anbu infiltration. Which would help explain that dude that blew himself up.

  The more I read the more plausible it is for Orochimaru to be The Enemy, or at least directly working with them.

  So did sasuke kill every1 at the hyuuga compound or was that some other shadow guy?

  typos

  > “Well, you know it is at my age,” she said. “Forget me own head next.”

  know it is -> know how it is

  > “That – that’s the Uchiwa Gunbei,” he said.

  Gunbei -> Gunbai
