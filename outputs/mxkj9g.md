## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I saw a post on askreddit the other day asking what people would do with the ability to go back in time by three seconds. The time travel couldn’t be stacked so you can only use it every three seconds. 

  Besides the obvious of winning Randi’s million dollar prize I thought maybe you could use it for HFT by partnering with a hedge fund though idk if that is long enough to get confirmation of your trades. 

  What else could 3 second time travel be used for?
  ```

    There might be forms of poker it'd be useful for, or some kinds of slot machines, but that's pretty much the HFT idea watered down (arbitrage.)

    It'd be good for physical exercise and combat, obviously. While it's not a good idea to seek out trouble, it'd help with preparing for and dealing with it. 3 seconds is enough time to avoid a lot of injuries and nullifies three seconds of the element of surprise.

    Any experiment that can be performed in three seconds can be undone. Silly contrived example: There's a priceless Faberge egg but you need to know what's inside it. Smash the egg, then rewind as soon as you see what's in there. Or, if you only have _one_ lump of unobtainium, and each of the five experiments you want to do requires a lump, you could perform the experiment over and over, resetting to preserve the material each time (as long as you can do it in under 3 seconds.)

    It could be useful for social engineering/cold reading; you'd still get to use the old cold reading tricks to get people to tell you stuff, but you could erase their memory of telling you that stuff. Strong psychic act.

    3 seconds is an interesting choice, because even 60 seconds is obviously ludicrously OP, but 3 seconds is short enough that one might barely get one's bearings in that time. (Still ludicrously OP, but requiring of more forethought to get there.)

      Good idea about gambling, blackjack would be another game you could manipulate with 3 seconds. 

      You mentioned combat and the element of surprise. It might help dodge bullets or something like that. 

      Another combat application would be for a sniper who gets to take as many shots as they want without losing the element of surprise. That would make them a scary assassin though then they would still have to escape.
      ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Can't stack them, but can you repeat the same 3 seconds without limit?

    Because that means free unlimited thinking time, which is incredibly useful for all mental pursuits, whether its math homework, crime solving, novel writing, etc.
    ```

    - u/andor3333:
      ```
      I was thinking you couldn’t repeat it since that would  be pretty overpowered like you said. But yeah I agree if you could repeat the 3 seconds it is way more powerful and basically a time freeze power as well as a way to execute any 3 second action perfectly if you don’t need to wait to see results.
      ```

      - u/dinoseen:
        ```
        It's doubtful that you could perfectly activate the power as soon as it's available, so each loop will in fact cause time to increment forwards a little. I don't know how relevant this is, though.
        ```

    Randi's prize hasn't been an option for half a decade at this point. 

    There are smaller prizes like the AUD$100K from the Australian Skeptics society, but you can probably only claim one or two of those before the others shut up shop too.

    For 'get rich quick', scratchcards might be your best bet?
    ```

  - u/longbeast:
    ```
    Three seconds is easily enough to create paradoxical conditions if the time travel mechanism is not a friendly one.

    This might be a case where the only winning move is not to play.

    But taking the question as intended and assuming it's quicksave/reset style time travel, you could do all sorts of physics experiments. Settle some arguments about odd variants of hidden variable entanglement, or play at being Maxwell's demon and reverse a tiny bit of entropy just out of spite.
    ```

      I like this answer! I guess with this power Bell’s inequality could somehow be even more confusing than it already is.
      ```

      - u/longbeast:
        ```
        I'm fairly sure that you could annoy everybody by making a time travel equivalent of the delayed choice double slit experiment and giving a very convincing fake of appearing to prove that conscious observers make a difference.

    Probe for hacking vulnerabilities with no one the wiser. In particular, I imagine your power grabs some cryptographic schemes by the assumptions.

    Spend a lot of money on a "one-time" voucher for 3 seconds of as much cloud compute as money can buy; effectively double the global amount of cloud compute for perhaps 8 hours a day, only usable for computations which have on average very few bits of output, such as brute-force searches, such as bitcoin mining.

    If you go public with your power: Livestream an LED that says whether the current timeline is virtual. Let people pay you a lot of real-timeline money to have the right to _once_ send back a message for whatever use they can come up with. (Their name is included in the message for purposes of length pricing. Still, they can send back N extra bits by doing their experiment 2^N times and sending back the info on a particular run; this is a feature.)

    I think it’d work well in sport scenarios e.g. if you’re playing baseball you can rewind until you hit the ball or until your catcher catches your pitch since the ball travels so quickly you can probably see it get caught before 3 seconds have passed since it left your hand.
    ```

  All sufficiently accurate and detailed instances of the same mind share a consciousness. Besides making threats of torturing simulations much more scary, what are some ways this could be taken advantage of, positive or negative?

  This works across time as well. If you copy someone and don’t ever turn it on until after they die, the copy will have memories from all the way up to the original’s death, because the copy is the original.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Uh. So you mean that if someone has a sufficiently accurate and detailed understanding of your mind, they could create an instance of it and use it as a literal voodoo doll?

    Then they can do all kinds of things to your simulated mind to control your real mind. World domination becomes actually possible, since a tyrant could forcefully make simulated copies of everyone's minds, and put them in a simulation that forces their real minds to obey.

    On the other hand, how would one create a sufficiently accurate and detailed instance of a real person's mind anyway? We don't have any kind of brain scanning technology that can do anything like that. So this would probably just be used for simulated (not actually intelligent) AI minds.

    This could be incredibly useful for phones. Create a simple AI that simply learns and regurgitates info when asked, duplicate it countless times and put one on every phone, and now you have a true wireless connection between all phones that can never be jammed and doesn't need any signal whatsoever.

    Private phone calls become possible just by having some simple security measures on the AI's regurgitation. Accessing a wiki is easy by having more copies of the AI sit in  servers somewhere and crawl through wikis. Giving the AI access to your phone's location could make search and rescue a breeze, as long as you don't lose your phone. The applications are boundless!

  You can detach your fingers and independently control them
  ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    You can leave a finger in a hospital, where they can monitor your vitals remotely and inject drugs if needed. 

    You could use it for communication with things radio waves can't reach, like deep underground or to nuclear submarines. 

    A low thrust space probe could use your finger as an infinite source of reaction mass and a much lower power and more resilient communications. Maybe even FTL.

    You could use it to cheat at various situations where communication is not allowed, such as school exams or trivia TV shows, even if they have faraday's cages, monitoring, etc.

    You could attach a strong to it and use it to trigger traps, even if you don't have access to technology.

    You could attract a SO with an extremely specific fetish.

    Someone who has the finger can detect if you're being tortured, and inject painkillers or something extremely lethal.

    If you hook it up to an IV with sugar and nutrients, an maybe even some form of oxygenation, you could require significantly less life support than someone else. 

    You could use it to trigger a bomb, in a way that's immune to most ways of preventing that.
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    You could build yourself a prosthetic hand, so you can detach your fingers, attach them to the prosthetic, attach it to your arm, and now have your fingers in an unusual arrangement. Like spacing them out for piano or typing, I guess.

    You could attach a bunch of fingers to each other tip-to-base^* to have a really long wiggly finger. This would be useful for when you drop something behind the couch and whatnot.

    You might be able to do something to help with search and rescue efforts in collapsed buildings, dropping a finger on a string down a crack and reporting if you feel anything fleshy.

    If you're willing to permanently lose a hand, you could lend some fingers to NASA for a Mars mission. Fingers are a lot more sensitive than instruments; you can report details about rock and soil texture that can be used to infer geological things. You might even be able to eventually get them back if it's a sample return mission, though you also risk losing them for nothing if the launch goes poorly. You'd want to keep the fingers in a heated compartment in the rover so they're not too cold to feel things, but otherwise it doesn't add any real life support challenges, since they're getting oxygenated blood from your body. 

    On that note, since the remote fingers have to still be getting blood from your body to function properly, I guess there's a tiny portal in there? You could hook your hand up to a siphon that withdraws blood just before the finger and inserts it on the way back, inject whatever in the blood's place, and bleed it back out of a cut on the finger. So you can remotely deliver tiny amounts of liquid very far distances. This sounds incredibly horrifying and uncomfortable, I'd recommend not mentioning this capability to anyone.

    ^* If the power doesn't allow this, I'm imagining a padded finger tube that you tie tight with string.

    Jack wires into your finger stumps and fingers, and you might be the fastest HFT arbitrageur between Wall Street and ten other stock exchanges, by cutting at lightspeed through Earth's mantle.
