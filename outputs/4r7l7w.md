## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Recently watched [the brand new testament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5QNKcwe_lM), a cute movie about gods daugther, who runs away from her abusive father. 

  The best scence in the entire movie: god proudly tells someone he hates people and is god, backs his claim up by telling that person an intimate memory of that persons life - and the person quite rationally immediately tries to kill god. 

  I wish I was that good at updating upon evidence!

    I just watched it and really liked the concept of people knowing their death dates. The thing is, I heard/read a lot of quotes saying "Live each day as your last", "If today was your last day, would you do what you are about to do today" and things like that. But I never thought about this in the perspective of "What would you do if this is your last 3 months or last 2 years". To me, this is more inspiring than the former thought about "last day".

    Anyway, thank you for sharing about this movie, kind sir.

    Wait why is it rational to try to kill god?
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Because god just said he is an asshole and responsible for bad stuff happening.

       Ergo: no god, no more bad stuff. ergo: kill god.
      ```

      - u/appropriate-username:

        Well, first of all, it's *god*. He's immortal and there's no reason to suspect that his character has an influence on his mortality. You're quite the opposite. If hell exists, you've just literally done the worst possible thing you could do. Even if hell doesn't exist, god could make it just for you.

        Second of all, it's *god*. Literally the shortcut to eternal happiness to everyone, everywhere, forever. Sure he's an asshole now but from what I understand there's no reason to suspect that he was always an asshole and he always will be.  And even if one assumes omniscience means that god will never change character--the world isn't completely horrible now and there is some semblance of order in a few places. It's completely possible that god is the only thing keeping the world from going, quite literally, to hell.

        This is like finding a switchboard that controls the universe, proving it's legit, and then smashing it with a hammer because you don't like the position of some of the switches and can't get them to budge.

      In my experience tinder's a lot of swiping to barely get any matches, and never get anywhere interesting. I don't think I'm especially ugly; it just seems like a waste of time and thumb health :P

      Could be location related, but really London should be pretty good in that sense.

    Had problems with both 'socially interacting with girls' and 'interacting with enough people in general (so there would be a GF candidate)'. Eventually solved both for myself.

    For the first one, a thing that might have worked for me (or perhaps correllated with working) was watching&listening to media (series/podcasts/webcasts/LPs) which a guy co-hosted with a girl, interacting with her in a friendly atmosphere (well, the atmosphere where the audience obviously ship them but nothing really going on and the jokes are quite mild).

    For a second problem, I thought 'Which of my interests are making me interact with people less than average and how can I re-focus that?'. Playing board games with friends? Might as well visit board game clubs a couple of times, why not? Spending my time in an online community? Why don't I visit (or even help to organise) a local meet-up and discuss the ingroup's things in a %food_place%. Playing a (non-casual) game on my phone? Why don't I try, say, Ingress instead, based on constant IRL interaction between players? And so on.

    I was a bit scared about 'how do I switch from just social communication aka being friends to showing a romantic interest and determining whether it is mutual' but I managed that intuitively (well, I guess I got lucky with one girl that became interested in me first, but I have successfully initiated a relationship too, with some light jokes and stuff.)

    Hope I helped a bit.

      That's exactly why I watch anime. Nothing like watching Subaru or Kazuma interact with girls to gain experience!

  What social engineering methods are there to get a group of people to do what you want, preferably without (overtly) bullying them or alienating them? I'm not asking for any specific reason, I'm just curious.

  On a completely different subject, I realized I've had this unfounded impression that dentists will be obsolete soon because of something I read years ago in a YA sci-fi novel. I just thought it was funny that that's been affecting my actions since then.

    > What social engineering methods are there to get a group of people to do what you want, preferably without (overtly) bullying them or alienating them?

    Give them reasons why doing it is in their interest.

    It's amazing how many seemingly complicated "social engineering" tasks come down to, "Have you tried cooperating and being nice yet?"

    Paying them money.

    EDIT: It's a vague question, so it depends on the parameters, but in essence, getting other people to behave in a way convenient to you, be it by giving you material goods or by doing something you want done, is what money represents.

    Again, it depends on the exact situation you're in, who you want to influence, what you want them to do, etc. A guru in a sect will not exercise his influence the way a policeman on the job or an office manager will.

    I actually posted a quote that responded to this exact question last week. Click on the link for a discussion of the quote's context.

    "No matter how smart you may be, no matter how much money you may have at you disposal, no matter strength of arms or argument, you simply cannot force people to do something. It costs too much. For all the bombs we have dropped, for all the lives that were lost, in the end this is why the Nazis could not prevail. There is not enough money in the world to truly command and control a populace. The best you can do, all you can hope to do, is create a situation where it is easier for people to do what you want than it is for them to do what you don't. Then no one will seek to oppose you or thwart you aim because it appears you are merely helping them to do what they really want to do. There is, in the end, no defense against cooperation." - Patrick E. McLean, How to Succeed in Evil

    Ask them politely.

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    Is the issues getting them to work at all, or is it getting them to take specific actions?

    If it is getting them to work/work together, then finding ways to make each person feel responsible for a specific part of the work so they feel like they own it or that it is theirs.

    If the issues is getting them to take specific courses of actions... If they are friends of yours, then establishing reciprocation over time is good.  You help them with something small, later you get them to help you with something slightly bigger, and so on until you are willing to go out of the way for each other.  If they are merely acquaintances, it might help to know what each person wants from the group and being able to navigate and negotiate between them.

    Also, to go with /u/CouteauBleu's idea, you don't need to pay them directly necessarily, but offer compensation that is worth money.  For example, if a bunch of friends help you move, buy them pizza for lunch, and if it really takes a while/you have a bunch of stuff, maybe take them out to dinner afterwards also.

    If you want specific examples... I was in the Boy Scouts and I was alternatively Patrol Leader, Quarter Master, Senior Patrol Leader, and Junior Assistant Scoutmaster, so I have some stories of what to do (and lots of stories about what not to do).

    About the dentist thing... I think that would be one of the last medical professions to go.  I could see implants monitoring your health and eliminating the need for checkups, but mouth health seems kind of tricky (spit into a device that monitors for chemical traces associated with cavities) and physically removing cavities will be always necessary if anything goes wrong in maintaining your mouth health.

  I've been reading a super interesting nonfiction book called Incognito: secret lives of the brain, I recommend it, it lets you understand more about how you and others function cognitively. There's a lot your can get out of the book, but I'll leave it with this; 

  Single women reading this, when setting up a dating profile, take a picture of yourself when you are ovulating and horny, it will get you the most interest. :)

    Also, look into "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Kahneman and Decisive by Heath.

    Also, "The Power of Habit", by Duhigg.

    And men, get a picture of when you're scowling at something.  I literally did not believe this until I tried it in a mirror, but it makes your eyes look more intense.

    Luckily, my wife prefers smiling and silly.
