  Fascinating story. I think I would disagree about calling it horror. I am curious about the real world implications of this, since it's fairly clear that all of those are simulated personalities. We know there are flying foxes, but if all of humanity is living in an eternal simulation, what happens to the physical world?
  ```

    Ooh... also what kind of "time dilation", for lack of a better word, is there when they use an organic? I would have to assume the simulation doesn't run in real-time; it's probably much faster.

    Not everyone's in that simulation.  Kendra mentions once that she was "in graduate school before she uploaded," so apparently she grew up in the physical world.

    But yes, I'm also curious what's going on in the physical world.  Also, how many people are growing up in virtuality?  What's that like?

      She says she was in graduate school before she uploaded, but she also has pictures of her son's first split. And the grandfather died before the simulation was available and that was only 50 years ago. Given that both Kendra and Zeke appear to be relatively young (certainly not 50+ years) I don't think it is a safe assumption that growing up in the physical world and then uploading as an adult is the norm. I think it's more likely that Kendra grew up before uploading was available

  I don't really know what to make of it, except I feel like both Daniel and Kendra are really relatable.

  A story of transhuman forking, focus, and family.

  The best way to describe this story-setting to me, is to call it a Weirdtopia. It's a utopia that works, but is fundamentally uncomfortable.

  I have no clue if I would be happy living as a multi-threaded hive mind, but I'd love to try it out!

  Alicorn writes the best horror out there

    Horror in the existential sense, or horror in the sense that we don't have the current technology to be able to do this?

    Imma spin off 367 Shitposters and 400 Internet Arguers for starters.

      Inefficient. I'll counter by spinning off a single half-instance that just responds "No U" to whatever you post. ;)

    I saw it as weirdly hopeful, actually. There was a certain sense of peace to it.

  Something I've not seen brought up (at least, not openly for discussion) yet is the potent parallel to using technology and consuming media. Sometimes I'll sit, eating something, watching TV and playing a game all at the same time. I presently have 5 internet windows and some 20 tabs open.  I will take a walk, and most of the time I'm listening to music. I almost never leave the house without my phone.

  I feel the pull of the Daniel, I fully understand /why/ someone would want to unplug, I at least partially understand how consuming a greater portion of the effectively infinite media landscape in which we reside leads to each individual part being less special, and yet.. I still find myself spinning up instances: I still take my headphones with me when I leave the house. Not every time, but enough that I start to feel it.

  When i sit without my phone it's nice, but it's not.... divine. I've experienced lots of moments of silence. None of them have managed to convince me to change.

  Yet.

  ```
  This makes me feel something resembling [existential sadness, I think](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wozmu-1Rv7g). I simultaneously pathetically need and mournfully dread this universe. ... And I notice that "this" is ambiguous there, and find that even more appropriate.

  Lonely Platypuses ... platypi? Platypodes? Sad avatars aside, the mention of meditation makes me wonder if maybe this wasn't meant to explore different interpretations of self (there is no self Vs there are many Vs there is one, or whatever).  But I'm mostly distracted by how horrifying this world is, and how there seems to be no better options in reallity.

    What makes you think it's horrifying?
