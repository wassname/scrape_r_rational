## Disappointed in the sequels to Crystal Society (Crystal Trilogy by Max Harms)

### Post:

I just finished the [Crystal Trilogy](http://crystal.raelifin.com/) by Max Harms and it has left me with a terrible taste in my mouth.

Many spoilers follow.

The first installment, Crystal Society, captured my interest immediately. I found the main characters *incredibly* endearing, moreso than any fictional characters I have encountered before, and their interactions and thoughts made me grin and laugh many times.

This is where the series excels: the main characters and particularly their interactions. To summarize, the perspective character is one subagent of an AI, created basically for public relations, and it works with other specialized subagents. Except that the subagents aren't actually subagents of a coherent agent. Rather, they have completely separate utility functions (mostly embodiments of instrumental goals) and cooperate due to their situation. Their thoughts and dialogue is written really, really well, and they are all very distinct, have salient goals, and are ADORABLE in their singlemindedness toward maximizing their individual values.

This is where the series excels: the main cast and their interactions. Unfortunately, over the course of the series, this becomes less and less of a focus.

The second novel, Crystal Mentality, becomes more focused on the politics of the Martian station that the Society find themselves on, and in its second half, in the conflict between the members of the Society. I found this somewhat less interesting, but still fairly engaging. The intra-Society conflict in particular was well-written, though its relative lack of actual interaction between the characters made it less interesting to me than the cooperation of the Society in the first book.

Where the series really breaks down is in the third installment.

For starters, we leave Face's perspective, and instead jump around the perspectives of other characters (mostly human) in a non-linear fashion. According to the author, this was supposed to help communicate the feeling of helplessness and confusion that humans might feel during AI takeoff, but instead it mostly just makes the novel less fun to read, because it completely plays against the the story's strengths.

This is annoying, but the story still could have been saved by a satisfying ending.

Then the story pulls really weird metaphysics out of nowhere, despite being quite hard sci-fi up until this point. It introduces this thingy called Ro. Ro is hard to explain or understand, probably because it doesn't make sense. To summarize, consciousness is ontologically fundamental, and, in fact, physicality arises from consciousness, rather than the other way around. Furthermore, there are laws about consciousnesses that seem sort of analagous to the laws of thermodynamics, which limit the maximum achievable level of intelligence as well as preventing drastic reductions in the diversity of consciousnesses, or something. It's presented in this weird kinda Zen way with Ro as a geometric shape/equation thingy whose rotations/angles of viewing produce the universe and consciousness and math.

This completely took me out of the story, because I thought it was supposed to be an exploration of AI takeoff and interactions/conflicts between different sorts of intelligences. Instead, it suddenly and very conveniently made the annihilation of humanity physically impossible, and superintelligences becoming *too* superintelligent physically impossible.

It was also just really confusing, what with the perspective changing every chapter and the non-linearity and certain perspectives fusing/splitting/creating aspects of themselves which emulate each other/other funky personhood stuff. Funky personhood stuff is fine (in fact I find it very interesting,) non-linearity can be fine, I think writers should take care when mixing them to this extent when the plot is also somewhat complicated. Though I would have given the story the benefit of the doubt and happily put more effort into puzzling the mess out if not for the wacky metaphysical bullshit.

I had somewhat similar issues with the Ra, except that I feel like Ra a decent amount of sense, so it was fine.

Anyone else have a similar experience? Thoughts?

  Similar experience here. The first book was one of the best I've ever read. The interactions between the cores was so interesting. 

  I immediately bought the second book, got a few chapters in.. and the pacing is just so terrible. I've picked it up several times but never make progress and have to drop it again. It's an absolute chore to read. I don't understand why the author thought such a big shift in tone and focus was a good idea. Book 1 was working, why change the formula?

    In your opinion, was the story at a reasonable stopping point at the end of the first book? I'm wondering if I should just read the first one and stop there, based on the comments in this thread.

  Sorry to not fully engage with your post here, but I think the truth of "Ro" is meant to be left somewhat ambiguous.  That is, it may be a trick played on Vision.  This reading was a bit more satisfying for me.  

  I wish we had spent less time in human PoVs (or with humans that better held my interest), but I'm sure it was hard to believably write the AIs as they increased in power. 

  Also, having some small acquaintanceship with the author, I wanted to note the following in case he's reading this: I really enjoyed the first book.  I didn't like the next two as much, but I hope he writes more fiction in the future.  I imagine it's painful for him to see all of the negative feedback the sequels have received.  I don't intend to censure anyone for tone, but I thought seeing my paragraph here might make it easier for him not to take things too personally, or feel too bad.

    I've heard of the theory of Ro as a trick. Here's a relevant comment from the author: 

    https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8dpxrb/crystal_eternity_now_available/dxtuxqx/

    He says it was heavily foreshadowed, but I'm not sure he really knows what foreshadowing is. He seems to have little concept of communication in storytelling.

    Overall as the story goes on it gets less and less focused and becomes less and less of a story. It's somehow not "tight" at all- there are many elements that could just as well have been removed in editing or simplified, to the betterment of the story's integrity- while simultaneously leaving out crucial information, and leaving many of its most interesting threads unexplored. I also feel that the first book is one of the best I've ever read, though. Dream, Wiki, and Growth remain some of my favorite characters in all fiction.

  I did like a number of (what seem to be) controversial choices the author made. I liked the dog chapters. I think they played into what the author was trying to go for, these discontinuities in consciousness different levels of intelligence allow. The discontinuity between dogs, humans, Face, and Growth.

  But yeah, Ro was annoying. That bit where Vision flips a coin, promising to eliminate all humanity if it comes up heads or tails, so it lands on its side, which is labeled "deus ex machina"? Such an odd decision. 

  I'll admit I am not sure how you could have landed the series without just killing everyone but Growth or Vision, and I'm not sure I wouldve been more satisfied by that. However, the surprisingly OP Growth was perfectly in line with the author's motif, if I am reading these books correctly, so I probably would've been fine with it.

  Anyways, I am happy to have paid Max Harms. He earned my money and more. I know that he has received criticism directly, and I hope he knows how good of a series he has written.

  My confusion is: a mind hack of Ro neatly explains the coin landing on its edge and such without violating the "no miracles" rule.  But the bomb on the nameless ship at the end of book 1 malfunctioning was a miracle that was explained by Ro, and none of the society could possibly have caused that from afar.  How, then, does this not violate "no miracles"?

  The whole Ro concept was very disappointing.

  My most generous take on it is that Ro is an in-universe explanation/discovery by the super intelligences for the pressure placed on authors to give a story a “happy ending” where not everyone dies. Basically if you were very smart and lived inside a fictional universe, you might be able to deduce some things about it that you wouldn’t if you lived in our universe.

  Not saying that makes it any good, it’s just the only explanation I could come up with for why the trilogy took that turn
