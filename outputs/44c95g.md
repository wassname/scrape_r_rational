  Iâ€™d buy it if it was remotely feasible for me to do so, reach out to fimfiction for infrastructure and design guidance, and do my best to keep rational fic as far away as possible from fanfiction.net from there out.

  I actually have a group of people working with me on making a standardized fanfiction mobile app already.

      You may want to work on your synchronization.
      For instance, Mother of Learning is 12 chapters behind.

      Was that the one written in django? If the source is up somewhere I might spend some time on it.
