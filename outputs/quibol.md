## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Anyone know any good 'jumpchain-adjacent' stories? I've read:

  *[Brockton's Celestial Forge](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/brocktons-celestial-forge-worm-jumpchain.70036/)*: It's a Worm fic that features a canon background character who wasn't even important enough to have a name. Uses a selection of jumpchain perks from a document called "The Celestial Forge," all themed around crafting. It's a writing experiment as much as anything else, so the pacing does suffer at times.

  *[Companion Chronicles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-el-goonish-shive.787978/)*: It's a jumpchain, except the main character is a companion instead of the jumper. Gets lost in its own head sometimes, but I found it enjoyable, overall.

  *[Nowhere Land](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/)*: It's a jumpchain, except it's a broken SCP anomaly. Strong elements of horror.

  *[Bootstrapping](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bootstrapping-multi-cross-book-2-now-in-naruto.770733/)*: It's not a jumpchain, but it's similar to one in some ways if you squint. Doesn't have any jump docs or perks, but 'jumping' from one setting to another is far from trivial. Probably my favorite story in this list.
  ```

    +1 for *Companion Chronicles*. Generally the entire Jumpchain genre is terrible, mostly because of the gratuitous wish fulfillment or the existential horror that is the self-insert genre--if not handled carefully by a skilled author. As such, the best ones are usually deconstructive, or satirical/parody in nature and this fic manages to do just that (deconstructive in this case). Personally, I found the *Worm* arc the strongest (and it's also the first) because the protagonist learns how terrible jumpchain is from first hand experience. 

    +1 for *Bootstrapping*. This mostly avoids the standard SI-pitfalls with plain good writing and the character visiting settings they are rather unfamiliar with. The character's actual motivation for worldhopping is a *bit* on the weak side, but overall she's cohesive and well made. One element I really liked is that she hated the first world's setting, DxD, which I can empathize with because it's just bad. 

    De-rec on *Brockton's Celestial Forge.* It's not overtly terrible, but the schtick is that the protagonist gains a new power every 2k words. This results in them just gaining power after power because simply describing the power they gain consumes enough words to grant a new power and the story devolves into self-reenforcing, magitech-wank with absolutely crippled pacing. Now, this isn't inherently bad--I'm rather mechanically inclined myself, and descriptions of hard-scifi or speculative technology are great; it's just that most of the "tech" is just straight up authorial-fiat-magic which takes the fun out of it for me. Also, the enemy power-scaling pisses me off even if there's a "canonical reason" for it--and it's not like the *Worm* setting lacks for worthy opponents.
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      Yeah, celestial forge works have an awkward problem where you kinda wanna frontload the power get and then drip feed the rest, which doesn't quite work with the points/words strategy.

    [cliffc999](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cliffc999s-slush-pile.519355/) has several good stories:

    [Jump-chan Didn't Start the Fire](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/jump-chan-didnt-start-the-fire-jumpchain-complete.542599/) and [Jumper: The Legendary Journeys](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/jumper-the-legendary-journeys-jumpchain-complete.497086/) are both straight up completed chains. Fairly short, but complete.

    [The Laumer Gambit](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-laumer-gambit-harry-potter-cyoa-jumpchain-adjacent.942693/) is fun and Jumpchain-adjacent, also complete.

    [The Light of the Forge](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-light-of-the-forge-rifts-celestial-forge.934831/) is the only good Celestial Forge fic I know of. It takes place in RIFTS, but you don't need any setting background. The author does include a small [setting primer and glossary](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-light-of-the-forge-rifts-celestial-forge.934831/#post-75781087) if you want it though, and the 'Apocrypha' threadmarks contain more setting info.

    *Really* 'adjacent' but cliff's current project is on QQ, called [An OP Journey](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/an-op-journey-cyoa-multicross-shadowrun.16353/), taking place in Shadowrun and eventually featuring Jumpchain-style jumps for multicross.

    Speaking of QQ, you may well be interested in the absolute _explosion_ of 'Waifu Catalog'/R34 Economy fics that got incredibly popular over there for the last year or two. There are literally hundreds of those, and some of them are actually good! Most feature world hopping and OCP protagonists, which is what I would call Jumpchain-adjacent.
    ```

    - u/kraryal:
      ```
      Despite the name, An OP Journey is really well paced and well written. Sure, the main character is OP, but he's very careful and rational about it so it doesn't swamp the story.

      Be warned that Light of the Forge is on hiatus, but OP Journey is updating rapidly.

    Very rational jumchain self-insert deconstruction. No given powers, no wish fulfillment, MC is thrown into a stress test. Every awakening is in new bed, but it's T-rated, no smut
    ```

- u/BavarianBarbarian_:
  ```
  I'd like to recommend Umberto Eco's [The Name of the Rose](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/119073.The_Name_of_the_Rose?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=G4fc1Cfec0&rank=1). It's... well, on the surface, it's a medieval monk murder mystery (yes I've been sitting on this one for a while). You've got your Sherlock expy, the retired Inquisitor William of Baskerville, an aspiring rationalist, as much as such a thing is possible in 14th century Europe. There's his Watson, the young monk Adson, who narrates the story. There is an abbey which houses the greatest collection of texts in the entire Western world. There's political intrigue, most of which frankly flew over my head because I'm not very familiar with 14th century Catholic faith politics, though the book makes a good effort to give the reader an understanding of the factions involved.  

  Certainly, some parts of the book were less than interesting. Besides the already mentioned political struggle, there were simply pages upon pages of descriptions of drawings, or book covers, or speeches, or sermons, none of which contributed meaningfully to the plot or the characters or even the themes of the story, as far as I could notice with my limited literary prowess. I found myself skimming about 20-30 pages alltogether, by my estimation.  
  This is mostly offset by an interesting murder investigation, in which the murderer seems to follow the apocalyptic prophecies, and the prose, which is often captivating when it doesn't overdo it.

  However, there is one primary reason I recommend that book on this subreddit: The story and especially William talk *a lot* about philosophy of science, even if it's never called such. William often relates the finding of hypotheses and their testing from their investigation to the same tasks in scientific studies as well as theological debates. Contrasted with his *almost* enlightened views (as in the historical period of Enlightenment, not... whatever nonprofessional quote makers on Reddit think it is) are the medieval thought patterns and discussion structures exhibited by all other monks. Eco shows their debate modus faithfully: In their eyes, empiricism or independent thought is worthless, points can only be proven by showing how some prior authority figure thought about the concept or a related topic.  
  Watching someone who's so clearly intelligent fail to change the minds of his contemporaries due to their blind faith in authorities should provide ideas for people who want to write stories about a single guy ending up in the middle ages and bootstrap himself an industrial revolution.

  Oh, also content warning for period-accurate sentiments of the main characters concerning homosexuality, non-Christians, women,...

  All in all, an entertaining book, and maybe a bit of a change from the usual fare recommended here.

    ```
    You should try "An Instance of a Fingerpost"

  Today I would like to recommend for all fans of horror the podcast The Magnus Archives.

  More specifically the second episode titled Do Not Open. It is akin to the YouTube video Hell No: The Sensible Horror Movie, in that the protagonist is quite well suited for the travails he must deal with.

  Here is the link to the episode on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/2eRmdP9mAEbgzVxyzF8aK6?si=OieuJQ01R9STlJrDpLLptg&utm_source=copy-link

  I recommend the whole podcast as the first 4 seasons (160 episodes, the whole show is 200 episodes with 40 episodes a season) has wonderfully tight story boarding, writing, character development, and sound boarding. If the show had ended on episode 160 I would consider it the single best horror fiction ending I've ever experienced. 

  Sadly I found that the final season was far more rushed and the ending did not have the impact the writer intended it to have.

  However it is still an excellent listen. The writing does very well to depict the slow spiral into madness and loss of rationality and logic that would come with living in a cosmic horror world and the voice acting is marvelous.
  ```

    ‘Hell No: The Sensible Horror Movie’ was a great quick laugh, thanks for recommending it!

    ```
    How long does it take to get to the metaplot? I found the early handful episodes to be good, but not the sort of horror I enjoy; meanwhile, much of the hype is the cast of characters and >!several types of horror abominations that make up the world.!<
    ```

    - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:
      ```
      I believe the first non-subtle hints of meta plot begin around episode 4 and 8. The teens help establish and set up further recurring motifs/places/characters. 22 is where the implications and consequences of statements start to be felt by the cast outside of the "this is local and I should probably stay away from there". 

      It's a slow burn with great pay off. Think of the first season as setting a norm and then the rest of the show as thoroughly destroying the reality set up for the cast so far. The idea of what the meta-plot is will change for the listener as you progress through the show.

      What kind of horror do you enjoy? As this is very much a cosmic/lovecraftian horror.
      ```

      - u/fljared:
        ```
        I do like Cosmic horror, but only those that show the horror; A lot stories focus too much (for my tastes) on exclusively ramping up the tension and not on "here's the actual scary thing"- compare and contrast SCPs like 106 (Here's exactly what it does) vs ones with a large amount of exploration logs (Often a low information-to-atmosphere level; the summary being "The cameras saw a hand in the dark, then cut out")

        And those aren't bad, but I enjoy a work that explores the horror (closer to science fiction) than ramps up tension (closer to thrillers)
        ```

        - u/Master_Gazelle_6068:
          ```
          Ah gotcha. No it very much has here is the scary thing moments. The whole point of the series is the variety of horror experienced, but there is no not saying what the horror is. 

          The whole show goes on with "Statement recordings" being the primary focus of each episode but as it enroaches on the cast's lives it become more like live recordings of statements if that makes any sense. 

          I'm trying to think of an accurate way to describe without spoiling. At the beginning it's more like snippets of recordings at the beginning or ending of statements of office interactions, occasionally interrupting the recording. Once you pass the mid way of season 1 the amount of non-statement audio increases drastically.

          Edit: Think of the first 10 or so episodes as worldbuilding and the rest as world acting. At the very least try for the season 1 finale, if you want even more than the finale the rest of the show is about the same amount as that, or maybe a little more. The setting changes each season and they don't even stay at the institute for the whole of the first season.

          Hope this helps!

  Strong recommendation for John Shirley's "Rapture" (Bioshock 1 prequel in novel form).

  Not exactly rationalist but a bit rational; the story is just a vehicle for the exploration of philosophies: Objectivism (and in it, rational selfishness) and Collectivism (and in it, idealistic altruism) and how they could go horrifically bad in realistic setting.

  For those who don't know what it is about, its basically a deconstruction of the "rational genius builds an utopia" idea.

  The story is obviously pretty formulaic and railroaded because it is about doomed characters, like most such prequels, but the main strength of the novel is its beautiful language. Shirley paints a beautifully horrific picture with words, and is especially good at writing dialogue and using slang, cant, patois and word choice to make the characters unique.

  The Last Orellen's shaping up to be an excellent read so far, although it currently only has 21 chapters  
  [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46901/the-last-orellen-an-epic-progression-fantasy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46901/the-last-orellen-an-epic-progression-fantasy)  


  **World-building:** Set in a world where magic is hereditary and powerful magical families dominate entire schools of magic, The Last Orellen reminds me of WtC in how magic is extremely categorical, niche, but also fully explored by the inhabitants of the world. Brought to its logical conclusion, entire industries are dependent upon the hereditary affinities of certain large families - House Orellen, for instance, monopolises the "space" affinity and thereby has a commercial monopoly over trade and transportation.   


  The operation of magic is also empirically studied and analysed by its practitioners- for example, "Luck" magic was thought to be useless, but after  trial-and-error experimentation was conducted, its operation was revealed to be dependent upon the initial variables capable of being affected by the user, with "luck" being more reminiscent of a supercomputer outputing a prediction based on the variables put in.  


  **Characters:** Well-thought out, intelligent characters and characterisation.   


  The Main character is currently an extremely endearing boy whose interest in exploring magic likely mimics the audience's own.  
  Characters behave highly rationally too - the plot is set in motion by House Orellen receiving a prophecy that their seventh born child of Lord Orellen "may someday become the most powerful magus in the world". Due to it merely being a "may" and not "will", it is accurately anticipated by the members of house Orellen that other families would see this as a potential threat, and the vagaries of realpolitik necessitate their extermination.   


  Accordingly, options are considered (should they simply kill the child to appease other families? should they ensure that no such 7th child could exist at all?), discarded (none of the other families would believe that the 7th child would have died, and the looming threat of the 7th child would always linger, as there would always be a Lord Orellen), and steps taken to prepare for such an eventuality.   


  Characters also have highly distinct "voices", and several moments between the MC and his adoptive family are quite sweet and touching at times. 

  **Style:** Technically perfect and evocative of more traditional fantasy works. This could absolutely be a published novel.  


  Overall, this seems to be an extremely promising work, and I highly recommend it if low chapter counts are not an issue for you.

  I've been really enjoying The Bureau of Isekai Affairs. It's the story of a software engineer who gets isekai'd to a place that has a _lot_ of people getting isekai'd, and is handed a wizard's grimoire and recruited on the spot by the Fantasy FBI who are chasing after a malicious necromancer.

  "Wiz Biz, minus the grossness" is a reasonable five-word pitch for it. The MC is having very plausible reactions and I love her internal monologues.

  It's new, only 14 chapters up at the moment.

    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Wiz Biz refers to Rick Cook's "The Wiz Biz" series, yes.

      The story continues with a mix of dealing with the remnants of the Book One antagonist forces and bringing in a wave of new blood from Earth to make a more generally-usable programming-magic framework.

    On /r/rational?  Skews the field quite a bit, and admittedly they're rarely romance novels in the classic sense, but:

    - [*Water* and *Mana*, by Alicorn](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/stories.shtml), and of course *Luminosity* (for a while)
    - *Vampire Flower Language* by /u/magicweasel (really is romance)
    - [*In your arms I shall not fear the night*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/13579596/) (tragedy warning)

    Not rational, and the main couple is M/F but I quite liked [The Demon Lord's Lover](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20243/the-demon-lords-lover). The premise is that the mentor of the current generation of heroes falls in love with Demon Lord, and the two have a grand journey to finally meet each other in person. 

    The world starts somewhat bland but slowly gets very well developed, it's an interesting world with well developed lore, regions, politics, etc. It's not a magnum opus of worldbuilding or anything, but it's surprisingly well developed considering that the story is mostly a romantic comedy. It's also the only story I've ever read where almost everyone is poly, yeah. And it's not even a titillating thing or anything, they are poly as naturally as they drink water. It's a very interesting thought experiment in that respect, and I commend the authors for that. Everything else is pretty run of the mill romcom adventure, if high quality and enjoyable. Strongly recommend!

  I strongly recommend [The Devil's Dark Remnant](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39156/the-devils-dark-remnant-an-urban-progression-fantasy). It's an urban fantasy YA-ish novel with the usual urban fantasy creatures, but the paranormal society shown so far has Wiccan/Occult-ish aspects instead of the normal fae court, vampire gothic, angels, demons, etc. There's also government conspiracies and internet message boards following those conspiracies. It's a very interesting setting. 

  The main character is a breath of fresh air among male protagonists. He's competent, but also has definite flaws that *he realizes he has*, and works to improve on them. I really like his brand of self awareness, and leaning on his support group when it feels like too much, although he's still a teen and makes stupid decisions. He feels like a lot of teenagers I know, has a modicum of self awareness and knows how to work through toxic masculinity tropes, while also not having enough experience or self awareness to temper the more impulsive decisions. 

  The other characters haven't shown as much depth yet, since a lot of time is spent in Seth's head and looking at things through his view of real life. And the teenage angst does get a bit much at times, which is why I said it's YA-ish. But on the other hand the action scenes are great, the author is very good at writing action scenes. They get the heart pumping while still having enough unexpected curveballs that you're not always sure how the protagonist will win, or if they will even win. And when it goes hard, it definitely *goes hard,* moreso than I'd expect in a YA novel. Lots of gun violence, blood, and broken bones, as well as sounds of watermelon smashing, with the biological description given in the next line.
