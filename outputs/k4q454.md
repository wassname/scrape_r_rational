## Worth the Candle, why the protagonist has a depressing spiral of death and pain. Spoilers.

### Post:

Worth the Candle is a great story, and has all sorts of fun world building elements to cover. I enjoy it a lot. And part of that is his endless struggles. Recent chapters have made me have a theory about his irrationality and why he tends to have bittersweet wins.

He is an absolutely terrible incremental game player. He isn't very good with numbers.

He knows that numbers dominate the world, and that numbers determine how well you do, but his main plan to win has reliably just been to soul his way up to high skills and hope for the best.

He has avoided a number of strategies to improve his numbers.

1. He doesn't tend to break the level 20 cap of skills, despite being a rich guy with access to skilled trainers.

2. He doesn't tend to increase the number of techniques of magic he knows, despite being a rich guy with access to skilled trainers.

3. He doesn't seek alternative ways to boost his stats, such as entads or rare locations or people or biological modification.

4. He acts as the main party face, without making any real effort to use the high social stat people for social conflicts and having terrible social stats. See the recent dragon conflict. 

5. He doesn't leverage state power for personal gain. He now has control of three states, through allies and such, and rarely uses his numbers.

6. He hasn't made a strong effort to exploit the loyalty mechanic, even for consenting individuals. 

7. He doesn't exploit the time chambers they have access to for training and relationship grinding. 

While there may be rubber banding of challenges, he could likely have lower cost conflicts if he had a broader variety of skills and stats. As it is he needs to soul abuse himself to get boosted skills, give up all his gold to the gold entity, and expend rare magical items to win conflicts often. 

The world is a clicker game, like those he used to waste his time away with. He could get his numbers high, but he just endlessly looks for quick get powerful schemes rather than putting in the time and effort to improve, or spending it cuddling Amaryllis in a time chamber to improve your relationship.

It would work narratively as well, as it would likely amuse the DM more than him repeating the same trick repeatedly whenever there was a conflict as he tends to do. He's not that creative as a player.

  I can't say I've fully 100% retained every detail of the story, so sorry for inaccuracies, but:

  1) My understanding is that you get relatively negligible XP for training, especially as you level a skill. You need to engage in actual combat, complete quests, that sort of thing to really level the skills. When he was lower level he did, in fact, grind like you suggest.

  2) Hasn't he trained all the useful skills he has access to? What else would he learn that's worth the tradeoff in time?

  3) Do they know actually know a way of finding those things and choose not to? I think the best way of finding unknown rare things is generally going to be through quests which they do plenty of.

  4) I feel like Amaryllis and Valencia do *a lot* of that to the point where Amaryllis almost feels like the main character a lot of the time. Juniper is mostly the active one when his decision on whether to project overwhelming force is the main deciding factor in the situation, which make a lot of sense to me.

  5) IIRC he's taken tons of entads from Anglycynn and they use the Tuung to achieve very impressive feats. I'm not exactly sure what else they could be doing with their power.

  6) What is there about the loyalty mechanic that is exploitable? Loyalty points seem to only be assigned when genuine insight and character development happen, there's not really an "improve relationship" button to grind. Are you thinking about how he could have altered souls before? Cause that's pretty opposed to his ethical views and I'm not sure it would even work.

  7) I guess he could spend more time in the time chamber, but being locked up in a time chamber with someone for a long time could easily back fire, and you're getting at most a loyalty bonus. As for training see point 1. Also it got taken away as an option for him unexpectantly, since using the chamber involves being inside Bethel.

  The world very much does not feel like a clicker game to me, at least not at the level Juniper is at. I don't think there really are simple ways of grinding, and he's often operating under some extreme time pressure.

    1. He tends to grind up to the unskilled training cap and stop, even if he has the stats to go higher, because he doesn't tend to get trainers.

    2. He can learn extremely quickly, and can buy access to time chambers. He could cap out his skills with access to trainers, along with learning spells that trained mages know.

    3. They don't really go on quests to find things, juniper sticks to the main plot and immediate emergencies. 

    4. He has multiple times faced issues because he has social conflicts with people on his own. Notably, there are ways for him to lead without losing the benefits of others, such as seeking out communication entads, or making a radio. They mostly relied on the house for that and made no effort to find an alternative.

    5. He has used the tuung to achieve large worldbuilding feats, but not to gather personal power. Likewise with anglycynn, he has taken what amary rightfully owns, but nothing more.

    6. Spending a lot of time with people let's him learn about them and boost his loyalty. As such, spending time with them chatting or watching anime or such in a time chamber makes him materially more powerful and let's him destress. 

    7. There are other time chambers they can rent. 

    He has had lots of downtime, and again, they have access to time chambers to grind stuff.

  In my view, Amaryllis is the protagonist and Juniper is a mostly ordinary teenager from Bumblefuck, Kansas who was given god-tier ability to improve himself and his companions. Juniper is in the story to provide a relatable character for Amaryllis to explain things to. I'll agree that Juniper does do a poor job of optimizing things, but given his age, inexperience, and inadequacy of training, that's not surprising at all. Amaryllis does her best to keep him on track, and she's obviously doing a decent job of it given that they're effectively running three countries now and even the dragons don't want to fight with them anymore.

  I'm not going to answer all of these, nor do I think they're even wrong, but a few points:

  > 1. He doesn't tend to break the level 20 cap of skills, despite being a rich guy with access to skilled trainers.
  > 2. He doesn't tend to increase the number of techniques of magic he knows, despite being a rich guy with access to skilled trainers.

  The most valuable skills he could do this with, his magics, are illegal to receive or give training in to people who arent vetted by the associated Athenaeum. Maybe they could convince an Athenaeum to give some training to this guy who somehow became incredibly proficient in the magic that they supposedly have a monopoly on, but probably not, and it would take a while. The penalty for teaching magic to someone unlicensed is death, so they aren't going to find illegal teachers, not good ones anyway, and the Athenaeum would be hesitant at best to give very valuable teaching to someone they don't know.

  Aside from that, it gives some strategic advantage away. Joon being absurdly proficient at magic is pretty valuable information, and the specific magics he knows and at what proficiency is also pretty valuable. The group would be handing whatever Athenaeum they contacted a good bit of information for relatively little gain, considering how fast he gains skill levels when using the magic.

  For the magics he actually could get legal instruction on: he tried to get instruction on vibration magic from Oberlin but was shut down, and not too long after that Sound and Silence had some staffing problems and probably can't spare their most educated members.

  For gem and water magic, he would just need a teacher, but those are also two of his least valuable magics. And they *did* try to hire a really good water magic teacher, but the DM shut that down and gave them someone who wasn't a particularly good teacher.

  > 3. He doesn't seek alternative ways to boost his stats, such as entads or rare locations or people or biological modification.

  He did get some biological modifications, this batch in fact, but with decent PHY his body has fairly few areas that existing magic could meaningfully improve.

  > 7. He doesn't exploit the time chambers they have access to for training and relationship grinding. 

  Relationship grinding doesn't really work. They went over this, spending significant time with someone with the specific intent of raising their loyalty doesn't really endear them to him, and means any action he takes is tainted by his motivation for extrinsic rewards.

  They *do* use time chambers for increasing skills, but the level 20 cap on amateur training means there isn't all that much point anymore, since he gets skills to 20 in a handful of hours anyways.

    ```
    He has access to a secret government organization of black power and a wife with control of a state, a reputation as the next saviour and a massive amount of wealth. Convincing someone to be corrupt for him is a solvable problem, and one that I would really expect him to follow. It's not like he needs an extreme expert. He doesn't know a lot of low hanging fruit. If he had tried and failed that would be one thing, but he didn't really try. He didn't even ask his mother what spells are common for water mages. 

    You can make explanations after the fact of why he didn't do it, but it wasn't mentioned in story so it apparently wasn't even a plan. 

    I dunno if the mods improved his stats or if they were sidegrades or fluff upgrades. We shall I guess.

    Amary managed to raise her relationship with pure mental effort, and as grak mentioned, he does go on the rounds regularly to spend time with everyone and often gets loyalty ups. Relationship grinding does work fairly well. It feels bad to him because of the extrinsic rewards, but he does regularly go on the rounds and get boosted relationships.

      AWales really doesn't like writing out things that turn into dead ends. There are a million things that the group as a whole can do, but entire chapters of "we tried X thing for Y reason, but it didn't do all that much because of Z" would not be good story telling. Juniper tried to unlock a ton of magics super early on, but we were only informed that he did try when it was relevant during his actual learning of the magic. The word count of the story is already obscene, it really doesn't need even more words detailing all the things that won't work and won't affect the plot.

      Water magic does not have spells, just like gold magic doesn't and arguably still magic doesn't. It's a single ability that is applied in a variety of ways.

      > You can make explanations after the fact of why he didn't do it, but it wasn't mentioned in story so it apparently wasn't even a plan. 

      Disagree heavily here. One of the most common complaints this story gets is that it spends too long talking about things. Adding in even more talking and planning for things that won't go anywhere would be actively bad. There are going to be lots of plans that we may get a full explanation for during the payoff, or maybe we will only see the payoff, but are never going to be fully detailed as they're happening.

      > Amary managed to raise her relationship with pure mental effort, and as grak mentioned, he does go on the rounds regularly to spend time with everyone and often gets loyalty ups.

      She did that exactly once.

      Spending downtime between missions checking on people is a lot different from spending weeks in a time chamber with the express intent of grinding loyalty.

        He didn't even get skills like repair up past the cap, and I really doubt that repairmen or women are so committed to their work that for a million no one would take him past the cap. Till recently it would be really useful as well since he could dump all his skill points into one super skill. 

        This isn't necessarily a flaw in the story. It's about a depressed teen who is obsessed with finding uther and ignores everything else in favour of that if they can. He is also a dm, not a player, so him not being very good at playing is no surprise. 

        So yeah, I am doubtful the actual explanation is that this is all too hard and it was resolved off screen and shown to be impossible because AWales doesn't like to show dead paths. More likely the explanation is that juniper is a bad gamer and isn't very good at planning and gaming. 

        On the other issue, we don't know if still magic or gold magic or water magic has spells, because juniper has never asked an expert about it. 

        It would take one line to cover this issue, it wouldn't break the wordcount.

        Sure, and if she can do it once, she can probably do it again. Valencia and Amary would be up for it, grak probably wouldn't, and raven might be up for it. The locus would hate it, bethel would be up for it but he shouldn't do it with her, fenn would have loved it.

        He has an excuse anyway, of wanting down time.

          The reason I didn't mention the non-magic skills is because they aren't nearly as valuable, and are much less valuable to train. For the skills that aren't ever going to be needed too urgently, it doesn't matter if they aren't at their caps because he can level them pretty fast in the course of using them. The more he needs that skill, the higher it will be. And then it might not matter at all that he doesn't have it at cap, because he got the opportunity to spend a long time doing productive things using that skills, as happened in the story:

          > I had put a ton of work into our plans, leveling almost all of my non-combat skills up to their caps, and getting new virtues in the process.

          Chapter 220.

          As for the soul stuff, he only needs enough points to get soul magic to 80 or so, at which point he can take skills from the souls of others. It's not all that urgent to get every skill as high as it can go for soul magic.

          > On the other issue, we don't know if still magic or gold magic or water magic has spells, because juniper has never asked an expert about it. 

          We know what those magics do pretty well. There's no reason to suspect that these magics have discrete spells to unlock when every use we see is an application of a relatively simple base ability. Water magic can move water around on a large scale with a handful of factors governing the extent. Gold magic is somewhat low precision, high strength telekinesis at very short range. Still magic stops things from changing, though as I said still magic is a little more arguable.  There's no reason to spend time asking about things that should be readily apparent at this point.

            He doesn't know what the higher level virtues are so he doesn't know if they have useful applications, and he has several needs. Essentialism, still magic, sword work, unarmed, armor. The more he can dump into them the better he can do. He could also raise up other magics if they were needed for a particular purpose.

            As he noted he almost lost the sword duel because he didn't have enough sword skill. If he could dump more into that he could have done better, because onion had higher attributes. As such, again, I suspect that juniper is pretty bad at planning out his advancement. 

            Do you have evidence we know what those magics do pretty well? That there aren't spells or tricks that a skilled expert could teach?

              If he has the time to dump points into *all* of those, he has time to put points into essentialism and then take the skills from other souls instead. He has enough points already in non-combat skills that it really isn't an issue

              > As he noted he almost lost the sword duel because he didn't have enough sword skill. If he could dump more into that he could have done better, because onion had higher attributes. As such, again, I suspect that juniper is pretty bad at planning out his advancement. 

              He didn't dump all his skills into the skills he used to fight Onion, he drew from souls, and he was capped at 300 anyways going in to the fight. More points in the other skills wouldn't have helped, because he didn't really use them.

              > Do you have evidence we know what those magics do pretty well? That there aren't spells or tricks that a skilled expert could teach?

              There's a whole world building document that gives a decent explanation of all the major magics plus water magic. There's the textual descriptions of the magic when he gets it and all the times he uses it. I'm not sure what more you could want. He has water magic in the 20s at least, which is roughly equivalent to being a graduate student. It would be *incredibly* weird to get to that level of skill without knowing something so basic about the magic. It would be like going into your third year of graduate school for computer science but not knowing that computers run on electricity.

                He didn't get athletics, so he didn't get all of the skills, and my point about the various skills having benefits above the cap remains. He could try to get his other skills up, but does not. Plus, he faced the issue that it was harder to train a skill up each time, so he should have raised them more.

                Him using the same tactic each time is probably why soul magic got excluded. If he had found some clever trick with other skills he would likely be stronger now.

                The world building document doesn't describe them in enough depth to say whether the others have spells, and he didn't learn any more blood magic powers with levels. The skill levels just give him greater skill, not specific abilities. It is weird, but the game layer is weird.

                  He posted this in the early birds chat when that batch came out
                  > You should assume that he did and the virtues weren't particularly applicable to the fight/plot (either more applicable to traditional track and field stuff, or superceded by other virtues such as the ability to fight without fatigue).

                  > (Honestly, writing virtues was my least favorite part of this batch, and I think that for some readers it probably just makes their eyes glaze over, especially the second section, which basically comes mid-fight, which is one of the reasons that I elected not to make a bunch of new ones for Athletics. Rifles was the other one that was arguable, given that he was using something that could reasonably have been considered one with maybe a different form factor, or which he could potentially have decided on using a borrowed rifle entad with if it were good enough, but it's one of those things that would have just taken up space on the page for no good reason, and you can assume that things I find sufficiently boring are being left out.)

                  Admittedly, that wasn't public information, so it's hard to fault you for not knowing it.

                  I'm not sure what to tell you for whether water magic has spells. It's given a very clear outline for what it does. Macrohydrokinesis. Maybe it can do more at higher levels, maybe it just gets more precision, but there's no reason to suspect water magic has some additional abilities tacked on to it that nobody seems to ever mention despite their knowledge of it. Basically the same for gold magic, it's tactile telekinesis plus some stuff related to finding and marking gold. They're really simple.

                  For blood magic, he only can get to 35. Reimer explained why he doesn't automatically get spells on skill increase. Maybe he did learn some of the other blood magic spells in the weeks of time he's had between screen time, and that will get brought up when it's relevant.

                    Makes sense. In that situation it would not be useful, as you said, since he was relying on soul scalpism.

                    Still, I suspect raising skills above the 20 cap would be useful outside, as skills are useful, and he does face situations where he is short on resources. As such, since he doesn't raise skills above 20 generally, I suspect he doesn't try to find good trainers.

                    >I'm not sure what to tell you for whether water magic has spells. It's given a very clear outline for what it does. Macrohydrokinesis.

                    Weather is an extremely broad subject, and there's a lot of very complicated things he could be doing, like summoning water tornadoes or storms or lightning. 

                    Likewise, telekinesis is a very broad subject, with a lot of potential variants, and we don't know if the gold entity can offer buffs to people or variations on powers for especially good service.

                    And the same could be true of other magics, that there are unique abilities and spells and such that a skilled practitioner can learn. Trainers are useful for this. 

                    If he was feeling anti social, he could have sent his pet thief to steal some magic books to learn from.

              That's not quite what happened. In fact Juniper calls out massively outskilling his opponent as his specific edge in the fight against Onion. The only reason that fight wasn't trivial was how op Onion's entads were and Juniper's relatively bad physical stats.
              ```

- u/Amonwilde:
  ```
  I think the fact that Juniper is weak in social skills, to the point that he has a large blind spot for that whole area, is a core part of the story. His history on earth is one of messing up relationships, that and his escapism through worldbuilding are his two defining qualities. So, yes, sometimes his social failures are frustrating, but I think they're actually a relatively strong part of the story. More specifically, I think he's right not to try to game loyalty. This has been lampshaded well with Grak, who is reasonably highly suspicious on the whole loyalty mechanic, and it seems like pushing on that mechanic could backfire. Perhaps one area where he could have made more of an effort is with the locus, who gets consistently sidelined.

  I agree with you in that Juniper falls down on basic gaming skills. He's actually a halfway decent exploiter or munchkin, he's found quite a few holes in the system and found out how to string them together, and he's strong in the area of usefully deploying magic items. He almost completely ignored the early quests, though, for some reason, which is poor strategy, and made him overly dependent on cheats, which has resulted in major issues and a put-out-the-fire mentality. I'm not actually even sure what the latest endgame rush is supposed to accomplish, as a purely practical matter that kind of approach never works in games where you don't have mastery that comes from playing through the game multiple times. You can't speedrun on your first playthrough. It's sad to see him go through quests that should have been done levels and levels ago, that's really just a waste He also systematically undervalues any skill that isn't magic. Consider how much use he's gotten out of swords alone, highly useful skills like bows were treated like. It's fine that he's not a gamer, but most of his problems do seem to stem from making a giant rush for the endgame. Admittedly the DM escalates quite quickly, but Juniper's inability to play along, to play the game qua game, is a major source of problems.
  ```

- u/IronPheasant:
  ```
  Yeah, he is rushing and neglecting the assets his team can bring (with Fenn, you can win. When you've got Grak, you don't go back). I'd like to touch on their primary problem: the metagame, or narrative as they call it in the story.

  These fictional universes have their own rules and fundamental laws. As an illustration, I present to you the Dragon Ball fan-fiction *Reincarnated as Yamcha*. The story they wrote takes the Dragon Ball canon as something literal and that makes sense, so in the end New Yamcha ends up ultimately being as relevant as a background fern regardless of his effort. I hate where they went with it - it makes that whole universe and story feel like its carved in stone and dead.

  It isn't how shounen stories work. They're self-insert wish fulfillment stories. That are there to entertain the audience, and respond quickly to their reactions. Training effectiveness is based completely on how entertaining and novel the method used is, [as well as how much the audience likes you.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42HNvl0e26I) The very first thing New Yamcha should have done was cling to Bulma's leg, because his life depends on it, and then gone around doing entertaining hero stuff, so he could hijack the MC slot Steve Urkel style. Then there might have been Super Space Werewolves instead of monkeys as the ultimate fightin' race or whatever. Maybe if he didn't allow things to escalate, it could have remained a lighthearted adventure story with gags instead of a wrestlin' show.

  So. Back to Worth the Candle.

  According to Table Top rules, a good DM will strive to make his players happy. They'll accommodate the interests of the table and let them have the freedom to have fun. A bad DM is dictatorial - you will do these chores I set up for you and you'll like it.

  In a perfect world, Joon would be able to relax, maximize the skills that cultivate strength (that's mainly the crafting abilities on his sheet. I'm sure you've had tons of fun imagining all the things Woodworking can do. Like create those teachers you were talking about.) all while running a sandwich shop. If he doesn't seek violence, he won't suffer violence... buuuut the DM gave him a dozen apocalypses and a time counter and Joon knows he's under a Joon-class DM so probably assumes he has less time to work with than he thinks.

  He did abuse his crafting skill Essentialism and burn through various skills - easy come, easy go. The DM might be less likely to ban skills if the player were actually personally invested in them. You could argue he indulged Joon's antics with Essentialism for as long as he did solely due to that. A more energetic Joon might have combined it with Livestock and created an army of super intelligent cows or exploited other synergies as it seemed designed to do... but I'm pretty sure we're all in agreement that Woodworking is broken. At a minimum you can use it to make more companions each with their own cheat. You can literally write a hundred very different Worth the Candle spinoffs with this magic genie alone.

  TLDR: Yeah, I personally would have tried to hide in a hole and cultivate even if the world got swallowed up in the meantime. Every cultivator knows cultivating = winning, while going outside makes you doomed to be yamcha-esque canon fodder for the MC.

  Fundamentally I think there is a misunderstanding here. If the GM was like Reimer, I'd agree. The numbers would be all that mattered. The GM is not like Reimer though, they are like Juniper. Ultimately the GM is not trying to kill Juniper, he is trying to tell an interesting story/make an interesting game. That's why you get bullshit like a random barely relevant npc having the exact counter to Juniper's op 100 still magic cheese. It ultimately doesn't matter how much he games the numbers, the GM isn't going to let him get away with no challenge. The only way Juniper could end up having no chance is if he puts himself into the situation with adequate warning about the threat level. (For example the Onion fight was an out of depth encounter and not at all necessary. Juniper just pushed for it anyway.)

  If the party wanted they could spend decades preparing for Fel Seed, but in the Juniper perspective that's a boring waste of time and the GM would tend to agree. Ultimately in a tabletop game its not the numbers that determine your success/failure, its the GM. (Within reasonable limits of course like I mentioned before with the Onion fight.)

  Reading most of the comments, I think there is an under-discussed aspect going on here: I think the author has made it fairly clear, via text and subtext, that the numbers game characteristic of litRPGs and related genres is actually a crutch to avoid more interesting narrative elements.

  You can see this in broad strokes by comparing how stat heavy the early chapters are compared to how narrative heavy the later ones are. When was the last time that we saw an "Affliction" bold text announcement, right? When was the last time that the character sheet was presented? On a narrative level (for us reading WtC, not the narrative in the story), I think the reason that soul magic got the ax was because it was the last significant RPG GUI still in the story.

  I love this because while I enjoy the litRPG genre in the abstract, I actually have a hard time finishing stories because I always get bored after the fiftieth discussion about, eg, whether to use experience points to boost one handed metal sword critical hit chance by 5% or whatever. When the story becomes a literal optimization problem, I always lose interest.

  I think if WtC spent lots of time talking about Juniper getting incrementally better at every available skill and exactly how that increases his probability of success, or if there were tons of discussion about the perfectly optimal combination of experience point distribution, without ever tying it back to an interesting narrative, I would have stopped reading.

  For me, the introduction focusing so heavily on RPG mechanics worked well because it was a very efficient way to build the world for us. The world was huge and mysterious and confusing, but the character sheet quantified Juniper's status and progress in a neat way. And, of course, the RPG elements form the basis for all of the cool magic. But after getting sufficiently immersed in Aerb, I don't really want to keep hearing about whether Jun's knife throwing skill is at 17 or 18. I want a brief discussion of how he's been training his skills, and then I want to see him throw knives real good, which is basically what happens and I love it.

  Instead of continued attention on stats and skill trees, I think the story is right to redirect the attention to the more important thing Jun needs to work on: growing as a person and making connections with people in ways he couldn't before. The quest keeping track of how many companions he's had sex with gets at this in a really clever way. His progress begins in simplified, quantified RPG land with x/7 popping up as it happens. But he quickly gets annoyed at this and at this point in the story, it would be completely absurd for him to care about the counter at all. He's developed deep, intimate relationships with everyone in his party and the RPG component that initially spurred him on is vestigial.

  I think this point applies more broadly and actually dovetails into what others have been saying: the GM is going to keep escalating things no matter how hard Jun grinds and focusing excessively on optimizing the RPG elements is really just ignoring all of the beautiful depth the world has beyond them.

  It's basically Goodhart's law applied to world building. Grinding skills was good to a point, but to achieve his goals, Jun needs to move beyond that and work on deeper problems. I have mixed feelings about rushing to the endgame, which seems to be what's happening, but I don't think the story would be improved if it were interrupted to show Jun optimizing his character sheet at the eleventh hour when the whole time we've been learning that his real problems are not solvable like that and on a meta note, that a story can't be (satisfyingly) solved by the protagonist hitting the max level.

  But I think if you expect the story to stay true to its litRPG roots, the lack of explicit skill point optimization in the later parts of the story might be irksome.

  This is spot on, and I'd extend it to say that his lack of *normal* power progression likely bears a large part of the blame for the exclusions he's been causing. If a level 100 character is basically invincible and defeats Mome'Rath, that's only to be expected. If a level 15 player munchkins their way into level 100 stats and does it, that's breaking the game and therefore a reason to change the rules. (That is at least partly the DM's fault for throwing far too high CR enemies at him, but Juniper's refusal to settle for anything but immediate and total victory, and his reluctance to let temporary boosts wear off naturally, isn't playing well with that tendency.)

    Yeah. He can easily get lots of power in lots of magics, and potentially get companion buffs, he has other routes to be op. With a notably stronger magical foundation and a stronger party there's a good chance he could have killed Mome' Rath without needing soul magic hijinks. Broader power means more chance at creative solutions.

  Even if I agreed on every point, I think I disagree with the overall premise of the post. For two reasons:

  1.) I don't think that people work like that. There are a lot of ways, big and small, that we could optimize our lives for a particular criteria. Using money as an example (the closest IRL analog to a person's power level), there are things that you and I could be doing right now to either earn money or raise our earning potential. We're not doing that though, because at some point we value something more than seeing our numbers go up.

  Even super charitable people who donate all their money to saving lives, they all draw the line *somewhere*. Juniper has been the target of two(?) exclusions so far, so it's not as if he's making *zero* effort to game the system. What we see in-story is simply where he draws the line.


  2.) I don't think that munchkining is all the story wants to be about. I can imagine a story where Joon does try to min-max everything. Like many other Gamer!Fictions, it soon gets tedious to read without a driving conflict. Which-- I guess that you could do min-maxing off screen and come back to introduce the next interesting thing or whatever, but that seems to be status quo already? I don't remember the scenes for grinding ink magic, star magic nor water magic.

  I *do* remember Joon using his resources to acquire star and water magic tutors, but I *only* remember those because they were both enmeshed in layers of plot.

    Both of the exclusions were because Juniper found a comfortable exploit, soul magic to boost skills, and reliably used it. His numbers go up very quickly, he just doesn't optimize much outside his fairly narrow niche.

    His numbers actually go up even faster with trainers, so it's not like this would increase the amount of time he spends doing things in story.

    Out of story, I think people would be fine with him gaining fun new magics and exploring them more, people tend to enjoy new lore things, just his obsession about Arthur is a big part of his character, so he is willfully not taking the smart route, so it works in story.
