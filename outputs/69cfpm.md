## Are there any good Rationality Audiobooks out there?

### Post:

Besides HPMoR. Not sure if audiobook is the correct term but you get what I mean. I'm not big on reading.

  u/raymestalez made [a list a couple months ago of some.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5us4xo/meta_rational_audiobooks/ddx4ufb/)

  In addition to what they listed, there's also a [Twig](http://audiotwig.dauber.kim/) audiobook, which is another book by Wildbow (writer of Worm).

  Edit: [Also various shorter things from the same people that made the HPMOR audiobook,](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1096) and a [Metropolitan Man](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705) audiobook, which I realized weren't included in that list because I listed them in a different comment on that thread. I probably should have just linked that entire post, shouldn't I?

  The [Bobiverse](http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/We-Are-Legion-We-Are-Bob-Audiobook/B01L082HJ2/) series is pretty rational.   It's about a kind of Tony Stark/Mark Watney type character who has his mind uploaded to a self-replicating Von Neuman probe sent out to explore the universe.

  The character's hyper-competence may be taken to a slightly unrealistic extreme, but the books are otherwise pretty intelligently written, and definitely a fun read.

    Seconding this, Bobiverse is definitely best described as The Martian but bigger.

    Bobiverse has already been recommended on this subreddit before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5u054p/hsf_rt_we_are_legion_we_are_bob_a_novel_about_von/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55all1/we_are_legion_we_are_bob_bobiverse_book_1_rthsf/).

    I'm listening to it now, and the voice actor not knowing how to pronounce Archimedes is really starting to annoy me. Other than that, it's great.

  There is a group doing the Less Wrong sequences. They are currently in chapter 130.
