  The only true democracy in this world is Evil aligned, and is basically magic 1984.

  That's actually kind of funny.

    The other countries scoring points for tempting them into blowing their own diplomats up is even funnier.

  ```
  The Tyrant was foreshadowed in the prologue to book II. https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/11/04/prologue-2/

  > The Augur had found that the plan being implemented went much deeper than a mere escalation of the civil war, and Cordelia’s blood still ran cold whenever she remembered her cousin’s words: "the Tyrant seeks to end Procer".

  But First Prince Cordelia thought the Augur was referring to Malicia.

  ```
  At the end, I smile at the thought that, perhaps, the most effective thing the sides of Evil could do when Cordelia cobbles together her alliance is just to wait until it falls apart again, /then/ strike.

  Like for kings Henry IV and VI (in contrast with V), allies without enemies uniting them turn on each other for profit.  Then again, that largely goes for the Evil sides too.

  What books/web novels would I like if I enjoy this story? I'm looking for another story to get immersed in now that I'm caught up here.
