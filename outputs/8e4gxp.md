  It's not a bad idea, but there are a lot of crowdfunding platforms out there. You also seem to be advocating for a very different structure than is usual for crowdfunding projects; it's usually the person who is making a thing that asks for money (which is then paid by people who liek their work and want to support it), instead of the person who wants a thing who pays money upfront (which can then be claimed by someone who wants to do the work to make it?)

  If you're offering up-front money for translation work, it may be difficult to keep out people who just do a machine translation and then briefly edit the raw. Trying to ensure translation quality under those circumstances seems challenging... and any added overhead for people checking the work of the translators cuts into the money that ought to be paying for the work to be done.

  Also, quite frankly, given that your business plan starts with trying to get money from poor people in poor countries, you might want to realistically consider whether that's enough of a market to be worth your time, or to fund the kind of translation that you want to read.

  I think it's a pretty good idea and the issue with trust can be solved by a middleman, like what programming bounty websites do, e.g. [bountysource](https://www.bountysource.com/).

  Well, the first problem you'd run into is that this would probably be super incompatible with copyright law.

  Otherwise, I dunno. This isn't the *worst* startup/website idea I've ever seen, but I still wouldn't expect this to work out.
