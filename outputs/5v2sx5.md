    They're kind of ignoring the fact that *someone* is going to get shipped out at some point. If it's not Ray or Norman, it'll be another kid.

      Didn't she move up the shipping date in order to get rid of Norman, though? If she can't get rid of one of them, the next regularly scheduled shipping date isn't for a while yet.
