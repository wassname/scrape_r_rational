## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

    I'm sad to say that I mostly just use the standard skeptics toolkit. Is the claim outrageous? -5 truthiness. Is the body behind it notably biased? Are the results hard to measure, or do they deal directly with physical reality. Do the authors support postmodernism?

    I'm never getting any real certainty from research papers, outside of very specific fields (we built a room-temperature maser, here it is) but I am getting a lot of evidence.

    Take a look at the psychology replication crisis, as an example. I think there are even odds that any given paper is going to be bunk, which are horrible odds for something that's supposed to be pretty solid.

    You can find papers that support pretty much any viewpoint. The answer seems to be that you've got to use the rationalist toolbox to asses them. Which sucks massively becouse it's supposed to be more reliable then reason.

    Raw data is nice though.

        So what?  The best rationality skills are only as good as the information you work from.  Being wrong when the best available science was fraudulent or failed to reproduce doesn't mean you've made a mistake.

                  (My latest adventure: A couple of nights ago I had to explain to my fourteen-year-old brother how it is that, if one person says that smallpox is a virus, and another person says that it's an affliction caused by an evil spirit, *one of those people is objectively wrong.*

                  The big sticking point was when I tried to convince him that even if the Evil Spirit Hypothesis posits an evil spirit that acts like a smallpox virus in every manner, it's still better to take that final step of believing that smallpox is caused by viruses and not evil spirits, because even a small mistake like assigning it to the wrong category can lead you to develop other errors along the way, or make it harder to updates your beliefs when it turns out that you were ever-so-slightly wrong about potential vectors or something.)

    I don't think there is anything that can replace personal experience in the field.  Often, there will be particular plots or techniques whose quality can be immediately judged if you know what a typical example looks like, but will be difficult to compare without that knowledge.  From outside the field, you can see glaringly poor presentation of data (e.g. different representation of numbers in the same table, switching between stddev and FWHM to mislead a reader), but have a hard time finding honest mistakes (e.g. a poor background model, leading to something erroneously being listed as a peak).

    For me, personal relations help quite a bit.  I have a number of friends on facebook who will post research papers from their fields that they find interesting.  With their approval of the paper, I can focus more on understanding it, trusting that the conclusion is reasonably valid.

    This has the interesting side-effect of reducing my perceived reliability of other news sources for research results that I had not heard of before.  A research article will get picked up by personal friends if it is interesting and correct, but will get picked up by wider social media if it is interesting, regardless of how correct it is.  Therefore, within the fields that are covered by personal friends, pop-sci articles that come out without me hearing of them earlier are likely to be interesting and incorrect.  I don't discount them immediately, but they certainly get a greater level of scrutiny.

  An Ny Mag article on what causes kids to stop believing in Santa [(link)](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/12/what-makes-kids-stop-believing-in-santa.html).

  > When it comes to evaluating information — and separating the real from the bullshit — kids aren’t that different from adults, Woolley wrote. Over several studies, she and her colleagues illustrated the similarities between us and our younger counterparts: When learning something new, kids, like adults, take context into account; they measure the information against what they already know; and they consider the source, evaluating its trustworthiness and expertise, before deciding how much to believe.

  > The question, then: If children are just as capable of seeing through nonsense, how come we adults have figured out that Santa doesn’t exist, while kids still happily wait on line to sit on a jolly guy’s lap and throw their energy into composing letters to the North Pole?
  ```

  - u/zarraha:
    ```
    A. Similar =/= the same  The fact that kids use similar methods doesn't automatically mean they're just as good at using them, just like with motor skills.  Thus, they make more mistakes and believe more false things.

    B. Children have less experience, less total knowledge of the world to sift through.  If a baby was born with the same level of rationality as an adult, or if an adult from an alternate universe was warped into ours, they still would believe more false things than a normal adult does because of fewer reference points and general understanding of the universe.

    C. One of the important methods of effectively learning in the real world is trust.  Nobody has the time nor skill to derive all of science and mathematics and investigate all of history and art from scratch.  Instead, many things that you know are learned from other people.  Hearing or reading about things is much faster than experimenting for yourself, but carries the disadvantage of sometimes giving false information.  The most reliable way of sifting through this is to gather information from multiple sources and weigh them against each other, and believe more strongly information that's provided by multiple sources.  Additionally, some sources are more likely to lie than others, so you give more weight to sources that you deem reliable.

    Since parents typically have their children's' best interests at heart, they have little incentive to lie, at least about anything important, and they provide an extremely large amount of correct information to their children.  Thus children rationally categorize their parents as reliable sources.  Thus, when their parents tell them that Santa Claus exists, and all of the adults around them, who are also trustworthy, corroborate this information.  And the media tells them it's true, and all of the children around them also believe it, it's entirely rational to conclude that Santa is real.  If you leveraged this level of conspiracy against any adult who grew up in some country isolated from the first world, they would believe it too.

    When you tell someone the truth all the time and then lie about this one particular thing, they're going to think it's the truth too.

      On a sidenote for C,

      1. I find that the experience of actually going through & deriving Maths & Physics from the base up (as presented in text books) does wonders for your understanding & application, rather than blindly applying the end "short cut formula" derived.

      2. I don't know if it's just me, but my science classes generally do have lab sessions to replicate out the experiments.

      All in all, not much you can do about Non-Newtonian Physics (like fracking Relativity) though.
      I also admit that no-one really does the non-basic experiments that's too complicated to practically do.

      And you do have to take History & art on trust.

  Weekly Monday Update


  In an effort to have no more zero weeks (see: zero days), I am now making a post in Monday general threads to catalog personal goings-ons and efforts. From what I've discussed with those on Discord, the post will be great. To that end, if you enjoy these or I don't make one one week, please pester me. It means I'm depressed or don't feel like anyone else enjoys these, and seeing someone care can make a big difference.

  If anything I mention here seems interesting, let me know and we can discuss in more detail!

  This week was Christmas, and I'll still be reeling from New Year's next week, so don't expect much.


  **Story**


  I have come up with what I believe to be a solid idea for a rational Pokemon story. With /u/DaystarEld, /u/alexanderwales, and the help of many of you on Discord, I think I have the underpinnings of a pretty good story! I don't want to go into too much detail on the story, but I can discuss the efforts in worldbuilding. My goal is to create a story first, and then kind of fit the world around it. So I have some main priorities that have to happen to fit the world, and then to have a world which can span from that and still feel like it actually exists. And as DayStar has mentioned in the past, the Pokemon world is full of terrible, terrible inconsistencies. Even the TV show and movies, in my experience, have only shown to keep things more 2-Dimensional. I just can't watch the shows and movies and see people living in those worlds, as they show enough to get me to start to ask questions, but not actually answer the questions either. How do trainers earn money? Can a trainer live in a pokemon world and still not know about Pidgeys by the time they're ten years old?



  The plot holes are endless.

  So I wrote an answer to this CYOA: https://sli.mg/n1YlMv which ended up so long I had to put the full thing in a google doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbr8snCia58_2rjyUIn7oa768CS25VI8h1E8lYKWgEE/edit?usp=sharing

  However I feel I really couldn't do it justice even in a few pages, so I'm actually considering writing a story about it. So I have to ask what some of the problems are with my plans in my answer, and how to improve them. Obviously I left out quite a lot of logistics, but I'm also kind of dubious about part of my plans, for instance how people would react to you suddenly launching hundreds of craft into space in a single day, as well as how well mass threat of  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_bombardment from space would work as a way of forcing world governments to do what you want.              
  Earlier I also dig massive tunnel systems miles underneath the ground using magic, to launch coordinated strikes at the centers of government for a bunch of countries (sticking mostly to countries that don't have powerful allies). However i'm not sure how well that would work, or whether people might notice beforehand.
  ```

  - u/artifex0:

    That's pretty good.

    An ocean-spanning tunnel still seems like a pretty vast undertaking even with a perfect cutting tool and 90% weight reduction- but if the lizard people have muskets, then they probably have a reasonably advanced civilization, with the potential for an industrial revolution.  Rather than trying to conquer them with the cannibals and some tame animals (which I don't think would go well given the technological difference), it might make more sense to sell them technology, found a company recognized by their laws, wait a few decades for them to get the hang of building factories and steam engines, and then use that industrial capacity for the tunneling project.  At that point, though, aircraft might be more practical.

    I do think that the idea that the island is located on present-day Earth is a big assumption.  The island seems to have been constructed from a variety of different worlds and ages.  It could exist in the far future, as part of a simulation, or somehow outside of time.  That you'd leave the island only to find the rest of the world exactly as you left it seems like one of the less likely possibilities- although, if people and objects from different worlds and times can travel to the island, maybe it is somehow possible to travel to those worlds and times from the island.

      My pet theory is that the island is in some other universe along with a bunch of other very crazy islands ("You're on a crazy island" was a popular subgenre at one point, with most examples having more or less the same mechanics). You can escape, possibly, but the odds of getting back to your original universe by chance alone are...not good.

    >So I have to ask what some of the problems are with my plans in my answer, and how to improve them.

    IMO, of course, but I think your current story outline suffers from that particular type of Mary Sue-ism when everything in the universe works out exactly the way you want \ expect it to. For instance, this bit:

    >Making objects immovable is also a great way of blocking off entrances, all you need is a sheet. If you cast it while moving a object you could also make it keep it's relative momentum which can be used to crush enemies to death in enclosed spaces and even use it to tunnel through solid rock.

    upon which you’re later on essentially building most of your success and further solutions, established several major universe mechanics laws that were not mentioned in the original CYOA image:

    1. that something that was originally distributed with the expectation to be used only as party tricks could be used as such a powerful weapon and tool (even if it was made in some Bioshock-type sub-verse);
    1. that making an object immovable would mean essentially freezing its velocity \ momentum, and not, say, making it nailed in place in a specific (caster’s?) frame of reference;
    1. that the phenomenon which the pamphlet’s author described as object immovability also essentially makes it indestructible (for instance compared to more commonly “known” form of immovability whereupon you freeze something up and are then free to start dishing out abuse at it at your leisure).
    1. etc

    You’re free to choose to expand the canon’s rules in your favour as much as possible, of course, but then the story becomes boring because most of the difficulty and conflict from the original setting disappear.

    That all being said, I’m not too familiar with these one-image CYOAs and how the community around them expects them to work, so maybe making them as easy as possible *is* the purpose, and your rendition on this one is actually doing rather swellingly despite my ministrations.
