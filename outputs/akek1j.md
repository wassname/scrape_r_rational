## [RST][FF] What's going on with Mr. Zoat? (With this Ring)

### Post:

Here's the lowdown.  I was hanging out in the Polyhistor Academy thread on Questionable Questing, and to my surprise I saw a banner message about Mr. Zoat moving to QQ.  Upon further investigation, it seems he received an indefinite suspension from the Sufficient Velocity message board.

I'm pretty sure there's a modest following of With this Ring readers on this subreddit, so I thought I'd ask here.  It's been a while since I read the story, but I usually leave it alone for long periods of time before catching up.  From what I remember it was a fairly rationalist story.  The main character, Paul, is known for being extremely self-aware about what he wants, and he makes meticulous plans to achieve his goals.

From what I can tell, Mr. Zoat got in trouble with the SV mods for misusing LGBT terminology, or something about "Apache Attack Helicopter" sexuality?  I'm not entirely sure.

Anyone have a good idea about what exactly happened?

  ```
  There's a section of Sufficient Velocity rules (Rule 2) which prohibits misgendering. [Here:](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-rules-and-procedures-of-sufficient-velocity.40100/#post-8912695)

  > We expect, for example, that you will gender everyone appropriately. We expect that you will not refer to anyone by what might reasonably be considered a slur: don’t use “retard”, “japs”, or “traps”, for example.

  Zoat fell afoul of that (and claims that he didn't know it existed). As part of *With this Ring*, a character was turned from a man into a woman by some kind of magic, and was misgendered in the narration ... which might have been fine, but Zoat then said (non-story) that he defined people by what genitals and secondary sex characteristics they had. He also used the "sexually identify as an attack helicopter" meme. [You can read the staff response here.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/11965536/) Especially:

  > So how does this relate to 'attack helicopters' or 'trap'?

  > Put at its most bald, they're both deeply insulting ways to refer to transgender people.

  > The attack helicopter phrasing casts something very real and important as both trivial and absurd; the best case is that it is a mindless 'joke', a repetition of malicious mockery by someone who didn't realize that was what it is.

  > But even in that best case, it serves to drive out people who have done nothing wrong and who should expect and deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. And we don't want people being driven out, so it's covered by Rule 2.

  Zoat wasn't banned for this, he was suspended for a day. When he came back, he proceeded to do the exact same thing that got him suspended in the first place, which got him indefinitely suspended and the thread locked.

  **I would appreciate if people don't attempt to relitigate this here.**

    When his appeal was denied he opened the QQ thread and posted his story. *Then* he proceeded to post what he posted on SV.

      Yeah, it was more of a "Fuck you moderators, I'm on a new forum now, what are you gonna do, uh?" thing.

      Honestly, even if I sympathized with him (I kinda don't), this would have been the tipping point. Being an ass to moderators just because you can is sad.

        It's interesting to me that this is the second time I've seen him get suspended from a site, and proceed to take his ball and go elsewhere. I'm kind of wondering how he's going to get himself suspended from QQ, because sure, that's gonna be hard, but he's got a confrontational personality that apparently can't just let things go, and that makes me feel that he'd be up to the challenge.

              Yes but I'm not really offendable if he's not creating a liability issue. The every 2 years or so drama vs the minor expense of having a site seemed like a safe trade-off.

          I don't know, if you ask me, 2 bans in \~10 years of online presence is about average. 

          You may also want to keep in mind that fanfic authors are inherently prone to inhabiting fanfiction sites, and that fanfiction sites are notorious for their insane drama.

          Just look up the story of [MsScribe](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/23/we-are-all-msscribe/), for example.

            Not all bans are equal, and I would be surprised if most people got banned on average once every five years for having a hissy fit. I'd be surprised if most people got *temporary suspensions* that often, to be honest.
            ```

            - u/PlaneOfInfiniteCats:
              ```
              True, most people don't get banned every five years, because most people are lurkers, and level of user's activity is highly correlated with chances of getting banned. Trivially so: the more one posts, the more likely someone to get offended by their post.

              In Zoat's case his level of activity is very high, so I don't find it surprising he gets banned more often than an average lurker.
              ```

                ```
                Dude, why are you so eager to defend the guy? 

                Zoat didn't get indefinitely suspended because he was a frequent poster. He got suspended because he was an asshole, and then he  threw a hissy fit when he got called out on it.
                ```

                - u/PlaneOfInfiniteCats:
                  ```
                  You seem to be deliberately misinterpreting my position. Please do not do that.

                  Can you present your position without name-calling? I don't think a productive discussion can be had with "he was an asshole, and then he  threw a hissy fit" used as an argument.
                  ```

                  - u/callmesalticidae:
                    ```
                    Zoat's high activity level means nothing beyond the obvious and inane point that somebody who never posts will never make an infraction. You might as well say that people who live longer have more days in which to get sick, while humans who die in infancy get sick only a handful of times, or even once. It doesn't matter when we're discussing whether the dude who got two heart attacks in the past year is going to get a third. 

                    > Eaglejarl was never banned. Zoat was banned twice. I think the difference in online activity level alone is sufficient to explain that.

                    Eaglejarl can be civil, follow the rules, and take his lumps when he and the mods don't agree on whether he made a violation. Zoat...acts like a child when he get an infraction. 

                    Eaglejarl could be ten times as active as Zoat, and I'd still bet that Zoat gets suspended again before Eaglejarl does.
                    ```

                    - u/PlaneOfInfiniteCats:
                      ```
                      I think the proper analogy would be:

                      A person who does not  post/leave home won't get banned/mugged. 

                      The more often you're outside/you post, the more chances there are that you will be considered a mark/offend a mod. 

                      The more often you go to dark alleys/SB and SV, there more you risk, as the muggers/mods are more vicious there.

                      One can give the mugger his valuables when confronted/ be civil, follow the rules, and take his lumps when he and the mods don't agree, and then he probably wont be beaten up/banned.

                      &#x200B;

                      See? I too can make up loaded analogies.

                      &#x200B;

                      I insist that "Zoat asshole, Zoat hissy fit" is a childishly simplistic view of the situation.

                      To me it looks like:

                      1. Zoat is more active, so is at higher risk of ban all else being equal;
                      2. Zoat is a bit abrasive, so this also contributes to conflicts that may occur;
                      3. SV and SB mods are power tripping, SB mods more than SV ones;

                      You seem to think Zoat is in the wrong and behaves childishly, completely disregarding that mods can also power trip and behave childishly.

                      &#x200B;

                      Also, at which odds are you ready to take a bet that Zoat will receive next ban before Eaglejarl does? 10:1? 100:1?
                      ```

                        He got a one day suspension for saying something dumb and then got smacked harder cause he doubled down in a (self-admitted!) fit of pique.

                        Zoat was an asshole and at a day suspension. Zoat threw a hissy fit and got a longer one. Sometimes reality is actually simple enough for a child to understand.

                        Cool cool. Mods can obviously be childish, being human and all, but I don’t think they were being childish in this case. 

                        The point to my original comment, way back when, is that if you remove “Zoat is abrasive” (If that’s what you want to call it) then the other two factors don’t stand on their own. That is, Zoat’s own personality contributed to this affair, just as it did on SB, and, if it is possible to be suspended for anything 

                        10:1, up to $100:$10, on the conditions that (1) the money is donated to the Against Malaria Foundation or another Giving What We Can-supported nonprofit and (2) EagleJarl doesn’t mind, because it feels skeevy to make a bet on somebody who I respect, without getting that person’s approval.

                          I am not sure how we can come to agreement about relative levels of childishness of all participants.

                          So far you did not show any arguments in support of your position, just stated the position several times.

                          Regarding the bet, I personally would take it as stated, but setting it up would require online stalking of both Zoat and Eaglejarl, which I am not comfortable with.

                            That’s fair, and another reason why I wouldn’t be open to doing it without EagleJarl being cool with the bet.

            I've never been banned from any site, and I don't think of myself as particularly virtuous.  The rules of SV essentially boil down to "be respectful to each other".  It's not hard, and it's your obligation to know what the rules of the site are if you get an account there, just like it's your obligation to know the rules of the road if you want to drive.
            ```

            - u/PlaneOfInfiniteCats:
              ```
              I don't think my, or your, online presence is comparable to Zoat's "1000-words chapter every day" style of activity.

              And the more active you are, the more likely your activity to attract attention, including negative attention.

              As a general rule, lurkers hardly ever get banned.

              I also think your perception of SV rules is too optimistic. Or, at least, the way the rules are enforced in practice.

              SV has a long history of questionable, to put it mildly, decisions by their moderators. In particular, SV's rule enforcement is not even-handed or consistent in the slightest.

                  ```
                  I think you missed the point of my post. Let me rephrase:

                  The likelihood of getting banned is highly correlated with user activity.

                  * Lurkers are almost never banned, because they are not posting anything.
                  * People like me, who are moderately active, have higher likelihood of getting a ban than lurkers.
                  * People like eaglejarl, who is much more active online than I am, are even more likely to get a ban.
                  * Zoat is completely in league of his own, because he is ridiculously active online, which also means he has the highest probability of getting banned out of all of us, all else being equal.

                  Eaglejarl was never banned. Zoat was banned twice. I think the difference in online activity level alone is sufficient to explain that.
                  ```

                  - u/eaglejarl:
                    ```
                    I think you substantially underestimate my level of activity. I also think you are wrong about how easy it is to NOT get banned from a site, especially SV. The SV mods rule with a pretty light hand, all things considered. You have to be be a jerk order to get points at all, and you need to be flagrant in order to get even a temporary ban.
                    ```

                    - u/PlaneOfInfiniteCats:
                      ```
                      Well, nobody knows how active you are on the Internet better than you, so your estimate of your level of activity is definitely better than mine can ever be.

                      I also do not say it is hard to not get banned. What you say is true, most of the time.

                      Usually all is fine, but sometimes moderators get into a strange mood and ban people with little or no provocation. It doesn't happen often, but it does happen, and fanfiction communities, such as SV and SB, are more prone to such drama than other online communities. 

                      Examples of questionable moderation decisions on both SV and SB are plentiful.

                        Any decision is easy to question, especially if it's against the person doing the questioning. My feeling is that the mods on SB are quite hair-trigger and heavy-handed, but the ones on SV are much better. Not perfect, obviously, but better. The only instance of (IMO) incorrect moderation that I've seen on SV was when...I think it was /u/OliWhail, but it might have been /u/DaystarEld got busted for pointing out that some of the people in the "Why rational fiction is awful" thread were strawmanning rational fiction. I got 25 points for being a little snotty n that same thread; it wasn't unfair, although I think it would have been just as reasonable to make it a warning instead. Aside from that, I've seen plenty of warnings that did not carry consequences and all of the cases I've seen that did have consequences were entirely reasonable.

                        Your experience apparently differs, and I'm not attempting to invalidate it, I'm simply offering a countervailing view.

                      Not even slightly true. Things that have gotten temp bans *just in WTR's thread*:

                      - asserting that, given sufficiently contrived circumstances, atrocities can be morally required

                      - asserting that it may have been a mistake to concede the "obvious common sense" exceptions to free speech like exhortations to violence

                      - refusing to agree to disagree about religion being evil

                      None of these involved being a jerk, let alone a flagrant jerk.

        Tbh, what annoys me the most is that SI Paul is acting ooc. He should be able to see intense orange in the guy to return to being male, and intense yellow about not being able to do so. But Paul doesn't use his goddamn magic empathy.

        Mr Zoat is also way too sensitive to moderation. Somehow, he *will* piss off the QQ mods, eventually.

        I mostly hope he just crossposts the story to AO3. Even its review system is pretty good, and he can just keep using QQ for the forum format.

          When you put it that way, it definitely sounds like a case of Zoat forcing his own political views into his story without considering any in-story context.

            Wow, a response to a four year old reddit comment. I don't think I've had such an old commented responded to before.

            The past 3 months or so, I've kinda fallen off reading it. I mean to catch up on some point. But before then, I never stopped.

            As much as I can remember, the story has never gotten as bad as it did with this incident. Still going strong on QQ. There were even some bits that made me wonder if he's actually changed his mind -- but it's hard to say, and I think he still avoids it. Which has been fine enough for me.

            The whole point of the story has felt intertwined with political views, anyway, being not too dissimilar to various nation building stories in some ways. Like building an orange lantern Corp. Or some of the sidestories of him in other fandoms literally doing the nation building thing.

            TERF stuff is like a brain rot that otherwise ruins perfectly logical and rational minds. There are other brain rots, too. It makes sense that he had such a moment, though I can only hope that the brain rot has gone away, but if not, he actually hides it, which is usually not how TERF brain rot develops. (It's a bit like how scientist minds can get destroyed by religious thinking.)

            This one bit sucked, but otherwise the story is fine.

            That said, stories with LGBTQ+ stuff in it typically are better, so I don't begrudge not wanting to read an insanely long story by some random white British guy doing at least some power tripping. (Though where I stopped off, the story has gotten significantly more grimdark, which was cool.)

I found this thread when doing some research for a client on Google (I'm a freelance academic researcher), and since my hyperfocus on my research work caused some blind spots, I neglected to check the date of this thread before leaving a few comments. Please, accept my humble apologies for my lack of Reddiquette in necro-ing this thread (and I'm being 100% genuine here).

              Zoat has continued to double-down on the transphobia since, BTW. He uses the baseless argument that gendered English words MUST be tied to biological genitals for every case-by-case basis, and that someone MUST provide proof they've had bottom surgery before Zoat can allow them to be trans in his presence. Completely ignoring that boats and cars have been called "she" and "her" for centuries without having vaginas, that English isn't some universal language (Japanese has vanishingly few gendered words, Spanish has very few words that *aren't* gendered), and that it's super creepy and grossly perverse for him to be *that* obsessed with what's in a trans person's pants. But then again, leave it to transphobic brainrot to suggest this man lives in a bubble.

              This, combined with his more recent practice of stealing other writers' OCs and SIs without permission and defending doing so, suggests that Zoat is an egotistical diva.

  In one of the latest chapters, a character gets put in a female body. Another character goes through a whole thought process and decides 'Now he's in a female body, I'm gonna start calling him *she*'. 

  This isn't by itself a problem - there's a lot of ways that kind of misgendering could be played, opportunities for realisation and character growth down the road. Even if it's never addressed, it's still 'a character' thinking it.

  The problem was that Zoat immediately doubled down in the thread itself, growing increasingly anti-trans, increasingly defensive about it and, yes, pulling out the old 'I sexually identify as an attack helicopter' chestnut as a defence [in this final comment](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/page-508#post-11963172). 

  When it's the *author* saying this kind of thing in threads rather than a character they're writing, it becomes a problem for the forum, and they get treated as any other person would for making comments like that in a thread. Zoat then threw a hissy fit over the temporary suspension, upped sticks to Questionable Questing, and claimed he was being oppressed for writing a story where a character misgenders someone. 

  This isn't the first time he's pulled the martyrdom schtick. On SpaceBattles he accrued a whole bunch of infraction points for not covering his spoilers in a Star Wars thread. He then receives a final infraction point for posting risque art of a succubus in a place he shouldn't have, putting him over the total to receive a one-day suspension. Cue hissy fit and claims that he was being 'banned' by SB because the admins were a bunch of prudes. That's how WTR ended up on SV in the first place.
  ```

  - u/Sceptically:
    ```
    On spacebattles he got suspended for posting something along the lines of "Why would you still call yourself a rebellion when you've become the legitimate government?" on the WtR thread. I saw it when it happened and my thought was "what the hell's coming up in the *next* episode that he's asking *that*" until other posters started bringing up star wars.

        From what I've heard, there was also a mention of the Millennium Falcon being in Episode VII.  Neither of which I would really categorize as a "spoiler."

        So, yes, I agree: I sympathize with him regarding the SB ban.

        Not so much with this one, though.  Had he come back, apologized, and diplomatically said he was leaving as he disagreed with the moderation policies, I could see myself maybe following him to QQ to continue reading along.

        Getting himself deliberately perma-banned, by repeating a meme that he has already had explained to him exactly how and why it's offensive to trans people, solely to live up to being a "dedicated rage-quitter," though...  Yeah.  That's the kind of tantrum that only gets worse if you indulge it.  Good riddance.

    What is so offensive about the "attack helicopter" meme?  


    The way I interpret it, it's like this.  Look, if I could be in a different body, I'd choose to have the cloned body of an 18 year old female beauty pageant winner.  Because I know I would receive the best treatment possible by society, and also I know I'd enjoy just looking at my own reflection.

    &#x200B;

    But reality is not that way.  I can't have that, the laws of nature don't allow this without vastly more advanced technology than our civilization currently has.  

    &#x200B;

    Similarly, I can see the appeal of having a fully armed and armored attack helicopter as a body.  

    &#x200B;

    So I can't reasonably demand that society treat me, both in gender pronouns and what they put on my driver's license and what they say behind my back, as the 18 year old beauty queen.  Or treat me as if I'm actually an attack helicopter.   

    &#x200B;

    Since we can't actually turn men into women or vice versa with anything like a reasonable or reliable success, that's kind of how it is today.  Most transgender people are sort of asking for special favors to be treated as something they are not.

      But that's really quite beside the point. Trans people aren't asking to be treated as something they're not. Quite the opposite, really. They're asking to be treated as what they are.

      As for the attack helicopter meme, it's deliberately intended to poke fun at somebody's identity. That's pretty much always offensive.

      SB, SV, and QQ are all BBCode. AO3 uses HTML (and CSS). Porting from one to the other is non-trivial, even if you have all the BBCode, and *With This Ring* uses a fair bit of formatting that would require work to port over.

        That's fair. There's probably a tool to convert BBCode to html though. Or at least someone willing to write something in Python (which needs to be done anyway to get everything off of SV).

        I mostly say that because I bet he's going to get banned/annoyed with QQ eventually. (Also because I'd rather read a story-only on AO3 😆.)

        The best thing to happen would have been Mr Zoat to just follow the rules, though. We don't have any control over that, though. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

          Since the forum itself translates the story from BBCode to HTML to display it in the browser, wouldn't it just be easier to scrape the rendered web page, rather than scraping the BBCode and parsing it?
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            The forum translates it to HTML and CSS, so you'd need both of them, and the CSS probably has a fair bit of extraneous styling that you'd have to hack out. So far as porting to AO3 goes, *there* you would run into problems with what HTML they allow and how they set up their custom CSS styling (with a work skin). That would be the case whether you ripped the HTML/CSS, or whether you ripped the BBCode and then put it through a translator.

            I wouldn't know the issues without doing it myself, but especially given how often this story uses custom coloring, I feel like there *would* be issues.

              Yeah, now that you mention it, I remember that this kind of automatically-generated HTML/CSS is usually... sub-optimal, to put it charitably.  Upon reflection, I agree that you'd probably get a better result from taking the BBCode and running it through a parser designed to do a lightweight conversion.

              There are a couple of open-source BBCode editors that might make a good starting point for a parser, though.

- u/Iconochasm:
  ```
  Yeah.  After the first time ever there wasn't a new chapter waiting for me in the morning, I looked into it.  Basically, the current plot threat involved a MacGuffin of gender-bending.  Paul and Zoat are apparently gender essentialists, or something, it's strange.  The character was a man changed into a woman, and Paul uses female pronouns while calling the character "Mr. LastName".  There was discussion in the thread about it, and Zoat basically said "If you're full of woman parts, you are currently a woman, even if you'd like to be a man, even if you used to be a man, even if you'd like to be an attack helicopter".  He was a bit confrontational, but things had gotten nowhere near flame war, or hateful attacks, etc.  But apparently this was enough for the SV mods to drop the banhammer, in what struck me as rather overreacting.  

  So now the story has moved to QQ.

  tl;dr: Avoid trans issues on Sufficient Velocity like they are radioactive.

    I think that SV's rules on transphobic speech clearly prioritize sticking to a given ideology over free speech (you're essentially not allowed to say that you have conservative opinions on identity issues), which, y'know, is fair, not every place needs to be SlateStarCodex.

    But Mr Zoat was clearly in the wrong here. The "I identify as a attack helicopter" meme is *not okay*. It's not innocent, it's an-injoke that clearly sends a message of contempt and mockery. It's a way to code "I don't care about transgender issues and I think their beliefs are ridiculous and childish" in a short sentence. Using it in the middle of a discussion about gender identity is equivalent to posting Barack Obama's face photoshopped on a monkey in the middle of an US politics discussion.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Or, y'know, you can just not be transphobic.  I've heard that's a pretty good solution to not getting banned.  What a joke is it that a guy is using transphobic rhetoric and you're sitting here nodding along saying, "Oh well that's not hate speech, he's not saying that trans people should die, he's just saying that their existence is invalid!"
    ```

    - u/Fresh_C:
      ```
      I think it's a more nuanced topic than you're making it out to be. Refusing to use the pronouns they request you to use is not the same as saying their existence is invalid.

      Personally I think it's a dumb and petty thing not to call a transgendered person what they want to be called, so long as it's not something so ridiculous that it's clear they're just messing with you (ex: if someone actually did request for you to call them attack helicopter... yeah that'd be ridiculous).

      But there's a huge difference between telling a woman "You're a man" than telling them "You don't deserve to exist".

      The whole concept of gender being different than sex is a relatively new thing (in the public consciousness) and I at least understand the desire to keep things simple and define gender by physical attributes rather than a person's self-image. It's a natural thing to want everything to be easily categorized.

      And honestly if it wasn't for the fact that people feel so strongly about it, I too would like to categorize people simply based on their physical features. It would just be easier and make dealing with people less confusing overall.

      But I think realistically, the downside of having more complexity in dealing with pronouns with people you don't know yet are outweighed by the upside of the people who self-identify as a gender different than their sex feeling comfortable. If it's a choice between simplicity and someone's self-esteem, I think the right choice is generally to help that person's self-esteem. Especially when we're merely talking about semantics.

      Also... I think I kinda got off topic. The main thing I was trying to explain is that it's possible to hold the views that Mr. Zoat seems to hold without necessarily being transphobic or even disliking trans people. You just have to have values that prefer linguistic simplicity  over a group of individuals' comfort... which I think, all things considered, is dumb and petty as I said before. But not necessarily sinister.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        Honestly, for me it seems like character inconsistently for both Paul and Zoat. His story is full of gendered characters that either can shapeshift freely or don't have genitals at all. It has beings that reproduce primarily through cloning and still have a gender identity. Why would someone experiencing all that (in case of Paul the character) or someone who seems to empathize enough with all kinds of strange mindsets to be able to write them suddenly regress into putting needless emphasis on something as mundane as a pair of dimorphic body parts?
        ```

        - u/Fresh_C:

          That does seem a little inconsistent. Though I suppose you could argue with the zenomorphs they were mostly modeled after the stereotypes of the genders they identify as even though they don't have genitals.

        When I say that it invalidates their existence, I don't mean to say that the claim is that they shouldn't exist.

            Not the person you're responding to, but it would apply to telling a religious person that they aren't faithful. Faith or the lack thereof, like gender identity, is both a subjective experience and an essential facet of a person's existence. (Misgendering trans people is an extra layer of fucked up, though, since they're already a marginalized group and it's reprehensible to kick someone when they're down.)
            ```

        - u/Fresh_C:
          ```
          Fair enough. That does make more sense. Though I still disagree that that's necessarily transphobic.

          That's just a difference in definition. It's not denying the person's personal experience, it's just denying that that personal experience should inform the definition of that person's gender.

          It's really an argument of semantics, not an argument about anything intrisinc to the person's character. The definition of the person themselves stays the same regardless of what you call them.

          I'm not saying that definitions are unimportant, but the words themselves do not have intrinsic value.

          So if I called you an "Snoopite" but I defined the word snoopite as "anyone who uses reddit", I don't think you can say that I'm misrepresenting you, nor can you necessarily claim that I hate or fear all people from reddit. 

          You can say that I'm a jerk for calling you something you don't want to be called. And you could make arguments that my definition of "snoopite" is not the most optimal or socially inclusive definition.

            >  the words themselves do not have intrinsic value.

            They have value in context, to the people hearing them, which is what matters. "Semantics" is a terrible reason to hurt people.

            I also have to say, I've never encountered someone who insisted on misgendering people who *wasn't* doing so as a denial of those people's gender identities. I don't know where you get the idea that "I won't call you a man because I don't think you meet my preferred definition of the word 'man'" is distinct from "I won't call you a man because I don't think you're a man."

            Aside from that, I think it's key to remember that bigotry takes forms other than "hate and fear." It's entirely possible to have awful, wrong, hurtful opinions about a group of people without hating or fearing them. "Lesser" forms of bigotry still need to be called out, because they're still harmful and they provide a foundation of support for more extreme bigots.
            ```

              I don't think these two statements are much different from each other. That wasn't my point. My point was simply that "not thinking you're a man" doesn't mean that they're necessarily discriminating against that person or group of people, which is generally what a phrase such as "transphobic" describes.

              Disagreeing about definitions is not the same as thinking trans people are bad people, or thinking that you don't ever want to be around a trans person.

              >Aside from that, I think it's key to remember that bigotry takes forms other than "hate and fear." It's entirely possible to have awful, wrong, hurtful opinions about a group of people without hating or fearing them. "Lesser" forms of bigotry still need to be called out, because they're still harmful and they provide a foundation of support for more extreme bigots.

              Bigotry is probably a better word than transphobic for this interaction. Bigotry implies an unwillingness to change your views. Transphobia implies discomfort or outright hostility to trans people which is not what we're seeing. But honestly, even bigotry has some extra connotations that don't really fit what's happening here.

              As I said before, I do think you're right that these views are ultimately not good. And they definitely can be harmful to people's mental image of themselves.

              But if you look at this objectively, no one is being oppressed by this. No one is having rights taken away from them. No one is being assaulted or (IMO) even verbally abused.

              It's harmful because using language like this has the potential to hurt someone's feelings. But not having your feelings hurt isn't an inalienable right. It's just inconsiderate and unnecessary to call someone a gender other than what they would like to be called.

              I agree there's nothing wrong with pointing this behavior out and calling people out for it. I just disagree that you can conclude that anyone who does this is transphobic without further context.

                I disagree. When Zoat expressed those opinions, he wasn't expressing them in a vacuum. Trans people are actively discriminated against in employment, housing, etc; they're disproportionately likely to be homeless because of the above-mentioned discrimination in combination with parental rejection; and their rights are constantly under threat (e.g. the bathroom debacle, the military thing). People who intentionally misgender trans folks because they "disagree" normalize the idea that they're deluded/lying, and in so doing, help to foster a climate where more serious forms of discrimination are viewed as acceptable. Little things add up.

                I would also argue that intentionally misgendering someone *is* verbal abuse; it's hurtful speech, that's what verbal abuse is. And I think that reducing the direct harm it does to "hurt feelings" trivializes gender dysphoria, but that's territory I'll leave to trans folks to speak on.

                  I agree that some people (maybe even the majority of people for all I know) who use language like that do engage in discriminatory practices.

                  But you can't conclude that any single person doing this is also practicing discrimination.

                  As I've said, I agree this type of language isn't helping anyone. It's ultimately a bad thing. But it's not discrimination in and of itself.

                  As for this being verbal abuse here's wikipedia's definition:

                  >Verbal abuse (verbal attack or verbal assault) is when a person forcefully criticizes, insults, or denounces someone else.[1] Characterized by underlying anger and hostility, it is a destructive form of communication intended to harm the self-concept of the other person and produce negative emotions.

                  I think you can at best make a weak case for it being verbal abuse based on the fact that it can harm a person's self-concept. But the fact that it's not necessarily intended to do so makes me think it doesn't fit the definition.

                  I imagine many people who call a person only by the gender which matches their sex feel as if they're simply stating a fact. "They have a penis, so they're a man". They're not saying it to hurt the person. They're just saying it because to them it's the truth, and they refuse to lie in order to spare someone's feeling.

                  I've honestly thought this way myself in the past (though I was never bad enough to say this to a trans person's face). There was no ill intent with these thoughts, just the idea that a person can't change the truth of what they physically are.

                  I've since come to realize that it really is just an argument of semantics. And since the semantics mean absolutely nothing to me, but are very important to some people, there is no harm in changing the definition of man to be "A person who identifies as a male" for non-medical purposes.

                  My point being simply that, it's completely possible to think the way Mr. Zoat thinks without any ill intent towards anyone. And the harm caused by calling someone a gender they don't identify with can be entirely unintended and non-malicious.

                  That doesn't erase the harm itself. But that also doesn't mean the person who is causing the harm is doing so because they're transphobic or have any intent to hurt anyone.

                  >And I think that reducing the harm it does to "hurt feelings" trivializes gender dysphoria, but that's territory I'll leave to trans folks to speak on.

                  It wasn't my intention to say that being treated this way can't be deeply hurtful to a transperson. But you can't control other people's word choices and actions so long as they are not illegal. People say hurtful things to each other all time, whether intentionally or not. Sometimes people are affected by them much more deeply than others. I don't think this situation is particularly different, other than the fact that it deals with a sensitive topic.

                    I think you misunderstood what I was saying. I'm not saying that every person who misgenders trans people is also personally telling them there are no vacant apartments left, or voting for politicians who want bathroom bills, or whatever. I'm saying that they're normalizing harmful attitudes toward trans people that breed those forms of discrimination. 

                    As for the question of intent to harm, I'll go back to what I said earlier: bigotry doesn't have to be malicious to be harmful. And I think once someone has been made aware that they're harming people in such an easily avoidable way, it's inexcusable for them to continue.

                          True, but it's a cultural matter of whether biology or self-concept is what determines whether you're called a man or woman.  Currently the predominant deciding factor is biology, and while that may change in the future I doubt it due to the sheer inconvenience associated with it.

                          > B., regardless of your opinion on trans as a concept, it's indisputable that misgendering people is hurtful, and hurting people on purpose just because you disagree with them is inexcusable.

                          Yes, but fundamentalist christians consider teaching evolution a personal attack on their faith, yet we don't kowtow to them. 

                          I'm not saying I won't call someone their preferred pronouns out of courtesy, but A. I have enough trouble with names as it is and B. it's not so universally accepted that it should be considered rude not to do so.

                          Neat.  You're asexual.  There's a 100% that you don't find people sexually attractive.  If I remember that then I won't flirt with you.  You're not claiming you have different biology than you provably do and currently, that's the deciding he/she/they factor.

                            I don't think it's really that inconvenient to call people by their preferred pronouns based on how they introduce themselves and (less importantly) other external signals of their gender, like style of dress, hair, etc, as opposed to based on biological characteristics. I mean...I might see where you were coming from if it were standard practice to figure out people's pronouns by pulling their pants down to check out their junk. In that case, there'd have to be a whole societal shift away from that method of identification. But in practice, it's the norm to address people according to how they present themselves, and transphobes add this weird invasive extra step of wanting to know what kind of chromosomes or genitalia you have.

                            It's true that calling trans people by their pronouns isn't universally accepted yet. Respecting interracial or gay partnerships also wasn't always universally accepted, yet we now recognize that it was shitty to denigrate those relationships even when that was the norm. It's the same for respecting trans identities. Hurting and dehumanizing people is wrong, always. Humans just happen to be really good at rationalizing why it's totally okay *this* time. 

                            As for the fundamentalist christian comparison, it's not the same thing. Teaching evolution is in a way an attack on their faith, but it's not an attack on their *identities.* I would teach evolution in a classroom, but I would not teach that fundamentalist christians are lying or deluded about their subjective experience of faith. I wouldn't say "you're not really a believer." In the same vein, if I met a Christian who had converted to Judaism, I would not insist on continuing to call them a Christian. 

                            >You're not claiming you have different biology

                            I see this misconception a lot. Trans people in no way claim to have different biology than they have. They are *agonizingly* aware of the particulars of their biology. What trans people are saying is that their gender identity doesn't align with their physical sex characteristics. This mismatch causes psychological distress which can be alleviated by social, and sometimes medical, transition.

                            I'll add that there's nothing implausible about that misalignment. We already know that there are intersex people with "mismatching" sex characteristics, because the process of sex differentiation involves a lot of complex branching mechanisms that can individually go awry. If someone can have XY chromosomes and a vulva, why can't someone else have a vulva and a male brain?

                              There is no *one way* trangender people dress.  Even if you go with the most obvious dresses on men thing, crossdressers are a thing.  I don't know about you, but it's extremely obvious to me if someone has an XX or XY chromosome in my daily life.  There are exceptions, but those are usually transitioning people and I'd call them their pronouns anyway.

                              I don't think you understand fundamentalist Christian mindset.  They really do consider it a personal attack on their identities, their faith can often be the largest part of what they consider themselves, and it is being undermined.  Just look at the "war on christmas" bullshit!  They really are that sensitive and consider it disrespectful, to the point of pulling their kids out of school so they won't be corrupted.  It is the same thing.  Fun fact, many extremists will consider you dead if you convert, rather than your new religion.

                              And I'm saying that when they're claiming they're a man or woman, in common parlance they're saying they have different biology.  That's what the word *means* to most people, so whatever they intend that's the message they're sending.

                              Because male is literally a social concept which, at this point, means "has a penis".  Okay?  You may have a different definition than that, but that doesn't mean you can disregard everyone else's opinion as transphobic.

                                I'm aware that there's no one way people dress. There are, however, a lot of external signals people can use to imply how they prefer to be addressed, and when in doubt you can always just ask. 

                                And since we're on r/rational, I feel compelled to point out that you don't actually *know* you can always tell someone's karyotype. If you wrongly clocked an XX person as XY you wouldn't know unless you specifically asked "are you XY", and if you met a passing trans person you would just assume they were cis.

                                I think it would require a tremendous degree of willful ignorance to interact with a trans person for any period of time and still think that's what they're saying. Trans people are very clear on the topic of what being trans is. There are also extensive, easy-to-access resources online that explain it in straightforward terms. Anyone who actually has this misconception could clear it up with a 3-sentence conversation with a trans person or 10 seconds of Googling.

                                >Because male is literally a social concept which, at this point, means "has a penis"

                                If that were really how humans interacted then we *would* pull each other's pants down for a junk check whenever we met. In practice, most people have zero interaction with most other people's genitals. The social concept of "a man" is many-faceted and nearly all of those facets are unrelated to penises. Meanwhile, the gender identity of "a man" is *usually* accompanied by a penis, but there's nothing that biologically *requires* it to be accompanied by a penis.

                                I maintain that it's hugely presumptuous to "um, actually" another person's subjective experience of their gender identity, and that it's transphobic to openly and insistently misgender trans people.

If I'm wrong, they (or more likely a third party familiar with them since that's who I'd be using pronouns with) correct me and I apologize and address them correctly thereafter. Easy peasy.

                                        My concept of "what constitutes a woman" is not so core to my identity that extending it to include trans women would shake my world, and it had evolved past "vulva = lady" after my first college-level biology course anyway.

                                  A. Most people aren't experts in trans fashions and so can identify them by perfume like Sherlock Holmes and B. Why would you ask?  Doesn't that defeat the point of communication, that you can just tell someone apart by a description?  Arrest warrants don't tell you the suspect's hobbies, they're used to describe someone's physical appearance and most people aren't going to want to go against that when there doesn't seem to be a pressing reason to.  Inb4 trans people find it offensive, A. they're a tiny minority and most people don't even care that 70 million falun gong practitioner were imprisoned or killed in China and B. why do they associate their version of gender with he/she pronouns?  Why, if your mannerisms conform to one of the sexes, does that require you to have people address you by that sex when for others it simply seems to be enforcing gender stereotypes?  You feel like a stereotypical man, great, but most people don't care.

If you wrongly clocked an XX person as XY you wouldn't know unless you specifically asked "are you XY", and if you met a passing trans person you would just assume they were cis. 

                                  You're kind of making me point for me?  If you look at someone and assume they meet the qualification for something, (in this case XY vs. XX chromosomes) and they don't, then of course you're going to identify them incorrectly.  If you think they have a penis then you're going to treat them like they have a penis.  It's when people get confused that (in their opinion) variable x /=/ x that all these arguments start up.

Trans people are very clear on the topic of what being trans is. There are also extensive, easy-to-access resources online that explain it in straightforward terms. Anyone who actually has this misconception could clear it up with a 3-sentence conversation with a trans person or 10 seconds of Googling.

                                  There isn't a statistic for the topic of conversation for most trans people, but as someone living on campus with a very high proportion of them, they don't tend to spout off their backstories like NPCs in a bioware game.  And for those who *don't* interact with trans people normally, which the majority of people don't because they're less than 1% of the entire population, then why would they google it instead of assuming they're speaking the same language as everyone else?  Why questions your assumptions for what should be an open and shut case?  It's not up to the random bystander to translate for you if you're giving unclear messages.

If you have a penis, there are certain characteristics that go along with it, and generally speaking you can identify those at a glance.  That, and nudity taboos, are why we don't check genitals.

                                  > The social concept of "a man" is many-faceted and nearly all of those facets are unrelated to penises.

                                  Yes, but most facets, when separated from "having a penis" don't make you a man by common definition.

                                  > but there's nothing that biologically requires it to be accompanied by a penis.

                                  There's nothing that biologically *requires* anything because we are solely in the made up realm of social standards!  I could start calling cats dogs but if I started calling them that on the street people aren't bigoted for looking at me weird.

                                  It's presumptuous for a minority to try and change an extremely deep-rooted part of a culture, IE the interactions of the sexes, and assume everyone who doesn't immediately get on board is a bigot.  You are the boss of your own body, but you do not get to make up a rule and proclaim that everyone who doesn't follow it is a bigot.

              There's a general fear that if they allow other people to dictate their language it will quickly become something unwieldy and less-useful. But realistically I think it makes more sense to evaluate these things on a case by case basis. And in this case it's not like transgender people are asking for a radical change in language usage, even if being unsure of what pronouns to use can be a very minor inconvenience at times.

          While I'm of the opinion that you should call someone whatever they want to be called, I still feel like this issue can be more of a semantics argument rather than a bigoted one. For example, someone might be of the opinion that a man who identifies as a woman is perfectly right in wanting to be a woman and that's fine, but the technical term for them is still a man as that is what they physically are.

          This might be hurtful to that person (which is why I think you might as well call them whatever they want) but to say it's transphobic just because you're of a different opinion of what the word "gender" means is a bit much. I've always felt uncomfortable about the idea that sharing an opinion with bigots but for a completely non bigoted reason automatically makes you a bigot.

      There's no indication that Zoat fears or hates trans people.  Insisting on using referents based on physical characteristics rather than self-identification is *kinda dickish*, but I suspect the vehement backlash that stance generates is precisely *because* that stance has no good answer to the "attack helicopter" meme.  Let's discuss it with a subject that isn't so heated.

      There's a guy I saw on some television show like 60 Minutes, years and years ago, who considered himself to be a cat.  This man had gotten a bunch of plastic surgery done, cat-like facial tattoos, whiskers installed in his cheeks.  The end result looked absolutely freakish, but that's besides the point.  Obviously pointing and laughing and calling him mean names would be atrocious behavior, but would you consider referring to him as "human" to be hateful bigotry?  I called him a "man" instead of a "tom", would you accept that I should be subject to negative consequences?  Do you think that person was mentally ill?  Do you think *any discussion* of his mental health is beyond the pale?

      Zoat's stance seemed to be that the tom was a human male with some plastic surgery and facial tattoos.  Zoat would fully support his efforts to magically or technologically turn into a cat, but would not consent to considering him a cat while he was still physically a bipedal ape.  Would this instance be sufficient for you to consider Zoat a transphobe?  Would that be "saying his existence is invalid"?

      I *don't* think Zoat's stance is beyond the pale of acceptable behavior.  Frankly, getting that angry at people who are supportive of the desire to transition, but won't change their terminology until a change is actually made, seems like throwing away support.  I suspect that the extremely strong negative reactions that stance generates are largely because some people who feel strongly about trans rights know, on some level, that their epistemological grounds are rather shaky.  

      For the record, I consider all of this *sad*, and would make reasonable efforts to be accommodating in the event I ever encounter a trans person in my actual life.  But the mod behavior there seems to be on the same tier as a rule against saying a fetus isn't a person.  "Or, y'know, you can just not support murder" would be a kind of an ill-tempered response, if that were the topic of discussion, no?

        The attitude of "I won't accept/acknowledge your gender until you've medically transitioned" is directly harmful to:

        1. Trans people who aren't in a position to medically transition because of their age, finances, location, or unrelated health issues;

        2. Trans people who, for personal reasons, only wish to transition socially and not medically.

        It also perpetuates a societal preoccupation with genitals over personhood that's broadly harmful to trans people regardless of their state of medical transition.

        I'm not trans, so it's not my place to reject the "support" of folks who claim to be okay with trans people as long as they jump through the right set of hoops. But my perception is that said "support" is just harm with a veil of plausible deniability draped over it. A good ally would listen to the people they're theoretically supporting and acknowledge their descriptions of their internal experiences, instead of trying to force their own preconceptions on them.

        I don't think the cat thing is a reasonable comparison. Gender identity is a mental characteristic, and a human brain can be a man's brain or a woman's brain, but there's no such thing as a human brain that's a cat's brain. (That said, I would still refer to the guy as a cat if he asked me to because that's just polite.)

        Hello! Trans person you are meeting in real life. Here's the thing about the "attack helicopter" meme, no one says it and actually believes it. It's equating a person saying they are trans with a person play acting that they are something absurd. It feels one step removed from a slippery slope argument, if we allow people to claim that they are a different gender than I expect then next they will want to be spaceships!

        And honestly, if someone actually really did come up to and claim that they identified as a helicopter or hell, even your example of the man who thinks is his a cat then I'll do my best. I'll try to accommodate him in that way when and if I meet him, and if that means to refer to him as a cat because that is how he wants to be known I can do that for him. 

        And yes we can have a discussion of his mental health, that discussion is "How can we help him feel comfortable in his own skin?" Going through life feeling trapped that way must be terrible, and I think a big part of transhumanism, a topic we write and share a lot of fiction about here, is about ways we can help people like him down the road. Sure we don't have that technology now but there are other simple things we can do, like *acknowledging that this person is different* and treating them with respect anyway. Because if a sentient attack helicopter actually existed I think it would be deserving of respect.

              I have a problem with this "some jerks used it to troll trans people, therefore it is always transphobic" thing, because, as you pointed out, a sentient helicopter would still be as deserving of respect as anyone else. (I mean, how many cartoons are there about sentient vehicles? If there isn't someone out there who desperately wants to become a Steam Engine because of an obsession with Thomas the Train, that would be impressive.)

              No, really, I have a problem with this, because a bunch of jerks used *my* identity to troll trans people, resulting in a bunch of activists declaring that I do not exist. That coming from allies is painful.

              (Paul outright said he hates \<mygroup\> early on. Outside of a couple comments, it hasn't really come up, and in practice, he hasn't actually acted like this is as true as being his inner monologue would suggest. Also I'm kinda use to people who express such hate (their wordchoice) being easier to get along with. Among those who seem more accepting is where the drama lies (weirdly gendered drama, now that I think of it). So, in practice, I tolerate Zoat in spite of this, and the pronoun thing (which bothers me more just because it's not a blink-and-you'll-miss-it comment). Somehow, it seems like what side one claims is not very well correlated with what side one most helps/harms. Humans are weird.)

              \* "My identity" is neither vehicle nor non-human animal, just, ah, in case there was confusion about that.

                I *do* think that the specific phrasing of "attack helicopter" signals transphobia pretty much 100% of the time. Like, that's a very specific meme whose purpose is to denigrate non-cis identities. Though I wouldn't be shitty to someone who told me "no, really, it's not the meme, I honestly feel that way."

              Non-binary people may be, though they more rarely become non-binary due to a struggle with gender dismorphia.

          The thing about the attack helicopter meme is that it explicitly *is* a slippery slope argument.  I think a less snarky version of it would be something like "If a person says their gender is different than what they appear to be, there is no real way to verify that beyond their own report of their subjective experience.  If we're going to take that seriously, then how do we justify drawing a line there, and not *also* taking seriously every *other* report of a subjective internal experience that doesn't match anything verifiable?"

          We can draw all sorts of lines about which claims we take how seriously, but if we're going to be honest, we have to admit that any line is going to be at least somewhat arbitrary.  So how do you condemn someone whose line is a *little bit more restrictive* than your own?  How is a claim of attack helicopter-kin meaningfully different from the most marginal, lowest effort claim of being transgender?  I mean, you brought up technological options; it's entirely possible that it will be possible to upload your brain into a computer, and have that computer control an attack helicopter before it's technically possible to transfer your brain into a vat-grown, natural body of your preferred sex.

          - u/CeruleanTresses:

            I think this is easily resolved by recognizing that gender identity *is* a subjective experience. It's not a separate characteristic whose only evidence is subjective experience; it is, itself, the experience. It's not a claim we need to critically evaluate on an individual basis, any more than we need to critically evaluate whether everyone we meet has qualia.

              And if we slip a little further down the slope, aren't all experiences subjective?  What does it even mean to "feel human", etc, etc.  I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm not saying your position is absurd.  But I think trans is strange and fake-able enough that some degree of skepticism about the whole concept doesn't strike me as obviously insane and evil.  I'm sure that having that questioned hurts.  But I've also known people who felt personally attacked when someone pointed out that they weren't actually a Druid with Mystical Powers.

                What's so strange about it? Having a gender identity is practically universal. The only difference for a trans or nb person is that said identity doesn't correspond to their genitals. The druid thing isn't comparable because "feeling like a practitioner of magic" isn't an intrinsic characteristic of most human brains the way "feeling like a gender" is.

                  [citation needed].  I'm not trying to be snarky here. While there are clearly many people, both cis and trans that have intense feelings that they *are* their gender, and that it's an inherent part of who they are, and being otherwise or treated otherwise would feel like a huge violation.

                  But I really have seen many people (cis, of course) that live with the gender role society assigned them without it actually mattering in a significant way, and feel like they would be completely ambivalent to a magical sex change (if  not disrupting current relationships, or adding other hardships).

                    I would agree that not all gender identities are strongly felt. I'm also considering agender to be a valid identity. I don't intend to erase those who feel that way, just to contrast gender identity with the various attack helicoper-esque comparisons people keep making. I appreciate the nuance you added.

                      I think you could call *some* of these as just having a weak gender identity and possibly cis-privilege of not needing to think about it.   

                      But at some point a weak enough gender identity is effectively the same thing as none.
                      Some of these really do seem to go that far.  And this isn't actually the same thing as agender (which AIUI usually means "identifies as no gender, and would reject any assignment of gender"; if you don't care, the only reason to identify as agender would be solidarity with others).  Instead it really is gender not mattering to their identity.  These people go "eh, whatever" for any gender assignment.  They know the gender role that society assigns them, obviously, and might be bemused if someone uses another, but it's not important to them, and wouldn't feels like an attack (or maybe feels like an irrelevant, failed attack).

                      I'm sure this seems terribly bizarre to those who do have a strong gender identity, but these people really do exist, and these two ends of the spectrum are going to be talking past each other a great deal.

                  My experience of gender is that it's a socially constructed fact, similar to citizenship, or eye-color-bucket

                  The social construction might typically draw boundaries based on brute facts (eg. biology, gps coordinates of my birth place, wavelengths reflected by by eyes), but the social category isn't the brute fact.

                  We notice the distinction between social-category and brute fact because we could trivially redraw the boundaries of these social clusters by agreement.  If everyone agrees, it's perfectly possible to say stuff like, "men are people who self-describe as men, plus anyone who hasn't stated a preference and has with XYZ biological traits," or "American citizens are people who are born in the continental US, except Steve, because fuck Steve."

                  I can talk about the consequences of being categorized as male.  Just like I can talk about the consequences of having a US passport, or the treatment I get based on eye color.

                  I can imagine having a preference for US vs Canadian citizenship, or liking the social role of a woman more of less than the social role of a man.

                  But it's not clear what it would mean to have an intrinsically "American" or "male" feeling outside of this social categorization.  Even if I felt something distinguishable from "being me" how would I know that  Donald Trump feels identically, but that Theresa May does not?  I don't have access to their minds.

                  Other people could have other ways of knowing that I'm not privy to.  And that's fine.  But there's something alienating about being informed that an experience is universal.

                    A gender identity doesn't have to be strongly felt, and an identity of "agender" is also valid. My intention isn't to exclude people who don't intrinsically identify with a gender. I can't say that I identify particularly strongly with mine. But an intrinsic sense of gender is certainly common enough, and mundane enough, not to be comparable with "an intrinsic sense of being a druid" or whatever other deliberately outlandish comparison someone wants to make in order to discredit trans identities.

                    Maybe "practically universal" wasn't the right phrasing, but I hope you understand what I'm saying. Gender identity is a thing, even if it's not universal. Like, I'm asexual, but sexual orientation is still a thing, and I wouldn't try to discredit gay people by saying "but if we have to take seriously this dude wanting to ~~bang~~ **marry** another dude, does that mean we have to take seriously a dude who wants to ~~bang~~ **marry** a helicopter?"

                      Why shouldn't I believe people who say they have a machine fetish?  That's a thing.  And it's a thing that's not super-surprising when I learn that other people have tastes unlike mine. 

                      Next, how are you not misgendering me?  

                      Coming into this conversation, my view is that gender is a socially-created cluster that's often -- but not always -- correlated with brute facts.  We can experience brute facts.  We can experience treatment that depends on social categorization.  But we can't directly experience social category, as that's a mental process outside our heads.

                      This definition means that I identify as male, even though I don't feel any experience that's intrinsically "male." People can be wrong about my gender just like they're mistaken if they say I'm French.

                      You're proposing a definition where people's gender is defined based on an inner experience.  People who feel X are male, people who feel Y are female, and people who feel neither are agender.  

                      While you're entitled to that definition, the obvious consequence (even if you're kind enough to not rub my nose in it) is that I'm "really" agender, even though I identify as male.

                      That's not necessarily wrong; I've heard stories of gay people who thought they were straight.  But it's certainly a surprising thing to be informed.

                      And the follow up question is: What mental traits, specifically, are core to the experience of masculinity that I seem to be lacking?  What are core feminine mental traits?

                      If gender is intrinsic (and not dependent on social categorization) then these can't depend on the society around us.  And if it's body independent then they're not physical sensations, or dismorphia.

                      I can think of some traits that are correlated with gender, but I can't fathom how someone would populate a list of Definitively Male inner experiences without sounding like a sexist.

                        It's fine that you feel that that stems from external stuff for you. Your experience and identity are valid. The experiences and identities of people who strongly feel an intrinsic gender identity are also valid, and that includes trans people.

                        To clarify, gender identity and (social) gender role are different, though related, concepts.

                Why would anyone fake being trans?  It's a difficult process that carries a lot of social approbation.  Faking being white, sure.  Faking being rich, absolutely.  What possible reason is there for someone to *fake* being trans?

                  Depends on the circumstances.  In most of the world, you're completely correct, but if most of you life is on tumblr, or you live in SV, claiming to be trans could be a solid tactical maneuver.  Even outside those circumstances, it could be a function of Munchausen-like mentality.  There's a reason "transtrender" is a term.

                  I personally don't have any reason to think anyone in particular is faking anything.  I'm explaining why I don't think it's necessarily evil for someone to be skeptical about a claim that often boils down to "take my word for it, no proof is even really possible".

        See, it's not dickish, it's cruel.  I'm cis, so I can't speak to the experience personally, but everything I know (and also common sense) says that transitioning is a difficult process that takes a lot of time, money, and effort and has a lot of social pressure against it that will bring you a lifetime of insults.  Making an explicit choice to not use the person's chosen pronouns is saying that their choice is not important, that they're just being ridiculous, that all of the things that made them transition in the first place don't matter.

        It's like going out of your way to tell a devout Christian that their god almost certainly doesn't exist and that's a good thing because the Bible portrays Her as a slavery-endorsing, genocidal monster.  That Christianity has contributed a little value to the world (beautiful buildings and artwork) but on the whole it's been a blight on humanity (pedophilia, Crusades, anti-science, wars caused by political schism, etc) and it's a really good thing that as people get more educated religion is falling away.

        (Of course, the difference between those two statements is that the second one is actually true.)

          Do you think there's no situation where this is the case?  Plenty of mockery falls into this category, and the (obvious and reasonable) refusal to honor such pronouns means that we're clearly not working off some universally applicable principle here.  So again, how do we justify condemning people whose standards for using another persons chosen pronouns are a *little bit higher* than your own?

          Maybe this is a function of the particulars of my own beliefs, but I see this issue in general as one of *marginal differences* rather than *immutable categories*, and I don't feel justified in condemnation for even moderate differences in the margins.  It strikes me as sort of saying "15%?!  Obviously the capital gains tax rate should be 18%, *you son of a bitch*!"

          >(Of course, the difference between those two statements is that the second one is actually true.)

          I suspect that many people who refuse to use pronouns see "trans is a mental illness" as "actually true".  Trans is fundamentally a mismatch between body and mind.  The current politically correct stance is "the problem is with the body", but I don't see it as *obvious* that "the problem is with the mind" is *wrong*.  The former aligns better with my views of mental versus bodily identity, but mental illness is always going to strain that.  Would it be morally wrong to cure a schizophrenic?  You'd be forcibly changing their mental state, functionally killing the person who was there before.  "Would it be better for trans people to take a magic potion that removed the dysphoria, but left the body intact" strikes me as the same *general category* of moral/philosophical question.  Is it customary to address schizophrenics as "Your Imperial Majesty"?

          >There. See? I was a complete jerk for no good reason. I went out of my way to be offensive. Do you wish that I wouldn't say such things?

          No, I'm an atheist, and I'm fine with you expressing your view with no negative consequences.  I'd also be fine with you expressing "atheism is a religion too".  And more to the point, I see that sort of commentary *all the fucking time* in the sort of communities that care a great deal about kindness towards trans people.  Which is exactly why I find the "how dare you invalidate my beliefs and claimed experience" stuff to be hypocritical.  It's certainly not *beyond question* that the religious person's claimed, internal spiritual experiences are meaningfully real, why should other people's be so privileged?  "This is my experience, believe me or not, I stand by my convictions" is one thing.  "This is my experience, failing to  validate it in any way makes you a *vile monster*" is rather different.

            Gender dysphoria is a mental illness in the sense that people suffer depression and distress because of it. That doesn't mean you should go out of your way to make life harder for them.

            You are describing a false dichotomy. If I print out a picture at a particular size and buy a picture frame but the picture frame but the picture doesn't fit in the picture frame then the problem is that they are mismatched. The issue isn't that the frame is wrong and the picture is fine. The issue isn't that the picture is fine but the frame is correct. The problem is that they don't match. I could change either the frame or picture to match the other and it wouldn't matter unless there was a specific preference for a particular size. 

            In the case of transgender individuals changing their body and/or social role can be done but we don't have a magic pill for making them happy with their natural body. The question isn't whether you accept their presentation or change their minds. The question is whether you accept their presentation or push them towards depression and eventual suicide.

            &#x200B;

            You shouldn't compare transgender people to schizophrenics. Being transgender does not mean being delusional. Transgender individuals do not believe they have genitalia they do not. Also because psychotic individuals are not qualified to make their own medical decisions.

            &#x200B;

            Your mental state is forcibly changed all the time by experiences. The person "you" were 5 years ago is gone. The person that is reading this right now will also be gone in time.   

            &#x200B;

            If there was a magic mind altering pill for transgender individuals then I would expect some would take it for practical reasons and others would abstain for personal or ideological reasons. If there was a magic mind pill that made people straight then I would also expect similar results for gay and lesbian people. Note: Practical reasons can also include to avoid getting lynched.

      The ban had nothing to do with what was in the story.  SV is very clear about understanding that the attitude of characters does not necessarily reflect that of the author.  Yes, there are content types that will get you banned, but this wasn't it.

      Zoat got banned for things he said in the thread, where he went out of his way to engage with the discussion in offensive, thoughtless, demeaning ways.  [This](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/11961586/) and [this](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/11963172/) being particular examples.  tl;dr, the essence of what he said was "Transsexuals are just being ridiculous.  Your genitals determine your gender and trying to call yourself by other pronouns is a delusion that I am not going to bother caring about."

      SV has an explicit [policy against misgendering](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/8912695/). ("We expect, for example, that you will gender everyone appropriately.")  This was an absolutely clear violation of it, so he was given 50 infraction points, which is the minimum that you can get for actually clearly violating a rule.[1] That comes with a 24-hour tempban.  Mr. Zoat then flipped out about how unfair it was to be held to the clearly-stated standard that he'd never bothered to read and how he wasn't going to tolerate anything that would make him break his streak of posting every day -- which a 24 hour ban would not do -- so he took his ball and went home...after posting one last ["f* you" to the moderators](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-thirteen.49418/page-520), which earned him a permanent ban.

        Zoat has clarified on Questionable Questing that he demands that gendered pronouns mandatorily be tied to biological genitals, and that he personally will refuse to allow anyone to go by gendered pronouns different from their genitals unless they have gotten bottom surgery.

        Which means Zoat demands personal information from anyone regarding the state of their genitals before he will allow them to go by a specific gendered pronoun that he hasn't personally approved of.

        He also seems convinced that when boats or cars are referred to with "she," they somehow suddenly have vaginas.

        This also ignores how gendered words relate in other languages. Japanese words are rarely ever gendered. Spanish words are rarely ever not gendered. So Zoat's bizarre notion that boats and cars have vaginas holds even less water when you consider all the words in Spanish that are gendered and how most pronouns in Japanese are gender-neutral.

        **TL;DR:** Zoat has somehow conflated English grammar with universal human biology, even towards non-English speakers, and creepily demands to know the state of what's in someone's pants before he can give them permission to be trans in his presence.

        In other words, Zoat's an egotistical diva. He's also stolen other writer's OCs and SIs without permission and defended doing so, furthering his selfish arrogance.

  The first bad sign for me was site-wide scandal about some futa fanfiction blown out of proportion by moderators.

  This here is just another example of SV's splendid moderation policies.

  My advice to all authors who publish their stories somewhere they don't control: have your story's original source at your home.

  Never, ever should you publish a story online without keeping backups. 

  Literally insane moderators are more common than you think, and your content may be removed (and you banned) at any moment and with no warning. 

  Keep backups of your content. Don't expect people on the Internet (site moderators included) to behave reasonably.

  And, my last advice, keep backups. Seriously. It is very important.
  ```

  - u/Teulisch:
    ```
    it is true, backups are very important indeed. 

    and not just because power-mad mods can ban people, but because entire sites can simply disappear. think for a moment, how many old websites are simply gone now? how many fandoms have died off, and their many works vanished like so much dust on the wind? how many servers can fail with no backups, their content simply lost? 

    finding a good place to post ones own stories is the hard part.

      You're right, human factor is just one cause of works vanishing forever.

      Thankfully, now we have [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/), but it does not index all sites, does not do reindexing that often, and doesn't backup sites with dynamic content. So backups are still crucial, and will be for the foreseeable future.

He doesn't believe trans women are women/trans men are men/etc., and won't believe they are until a future technology capable of completely transforming them into being biologically female comes along. He doesn't believe gender is seperate from sex, hence him calling that man who was transformed into a woman against his will a woman and refusing to call him a man despite his requests.

      And to be clear, if you don't think trans women are women, and that gender is seperate from sex, you are transphobic.
