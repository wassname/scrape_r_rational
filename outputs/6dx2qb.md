  ```
  Everyone's dead because crazy people have powers allowing them to destroy planets. Fortunately hell isn't that bad.

    ```
    Plot twist: This is why Frieza uses his power to conquer and subjugate entire races, rules them with an iron fist, and sometimes sells planets for exorbitant prices to the highest bidder (when using resources to crush the would-be buyers instead would be vastly more expensive). Someone has to, otherwise insane planetbusting weirdos would turn everything to rubble.


    ...Poor guy just wanted immortality. Is that so much to ask?
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  And... do you just retcon the whole powerlevels thing?
  ```

- u/BigJoey1:
  ```
  Not sure what to do with Ki anyone have any ideas?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Since I forgot to do it before and don't want to edit my one-liner, probably start by looking [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/44j0t2/qdrationalistdragonball/), at the last thread where this was discussed.
