  Also relevant may be *[Knowledge Is Useful, but Power Is Power](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565)*, in which the Goblet of Fire is only the most powerful of many artifacts used by the Ministry to put powerful wizards under the control of weaker ones:

  > "I call particular attention to this artifact because it was the first time weaker wizards – a group of eleven wizards in this case – managed to create an enchantment to identify the most powerful wizards or witches within a group and bind them to a magical oath, on pain of loss of magic for non-compliance. Prior to this devil-cup, only the strong could perform such a binding. The only limitation known for the Goblet of Fire is that its binding is temporary, it must be used with a finite ending date, perhaps the only safeguard installed in the original magic.

  > "At least thirty-one potentially powerful wizards have been murdered by means of the Goblet of Fire since its creation. Ten by use of the Goblet of Fire in competitions such as the Triwizard Tournament, long since abandoned. The remainder by acts of trickery perpetrated on the Goblet of Fire, usually some contract a wizard was bound to without knowing it, a contract that would be unknowingly violated costing the target-wizard his magic, a ripping that was invariably fatal..."

    Very... interesting. So far anyway.

    It's a lot more upfront about the whole "chosen one" trope. Makes it feel a lot more like the divine right of kings. Which is a pretty interesting approach to the whole chosen hero thing.

  Did anyone else think for a moment that this was a *Death Note/Harry Potter* crossover?
