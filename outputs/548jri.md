  I haven't heard of a single one of them, and most seem too new and/or obscure to have a significant number of ratings on Amazon or Goodreads. 

  Can't really afford a blind purchase right now, even if it's cheap (too many books on my reading list). But thanks for telling us about this.

  I did a quick search on the different authors and one of the writer Michael Carroll has a book series on creationism for children, so not what I'd qualify of being a "REAL scientist".

      Not a "real scientist" at all regardless of his creationist beliefs, as it happens. 

      He illustrates, and occasionally writes for, pop science and scifi books and magazines. He does no research, and has no credentials that I could find. Wiki has him pegged as "space artist".

      (You can now return to your regularly scheduled epistemology debate.)

        Now *that* is a much better reason to take issue with this author being pushed as a "real scientist."

        It's also rather disappointing, especially when there are so many top of the line scifi writers who DO have training in technical science disciplines. 

        In no particular order and allowing both computer programmer and mathematician to count as "scientist", off the top of my head there's:

        * Mark Lawrence

        * Peter Watts

        * Vernor Vinge

        * Greg Egan 

        * Ken Liu (maybe? Wikipedia says he worked in "technology")

        * Ted Chiang (maybe? Has a degree in computer science and does technical writing)

        And I would highly recommend the work of all of the above. It'd be nice to have a broader list of such authors. Anyone have any suggestions?

          There's also the classics: Isaac Asimov, Vernor Vinge,  Arthur C. Clarke, Carl Sagan

          There's a lot of great science fiction writers who are scientists... That's why it's disappointing to see this.

    Michael Carroll...I think I remember reading one of his YA books, The Cure. I appreciated the...unusual viewpoint, like when I read Atlas Shrugged.

  I can't guarantee that the books are rational, but since you guys often enjoy hard science fiction I thought you all would appreciate the chance at these books. It's a bundle pack of science fiction books written by scientists where readers are certain to learn some scientific facts disguised as an entertaining story. The books even include fairly lengthy appendixes which explicitly explain the scientific concepts used in the books.

  For the people who has never heard of the Humble Bundle before, it's an organization which sells games and books with a portions of all sales going to charity. Every two weeks or so, they come out with a Book Bundle where you can buy some or all of the books at certain prices.

  Better hurry, today on September 23rd, there's only 4 days left for this bundle!
