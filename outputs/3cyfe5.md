## [D] Fiction Recommendations for the theme "Ever After"

### Post:

Heinlein may have made two of the best "ever after" stories and I thought I'd toss them out and hope some of you will toss me back a few you enjoyed:

**Glory Road** [Glory Road Spoiler](#s "Where the hero goes gallivanting after he's bored with his wife, the empress of the galaxy's job of ruling.")


**To Sail Beyond the Sunset** [To Sail Beyond the Sunset Spoiler](#s "The closest Heinlein gets to anti-deathist, and the conclusion to his solipsistic history as myth story-arc")
