  Since they speak Chantant, they must be one of the groups that raid Procer... meaning they might know of secret passages into procer. Pretty nifty I'd say.

    Something I found the other day when looking for references to the Drow in the series ([Interlude - Precipitation](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/12/28/interlude-precipitation/)):

    > *“We are the wall,”* Cordelia said, and she spoke with the ironclad belief of a hundred generations of Hasenbachs before her. “We are the bulwark between the West and the monsters. We have been looking south all those years, and now Evil wakes. Do you think the Tower will stand alone, when their Legions spill out onto the continent? The Dead King will rise from his slumber and drown the world in death. The Everdark will band under a single banner and etch the Tenets of Night in blood across our cities. The Chain of Hunger grows larger and bolder every spring, and when they come it will not be in warbands – their hordes will blot out the horizon.”

    It looks a lot like the Tenth Crusade will end up dragging the whole continent into war, perhaps in the exact order that Cordelia specifies (the Tower's Legions, the Dead King, the Everdark, the Chain of Hunger).

    Personally I'm rooting for it to be Cat's banner that the Everdark unites under, but if they end up sacking cities then it's probably going to be a Drow (maybe one helped into place by Cat).

        And, ironically, causing it, with her Crusade.

  ```
  The drow are one of the most perfidious, selfish, cowardly civilizations there is.

  Of course they speak French.

    ```
    Though /u/erraticerrata is a native French speaker (I think?), so English is the more natural language of perfidiousness.

      (I think they're Quebecker/Québécois, so yeah)
