  Definitely Zenith of Sorcery. Nobody103 writes archmages extremely well (many of the MoL fans were really excited about the idea of a Quatach-Ichl sequel, etc.) so I'd be interested to see his take on this. Plus, archmage protagonists aren't something you see much of; most novels start far from the top in terms of power levels so it would be covering fresh territory.

    > Nobody103 writes archmages extremely well

    See, I thought the back half of MoL was weaker than the first half. The problem with extremely powerful characters (especially ones that start powerful, rather than develop over the course of the story) is that it's very easy to fall into the trap of them always having another card up their sleeve. When they're that powerful, it's tricky to make sure that the reader knows exactly what they can and can't do.

    The final fight, in particular, suffered from this, I think. While I'm not sure I'd call any of the gadgets Zorian pulled out Deus ex Machina, it definitely felt a little too close for comfort. 

    If Zenith is more of a Zach than a Zorian (classic Fireball wizard, rather than a artificer), that might help. But I'm not sure.
    ```

    - u/Slinkinator:
      ```
      I really liked the ending of MoL, but I think that Zorian's mana limits were kinda thrown out the window.  Nobody103 didn't let him solo artillery spells or anything, but he was maintaining a lot of simulacra at the same time, all casting magic.  


      The golems and crafting made sense, in that he didn't actually independently develop all of them, he iterated them over restarts hiring people to work on them and then recreated that work out of the time loop, but having all his gadgets and letting him teleport simulacrums around shooting force lances and fire stars and running ritual spells...  


      I still loved it, but arguably it could have been even better if he'd restrained zorian a bit more.

  I rather like King of the Junkyard and Zenith of Sorcery.

  I'm confident Junkyard would be good.  The premise seems promising, and I don't see any obvious traps that would cause readers to bounce off.

  Zenith sounds like a great premise, but I think it would be very difficult to launch.  An advantage of a tabula rasa low-level character is they can learn about the world and develop their own abilities at the same rate as the reader.  Managing the exposition loads of both a new world and a wide-ranging set of abilities from the very start sounds like a real challenge.
  ```

- u/VorpalAuroch:
  ```
  Zenith of Sorcery is what I'd root for, because it's something hard to do well but this author has a decent chance of pulling off. But it's the "no guts no glory" option; it's the option with the most upside potential but also the most likely to bomb or be incredibly bland.

  I think King of the Junkyard is the one I have the highest expectations for in terms of EV(interestingness).

    I do like Worm, and it did have a fair amount of influence on the story. But no, this isn't supposed to be a disguised Worm fanfic. I'd say the world is very different, and the sparks themselves don't function anything like Shards.
    ```

  - u/luka_sene:
    ```
    This was exactly my thought when reading the description. Not that I wouldn't be interested to see what nobody103 would do with that type of setting, but it does seem like a very similar premise.
    ```

  - u/Papa-Walrus:
    ```
    Yeah, Sparks definitely seem to be directly inspired by "Shards" in a lot of ways. The addition of the possibility of outright "breaking" is an interesting addition to the way they affect their users. And having the origin and mechanics laid out so clearly before the story has even started makes me think that the characters are probably more aware of the way the Sparks work at this point then most capes were in Worm, which could have some interesting applications.

    There does also seem to be the addition of a lot of other extraterrestrial and/or supernatural beings and elements outside of  the Sparks, whereas all the supernatural elements of Worm could be traced back to Shards
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  > The world is Earth, but not our Earth. Twenty years before the plot begins, two alien gods fought above the Earth and one of them ended up being killed and torn apart. Pieces of the dead gods (sparks of divinity) sought out compatible children and bonded to their souls, giving them superpowers.


  Waaaaait a second, this seems...*familiar:*

- u/IICVX:
  ```
  My vote is Zenith of Sorcery with King of the Junkyard as a side-project.
  ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  I have thoughts about each.

  **King of the Junkyard**

  I like the episodic nature, as long as it's going to ramp up to an occasionally broader plot.  Think DS9, where there were a lot of plots that were resolved by the end of each episode, but the ending was stretched across nine episodes, and resolved plot threads going back several seasons.

  My main concern with this problem is that it seems like a bit too much of a coincidence for all of these various plot threads to be happening at once.  The aliens showing up so soon after Godfall, in particular.  I'd want to see the various Weird Things™ to all make sense to be coming to a head a the the same time.


  **The Infinite Dungeon**

  Again, without a looming threat, I think I could enjoy this being episodic, but there would have to be an overarching plot asserting itself, at least occasionally, if it's going to have a satisfactory conclusion.  I'm not overly fond of LitRPGs, but I would make an exception for something by nobody103.

  My main concern would be: why is this person the protagonist?  He's just "lucky and willing to take risks?"  It seems to me like there would be people who were better, smarter, stronger, more skilled, etc., or otherwise more naturally talented, and "lucky" isn't a really satisfying reason for a protagonist to be the one who prevails (unless played for laughs).

  One thing that I would really like to see if this is the concept chosen would be to have rotating viewpoints.  All of these characters are going into the dungeon for their own reasons and having their own adventures; it'd be a shame to focus too closely one one point of view.

  **Zenith of Sorcery**

  High-power-level stories are hard to write, and I just don't see this going well.  This sounds like a character who can accomplish pretty much anything through magic, which makes it really hard to relate to the character, really hard to have the challenges that the character will struggle to overcome, and really hard to have antagonists who want to antagonize the protagonist in the first place. It's like writing a Superman story: you either have to use Kryptonite, or threaten someone Supes cares about, or put the character in a moral quandry, and all of those stories will eventually get old.

  Again, this is a u/nobody103 story, so I'd probably at least start to read it, but this is the least compelling of the four ideas in my view, just because: where does the tension come from?

  **Refuge in Void**

  I like the idea of a reverse-LitRPG.  The only time I've seen something like this done was [Kid Radd](https://www.bgreco.net/kidradd.htm), which I really enjoyed.  And this one actually sketches out a long-term plot, which endears me to it more than the others.  In fact, I'd say this is the one that speaks to me the most.

  My biggest concern with this one is that, at first glance, the protagonist sounds completely unlikeable, and for someone who we're going to spend a lot of time with, that sounds like a pretty fatal flaw to the story.  I mean, it can be done (see Black Mage from 8-bit Theater), but you'd have to sell the character as someone worth following pretty quickly, in order not to alienate the readers.

    It sounds like the overaching plot would be the mystery of the dungeon, and I am a sucker for a good mystery. This one is my favourite.

  I hope it's either Junkyard or Zenith. LitRPG is getting too stale and makes it harder to care about the world and the characters.

  Zenith sounds like the exact opposite of MoL. Young novice vs old master. It's also a break from the constant teen protagonists. Junkyard's lightheartedness also looks promising and poses a challenge to nobody103 who is a bit lacking in writing fun and humorous dialogue.

  Dang. I don't think I'm interested in these.

  They seem to follow a more recent crop of progression fantasy type stories that eschew the coming of age aspect for an already mature protagonist that's experiencing "arrested development" in a power-level sense only, usually due to circumstances of birth or other misfortune.

  I enjoyed Zorian a lot because I felt like his teenaged cynicism was genuine and well executed. I'm not sure I want to read about these guys.
  ```

  - u/cstmorr:
    ```
    I feel like a teenage protagonist is the "safe" choice and thus way, way over-represented in fiction. Personally my favorite characters from fiction are all mature people with interesting pasts. Corwin of Amber, Croaker, Pham Nuwen... adults are just far more interesting people than teenagers.

    Anyway, just pushing back slightly that there's a trend of some sort, the real trend in my eyes is the eternal overuse of kids as main characters. I think it has been particularly pronounced in progression fantasy because most of the authors are also very young.
    ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      I would definitely call it a trend, having read Street Cultivation and seen Heart of Cultivation show up only a few weeks after I was done. There's other examples but I'm blanking on names (Diaries of a Skill Trainer? Not sure that's right). It's a very trends-based genre, at least at the moment. That doesn't make stories bad, so I'm not bothered by the idea that younger protagonists are an "overused" trend (though I think they're more a natural choice for coming of age narratives). I'm just speculating as to the inspiration/motivation for ranging far from Zorian (maybe it's specifically to get away from that type of protagonist, even).

      I think progression is at its best when it's multi-dimensional. I feel like these stories come with characters that are developed out of the box, all their learning far behind them, with only a situation to remedy and then power progression ahead of them. It's not a lack of originality that I'm speaking out against, but more a choice I personally see making stories worse instead of better, by a subjective standard.

      I get that other people are more interested in power speculation and numbers-other-than-age going up, but I like Mother of Learning enough to comment when I see the author joining in a trend I'm personally not confident about.

      (This is also not to say I don't see character development in the future for Heart of Cultivation, for example. I think that story did well setting up >!a big misunderstanding right at the beginning that not even the readers are sure about and that the protagonist will eat crow for almost for sure.!< I'm not sure the stories outlined here lend themselves to the same kind of "promise" built into the premise. Then again, that's just one promised moment. A young character promises more than one right from the concept, not so much an adult one.)
      ```

      - u/cstmorr:
        ```
        I feel like you're misunderstanding what mature protagonists can be? Implying that readers want a mature protagonist so that they can focus on power speculation and numbers going up just sounds like you've spent a lot of time reading poorly written wish fulfillment stories

        Both adults and teenagers can have the same struggles, in terms of categories: needing to adapt to challenges regarding friends, lovers, and their approach to the world. Adults simply have pasts that create nuance. Kids and teenagers have to start off by making relatively predictable mistakes that we all make at that age -- and if they don't, then they don't come off as authentic kids. All that said, authors can screw up and write kids that act like adults, or adults who come off as wooden or uncomplicated, and progression fiction isn't exactly a wellspring of good writing about relationships and personalities to start with, so I'd really have to go outside the genre for most examples of what I mean.
        ```

        - u/Revlar:
          ```
          That's not really what I meant. I was referencing someone else's sentiment in another chain that, for example, a lot of people seemed interested in a Quatach-Ichl sequel because they like what author could do, powers-wise, with a full archmage from the beginning.

          My point is that a young protagonist promises more mistakes than an adult protagonist (meaning more opportunities for growth or subversion of growth, forms of progression in a dimension other than power-through-mechanics) as well as implying that they have things to learn about the world they live in, and seeing some of the dry power fantasy that comes out of the genre and knowing characters are not the author's strong suit, I'm not convinced by what's on offer here.

          At the end of the day these are all very cursory overviews of ideas. Maybe I'm completely off-base on the predictions part of my argument, but I know I'm not lying about my reaction to reading through these. If you don't like young characters that's your thing. You're entitled to your own opinion.

          I personally don't believe in "overused" or "predictable" as markers that predict whether I'll enjoy something. I believe in setup and execution above pretty much everything. Premise is part of setup, and the protagonist's experience or lack thereof is a part of a story's premise.

          I also think you underestimate how many stories use tricks to get the same kind of setup as a young protagonist would give (TRICKS ARE GOOD, just to be clear). Making the character a fish out of water through Isekai, for example, is a way to keep the protagonist learning new things like a young protagonist would. Stories like Street Cultivation and Heart of Cultivation don't do this, because the protagonist already knows everything important about the setting (or has the means to look it up) and is only educating the reader.

          People who don't want to see progression, just power, are going to gravitate towards the archmage story. To borrow an expression, they're valid. I don't like that kind of story so I don't like that kind of story.
          ```

          - u/cstmorr:
            ```
            Oh, ok. That context about Quatach-Ichl makes more sense. I'd be interested in reading about him -- if he turned out to be a complex person with more motivations than a papier-mache villain. He's closer the the latter than the former in MoL, in that the only thing we see of him is wanting power.

            I don't underestimate how many stories use tricks. I'd say, instead, that 90% of progression fiction is crap that doesn't have much to recommend it, at all, and it's not particularly surprising to know that crap relies on cheap tricks.

            ... that's way more shade than I meant to give, I also recognize that these are amateur writers doing it for fun. Haven't read Heart of Cultivation, but Street Cultivation was nicely done. Anyway, we're probably on the same page insofar as we want authors to try new things and not just copy the last fiction.

  King has my vote. There's a dearth of good modern-superantural/urban fantasy fiction in rationalish spheres, and I honestly have trouble thinking of much the gameish stories might contain that other stories in those genres haven't already done extremely well.

  Zenith might be interesting, but (unpopular opinion time) very little of what the protagonists in MoL did felt "clever" in a way that makes me excited to see more supermages-beating-everyone kinds of stories from this author. Would rather see him try something new.

  1. King in Junkyard. Like it 8/10. Currently  I do want to read some urban fantasy with good world-building. This does not have the aim of having a good world-building but I believe it will still be better then most things around. 
  2. The infinite dungeon 4/10. Mixing fantasy dungeon with modern world does not sound cool. After watching the first video of fantasy knights getting killed by machine gun you saw it all. [https://youtu.be/UEahGo9EEyE?t=329](https://youtu.be/UEahGo9EEyE?t=329) 
  3. Zenith. 7/10. It is hard to write a book about a powerful protagonist. The only time I saw it being done well was in Hard to be a God. A very short story by Strugazkie. They made 2 movies but they are shit go read the novel.   
  4. Refuge. 5/10 Recently saw it done in New Game Minus. I do not believe good world-builidng is possible with such a premise.

  (This post is intended for /u/nobody103, not the OP)

  To me, Zenith of Sorcery both has the most potential, both the potential to be good and bad.


  I have been searching for a good OP protagonist story for years now, basically. They are incredible hard to write, as you already knows. Still, if anyone could have the chops to write it, I believe it would be him.


  My biggest problem, however, is that the setting seems...super boring. I know that you mentioned that different universes/planes will eventually be explored, but why not have that right from the start? What would a world look like in which multiple universes, all with different magic and technology, look like?

  The obvious problem would be how hard it would be to write. I know you mentioned that MoL took a lot out of you, and you seem to be more interested in branching out. Still...I would absolutely love for you to write Zenith of Sorcery. And heck, if you want to write King of the Junkyard as a side project, I'd read that too!

  Well, I'll read everything you post, anyway.

  Thanks for the absolute incredible journey of Mother of Learning, and I'm excited to see what you create next!

  **King of the Junkyard** - Healer/Mender Protagonists are rare and well-done ones that don't turn their self-healing into a method of being godlike in combat are rarer still. This has promise.

  **The Infinite Dungeon** - Pass. I don't mind LitRPG in general but the genre is absolutely saturated right now.

  **Zenith of Sorcery** - Hard pass. There are two good ways to write an OP protagonist - have the conflict involve side characters mostly while the protagonist is largely there for comedy (One Punch Man) or acknowledge that the MC is undefeatable and go full slice-of-life so that Demon Lords showing up is just an amusing afternoon diversion before dinner (the middle arcs of Death March WN [first arcs are rocky and worse in the LN version, and later arcs become too serious]).

  This one sounds tedious and awful.

  **Refuge in Void** - My vote goes here. I've always wanted to see a story set in a world where the odd abstractions used in a TTRPG actually exist - quantised power-ups etc. - but where it's also not actually *gamified*.

  Story 1: this is more or less a Worm fanfic  


  Story 2: could be another boring litRPG, unless A LOT of creativity is put in it

  Story 4: if the author follows more of a cyberpunk/AI angle this could be it.

  I'd say Zenith is the most likely to be as good as MoL, but I'd love to see an original LitRPG done to his standard, so Dungeon or Void would be good risky projects.

  Junkyard sounds like Wildbow's works injected into the Rick and Morty universe, which sounds interesting but is going to be so difficult to pull off well.  Still sounds good though.

  Refuge from the void sounds the most interesting. As does the garbage one. 

  LITRPG’s have become a trend and honestly many of them are just lazy form of making characters stronger and can power creep if not done properly. Zenith is almost an instant turn off, with perhaps the potential of being funny and having other elements of story telling.

    Refuge sounds interesting to me, but I'm not sure how much of that is the story itself, versus me just being interested in the central mystery of the setting.

    That's part of the reason why a competent author taking a shot interests me. I think the genre needs some examples of how to do it without relying on lazy tropes like starting bonuses.

  Combine all ideas. Start with King of the Junkyard, with the first 4 episodes you've already planned. Episode 5 have a Spark (or other entity or object) who can access The Infinite Dungeon. Episode 6+ have Jack encounter Zenith and his newly recruited sidekick NPC in the Dungeon (or just one alone). Spinoff Dungeon or Zenith or Refuge into fully realized series based on your own comfort and enjoyment in writing or if patrons start paying you serious money for more of one in particular.

  ```

- u/warlord007js:
  ```
  Oh God oh no.

  First idea-urban fantasy and a sprawling world which seems multivaried with episodic pacing. Good

  Second- straight litrpg. First off ewwww. Can probably be done well but it's been done SO many times I would skip. Doesn't seem at all original in any way. Inventive twists are unironically required for litrpgs at this point.

  Third- op dude making moves and solving problems on a big scale. Seems ok. Making it about logistics and political stuff can be a pacing killer but I'd be down.

  Fourth- character gets isekia'd (however you spell it) into a fantasy world with monsters and a dying civilization. Biggest problem is that the main character is described as an oblivious guy with no self awareness. I've seen this done badly too many times. He could probably do it well but idk.

  Overall

  1st-1st

  2nd-4th

  3rd-2nd

  4th-3rd

    If a major theme of Zenith is logistics or the inability of overwhelming power to get things done without people or bureaucratic skills, that would be extremely interesting to read about and possibly enough to make it my favorite option.
