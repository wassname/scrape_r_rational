## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  In a earlier thread I recommended the book How To Succeed in Evil as a rational dark comedy. Now that I've finished the book, I hereby rescind that recommendation because the ending was awful. Not only does it fail to properly conclude the story in any way, instead just setting up for a sequel, but the last scene features the protagonist convincing a man to commit suicide by allowing himself to be buried alive without a shred of irony.

  I felt unclean after reading that, and even if I didn't the final act is still a drastic shift in tone from the rest of the book. I was fine with its mean-spirited satire of human stupidity, but when it suddenly decided to take itself seriously it was repulsive to read and strained credibility. It has some hilarious and tragic moments, and even a few interesting insights, but when none of it is tied together properly it all becomes meaningless drivel.

  A bit of a rant here, but i'm sick and tired of 'adult' and 'adult-themed' books merely being another term for the inclusion of sex or blood and gore (if not all of that). It's a completely non-descriptive set of terms... The writing can be just as bad, or even worse than YA fiction.

  I would like 'for adults' be a moniker or a sign that the book uses more terms, treats the reader like an intelligent person, etc, but I'm not sure how I could influence that. I'm sure if I wrote a novel and marked it as adult, I'd get a bunch of teens in on it, looking for porn, and then get complaints that what I was writing barely even mentioned sex, and when it did, it wasn't detailed graphically.

    I find sex scene in general to be mostly totally unnecessary to storytelling.

    If a story can function just fine without it, why include it at all unless the entire point is erotica.

      Agreed. I recently finished the first season of Penny Dreadful on Netflix and found the sex and nudity annoying. Presumably it was added to compete with Game of Thrones, but many have nothing to do with the plot and don't add to the gothic horror. That said, I do recommend the show if you like old English literature, since it very much embraces that writing style.

        Lol.

        The Tudors predates Game of Thrones and had this in buckets.

        Cable shows, especially history shows, play into this, both in terms of nudity and gore, it has nothing to do with Game of Thrones.

        Frankly, a lot of the things people attribute to Game of Thrones gets a bit tedious, kinda like back when everything was "The Sopranos with/of X".

      I've certainly seen a fair bit of critique in /r/rational for stories with simple vocabularies, and quite a few of the stories written in here tend to have rather complicated vocabularies.

      I'm reminded of vaguely remembered studies that found that Donald Trump and Daily Mail or something had a reading level and style well below other political leaders, and suggestions that this made them more popular and charismatic. 

      Plus this.

      >The initial surprise from my little data experiment is that writers whose work we regard highly tend to be produce work at a lower reading level than we’d intuit.[7] Cormac McCarthy, Jane Austen, and Hunter S.

      >Furthermore, the dialogue is stilted, the characters are dumb and erratically motivated, and the writing itself is childish, which opinion I arrive at having spent three years teaching and grading the writing of eleven year olds. If Brandon Sanderson reads my first, incorrect rant, I am entirely sorry for any degree of pissed-off he becomes, and abjectly apologize, and direct him to this more accurate rant instead, acknowledging any further inaccuracies as my own fault.

      This sort of comment by another user is representative of the sort of attitude I've seen here. Brandon Sanderson does probably write at a fairly low grade level. This may explain part of his popularity. I read that above quoted user/author's writings, and there were a lot of odd complicated terms I wasn't actually sure of the meaning of in his writing.

      From a quick google, harry potter book 1 is a grade level for 11-12 year olds, and is of interest to 8-9 year olds as well.

      I'll end with a quote.

      To some extent, this is one of the expectations of "literary fiction" as a genre (and one of the things that people mean when they use "literary fiction" as a euphemism). Literary fiction doesn't tend to sell very well, because it's mostly optimized for critical acclaim and social status rather than actual sales, but I don't think that says too much about what impact vocabulary has on sales.
      ```

      - u/Dwood15:
        ```
        Vocabulary is a bad marker for good fiction, as it can go too far and give off the "English Major" feeling and turning off readers from enjoying the book.

        I guess I would like the "intelligent reader" treatment with more complex plot lines, deeper meaning in the story, etc. For example. Lord of the Flies would be in the category because of the way it treats the reader. Stephen King could be Adult as well, not because of any gore or sex in his books, but because he treats is readers like they're intelligent and doesn't beat the motifs or tropes over your head, etc etc. 

        Adult should be adult literally because it exhibits a higher quality in story and language depth than most YA novels. What that quality is, is extremely difficult to quantify.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          There's a point where you're just having a thesaurus thrown at you, which is bad, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad metric. The optimum pH balance of a pool is 7.4; it's bad if it's higher or lower, but that doesn't make the scale any less useful.

          I generally consider vocabulary as a fairly good second-order approximation for adultness of a work. Vocabulary acts as a gate through which inexperienced or uneducated readers cannot (or will not) pass, so if you see a certain vocabulary you can assume a few things about both the author and the author's intentions.

          I do have a B.A. in English though, so treat what I say with a grain of salt.

  Warning: Spiders/Politics

  So [here's Ben Carson](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/ben-carson-dallas-shooting-obama-225278#ixzz4DqSuBDxP) on Obama's response to the Dallas shooting:

  > Why do we have a Second Amendment? They’re always saying you don't need a high-powered weapon to hunt deer. The Constitution is not about deer hunting. It's about people being able to defend themselves from an overly aggressive government or an external invasion.

  I've always considered the "we need guns to protect ourselves from the government" as something of a power fantasy, similar to how a lot of people view the zombie apocalypse. People like to make escape routes out of the city, build prep kits, go camping in the wilderness to test their survival, etc. I generally consider this (and prepping in general) to be pretty harmless, or possibly beneficial in the sense that people are going out to acquire useful skills like first aid and disaster preparedness. This particular defense of the 2nd Amendment seems to come from a similar psychological place.

  What I don't understand is this reaction *specifically in response to someone shooting police officers*. "We need our guns in order to go after the government" seems completely tone deaf to me when someone has just used their guns to go after the government. I can't actually tell whether this is just repetition of a talking point without regard to context, or a hard line ideological stance. I recall similar rhetoric following the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, so I don't think this is isolated to just Ben Carson or just this incident.

  (There are other, much better arguments against gun control, but they provoke less head scratching from me.)

    > I've always considered the "we need guns to protect ourselves from the government" as something of a power fantasy, 

    At this point the best thing that can be said about it is it actually means "we need guns to make it *just* inconvenient enough for the government.

    And, honestly, I don't even buy that.
    ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    Yes, there is a real ideology that suggests that the answer to both "oppressive government" and "dangerous rioters" is "give everybody guns". We outnumber the government, and we outnumber the rioters.

    EDIT:

    I'm blue tribe, so take this with a grain of salt:

    The structure of modern militaries is fundamentally different to those envisioned by the drafters of the constitution. You have to remember, when the United States were founded, artillery and warships were routinely privately owned.

    You could argue pretty strongly that this means the constitution is outdated. 

    But you could also argue that it means our society has been drifting closer and closer to a state where a few powerful people control most of the power, and this is incredibly risky. Or you could start thinking about asymmetric warfare and argue that we can plot a fairly short route back from where we are now to something like balance, argue modern militaries aren't really all that in the case of civil war - when was the last time the US military really *captured and held* a hostile territory?

  Anyone have recommendations of well written fics that deal with protagonists that are actually inhuman?

  Of particular import is the MINDSETS being at least not like a baseline human.

  My frustration being, if my own  brain is more foreign then your so called "unfathomably alien" mind in its diversions from the baseline of 'majority' European human on motivations, approach to sexuality, ethics and problem solving, aesthetics of beauty, culture etc I will have to resist the urge to scream and smash something.

  I'd prefer if their vaguely insectile or something like the xenomorphs or zerg in physical aesthetics but considering how small the pool of this kind of works is I'll take most anything.

  Wait But Why is [planning IRL meetups](http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/07/wait-but-hi.html) worldwide on August 13.

      Plus, *everyone* is playing it, so I've talked to a bunch of people I haven't seen in a year or more.

      And I fully expect the gameplay part to improve-- they wouldn't have included strong attacks if they didn't plan for them to matter, so they'll probably balance out combat whenever they get around to doing the next patch.

  Anybody using git and programming in their writing process?

  I wrote a shell script to document how many words changes I made to a given project everyday, in which I learned a lot about...shell scripting. It was satisfying to document my progress this way.

  I am thinking of building a random name generator, a dice roller, maybe an RPG system for use in quests.

  Is there anything useful that I can do with books I started writing but didn't finish, besides actually taking the time to finish them? I have ~9 books that are sitting at various stages of completion (that's only counting anything that's crept over 10K words) and actually completing them will be [*haaaaard*](http://i.imgur.com/MD0p6LA.gif), not just because of the writing-prose aspect, but because of the editing, beta-reading, second round of editing that are a minimum to get quality content out the door. I don't want to just throw away hundreds of thousands of words, but I can't foresee myself ever having the time to finish all but one or two of them.

  - u/CouteauBleu:

    I guess it depends on the specifics (themes/stories/word count/etc), but in no particular order:

    * Making omakes or short stories out of them; you're still letting a lot of words go to waste though. 

    * Cannibalizing their characters and plot points into your other stories/books, the way Wildbow did with his superhero stories pre-Worm. It means you probably can't use most of the text you've written, but transferring a character to a different story might be faster than writing a new character from scratch, so you *might* get some increased productivity from your previous work that way.

    * Making A GIANT CROSSOVER OF THEM ALL WHERE THE DIFFERENT WORLDS ARE LINKED BY PORTALS AND then I guess interesting things happen or something?

    * Trying to complete shorter, denser versions of you stories. Only keep the essential, try to go to the conclusion as fast as you can, maybe use a different format. You still need a lot of work for each book but at least you're actually using your previous writings.

    The trivial answer is "a character who trains and studies very hard to become good at wrestling".

  It's kind of interesting to note that, despite the rise of [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (in [EPUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) packaging) and the decline of [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format) in electronic books, many tabletop role-playing games are sticking with PDF. Why should this be?

  Compare the following screenshots...  
  \- [First](http://i.imgur.com/gJKUacH.png), a page from the PDF version of the **ludicrously**-awesome (seriously--check out [the bibliography](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/low-tech/bibliography.html)!) book *[GURPS Low-Tech](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/low-tech)*;  
  \- [Second](http://i.imgur.com/FGeKwUx.png), an excerpt of the same book, manually converted to HTML (including some [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) tweaks--read the code [here](http://pastebin.com/6NsHKN9S)) and displayed in [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome);  
  \- [Third](http://i.imgur.com/OOY3ieT.png), the same HTML file, displayed in Google Chrome at a different window width; and  
  \- [Fourth](http://i.imgur.com/AWsA4cs.png), the same HTML file, converted to EPUB in [Sigil](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil) and displayed in [Cool Reader](https://sourceforge.net/projects/crengine).

  Note that Cool Reader doesn't display the [~~sidebar~~ boxout](http://www.graphics.com/article-old/creating-boxouts-and-sidebars-css) as a boxout. Actually, Sigil recognizes that e-reading applications can't read the boxout's `float:right;` style, and just removes it in the conversion. If I try to open the HTML file directly in Cool Reader, it just crashes the program, even though Cool Reader normally is able to open HTML files! (It *does* work properly in [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com)'s EPUB converter and viewer--but Calibre is *library-management* software, not *reading* software, and doesn't even have any mobile versions.) Tabletop RPGs can't abandon PDF for EPUB until mobile e-reading programs are as good as mobile Internet browsers (and mobile PDF readers) at displaying content more complex than a single column of text and images. (Obviously, distributing an RPG book as an HTML file, with any illustrations provided as individual image files in an accompanying folder, would *technically* work--but it also would be a horribly cumbersome solution. "PDF" stands for "*Portable* Document Format"!)

  (Note: I took the fourth screenshot above before realizing that my versions of Sigil and Cool Reader were outdated by more than a year. However, after I updated them and tried again, the results were exactly the same--right down to Cool Reader's crashing when I attempted to open the HTML file!)

  [A relevant 2015 discussion on the RPG.net forums](https://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?756319)

  ---

  And, on the topic of sidebars and boxouts in RPG sourcebooks, it occurs to me that they're a very interesting innovation.

  In [the example passage that I used above](http://i.imgur.com/FGeKwUx.png), there are exactly six heading levels, from `<h1><em>GURPS Low-Tech</em></h1>` and `<h2>Chapter 2: Core Technologies</h2>` to `<h5>Glass</h5>` and `<h6>Core Formation (TL1)</h6>`. HTML allows a maximum of six heading levels, so this probably was a conscious choice on the part of the editors. However, where should "Race for Porcelain" go? It obviously needs to fit under `<h5>High-Fired Ceramics</h5>`--but, at the same time, it isn't quite as narrow in scope as the `<h6>...</h6>` headings underneath `<h5>Glass</h5>`. So, it gets an `<h5>...</h5>` heading *in a boxout*--effectively, a heading *at level 5.5*--underneath `<h5>High-Fired Ceramics</h5>`! It's a neat little solution. Note that it's a branching path: After reading about ceramics in general, you can take a temporary detour down the dead-end right side of the page to learn about porcelain, or you can advance to the next topic in series on the left side of the page!

  The *ex post facto* determination of where a boxout was meant by the original author to go in the structure of the book can be tricky, however. Note that the font style of `High-Fired Ceramics` in [the screenshot of the original PDF](http://i.imgur.com/gJKUacH.png) actually seems to be a hybrid of `<h4>...</h4>` (not in the screenshot: large, bold, and all-caps) and `<h5>...</h5>`--*not* a hybrid of `<h5>...</h5>` and `<h6>...</h6>`. On the other hand, though, it's very obvious from the text that this boxout is much more relevant to the narrower "High-Fired Ceramics" section than to the wider "Stone and Earth" section. The verdict: The editors at Steve Jackson Games failed to provide a consistent progression of weight in laying down the stylistic guidelines for their headings. Tut, tut!

    Regarding the ubiquitous use of the PDF format, I would define the problem as such:

    "New formats will only turn popular once you can emulate the design of a current complex PDF with just LaTeX"

    As a totally anecdotal evidence I can say that I've worked on trying to emulate a Pathfinder sourcebook with a LaTeX template, and the work hits a snag around 70% authenticity. Don't get me wrong, LaTeX is still the number one option to obtain the best alignment and visual aspect with the least effort, but once one goes pass the bare medium effort, the small design details that one might want to work with turn it into a nightmare. Putting a picture halfway in each column, creating a wrapped effect in a column, making changes halfway through the page, etc... All of those things are complicated to do in a project where the design process has to be left partially to the computer, but easy to do when the human controls where pretty much everything will end up in as in InDesign.

    All of this to say that in this comparison the free formats for online resources are much more similar to the LaTeX pipeline than the InDesign one, you have your inputs of images+text+design rules->you get the device constraints(screen, proportions, etc...)-> you display the final result 'image'. And if you wanna present a very stylized and presentable result then a static creation like a PDF is still the best option, both in terms of the result and of the tools used to create it.

      I use it all the time when I'm talking to people online, just because gender is almost always ambiguous with user handles. I prefer singular "they" to alternatives like "he/she", "s/he", "xir", etc. because it's the only one that doesn't draw attention to the issue of gender. Using "he/she" has always felt like it was saying to the reader "okay, I don't know gender here, so I'm going to be respectful and point out that it's ambiguous", which can detract from the message you're actually trying to communicate ("xir" and variants being the most aggressive about it). I've never felt like there was a similar component of signaling with singular "they", which is practically invisible for most readers.

      (There was a period of about a week when I tried to avoid using pronouns and/or tried to figure out gender from posting history or context clues, but it was too much work.)
