  Personally, after the discussions I've seen on how to define Mary Sues and whether X character is or isn't one, the best understanding I have of it is that a Mary Sue is a character who the story and world revolves around to the exclusion of anything else.

  The only point of other characters is to reinforce or oppose the protagonist, anything beyond that is frivolous set dressing.  Further, since the only relevant points of those characters are their relationship to the protagonist, they are best served by having those points at the forefront of their character at all times.

  The protagonist will have a backstory chock full of plot devices and tragedy because they're the only person that really matters.  The protagonist's flaws only exist to highlight flattering features, or are flattering features masquerading as flaws.  The protagonist is tethered to the main cast in order to have easy access to people who reinforce or oppose the protagonist.

  There is overlap with protagonists as a whole in this, since a story will invariably focus on the main character and pay attention primarily to them and things relevant to them, and more than likely the protagonist is one of the most important people around, but the difference in magnitude is starker here, and it's not a difference that can be discarded.  There's still room for ambiguity, someone might say that a story is a Mary Sue story because they feel it revolves around the protagonist too much, and someone else might disagree.  This is okay, to me.

  At the end of the day, I believe that a Mary Sue is less a quality of a character, and more a quality of the story at large, describing a story that has nothing to show but the protagonist and things directly connected to the protagonist, most commonly but not inherently wrapped up in a shameless power fantasy.  Calling a character a Mary Sue, I believe, is an accusation that the story, world, and characters are not fleshed out and that the protagonist is the only character treated as a person.

  I could be wrong about this, approaching it from the wrong set of assumptions or lacking a key insight, but from what I know right now I do think the term has merit.

    >I don't like being told what to do.

    That's precisely why I tried to be a little gentler about this, but I get the feeling I've prickled more than just you. I apologize if it sounds like a demand - I've just been bottling this rant up for half a decade of reading. As for the other points:

    >The types of stories it is supposed to describe would still exist, and people would want some word to talk about them with, even if not this one. If I'm warning people why I don't think they should read a poorly-written power fantasy, I'll still use words like "Mary Sue".

    You seem to have grasped what I'm trying to say, but missed one of the key points. Incontrovertible Mary Sues still exist, but they tend to be very rare, and the works that they're in have other obvious flaws besides Mary-Suism which would be better to point out, and on top of that you still have an *incredible* amount of works that are "borderline" Sues where you could argue one way or another ad-infinitum. HPMOR is one of these, Daystar Eld launched a massive reread investigation into this, and he could only come out with something like "I believe in this, but it's still probably possible to construe it in the other way."

    >The solution isn't to destroy words that can be used for that--it's to notice when people are doing that, and not be fooled. And also try to get people to quit doing that, which is a really hard problem. Are the people you see using the term on r/rational trying to sneak in connotations? If so, you should address the problem directly when they do that, instead of suggesting we discard the word.

    What do you think I'm doing? (lol) I can't possibly write out this entire thesis every time I try to talk someone off the ledge, so I wrote a big post to convince people otherwise that I can link to. I think it's reasonable to expect people on the subreddit to read this at some point, and maybe it's a good enough meme that it sticks in their head and they share it around. I couldn't possibly destroy the word, but maybe having people think about what Mary Sue really means every time they use it will make them more reluctant to do so. ([Eliezer also wrote an essay on this](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words))  You do exactly this when you say there are two possible uses for Mary Sue. If it's as simple as saying:
    >...the story is too much of a power fantasy and it's damaging suspension of disbelief.

    Then why not say exactly that? It's not too many words, and it's certainly more helpful. In fact, words like "power fantasy" have a large number of meanings as well - if I wanted to make my story less of a power fantasy, I wouldn't just turn down the "power fantasy" dial on my write-o-tron 2000, I would have to do other things like make sure that the character had a few more permanent losses and that he didn't grow too much better than the antagonist. If those things constitute better advice, then *obviously* it's better to say those than to say "power fantasy" or "mary sue".

    >It's not a coincidence...

    That was the whole point of me saying it was an enormous coincidence, so much that I couldn't have possibly made it up. The implication was that the coincidence was so big it couldn't possibly be a coincidence.

  >"Mary Sue" is a category created in response to a suspiciously large number of stories with protagonists that share the same few traits. The most archetypal example of a Mary Sue is a female character that will be liked by the protagonists of the story and disliked by the antagonists for some tangential reason, who has very few flaws and many strengths, some of which are out of place in the setting, who also has some kind of relationship tethering her to the main cast whether it be familial or coincidental, and has some kind of sympathetic backstory meant to engage the reader in her story (and little else). There is a male analogue to this, the Gary Stu or Marty Stu, who has all of the same traits with the gender reversed.

  from my experience 'round these parts, a mary sue is a protagonist who is too good at too many things in a way that violates suspension of disbelief and robs the story of suspense and a satisfying resolution. im not gonna argue about which definition is superior because that sounds boring, but i think most people on /r/rational who say "mary sue" are referring to something akin to my definition.

    I'll just chime in what I thought a Mary Sue was, without ever having looked it up and only ever heard it colloquially:

    A person who's so good at everything there's no real reason for anyone else to exist aside from creating conflict. And for this to *seem* unrealistic or unreasonable to me as a reader.

    So, mostly in line with your definition. But I won't argue strongly for this. I'm sure other people use it differently, but this is one point in favor of your guess.

      yeah the point of everyone else's existence being pointless in context is a good extra dimension, and lines up with what others have said

      but yeah, i wouldnt defend any definition of mary sue all that hard, its just more of a way to vocalize a certain vibe you get about a character that you have issues with

    The occasions when I'm inclined to call something out as a Mary Sue, it's because the characters virtues dissolve conflicts before they've materially inconvenienced that character. 

    More generally, It's not about a specific set or high amount of attributes, it's how many of the character's conflicts are overcome by attributes they're purported to have had since the start of the story. A character who's capabilities at the start of the story are sufficient to overcome all the conflicts that occur in the story. 

    This may or may not break someone's suspension of disbelief but that isn't really the issue. Rather, characters who never fail or need to grow reduce the tension, and that's a story structure problem.

  I had understood 'Mary Sue' to mean, in short, 'a character who is never at risk of failing to succeed, and who never loses anything'. I do see your point that there is a strong overlap with 'protagonist' in there, and there are indeed some very famous protagonists who would fall under that definition.

  Consider, for example, Sherlock Holmes. When you start reading a Sherlock Holmes story, you know he's going to solve the mystery, win the case, and the rest will continue in more or less the status quo. But Holmes is not *quite* a Gary Stu character, because he often not only risks failure, but often *fails*. He almost never loses the war, but he will sometimes lose battles along the way - sometimes come to an erroneous conclusion and have to frantically work to recover from the error (and, in one or two stories, even Holmes did fail to solve the mystery correctly).

  Sherlock Holmes can take one look at a person and describe his profession and what he did that morning. A Gary Stu version would take one look at a person and describe the mystery that he was presenting and its solution; and in there we have the difference between a mere protagonist and the far less interesting Gary Stu version.

  Which isn't to say that you don't have a good point... the term is perhaps being used too broadly, and it is reasonable to suggest that [that phrase be tabooed](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words) in order to better understand precisely what the problem is with a given story.

    I mostly agree with your definition, and came up with a [similar one](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8x7f94/against_mary_sue/e21s4av/) independently. This seems to be a good direction to converge towards.

  I think part of the problem we're running into is that we've expanded a term that was invented to describe a trend in fanfiction to use in general fiction.

  In fanfiction, the setting that is being used already has a distinct fabric to it, a set of relationships between people and other people, between people and things, between people and the power they have, etc. Original characters that are inserted into these settings disrupt these relationships somewhat by their existence, if they are relevant at all. 

  The classic example of Mary Sue bent the fabric of the existing setting around her like a black hole, damaging the existing setting and characterization by their new relationships to her. Dangerous enemies were easily overcome, authority figures cede authority, etc.

  I disagree strongly, and fully intend to continue using the term, not just despite it being "toxic", but because of it. almost everything "toxic" in the world exists for a reason. "Mary Sue" is useful both as a categorical criticism to identify a common kit of writing failures to an author, and as a derogatory term writers fear being applied to their own creations. I expect the use as a categorical criticism of a work will be a common position, and thus vigorously defended by those probably better suited to do so than I, so I will leave it to them.

  I will, however, attempt a defense of my intent to explicitly continue the use of a phrase with the specific purpose to cause harm to the feelings of others, as I suspect that position may be rarer and thus my contribution here will not be repetitive. I feel that having hurtful language which is extremely specific in who it targets to be an extremely useful component of enforcing soft standards.

  Take the US military, for example. There is an extremely common bit of jargon which specifically refers to someone who goes to the doctor too often and for minor things, and misses a great deal of work because of it. this not only is not against the rules to do, but making any sort of rules limiting a person's access to medical attention would be illegal. thus, the denigration of those specific people is important to keeping soldiers productive, and the ability to wield a word which is meant to specifically hurt the people who have that negative behavior is amazingly powerful. with the inclusion of this word in common parlance, anyone who has this habit will continuously be reminded and shamed for it, until they either stop or are removed from the community one way or another.

  as it is useful for the military, so too is it useful here. having a term in common parlance which offends and hurts the feelings of the type of author who would write a Mary Sue in the first place is one of the circles of protection in place which shelters our community from those authors and their stories. a writer who fears that they may be writing a Mary Sue has two options: either they will take steps to ensure that they are not to varying degrees of success and will grow as a writer regardless, or they will complain about the term, hopefully be ignored, and eventually will leave. in either case this community benefits, and I might go so far as to suggest that the fear of writing a Mary Sue itself may be one of the most potent protections against doing so. the refusal to change one's self and the demand that the community change instead should be a sufficient red flag that we should ignore that person.

  while there may indeed be a good deal of subjectivity to the label of Mary Sue, that subjectivity becomes a valuable trait when it is used as something to avoid. in trying to avoid something which is subjective, the writer must take pains to try to see his work from as broad a perspective as he is able to imagine. avoiding the label takes work. and should an author fail, and receive this particularly painful criticism? at least in this specific community, they are more likely than not to also receive a list of reasons for it. thus the author is given the opportunity to see which specifics triggered the reaction, and how frequently the same criticism comes up. being able to sort through criticism and use it to better yourself is also a vital skill for a writer (or anyone, really).

  I don't really know if I have made my point, but I do feel like I have probably rambled enough. please let me know if I have made any glaring errors, for I too benefit from criticism.
