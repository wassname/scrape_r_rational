  As a patreon reader, Delve has me in this weird limbo of satisfying, yet frustrating. Interesting, yet mundane. I can't make heads or tails of what I actually think, but I will continue being a supporter so I can see where this is headed.

    I find myself subscribing and then canceling every other month. I really like the series but it's just so slow lately.

    To me the frustration comes from not being able to read it in whole books rather than chapters piecemeal
    ```

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      Indeed. I think Delve would be much better paced as whole books. 

      (And there needed to be a bigger end-of-book-one climax before the trapped in a cave arc.)

      I think you might be on to something. I have followed several fictions on RR that feel choppy and oddly paced when read chapter by chapter. However, when I read the backlog I had a grand time and couldn't put it down.

  For some reason it’s funny to see Rain worried about mind reading. I really doubt he knows the finer points of uranium refinement and all the required processing to make nuclear weapons. Besides that, is there really dangerous information he could possibly have that wouldn’t inevitably be figured out from the other information he plans to introduce anyway?

  It’s wild how useful that ring is. I forgot why Tallheart made him it; I wonder if he’ll ever get a better one.

    He doesn't need to know the finer points of uranium refining, that's what Tallheart's filters are for.  As for going from pure U235 to a bomb, it doesn't sound *that* hard if you aren't picky about the yield.
    ```

      ```
      >that's what Tallheart's filters are for.

      I wouldn’t necessarily assume that’s within his capabilities though, since isotopes are chemically equivalent.
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        As far as I can tell, his materials filter based on what they are made of (eg. iron-with-a-bit-of-impurities), and it would be difficult (but not impossible) to make a filter for U235 but not U238.  The most probable first step would be the density-ordering skill he used to sort everything into layers.
        ```

    - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
      ```
      In a world where they don't understand zero, there's no imaginable way they have the mathematical capabilites to create a nuclear bomb. A dirty bomb, sure, maybe.  

      But who is to say they even have uranium in this world?  And are we to believe teenager Rain somehow knows how to make a nuclear bomb? Do they even have gunpowder in this world? How would they manage to create not only the explosives needed to create a critical mass of uranium, but the proper shape, quantity, enclosure, etc. Not to mention the electronics necessary in a world with no fucking electricity.
      ```

      - u/gramineous:
        ```
        Eh, clarity-enhanced memory and a wikipedia-binge on the topic sometime in his past could be a chunk of knowledge. And fucking up the process of making a nuclear bomb is both more likely and still significantly destructive if there's some amount of base knowledge.
        ```

        - u/Slyvena:
          ```
          Spot on. I imagine Gold-Plate Clarity Memories essentially become eidetic, impossible to forget anything. Even by Silver Plate stage I imagine Rain is going to retain at least 90% of any information he encounters.
          ```

  ```
  This weeks Patreon chapter was a slow one, but one of my favourites. Spoilers are quite minor. 

  >!It felt like Rain was giving my criticism of far far too many litRPG systems in general. The lack of synergistic party builds, and Rain took it further by talking about sending specialist teams like fire mages against an ice dungeon.!<

    ```
    FYI I personally enjoy these discussions on patreon chapters here so please continue and don’t mind the naysayers.
    ```

      ```
      Same here... And it was a great chapter this week :)
      ```

  - u/EsquilaxM:
    ```
    I wonder how well that would work, considering ambient mana.

    But yes agreed loved this week's patreon chapter
    ```
