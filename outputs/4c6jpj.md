  >The stranger seized the threads, pulled them forward, sheared them to their essence. HRCN. Then he rearranged them, made them dance. CHRN. Then fleshed them out. ACHERON. The river that formed the boundary of Hell. Sohu felt the storm darken, become deathly hot. Somehow the transmutation was affecting reality.

  I'm getting vibes of [Anglophysics](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/03/the-study-of-anglophysics/) from this.

  Last time we saw Sohu, it was Oct 3, now it is the 10th.  Both are Wednesdays.

    Agreed that it feels Anglophysicsy.

      For some reason this line made me laugh.

  The duel:

   - SA’AR

  Hebrew for "storm", it was drawn from the hurricane by Thamiel.

   - TEMPESTAS

  Latin for "season, weather; bad weather; storm, tempest" as well as the ancient Roman goddess of the same portfolio, it was translated from SA'AR by Thamiel.

   - HURRICANE

  English word.  It was translated from TEMPESTAS by Thamiel.

   - **HRCN**

  Transitional state.  Thamiel stripped the vowels (and one R) from HURRICANE to create it.

   - **CHRN**

  Transitional state.  Thamiel rearranged HRCN to create it.

   - A**CH**E**R**O**N**

  The river at the boundary of hell.  Thamiel added vowels to create it.

   - **CH**AI AA**R**O**N**

  "Life" and "Aaron" (the historical figure).  Uriel changed the meaning without rearranging any consonants.

   - **CH**AO**S** **R**UI**N** 

  Thamiel brought an "s" from the wind, and didn't otherwise change the consonants.  Note that the text presented this in the opposite order (Ruin, Chaos) despite Thamiel not rearranging the letters, which is not a coincidence.

   - **M**A**CH**I**N**E **R**A**Z**

  "Machine" and "secrets".  I don't know if it is "Machine Raz" or else "Raz Machine".  Uriel brought an "M" from the water, and hardened the "S" into a "Z".  

   - **N**A**C**O**M** **R**A**SH**A 

  "Punishment" and "Wicked", again presented backwards in the text.  Thamiel softened the "Z" back into an "S" and reorganized many letters.  

   - **M**E**R**EA + ?**SH**?

  "Friend".  The "N" and "C" fell out of their own accord when Thamiel pointed at them.

   - **S**O**H**U

  The "M" and "R" fell out when Thamiel pointed to them.

  > “NO. YOU CAN LEARN A LOT OF THINGS FROM STARTING A WAR. EIGHTY YEARS AGO SOME PEOPLE STARTED A WAR AND THEY ENDED UP LEARNING THE SECRETS OF THE ATOM. IT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE.”

  But it's 1990? So what war in 1910 he talking about?
  ```

  - u/ScottAlexander:
    ```
    It was a mistake. Corrected.
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      Oh, there's GOT to be a way to have Uriel explain how WWI and WWII are the same war.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Some mundane historians already think this.
        ```

- u/Atilme:
  ```
  I really wanna see Sohu teach Uriel how to fight with reality words better. That's pretty awesome.
  ```
