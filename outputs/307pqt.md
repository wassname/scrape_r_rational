## [D] [MK] You are Max from Life is strange and Nathan's father has just texted you his legal threat. You have decided that this is too much and he and Nathan need to be removed. How do you destroy the Prescott family?

The tornado will not happen.

You can break as many laws as you like so long as you are not caught. If you are constraining yourself with morality you are doing it wrong.

  So- the asymmetry in Max's ability is that anything in her possession moves in time with her. Ultra gruesome method- arrange to meet Nathan and Father in undisclosed location, shoot them, remove vital organ, rewind time. Organs in your possession do not remain with their owners, Nathan and his Dad fall over dead of apparent heart existence failure.

  Max also seems to not move in space when she time travels, and nothing in her possesion does, either. This gives her the effective ability to teleport on a moment by moment basis to anywhere she can reach within five minutes. If she were driving a car, she could hit and run, and effectively teleport the car the distance it could drive in 5 minutes every second.

  Conclusion: Max's ability is super easy to munchkin. :P
