## Munchkinry in self-insert/OC fanfiction?

### Post:

Hello, I am looking for self inserts that dabbles in munchkinry. What is munchkinry? Munchkinry refers  to exposing and/or abusing loopholes in a given set of rules, in creative and interesting ways. Since self-inserts presumably have omniscient knowledge of the universe they are self inserting in they have a higher chance to munchkin themselves to a greater power/advantage.

For example, in [With this Ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/), a DC comics self insert, the SI revolutionizes lantern combat tactics with his orange power ring by creating constructs outside the scope of normal green lanterns.

In [Sleight advantage](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sleight-advantage-naruto-reincarnation-si.37698/), a naruto self insert, due to the disadvantage of low chakra coils the SI specializes his repertoire in misdirection. With his past knowledge he finds success with this niche specialization.

Most self inserts I read start out as the self-insert is already overpowered/godlike which completely ruins the fun. I would also like to avoid recs that has wish fufillment, harems, mindless fix-it arcs, trolling canon characters, and crack. Thank you.

  I'm a big fan of With this Ring.  The SI isn't content to just be the best lantern in the DC Comics universe he finds himself in, but is undertaking a technological and magic-based revolution to bring Earth up to the level of the other galactic empires.

  And conquer death itself, for everyone, everywhere.

  The author (Mr Zoat) is amazing as well.  He puts out 1K words a day, every day, and has been doing it for years.  It is crazy and awesome.

    I really enjoyed the start of WTR, but I eventually dropped it, for several reasons:

    First, I couldn't stand Zoat's special snowflake writing style (capitalized species names, including "Ivy" and "Tiger"; no dialogue tags even if it made things confusing; random new punctuation; plot-significant text in invisitext; etc) 

    Second, the Renegade sections were infuriating. He was a smug, poorly-behaved Mary Sue who always succeeded at everything and never got called out on his bad behavior. Then he finally did and got really interesting... Only for all of that character development to be thrown away and status quo restored. 

    Finally, the story suffers from the normal problem of poorly-written ratfic: the protagonist is the only one allowed to be rational or munchinly. All the bad/implausible/OOC decisions that (eg) the Justice League make in canon Young Justice are still there, but Paul gets to ride in and save the day. No one commercialized schizotech before this, including Lex Luthor, who is canonically a billionaire genius inventor.

    I absolutely grant, however, that the premise is fascinating and a lot of the story is very engaging.

      The god-speech is annoying (doubly so on mobile), but usually only when New Gods are around.

      > Second, the Renegade sections were infuriating. He was a smug, poorly-behaved Mary Sue who always succeeded at everything and never got called out on his bad behavior.

      I strongly disliked the Renegade sections, and though he was an asshole with no redeeming qualities.

      And then we got the Renegade story arc [Stars, Crossed, part 1](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/page-34#post-6150225), which was one of the best story arcs in the entire series.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but it was epic and awesome.

      And again, not to spoil anything, but later on (after the above), Renegade does get to experience some severe consequences for his previous actions and arrogance.

      I think that was a desire to not change the story universe much.  The whole setting doesn't make much sense.  They have had AI for decades, nanotechnology, genetic technology, unlimited power generation, etc., yet the world doesn't look much different than ours (baseline humans walking around, driving to work, and so on).  There's definitely an adapt-or-die thing going on with the villians, and survivors like Lex are stepping up their game.

        Yep, I remember that. He did a good job with it. It was, as you say, a great arc.


        > I think that was a desire to not change the story universe much. 

        Sure. But when that's what you want, you've got a few options:

        1. Write it as a parody
        2. Add something that explains why people are being oblivious 
        3. Be a bad and/or lazy writer

        Zoat chose option #3. He could have taken #2 -- maybe there's an alien threat hanging over humanity, where the galactic powers have identified Earth's schizotech and supers as a potential threat. There's multiple factions -- one wants to nuke the place from orbit because it's the only way to be sure. Another wants to ally with humans in order to systematize and industrialize all of it. Another feels that humanity is too young and violent a culture to be in control of such powers and wants to take it all away and put us into the civilization-level equivalent of Child Protective Services. Yet another has brokered a deal with all sides that keeps everything stable; for now, Earth is left alone to do its own thing as long as they don't develop their tech too quickly, leave the solar system, or communicate with other races.  There is an actual group whose job it is to enforce the agreement; it consists of the Justice League, various intergovernmental bodies, and representatives from various alien species. They quash schizotech wherever they can and prevent it from going to market -- indeed, Wayne Enterprises has an entire department whose sole purpose is to buy up new companies or inventions that walk too close to the line of allowable tech, then sit on them. (Bonus: This nicely answers the question, "Where does [Batman] get all those wonderful toys?")

        There. All the issues wrapped up in a way that can sit quietly in the background most of the time, and offers lots of new plot threads and an entire metaarc for when you want them. And it took me more time to type it up than to think of it; if I actually put some time in, I could probably find a better answer.

        Zoat was lazy and WTR, although very engaging, is fundamentally poorly written.

            That's good to hear, but it's still lazy. It's not hard to hint at 
            the existence of behind-the-scenes reasons so that the reader knows they are there but won't be explained until the time comes. Here's a trivial example, that could be seriously improved if I put more than two seconds thought in:

            "Sir," I said, "why are you letting this stand?! Nabu refuses to let Mr Zatara take off the Helmet of Fate. That is kidnapping, forced confinement, and *slavery*. Mr Zatara is your friend; you can't possibly be okay with this."

            The Bat-glare had broken plenty of criminals without Batman needing to lay a finger on them, and was arguably one of the reasons he was a leader in an organization comprised of superhumans. Ordinarily I wouldn't have dared be so accusatory, but right now I was buoyed up by outrage. And, strangely, the wattage on the glare was lower than usual. Lower than expected, too, given the nature of the conversation.

            "The League polices its own," Batman said after a few seconds. "This is not an issue for the team."

            "But, sir...!"

            "No." The glare was back to full strength and the finality in his voice closed my mouth without me intending it. I couldn't match his gaze but every line of my body shouted rebellion and I was happy to let him read it.

            "Paul," he said warningly. "Do not pursue this."

            "Is that an order, sir? Because I am bound to obey your orders and faithfully serve the League for another two hundred and thirteen days." I forced myself to meet his eyes for the last words, making my intent clear.

            Batman...hesitated? What???

            "We have spoken to Nabu about the issue," he said at last. "For now, he is unpersuadable. The League *must* not alienate someone of Doctor Fate's credentials at this time. We will continue to discuss the issue with him and try to find compromise. Until you are told otherwise, you are not to approach Fate about this issue, nor are you to make any attempt to remove the Helmet by force. Do you fully understand these orders?"

            I forced myself not to react to the planet-sized loopholes that Batman had very clearly left open for me. Even here, in the privacy of the Hall, there could be watchers.

            "Yes, sir," I said, forcing myself to sound resentful. "I understand and will comply."

            "Good. Dismissed."
            ```

            - u/ansible:
              ```
              I can't disagree with you that there were not hints (that I am aware of) for why are things are the way they are earlier in the story.  

              BTW, to see how things worked out with Nabu and the Zataras in canon, check this out:

              But it may be unrealistic. A competent and powerful antagonist can't be expected to leave clues ([Evil Overlord list](http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html) #11). A force that has been able to invisibly influence billions of people over thousands of years will not necessarily be noticed in the first five minutes. Frankly, the fact that the protagonist has made such a discovery in just a year and a half is already pretty impressive.

              Bear in mind that this is all written in first-person present tense. If the SI doesn't see something, the readers don't see it either. Which is great for immersion, not so great for the author to drop clues that only the readers will understand. Except, of course, in the accompanying discussion threads, which do indeed contain many answers and spoilers.

              (Also, there are Watsonian reasons why the SI didn't approach Batman about dealing with Nabu, primarily his concern that Nabu would find out and retaliate.)
              ```

                ```
                > But it may be unrealistic.

                I have yet to find a scenario where I could not slip some hint of some kind into the first part of the story. It doesn't have to be in the first ten pages, but the first 20,000 words is not a big ask. If nothing else, just have the SI say to himself "Okay, I refuse to believe that everyone in the world is this stupid. Something must be going on, so let me ask around and see if I can get some hints." Boom, you've given nothing away but you've lampshaded the issue for the audience so that they know you aren't just being a bad writer. Problem solved.

                If you don't like that idea, set a clock for fine minutes and actually try to come up with something that you do like. I suspect you will succeed.

                As to not approaching Batman: Yes, I know. I did say "This could be substantially improved if I actually thought about it." As one trivial example, Diana (Wonder Woman) might be a better choice. She is something like a demigoddess of Truth. She generally does not lie and I'm not sure if she's supposed to be capable of it. Go to her and say, "Sir, [because Zoat insists on calling both men and women 'sir'] there is some information I feel that I really need, but it would be exceptionally bad if the wrong person heard that I was asking. If you are comfortable keeping this conversation a secret from absolutely everyone, including the League, then I would like to ask you some things. If you are not comfortable with it, I won't ask, and I hope you will trust me enough to not press me on the issue."

                Or, if you still think that's still too risky, then spend five minutes thinking about how to get the info. Maybe recruit M'gann (strongest telepath around), and have her do memory surgery on a consenting interlocutor? Maybe call up Etrigan -- he's a very old demon and has information about the magical world, so he might well have info on Fate, but Fate is unlikely to voluntarily interact with a random demon.

                The point is that Paul doesn't even try, he just snags John Constantine and goes off to invent a Fate-stopping ritual from now or less whole cloth.

                  He was even more upset with Diana than everyone else, because yes she's a goddess of truth, and yet she agreed to lie to the world about what happened to Mister Zatara so that Nabu could join the League. Because the world wouldn't have let them get away with it if they knew the truth. 

                  Recruiting M'gann would be an exceptionally bad idea. She's the hub of their team's telepathic network, and is still new to the idea of mental privacy. Nor would she be in the habit of hiding anything from her uncle. She *would* leak.

                    Fair enough. It's been years since I read WTR and I forgot those faces.

                    Regardless, hopefully you take my point. There are plenty of things that Paul could have done, none of which he did, and the one he did do seemed weirdly out of character.

      >capitalized species names

      Those have been dropped lately. As for the dialogue thing, well, he's pretty responsive to reader feedback, so when a chapter legitimately confuses a bunch of people, there's a reasonable chance he can be persuaded to adjust it. And the new punctuation and invisitext are explained in the FAQ (FAQ rule #1: Don't talk about the FAQ; FAQ Rule #2: Don't read the FAQ). Yeah, invisitext can be annoying, especially on mobile, but for me, it also adds to the expressiveness of the story.

      >All the bad/implausible/OOC decisions that (eg) the Justice League make in canon Young Justice are still there,

      I think you've identified the root cause right here. Mr Zoat attempts to largely preserve canon. The only way that canon events are supposed to change is if his SI changes something.

      But as u/Flashbunny mentioned, there is actually an in-story reason for the weird attitude to schizotech. It's just that the SI wasn't going to stumble across it in his first five minutes, or even his first year. As it is, it's been a year and a half in-story, which is still pretty fast for discovering something like that. Probably because >!he's been disrupting the status quo and thus gained the personal attention of the entity responsible.!<

      > Then he finally did and got really interesting... Only for all of that character development to be thrown away and status quo restored.

      I'm not sure what you're referring to here. >!He hasn't really been the same since his personal visit from Darkseid. How much of that is because of Darkseid, and how much is because he's trying to be a good father to Lynne, mentor to Sunset Shimmer, etc, is hard to say, but he's definitely softened from where he used to be.!<
      ```

  - u/Geminii27:
    ```
    Plus all the versions of the character (although mostly the Renegade, from what I can see) don't put their faith purely in their power ring, but also stock up on holdouts. Not to mention their tendency to appropriate and replicate any schizo-technology they can lay their hands on - and in a DC continuity, that's a *lot*. And perhaps more interesting, their similar tendency to build and maintain personal networks amongst both the empowered and the mundane. That last one, possibly more than anything else, provides massive force-multiplication and autonomy for the SI's drive to uplift Earth.

  Worth  the candle has both of those things. The main character doesn't know all of the rules though, because >!they are based on a custom rule set designed by his local world alter ego.!<

  IDK if you'd call the character's group a harem or not. It's kind of a deconstruction of the harem trope where  >!everyone recognizes a bad dynamic, and most of them end up pairing up with different characters.!<

  I read Sleight Advantage after reading this post, it’s quite good but it looks to me like it last updated almost a year ago. So unless the rest of the chapters are hiding somewhere, reading it might not be wise
