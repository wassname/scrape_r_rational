  Wow, this has got to be the most manipulative dialogue I've ever read where the manipulator isn't being dishonest in the slightest. I mean Sakura comes into the conversation terrified of Orochimaru because 1. He's a sociopath who has no compunction about experimenting on innocents, and 2. He's a traitor who not only went against his village (arguable morality) but kidnapped and experimented on his own teammates husband (super evil)

  In their conversation Sakura brings up these points, and Orochimaru actually affirms them, and makes it very clear to Sakura exactly what kind of person he is, but while he is doing that he's masterfully misdirecting and topic changing to always make Sakura feel like he's "winning" the argument. Like the issue with Tsunade's husband, what does Orochimaru actually tell Sakura? That he had a totally good reason for kidnapping him, and that he's not actually dead, just horribly experimented on. But the way this is presented skips over the bad parts, and focuses on the reason for kidnapping him, and of course congratulating Sakura for figuring out that reason (with some genjutsu positive reinforcement for good measure)

  Feels like this will be one of those times where the readers like a villain a little too much. A fantastic characterization of Orochimaru though, definitely less likely to think of him as "the Enemy" from now on, it doesn't seem like has much to gain from manipulating the whole world.

    I'll take that as high praise, thank you!

    Yep, this version of Orochimaru is basically the living embodiment of the phrase "reason is a slave of the passions", which is of course a big theme of the story. Naruto's key frustration is that people never want to listen to logic (and by extension, they don't want to listen to \*him\*) because they simply don't feel an emotional impulse to do so. I've tried to highlight this conflict throughout the story:

    >“Haku had the ability to *teleport*. Instant travel and communication, and he used it to *kill people*. He could have helped to save the world…”  
    >  
    >“But he didn’t want to save the world,” Sasuke pointed out. “He wanted to do  whatever his master told him to, and Zabuza wanted to take over the Land  of Water.”

    (Fun fact: I actually based that Sasuke quote on an, uhm, [slightly less serious comic](https://i.imgur.com/YKaqaTH.jpg))

    Oro takes this to a whole other level by literally being able to control people's emotions - justified, I think, by the fact that he was introduced in canon by his ability to paralyse people with the fear of death. Plus he could manipulate people through the curse mark. I always thought that was much more interesting than his ability to, well, summon snakes a lot <\_<

    More realistically, though, I've noticed that the most powerful kind of persuasion relies not on countering someone's arguments but simply avoiding them entirely to construct a narrative that suits you. If you tell someone that they're wrong about X, it encourages them to argue with you. However, if you say "what I love about X is that they're always so honest about how evil they are" and then quickly move on, well... there's a good chance that the other person will have "X is evil" recorded in the back of their mind without even realizing that they've been persuaded of something.

  I actually can't wait for Naruto to meet this version of Orochimaru. They're basically the same character - if Naruto didn't have the overarching goal of defeating The Enemy to define his life (and was a lot more willing to experiment on innocent people) he would basically just be a younger version of the Snake Sannin. All of the work Naruto has done in order to make his friends see the world more like him is, unbeknownst to him, just making it easier for them see the world like Orochimaru.

  If Sasuke switches sides in this story I won't even blame him. Naruto essentially spent their entire friendship priming the other boy for indoctrination by the Snake Sannin's cult.

    Honestly, aside from their shared dislike and distrust of the Konoha leadership they have basically nothing in common. Orochimaru seems entirely driven by personal curiosity, whereas Naruto, aside from his current major goal of defeating "The Enemy", is always driven by his desire to help people, and to make the world a better place. Naruto would look at Orochimaru experimenting on innocents, and hoarding his knowledge to himself, not bothering to use his knowledge to actually help people, and be disgusted. 

    Sasuke meanwhile wouldn't be interested in Orochimaru at all, and vise-versa. Orochimaru doesn't seem to have all that much interest in personal power, so researching with Orochimaru wouldn't help Sasuke become much stronger, and Sasuke wouldn't make a great researcher, so Orochimaru has no reason to take him under his wing, as he did in canon.

      Fair points. As I said in my first comment, I do agree that the main differences between Naruto and Orochimaru are their different core goals and Naruto's actual empathy. I'm basing my comparison mostly on how they have the same approach to growing stronger (experimentation, theorizing on how to recreate the secret techniques of clans, curiosity etc... they both have  a talent for invention that shocks and surprises at least Sakura) and they way they both see the 'ordinary', 'accepted' parts of the setting clearly (or at least more like the audience). The sentiments Orochimaru expresses in this chapter are exactly the things Naruto has spent the past arc or two struggling with - the violence and amorality inherent in the system. Orochimaru just has none of the ethical or moral limits of Naruto - while Naruto looks at the system and seems to get honestly confused/disgusted at how intelligent, rational beings with magical chakra powers ended up with the Ninja System, Orochimaru instead seems confused as to why Ninja take offence at his immoral actions when they deem so many other evil things acceptable. We've even seen this kind of thing in Naruto (to a much lesser extent) when the other Konoha ninja got mad at him after he beat Lee. Just like Orochimaru, Naruto sometimes can't understand why people take offence at his own less moral/nice actions when the world has so much more evil in it they don't seem to take offence at. 
      In this fic Kurama even admits he helps Naruto because its 'refreshing' to meet a human who hates Ninja as much he does. At this point I think its clear that Naruto is meant to have more in common (philosophically, not ethically) with the villains of the setting. 

      And I think this is most clear with the Snake - both Naruto and Orochimaru seem to see and approach the setting the same way. They're both scientists, they both see the violence of the system clearly, etc... It's just that Orochimaru doesn't have empathy and Naruto does. They differ in their core goals - they're both 'scientists', but Naruto wants to help people and Orochimaru only cares about personal power/enlightenment. Orochimaru is like a Dark Mirror of Naruto - the villain he would be most like if he was evil. I think Sakura is eventually going to notice some similarities between her relationship with Naruto and her relationship with this seemingly more relaxed, casual, almost 'nice' version of Orochimaru.

      As for the Sasuke point - I think its more that Naruto has spent the entire fic proving that real power and understanding can be found by going against the Village. The main group even talks about how the 'study sessions' Naruto organized between all the genin goes against so many Village rules that they found it more appealing to literally collude with enemy Sand genin than be exposed. By the standards of the Village the entire main group could already be considered, to some degree, traitors. 
      Orochimaru's entire argument in canon was that "only under me will you be able to grow strong, not with the Village". A big part of Orochimaru's argument in this chapter is "yes I'm a traitor but being a traitor isn't that bad and the Village isn't exactly squeaky clean either" and Naruto has spent weeks priming his friends to accept both of those ideas (or at least to accept that idea that the rules of the Village do limit/slow their growth). 

      And Orochimaru really does seem interested in the Sharingan. And he was one now - assuming he knows that the Sharingan takes more chakra to power if you're not an Uchiha, soon he's going to be interested in getting his hands on a live Uchiha specimen to study so that he can figure out exactly why that is. Meanwhile Naruto has spent the entire fic proving to Sasuke that this is a world where knowledge is power; Orochimaru has a lot of knowledge. The Snake has incentive to try and recruit and/or capture Sasuke - Sasuke has incentive to go with him and try to steal his secrets/reverse engineer his techniques. 
      I'm not saying it definitely will happen. I'm just saying it could easily make sense in the context of this fic.

  Ooh I liked this. I liked this *a lot*. An Orochimaru who has already won, in a sense. I m wondering how this is going to develop. Great chapter as always

      United vs Liverpool. 

      I ate this chapter up. This characterization of Orochimaru is hilariously touch and go, at one moment in agreeing with him, and at another he passes off Kakashi’s eye(and death) as inevitable for all his enemies. Sakura is in a horrible spot. Thanks for writing this chapter!

  I always love reading peoples’ takes on Oro. Enjoyed the chapter (as always)

  I haven't watched Naruto but I like what I've seen about this fic. Any tips for reading it without watching the source material?
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:

    My original beta reader never watched Naruto and he did not have too much trouble, so honestly you should be able to dive right in. There's a couple japanese words like kunai (throwing dagger) and a few suffixes (-sama= master, -san = sir, -kun and -chan are diminutives) but that's pretty minor stuff and mostly should be clear from context.

    Just remember that it's a world in which almost all major characters are ninjas, and that ninjas all have their own magical abilities. For the rest it's not too different from a regular fantasy setting. Translate "chakra" as "mana points" in your head and you won't be too far off. :P

    Only thing I can really see being an issue is that there are a lot of different characters and techniques to keep track of. Honestly I should probably rewrite chapter one to remove unnecessary cameos, since most of those characters don't show up again until chapter 20 or so. Same with terms like "sharingan" - a word like that might be dropped now and then, but it'll be explained as soon as it's relevant to the plot, so if you don't know what something means just keep reading and it'll become clear soon enough.

    That said, if you do encounter problems while reading, please do let me know so I can take that into account for anyone else who has the same issue. :)

    Ahh, now I want to rewrite the first chapters again. I get that niggling feeling every time someone mentions the difference in quality, but I figure it's probably better to just keep writing new chapters and not get distracted.

    I'm glad to see you mention Kurama as one of your favourite characters! I really like the ol' fox too, but for some reason he rarely gets mentioned in reviews. I was worried that I might have made Sasuke too over-the-top (especially early on), but he definitely has a special place in my heart as well. I find ambiguously moral characters much more interesting than designated villains, most of the time. Though I do love Sakura too - her POV is much easier to write and make relatable than someone like Sasuke, I feel.

    I get what you're saying about killing characters too easily, I think. I worry that it causes [darkness induced audience apathy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarknessInducedAudienceApathy). Although, Kakashi did go through multiple steps of losing fights, being beaten down etc. Did his final defeat bother you as well?

    I don't think removing souls from Naruto detracts from the story, TBH. Literally none of the main characters ever mention religion in canon - in NTBS, they at least occasionally mention the spirits or the Sage, but in canon it just doesn't play a role. Hidan even calls the Leaf a bunch of filthy atheists, and Kakazu points out that that's not quite true as they do believe in the "will of fire", but that's it. The "soul" thing only comes up when somebody is about to transfer one or rip it out of someone.

    Anyway, thanks for the review! I'm impressed you stuck around despite not liking the first ten chapters. I could have sworn I've seen you comment on this fic before though - did you give up on the fix earlier only to give it another try recently or something?
