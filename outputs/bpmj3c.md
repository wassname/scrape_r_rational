    > Masego is going to be saved by the power of love.

    This feels way too tragic for that to me, I'm guessing we're gonna see death flags start popping up soon instead.
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      If someone *doesn't* dies I'd be surprised. There was way too many flags in this chapter.
      ```

      - u/JesradSeraph:
        ```
        Roland only getting named at the last minute while departing decisively from his companions’ opinions ?

        Laurence lying haughtily about her encounter with Neshamah followed by the pleading endorsement by Tariq - she will be exposed at the worst moment to make her vulnerable ?
        ```

      - u/SkoomaDentist:
        ```
        I now want to find web fiction that intentionally averts death flags and other ”rules by audience” (X _ must_ die because of sign Y). Even better if it actively goes out of its way to spite peoples’ forum theories.
        ```

    ```
    > Cat will be an exception only if she actually manages to achieve something long term - like boxing up the Dead King or achieving the Liesse Accords. Otherwise she goes next to all the other entertaining people who massacred thousands for no reason.

    What are you talking about, she already saved thousands of people! She stopped Akua—though she was unable to save Liesse itself she did manage to stop the superweapon from tearing up the rest of Callow and Calernia, she prevented William from mind-controlling an entire city, she stopped a Fae invasion into Calernia, *hell* she saved an entire race from being genocided by the Dwarves!

    You could even say she did what William could not and liberated her homeland from occupation by the Dread Empire with a lot less bloodshed and deaths than he would have caused, as well as stop his foolish doomed rebellion in its tracks—though of course this is muddled seeing as she was responsible for that in the first place.

    Sure the peace in Callow is now solely maintained through her as a person and not through any institutions that will survive beyond her death, and if she were to die now then yeah Callow will probably return to being a place of slaughter and foreign occupation, but let's not claim that everything she did up until now was worthless. She saved a *ton* of people already.
    ```

    - u/CFCrispyBacon:
      ```
      And most of the reason Callow hasn't transitioned to a more stable route of power transfer is because Cat's been too damn busy keeping the wheels on the cart to do all that much steering.  She's actively looking for the moment to give up power now, so it can't be that far away.
      ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    Alternate theory, Saint realizes that Archer, as his loved one, will be the one to kill him, as per story logic.
    ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    More likely, Masego is going to die, being killed by Saint or Archer, and then Tariq is going to be forced to bring him back with his Resurrection abilities once it's known that Masego is the only one (thanks to his eyes and magical understanding) who can truly understand the weaknesses and flaws of the Dead King.

    Or, you know, so Cat doesn't obliterate Saint.  Either or.
    ```

- u/vimefer:
  ```
  > “- he had me thrown off a balcony by gargoyles after declaring that was the last we’d see of me,” the Rogue Sorcerer said

  > “He loudly lamented your lack of foresight,” he told me. “In some detail.”

  And that is why I love this story, and why Kairos is my favorite character ! Such a reliable traitor, trustable in his treachery ! Obviously he'll get away with it, even, because he's doing all the wrong things perfectly right.
  ```

- u/russxbox:
  ```
  I thought the build up of Cat internally trying to decide whether to reveal her plan was more about the Liesse Accords. It took me a couple of paragraphs after Archer popped up to realize that was all she was going to reveal in response to RS's question, and then I had to reread to really enjoy the part with Archer in it. 

  Also, Saint of Swords is coming around on Cat, even if she has to be dragged into the new opinion by Pilgrim and Rogue Sorcerer. It's going to be real painful when Cat has to choose between upholding the image of herself as a Noble Villain Dedicated to the Preservation of Life that she's built up and getting everything she wants. Not sure if she'll have to trade the few steps she's taken to being trusted enough to present the Accords in good faith for Masego, Black, or some other thing. I'm not sure whether she'll make the trade when the chance comes, either. Is there anything so valuable to her that she wouldn't give it up for a better chance at getting signatories to the Accords?
  ```

- u/PastafarianGames:
  ```
  Hot take: Saint is completely right that Cat is playing them and has basically a con running. (We may or may not know what the con is yet.) And Saint can tell!

  Indrani, on the other hand, has no cards up her sleeves. And Saint can tell. And you know what? Saint is 100% fine with this part of the plan, is 100% fine with Archer, not just because it's a Heroic story, not just because d'awww, but because Indrani isn't playing a con, and Saint can work with that.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Indrani played at being a hero once, as well. Or, something other than a villain at the very least. They're both unchained monsters.
    ```

    - u/TrebarTilonai:
      ```
      Yeah. Archer was originally part of William's band, wasn't she?
      ```

      - u/Amagineer:
        ```
        Nope. William's band was The Lone Swordsman (William), The Bard (Almorava), The Hunter (~~John~~ Tinkles), The Thief (Vivienne), and a (junior?) member of The Watch (Breagach)

        I think at some point The Bumbling Conjurer was also involved with Willy.

        Archer came to collect Hunter from Cat's custody after Ranger found out he was doing verboten Herostuff
        ```

        - u/TrebarTilonai:
          ```
          Ah right, thank you. It was Viv who was in William's band; I must have gotten that crossed with Archer picking up Tinkles.
          ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    It's easy to be 100% OK with something when you know they have absolutely no intent or desire to bring you or yours any harm.

    As far as Saint is concerned, Archer is absolutely zero threat in this case.  She wouldn't even betray Saint, as doing so would drastically lessen her chances of saving Zeze.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Sure, but to be OK with something due to its lack of potential harm to you requires that you believe it to not have potential harm to you.

      Saint knows that Cat is planning her death. Saint knows that Archer is not planning her death. Archer's statement places the current venture solidly in the latter's court, so it's not a threat.

      So basically I take this as evidence that Saint's antipathy towards Cat isn't stupidity or lowercase-e evilness; it's ... wisdom, really. Sense Motive.
      ```

- u/themousehunter:
  ```
  I miss having Masego as a character interacting with Cat and Archer. I have hope for the power of love to bring him back! Interesting that Saint didn't comment on Archer's reveal -- maybe realizing the sensitivity of the situation?
  ```

- u/Allian42:
  ```
  Why do I feel like Indrani has "The power of Love" written under her left boot to kick Masego with.
  ```
