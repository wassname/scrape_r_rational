  This is fantastic. Very professional quality and handling. I think my only criticism would be how you've portrayed a lot of the girls with scratchy voices.

  All I can imagine is this: https://i.imgur.com/2LJNEkJ.jpg

  Otherwise it's everything I've ever wanted from a MoL audiobook. Thank you!

    In addition, Xvim's voice really should not be the ancient unintelligible Asian teacher. Not only is it not how I imagine him, it also makes him a pain to listen to.
