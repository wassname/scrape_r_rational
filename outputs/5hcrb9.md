  I have no idea how you could make a rationalst Homestuck, its vagueness, arbitrariness and absurdism are core to the work.

    You could. there is the 
    [Sburb Glitch FAQ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SburbGlitchFAQ) which is semi-rational.

    I also read a fic a while back where Rose exploited name collisions in the  bar-code system to send messages through time and to other players.

    Homestuck itself includes some logical exploits such as Dave using time-travel to exploit the stock market on his world.

      I believe you are talking about [Collision](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3398243/chapters/7437521). It is by the same author, and should be getting another update in the next few months, according to yesterday's A/N. 

      (It's Jade who finds the exploit though, and not Rose).

      I mean more in the thematic way. A Homestuck story without absurdity and the other qualities I mentioned loses the Homestuck theme and flavor that makes it unique. It's no longer a Homestuck story, just one set in its setting.
      ```

        Erm, fanfiction that lacks the theme and flavor of the original work is hardly something new, even in the rational/ist genre. *Luminosity* lacks the theme and flavor of the *Twilight* series. /u/alexanderwales' [rationalist!*Frozen* fic](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White) sure doesn't keep to the original. 

        I'm not even sure that HPMOR *really* maintains the theme and flavor of the *Harry Potter* series. Certainly, it disposes of the themes, and as far as flavor goes it doesn't *read* like a JK book.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          You just wait until I finish my long-awaited *Where's Waldo?* fic.
          ```

          - u/callmebrotherg:
            ```
            I am genuinely disappointed that you are only joking.
            ```

            - u/Chronophilia:
              ```
              Yes, he's definitely at least 70% joking.
              ```

                Are you sure about that? Why wouldn't he write a rational Where's Waldo fanfic? That actually would be kinda fun to read now that I think of it. An interactive rational fic where you have to find Waldo, and Waldo does more interesting and plot relevant things to try to hide himself, and you have to use actual evidence to find him rather than just searching in a crowd where he'll be hiding in plain sight.

                ...I want to read this now.
                ```

                - u/Chronophilia:
                  ```
                  Oh no, /u/alexanderwales has definitely been planning a *Where's Waldo* fic. With all the deep lore of the books, and everything. He's posted to brainstorming threads several times. That's not the joke.

                  The joke is the idea that he'd ever get anywhere near finishing it.
                  ```

  Nice scene. It stands pretty well on its own, but I'm interested to see where it goes from here!

  The Spritelog format isn't ideal for AO3. In the absence of panels, we have no physical context for where anyone is - it's a shame to invoke the [Featureless Plane Of Disembodied Dialogue](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FeaturelessPlaneOfDisembodiedDialogue) when Rose's Land is such a pretty place. Jaspersprite's text is also quite hard to read, especially mixed with Rose's text to form a solid block of pink. Hussie got away with it because he's Hussie and people expect him to be weird and eccentric (and because there aren't many long conversations between Jaspersprite and Rose).

  Rose's thesis is quite right and could be the beginning of something really excellent. Her reaction to it is telling, and reminds me of the deuteragonist of CORDYCEPS: when trapped in unfamiliar territory, her paranoia becomes omnidirectional. She is driven to do the most dangerous thing she can think of, on the basis that everyone is telling her not to do it - *so what are they hiding?* I love it, it fits her canon character and pretty much summarises the reasons she went grimdark in Homestuck proper.

  (Edit: It's also telling that she doesn't re-evaluate everything Jaspersprite said once she's determined he's untrustworthy. Rose isn't entirely the rational protagonist she thinks she is!)

  I wonder how the other kids will react. John might not follow her chain of logic, but he gets worried about his friend's mental health. Jade - at this point in Homestuck - trusts that Skaia knows what it's doing, and this Rose could come to see her as an agent of the enemy. Dave would affect an ironic uncaring facade about the whole business, to hide his real feelings. But that's just my interpretation. You may feel differently.

  I wonder how this Rose will react to the discovery of ectobiology, and the revelation that she is herself a game construct. Not good, probably.
