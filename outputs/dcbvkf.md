Sorry this is late this week!  I posted this announcement Sunday night, but some bizarre bug ate it.  This is one of the longer installments to date.  Thanks to all of you who've followed Ram thus far.

Pyrebound is a high fantasy serial about power and survival in a very grim world.  The first installment is [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).

  I love the world and protagonist.  Great story so far!

  I'm at work so I can't give as much thought to puzzling out the ending as I should. Anyone from the Reddit hive mind want to help out? At first glance, it sounds like maybe the Ensi made another Ram and sent it off? I'm not sure how that impacts Ram though. Like I said, I don't have the bandwidth to puzzle this out on my own for a few days :(

    Sorry, I'm required to end installments with teasers when possible.

    I think Ram gets to found a new city

  Nice update! Things are actually happening in the plot, and Ram got to experience some new things. Like plumbing.

      That too? Pretty sure this counts as a Word of God that rimming happened. Fan Fic authors, you are welcome :P

  Also, I don't know how long they have been up this way, but I want to comment that I really appreciate having the links to the next/previous chapters up at the top of the page. Thanks for taking that advice and implementing it!

    I implemented that shortly after your (?) request.  You're welcome!

  ... yeah, not gonna lie, that scene felt extremely rapey and inappropriate to me. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't fly *at all* with the genders reversed.

  Actually, it reminds me of a certain scene from WtC, except the equivalent character in WtC gets (rightfully) treated as a piece of shit for doing what Darun does here.
  ```

  - u/RedSheepCole:

    Not sure how to reply to this, TBH.  It would have a very different vibe with the genders reversed because, if push came to shove, Ram could pick Darun up and throw her bodily out of the room (as she more or less notes herself).  The other way around, there would be a constant threat of coercion or physical violence hanging over them, and it would be a very different kind of scene.  I think a double standard makes sense here.

    I would say Darun's approach is not respectful, nor likely to lead to a healthy relationship in the long haul.  It's not moral--but then, very little she does is moral.  A large part of what goes on in this story is morally far from optimal.  By inappropriate, do you mean it shouldn't have been included?  Because the story also has much worse things shown in detail, like child soldiers, muggings, death threats as jokes, human trafficking, involuntary human experimentation, and organized crime.  What's the difference here?
    ```

  - u/TrebarTilonai:

    Eh, I'm not certain that that is a valid comparison. (WtC spoilers from here on out)

    In WtC, there was a significant amount of narrative time spent showing the equivalent character as incredibly powerful and also with a blue/orange moral code. Joon himself also had a number of outstanding, serious hangups regarding sexuality and interpersonal relationships in general. There is a huge power differential there, plus the house could not understand Joon's objections.

    Conversely, there is no equivalent power differential between Ram and Darun. Ram has expressed (internal) interest in Darun, and his objections to actually sleeping with her were broadly a combination of "my mom warned me that would be a bad idea", "I'm very cautious in general and Darun in general is not, so this is probably a bad idea", and "Darun made it clear she was not interested". Reading through it, I don't think that I saw any indication that Ram didn't want anything to happen or anything that reads as rape.

    A comment from the author indicates it's supposed to be more seduction-focused, and from that sense it's... not great, I'll agree there. I would not have thought seduction reading it. She's very much just throwing herself at Ram rather than seducing him, but given the comment I would chalk that up to authorial inexperience rather than anything else. I wouldn't have even noticed if it weren't for the comment; Darun has always been written as pretty straightforward with her sexuality so throwing herself at Ram could absolutely be in character now that he is a ticket to the kind of wealth she wants. Which is an entirely separate issue, but I digress.

    ```
    I mean i'd call it questionable rather than rapey. There is a lack consequence hanging over his head if he refuses, I think he just doesn't trust in her intentions or her character - but is still attracted to her.
    ```
