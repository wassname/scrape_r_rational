## Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

The Powers:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *clearly* defined rules that are consistent. The powers may be original or may be from an already realised story.

* The power to be munchkined can not be something broken like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

The Reverse Munchkin:

* In these scenarios, we will find ways to beat someone or something with a power which is, well, *powerful*.

The Problem:

* In which we solve problems posed by other users. Be smart and expect other users to be smarter.

Note; All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are the first vampire to discover that whatever phenomenon renders your image invisible in mirrors and photographs reacts differently with digital cameras, producing a distinctive and highly visible silhouette of static. Just as smartphones and street cameras are becoming popular, what to do you do to keep yourself and the rest of your kind from being exposed to the human world after secretly preying on them for centuries?

    Launch a movement to protect a person's right to anonymity in public spaces, encouraging those suspicious of Big Brother to integrate IR LEDs into their clothing to obfuscate their images on security and phone cameras. Vampires get written off as libertarians on camera footage. Even if no libertarians actually bother to do it, the myth that some do it will be reinforced by the vampire presence.

      That's, um, wow, that's very good. Can I grab that for part of the background for an idea that's kicking around in my head (scifi story where vampires are masquerading as people who have pulled out expensive, extravagant body mods and hide or downplay whatever powers can't be explained away as technology)?

    Start a campaign to prepare for your eventual reveal. Make vampire stories popular, make vampires sympathetic tortured figures deserving redemption, and make vampires fascinating and interesting to everyone. When love for fictional vampires are at their peak, do a grand reveal where you minimize the scary aspects of yourselves, and emphasize the beneficial parts where you are *useful* towards human society and can provide an irreplaceable service. Can't think of anything, but vampire abilities are so varied that something can be used for something.

      As much as I love the idea of stories like Twilight and True Blood being vampire propaganda, I do think the public consciousness processes fiction differently enough from nonfiction that it would present a problem. As much as we empathize with vampires, we still recognize their condition as metaphorical rather than literal. If the people vampires were killing were no longer fictional, I doubt we'd take it well.

      The key driver behind fantasy stories is escapism. We want to enter a world unlike our own and bring ourselves back to reality afterward. How does our psychology respond to fantasy becoming reality, even if it's a fantasy we like? The only example I can think of is that despite the modern miracles of science and technology, there's still an attitude of I Want My Jetpack. The fantastic ends up feeling mundane.
      ```

        Funny story about the fantastic feeling mundane. A few years ago I was in Australia. I made a blog post about how I had just paid my electric bill on my phone from the opposite side of the world. I got a response saying "uh, yeah? Welcome to the 1980s. 1950s if we count wire transfers."  It was the most oblivious thing anyone had said to me in a long time.

      I think a lot of this is going to depend on what their powers are and how they work. If they have mind control then they can easily just seize power for themselves, same thing goes if they can control new vampires they sired. How feeding and turning works will also make a difference; if you can easily feed on humans without endangering them or turning them then you are going to find it much easier to have good PR.     
      Another somewhat important detail is how much does power increase with age? If the only increase in power is via the experience you gain, then older vampires won't be able to stay in control over the vampire world (unless they have supernatural control over their childre. Of course if there's no large scale vampire government then the masquerade never would have held up this long anyway..

    Offer to make the politicians into vampires in exchange for their loyalty.  They get powers and immortality, and the only cost is they have to prey upon the common people, so business as usual.  Since most of them have no qualms about pushing legislation in exchange for personal gain, it will be easy to get a majority to agree.  Actually, you don't even have to ask for anything in return.  If they are vampires themselves they will automatically pursue pro-vampire legislation just out of self interest.  Regardless of whether they make some sort of committee that maintains the secrecy of vampires, or they make vampires popular or a protected class, I expect them to do a fine job of it.  Politicians can do anything IF it benefits themselves.

      I like to think it would be a littler harder than that to convince elected officials to eat their voters.

    What other powers/weakness to these vampires have? 

    Having some kind of blood magic or mind control would make the initial damage control pretty trivial.

  Power:

  You can straighten thread. It only works on a particular brand and thickness of thread. Limits:

  * When you activate the power, all of the thread must be within 100m of your center of mass. 
  * Any part of a straightened thread that leaves your 100m AoE will go limp again, and re-straighten when brought back in. 
  * The effect lasts for as long as you concentrate and up to 10min afterwards if you want it to. 
  * The power works by making all parts of the thread invulnerable. (Cannot be cut, burned, etc.) Immediately after making it invulnerable it makes all parts of the thread repel all other parts with a force equal to the cube of the distance. This means that you can end up with a knot pulled incredibly tight while the thread is overall straight. 
  * The thread will never harm you. If it hits your skin / hair / etc its momentum vector is instantaneously reversed so it bounces away. If you hold it in your cupped hands and straighten it it will simply vibrate back and forth furiously. 
  * Aside from the above, the thread will straighten regardless of what's in the way. Assume that the force involved will simply keep increasing until it breaks through any barrier. 

  (If this power sounds familiar it's because I literally wrote a book on it.)

  Power:

  You are able to increase or decrease friction in 2m area around you, ("you" being your heart) with control within that i.e: decrease only above you; increase on one side, decrease on the other side; decrease a lot in a 1 mm area.

  This can be done down to an atomic scale.

  Using the ability causes an increase in heat inside your body proportional to how much you increase/decrease, spread evenly.

  What do
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Make sure you stay around to stave off heat death of the universe.

    Is the overheating an upkeep cost (such that you can do short bursts of change cheaply) or a one-time cost (such that you can highly stack the effect on the area you're in)? Do changes persist after you leave the vicinity? 

    Can you have heart surgery to slice off a bit of heart, and distribute minuscule amounts over a large area that you want to be able to affect? (Test first whether the affectable area is any point that is within 2 meters of any part of your heart.) Similarly, extract some unneeded tissue and try to grow some tumors out of it, so there is more body to spread the heat over.

    For completeness' sake, check whether there's a lightspeed delay.

    There ought to be some configuration of matter, perhaps some crystal, that visually reacts to your influence. That would be useful for a [Silent Image](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/silent-image) effect. Translating thoughts to video is useful for at least:

    * Art. Animating something no longer requires the, I'm guessing seconds per frame, a professional animator requires in the best case. If you're good at it you could just get a television channel where all you do is read books live and supply imagery.
    * Teaching. You could probably just plop down next to some uncontacted tribesman and *show* him you two standing there, then zoom out to find that the Earth is a giant rock hurtling around the Sun.
    * Anything you might want pen and paper for, except it's instantaneous. Any geometers in here salivating at the thought?

    Similarly, you could set up a mind -> computer interface with your power's bandwidth.

  You have the power to cause a timestop, but only when running. If you slow down too much, time goes back to normal. You can manipulate objects as you normally could. To the outside world, it appears as if the objects teleported into what position you put them in. If you punch a person, it will appear to them as if their head just teleported into a new position; this is disorienting, but not strictly damaging.

  How do you use this in combat? The fact that you have to run to maintain the timestop seems like a big problem.
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    > How do you use this in combat? 

    Prepare by training for a marathon.  If I can't win with several continuous hours of timestop, then I have a big problem.
    ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    If the speed limit is not too high, fasten zipties around people's throats. Would bullets bounce off, or stop in midair? You could use acid and molotovs and grenades and poison.
    ```

    - u/Kumquatodor:
      ```
      Is it possible to, while running, aim and fire? And keep running during the recoil? I've never used a gun, but that sounds difficult. Is it?
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        > Is it possible to, while running, aim and fire?  

        Fire, yes.  Aim, no.  You could *probably* hit the broad side of a barn from the inside, but I wouldn't bet on anything better than that.  Of course, you could just run right up to someone and shoot them from one foot away.

        >And keep running during the recoil?

        Yes.  Recoil isn't very strong.  In terms of actual force, it is roughly equivalent to catching a baseball.
        ```

  - u/chaosmosis:
    ```
    > How do you use this in combat? 

    By running away a lot?

    Seriously though, just use hit and run tactics. No need to risk getting tired while meleeing bad guys in the face.

    What happens to the air?

    I assume jogging in place doesn't work, so I'd do a lot of running in circles.

    Obviously I'm going to need to be at least a marathon-level athlete, but thankfully I can also train absurdly quickly. Buy lots of audiobooks, download lots of podcasts, and practice reading as I run without crashing into things. (Actually I already have practice at that last one, so get back into the habit.) Hopefully my lifespan is extended, but if not, at least I'm not *wasting* huge chunks of my life.

    Combat - blades and explosives work OK while running. "You can manipulate objects as you normally could" - to what extent are they immune to damage, then? A punch doesn't work, but what about a stick? A sword? An electrified sword? Explosives are probably ideal-est, toss them in place and then run to safety.

    ... I could wear a computer on my back. This is useless in a combat situation but still neat, assuming my clothes aren't frozen.

    Combat, combat ... toss gasoline + match on someone, toss caltrops in their vicinity, throw paint in their eyes. If I miss, eh, I have multiple tries. Presumably my clothes move with me, but there are no chemical reactions for stuff I pick up, so in theory I could smear metaphorical-or-literal FOOF around people with my bare hands (although only if I can reach a LOT of water to rinse them with - does swimming count?) Hell, I could assemble a critical mass of plutonium near them.

    The biggest issue is space. Confined space, all my best options will kill me as well; confined enough, I can't run at all! Stuff for tunneling etc. is heavy and hard (though not impossible) to use while running in circles near a wall. Does spinning count as movement? The weight is a bigger issue here. Assuming I don't age a small tool might do, but that's a big "if" -  probably the same answer to that as whether I get hungry, so check that first.

      The idea of running during a time stop causing instant vacuums, plus high pressure areas around it due to teleported air it, is interesting.
      ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Use melee weapons while running? If there is a problem, just slow down for hitting. Run behind enemy and do whatever. Why would you ever lose a fight with this power against normals?

  When you play a wind instrument, it's significantly louder than it should be given the amount of air you're blowing into it, IE play a tuba, blow out a window with the force.
