  Hi all! I know, I know, it's been a while. But in my defence, I spent about a zillion hours looking for a new job after my last one suddenly got shipped to India, and ho boy does being rejected take a lot of energy out of a guy. Anyway, all of this is a leadup to me kinda sorta letting you all know that I have created a Patreon page, here: [https://www.patreon.com/Sophronius/overview](https://www.patreon.com/Sophronius/overview)

  Bear in mind that I'm a frugal kind of guy who saves a lot, so it's not like you should feel any moral obligation to save me from starving to death or anything. But just in case some of you are swimming around in bitcoin cash and you have no idea what to do with any of that sweet sweet dough, you know, I'm just saying the option is there. :p

  Thanks to everyone who has been waiting for an update all this time!

    It is great to see this story resume. I look forward to seeing how the story progresses now that Gaara died and the Chuunin exam has ended. I am really curious to see whether Sand decides to invade.

    Here are just some of my quick thoughts.

    The very first paragraph seems like it is very disconnected from the rest of the post and the story in general. Is this supposed to be a flashback to the scene in the beginning of the story where Naruto got into a fight with Sasuke? Is this supposed to be some kind of metaphor for how Naruto perceives his actions towards Gaara?

    On another note, This might just be my personal quirk but the use of the word "professor" makes me think of a college or modern school and doesn't seem to fit the genre. The idea of Naruto referring to a teacher as "Professor" just seems really weird and jarring.

      Thanks for the feedback! The opening scene is supposed to be a direct continuation from where the last chapter left off:

      >Naruto dispelled himself, and when he  opened his eyes again he was sitting at the kitchen table, trying to  explain to Jiraiya what had happened that day and feeling twice as  exhausted as he had before.

      This is probably more confusing than it would otherwise be because of the huge time gap between chapters. Sorry about that. Did anyone else find this segment jarring? I'll have to change it if so.

      Anyway, he refers to killing Gaara as "getting into a fight with a boy at school" as a way to sardonically contrast academy life with what he's being forced to do now. I agree it's a bit strange though, because the academy in NTBS would never have been all that mild and peaceful in the first place, so it does feel a bit like Naruto is drawing on real life knowledge which he should not have access to.

      "The professor" is the canon nickname of the Third Hokage, so that part makes sense I think if you continue directly from the last chapter.

    Thanks! Don't worry, I'm sure I'll land on my feet somehow. Who knows, maybe it'll work out for the better.
