  More setup and a bit of progress.

  Hashlush, Raynie and Rea what?!?!?!?

  Also Zorian is going full big brother with those telepathy nodes.

  &#x200B;

  Edit: Shit it occurred to me that Raynie's brother is a shifter child. That is not good

    ```
    The telepathy nodes have got to be part of operation mind wipe Zach so the angels don't kill everyone.
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      I'm not sure mind-wiping Zach would do the trick, since the angelic contract may just draw from what he previously sensed and previously remembered.

      On the other hand, if Zorian could bypass Zach's mind blank and override his senses to show him Zorian dying in the fighting, well, what is there for Zach to believe except that Zorian's dead?  Zach was under mind blank, after all, so he can surely trust what he sees with his own two eyes.
      ```

      - u/Watchful1:
        ```
        Maybe mind wipe is the wrong term, but basically change Zach's memory so that he thinks everyone is dead and that fulfills the contract.
        ```

        - u/skleroos:
          ```
          It's not a memory wipe. It's creating an illusion of reality more likely. Like he did with the spider matriarch.
          ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    What else were they going to do? Zorian hid the Cyorian shifter children from the Cult early on, and Sudomir is fully aware of Raynie's tribe in his vicinity. There's a whole tribe of shifters and their children to kidnap in easy reach.
    ```

    - u/letouriste1:
      ```
      Well, zorian didn’t expect it because shifters are probably well defended. I expect sentries and fighters ready
      ```

      - u/SleepThinker:
        ```
        Zorian can probably kidnap all their tribe by himself, shouldn't be much of a problem for invaders.

        Usually they were just kidnapping random children, now they had to actually put some effort into it.

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        how long ago was that tho, in-universe? there is a chance it happened precisely during that. either contact is slow/infrequent and Raynie only just found out now and/or Raynie only got around to seeking help now (though from her expression, seems like she found out recently). I would have to double check but I feel like I'm probably wrong because it's been a lil too long for "slow communication"

    Didn't they need a shifter sacrifice to release the endbringer/godzilla/whatchamacallit? Still probably a just a distraction.

  ```
  Wow this chapter was awesome. I loved the interaction between Zorian and Damien. It was great to read him going into self reflection. It really demonstrates how much he's grown. 

  I really enjoy these rare chapters checking in on all of his relationships. It shows the big payoffs for his maturity and change as a human being.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    I also love the part of stories that deal with it too. They bring our attention that every characters has their own problem, has their own skill set that may not be enough to solve their problem themselves, and give main character push and pull so he can develop. They're in correct dose too! I mean, this novel is still about Zorian, all these relationship subplot is always low key. But in the end, it has great effect: It brings characters alive!

    That said, I have dissatisfaction with Daimen's reaction in this chapter. We know he's having bad days. He's expedition not working smoothly, stressfulness from the arrival of his parents, and I'm sure the pressure from the Taramatula, especially his fiancee Orissa, must be mounting. Dropping a big problem he's not ready with should made him speechless, disbelieving, before transitioning into outrage and finally acceptance. There might be pressure to keep word count low, or maybe the pay-off from doing that part perfectly weren't big enough (the readers already know all of this anyway), but I still hope it was done well.

    Edit: On reread I identified the speechless part. Actually, the interaction is pretty good on slow read. Incredulity -> Dismissal -> (Show the orb) Surprise -> Speechlessness -> Confusion -> Frustration -> Anger -> Tentative Acceptance. I wonder, why the shock was barely noticeable on first read. It's unlike memorable Haslush reaction on Mr Kesir's (*ordering stronger alcohol, repeating "this is insane"*), or from further past, Zorian reaction on Merenptah's (*want to claim that he's furiously thinking, but the shock is too great he's left dazzled*).
    ```

    - u/MythSteak:
      ```
      I get the feeling that we are going to see much more of his reaction in the next chapter, when he visits Zorian.
      ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      He was pretty good about not being shocked and jumping straight to trying to work it all out the first time they contacted him in the loop, too.
      ```

      - u/sambelulek:
        ```
        Oh, but the first time Daimen contacted by Zorian, there's sky-high apprehension and wariness. He started by mocking his impossible ability to open gate and cast simulacrum, but when presented by proof, he became speechless. He walked around Cyoria in silence and never once utter a word to his little brother until Zorian himself nudge him to talk. That level of shock is what I expected when you're dumped something so outrageous.
        ```

        - u/lillarty:
          ```
          To be fair, the situation is different this time. Zorian isn't presenting abilities that would be impossible for him to acquire, he's presenting information about a highly implausible plot with rock-solid proof that Damien had participated in events that he doesn't remember. Memory manipulation (through mind magic or some other means) seems like it would be much easier for an accomplished mage to accept than the literally impossible feat of Zorian instantaneously becoming much more powerful.
          ```

        - u/Nic_Cage_DM:

          I guess the notebook helped
          ```

        - u/TristanTheViking:
          ```
          Zorian's being pretty careful not to overwhelm him with all the "15y/o but in the top ranks of archmages in the world" stuff this time.

      Becoming a lich doesn't seem worth it, for one thing its seriously illegal everywhere except for the one country he is at war with, the gods also dont seem to like it, and needlesly pissing the gods of when he knows there to be an afterlife is stupid.

    Those both require having a lot of magical power. He's improved, but his real strength is precision.

    - u/NZPIEFACE:
      ```
      How about a magic shield which automatically concentrates onto the points where it's going to be hit?

          Making precise gates like xvim probably still needs a ton of power. But would be amazingly effective as it could redirect basically anything.

  - u/Tserri:
    ```
    I doubt Zorian can take on dragons. He mught be able to use his mental powers against them _if_ he manages to break into their mind (not easy since they have incredible mana resources). 

    Tbh I think Zorian may summon the angel to get rid of the dragons, because I don't really see any way they could beat them. Or Z&Z will defeat Oganj and the dragons will retreat.
    ```

    - u/Banarok:
      ```
      nah zorian could probably handle dragons, but it would take a while, Zorian would just make lots of explosives and other things lure it into a trap and blow it up, Zorian would lose 10/10 times in a fight of brute force.
      ```

  - u/GWJYonder:

    He doesn't need a shield when he has a decoy ~~snail~~ Zorian.

- u/russxbox:
  ```
  So with the sigil network that literally no one but Zorian is aware of allowing him full coverage of the city with his mind whammy, and the mention of him needing to know soon how capable a normal human mind mage is, I guess the only question left is: do we expect a bluff, double bluff, or a side-by-side bluff? 

  Is he only going to take over Zach's mind and show him everyone who knows about the time loop dying, or will he take over Zach's mind and show him a convincing human-level attempt to take over Zach's mind and allow the simulated takeover attempt to be shredded by contract magic then let the higher level sim allow Zach to kill everyone who knows about the time loop? And will he be simultaneously (side-by-side) showing the invaders a simulation of their victory? 

  I'd really like to see the meta-level scene in this instance with Zorian sitting there, hand on the wall and holding a drooling, feebly kicking Zach while his allies quietly round up the streetsful of sleeping invaders.

    Xanatos Gambit.
    ```

  - u/spanj:
    ```
    Not that I would trust Silverlake’s word, but *theoretically* if the contract that Panaxeth crafted is of similar or lower stringency to that if Zach’s, you could try to convince Silverlake to switch sides again because she is ultimately self serving.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I doubt that Panaxeth's contract is perception-based. We know that the "primordial breaks free" part of Zach's contract is tied to the automated defences' activation, not his own perception.
      ```

      - u/lillarty:
        ```
        At the same time, didn't Panaxeth say that he wasn't sure what the defenses are? The angels know full well about the systems involved, but is it possible in magical contract law to define a trigger that nobody involved has specific knowledge about?
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Just as well we can be sure that Panaxeth was totally open and honest about the consequences of freeing it, hmm?
          ```

  - u/Allian42:
    ```
    Oh, that could work. We know Zorian looked into how to defeat the mind blank spell, that the contract depends on Zach's perception of reality and that he is building a network for mind spells. Zorian could make Zach think everyone that is aware of the time loop died during the fight, wait for the contract to be processed and completed, and then show himself.
    ```

  1. The telepathy nodes are definitely for the grand illusion spell .... or a twist ending with Zorian as the main villain.

        Could be that they're being lied to, and that they'll threaten to kill the kid/s if the tribe doesn't help with the attack.

  What was the deal with the weird reaction from Tinami at the end?

  Also - yay for more Raynie. I'm very pleased to see her brought back into the story. She was by far my favorite Zorian ship back in the days when Zorian was semi-dating. I can't believe I didn't see this coming with her brother though. Of course RR would go after the wolf tribe after Zorian took steps to protect the shifters in Cyoria.

  Rea is sharp. I mean, how would she connect a gifted student (that his professor deign to visit from time to time) to someone who's in-the-know about shifter kidnapping? I'm sure it's not Zorian himself who tried to convince her to leave the city, otherwise Zorian would not be surprised by her invitation in the first place. She must be a capable scout among her old criminally-inclined friendos to draw such conclusion.
  ```

  - u/LordGoldenroot:

    Didn't Zorian try to evacuate her though? It was unclear if he had a disguise but if he i not she would have known he is more than he seems.

      ```
      From this chapter:

      > Zorian was quite surprised at this, as this wasn't something Rea typically did. Did she somehow catch wind of his own involvement in all this?

      This was talking about Rea's sudden invitation to Zorian. The second passage implies that while Zorian gave the order, he wasn't the one personally trying to convince her, I would say.
      ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      It shouldn't be him, or at least, it shouldn't be undisguised him. If Zorian himself is the one who tried to convince her, he wouldn't approach the Sashal residence with apprehension; he would be enthusiastic at the prospect of talk.

  ```

- u/rman320:
  ```
  I'm writing this as more of a stream of consciousness:

  I'm assuming Zorian's work with mental illusions in chapter 97 with Spear of Resolve is foreshadowing a scenario where Zorian will subvert Zach's mind blank during the final battle and show a scene where everyone that knows about the time loop dies, leaving Zach thinking that that portion of his contract is fulfilled. Even still, Zorian is refusing to tell Daimen where his notebooks came from as a precaution. Zorian really is super paranoid.

  Zorian's vision from chapter 75 came true! The sea of suns represents his mental network that he has established throughout Cyoria!

  Did the angels talk to the sulthorum again in the real world? In the time loop the sulthorum were told that a powerful mage would come for the ring. Now they are willing to uproot and fight in Cyoria. It's good that he has more allies.

  I think Tinami might be looking at Zorian in a more romantic light. With the comments Daimen has made about Zorian being more confident and Zorian doing the mental lessons with Tinami in the real world, Tinami has a much better impression of Zorian.

  Finally, Raynie's back! Jornak seems to have looked outward for shifter children for the primordial summoning ritual. It sucks for Raynie, but I'm confident that Zorian can save her brother and get into Raynie's good graces. I'm personally rooting for Zorian to get to know Raynie better in the real world considering how they got along earlier when he interacted with her.
  ```

  - u/russxbox:
    ```
    My personal pet theory re: mental simulations is that he knows Zach is expecting an attempt to subvert the contract this way. So he intends to have two levels of simulation, one at a normal human mind mage level (hence the remark during the Tinami session) which he allows Zach to see through, and the other at or above the level of clarity we saw before. 

    When Zach drops into the second simulation, he believes he's beaten Zorian's trick and is compelled by the contract to kill everyone who knew about the time loop. End chapter on cliffhanger, next chapter is the reveal that Zorian keikaku'd everywhere and everyone is fine except for mental trauma on Zach's part because that was really an exceedingly realistic sim and why are you so good at simulating blood spatter, Zorian?
    ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      I'm pretty sure that Zach knows Zorian is anything but a normal mind mage.

      I would guess the remark about normal mind mages is so he can act like one after the whole thing is over.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Yeah. At some point Zorian is going to have to either deal with or hide from the fact that governments know that getting really good at some types of mind magic leaves a trail of bodies behind. This is him preparing to hide.
        ```

      - u/Tserri:
        ```
        Zach knows Zorian is an excellent mind mage, but he never experienced it and doesn't _actually_ know what Zorian is capable of.
        ```

        - u/XeL09:
          ```
          i feel like zach would.  he's been with zorian often enough when zorian was using mind magic on others and up until recently, zorian had no reason to lie to zach about his prowess.
          ```

          - u/lillarty:
            ```
            But Zach has no memories of ever being impacted by mind magic. For all he knows, his enormous amount of mana could just overpower Zorian's skill. 

            The only hole in this theory is that Zach was with Zorian as he used his mind magic on QI, and Zach knows that QI has much more mana than him.

    In the Ch 75 thread:

    >I think the sea of suns could be Zorian's hive mind - like the great web connections. It could also be the Bakora Gate network fully deployed. 

    Called it, kinda at least haha. Man, Zorian is getting scary powerful, isn't he. 

    I think honestly the author has shied away from romance from the most part, I don't think Tinami is leading up to that anyway. She's also repeatedly described as shy, so I'd doubt that angle. 

    Re angels and sulrothum - that IS weird. These guys have an intense relationship going on, although informing the church might not be ideal because it may leak out, whereas who will talk to devil wasps a continent away?
    ```

    - u/MSpekkio:
      ```
      The comment by the sulrothum high priest is by far the part that stuck out for me.

      It's a unexamined assumption that what the contract says is what the Angel's want to happen.  The angel interaction with the sulrothum speaks to there being more going on on the Angel side than we know about.

      What if the point of the contract is to put Zach into a life or death moral decision where he has to choose between the lives of his allies or his own life?  Perhaps with the added twist of finding out if he's strong enough to resist the compulsion of the contract?  


      There's no doubt in my mind the Angels could release him from the contract with a wave of a weird, tree tentacle thing.


      Let's remember the last known use of the time loop created the Emperor that unified the world.  Perhaps the reason Zorian wouldn't have been a candidate has more to do with bloodline than temperament.


      If this is right, then we'll see all of Zorian's beautiful plans get ripped down at the last second, perhaps by the Angels or Sulthorum.  Keep in mind, Zorian may be the book's protagonist, but Zach is supposed to be the hero of the story.


      It also bother's me that Zach's been offscreen the last few chapters.  What's he been up to?
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I was under the impression that angels don't lie. They distinctly told Zorian that they *can't* just renegotiate the contract. They're already stretching by letting ZZ know that they don't really mind cheating so long as the primordial is stopped. If they could just remove the contract, seems like they would.
        ```

        - u/MSpekkio:
          ```
          I agree, they specifically said they can't change the terms of the contract.  And yes, the primordial being released definitely will trigger the 'bad stuff', but everything else is all tied to Zach's perceptions, Zach's judgement, etc.  Doesn't rule out the Angel's just removing the Divine Framework, or nulling the contract in some other way.

          Consider the other oddities around the contract:

          * The fact that it just ends at the end of the month.
          * It's comprehensive and detailed, but doesn't stop a obvious way to get information out of the loop (research notes)
          * It doesn't stop Zach from communicating about the time loop in the loop (surely this would be an easy way to block information)
          * Nor does it prevent him from creating Temporary Loopers (again another easy to block thing).
          * There's no block on what Zorian did, or any method of physically removing stuff from the loop.  Admittedly this is weak, since it would be reasonable to assume that the Guardian would prevent this kind of thing.

          These discrepancies all make some sense if you consider the time loop as a crucible specifically for Zach, he has to have the opportunity to make mistakes, and deal with the consequences.   According to the Angels, if Zach had ever stopped the invasion perfectly then all the information would have been granted, but that doesn't mean that the angel's considered the task doable. If the angel's considered the task itself as impossible without allies then the strange restrictions make sense.

          I just wonder if all these little discrepancies around the Angel's actions, and the contract add up to something else.  Again, big assumption, the Angel's choosing Zach was the best way to stop the primordial.  Doesn't add up now that we have a view of the kinds of people who have shown they are willing to help with said Primordial.  But again, if there's more than one goal here, then it may make sense.

          I think we'll revisit the question of "Why Zach" at some point, and hope the answer is more satisfying than "because".

      What Raynie offered is convenience. She's unwanted by her tribe. Matching Zorian's ambition of living a quiet but prosperous life. Her being gorgeous is a bonus. Being not exactly close to Zorian is too a bonus, so there's a payoff if he try know her better. 

      Akoja can offer the same convenience of quiet life, but her personality doesn't match Zorian's. 

      Tinami is the contrary to quiet life. Husband to a noble house's heir implies additional responsibility and fame. Two things that may only serve as distraction from his dream of revolutionizing magic.

      Neolu's naivette is endearing to Zorian but only in small dose. Abundance of it will not mesh his taste well.

        What's good about Tavien is that she's blunt, sincere and caring while being highly motivated to reach her goal of becoming a battle mage, she don't care much for social prestige so she wont bother Zorian to go to parties even if she'd bother him as a diviner, something he's probably okey with.

        &#x200B;

        Tinami is best girl however, she's horrible dating material but she's cute, helpful, honest, driven and will do ANYTHING to reach her goal, she's great, but Zorian would Loathe the clan politics she brings, but having her as a friend should be okey :)

          What you and /u/sambelulek are forgetting is that Zorian was in the time loop for, what, over a decade? I imagine he's no longer interested in most girls his "age". Taiven is a couple of years older than pre-loop Zorian, but I think the *real* ship is Zorian x Spear of Resolve.

            but also he've had not much experience with romance or social stuff anyway, so he's still pretty inexperienced in that area in general, so the gap of such knowledge between himself and girls his age is lower then what you might expect from one his age, talking to huge spiders don't make you much of a people person.

        - u/sambelulek:

          I always imagined Zorian to be a pragmatic sort. Getting what he want trump pride every time. In locating Imperial Orb, he swallowed his pride and asked his brother Daimen help, didn't he? Moreover, undervalued is not equal to non-valuable. What marred Raynie's perfection is she's no longer involved in tribe's politic (a plus point in Zorian's book), she is still most desirable girl in her whole class.

          Same with other girl, I'm not saying Raynie will just throw herself to Zorian. Courting is an endeavor. But in success in courting Raynie, Zorian get all the bonus and none the minus.

  It's extremely likely that the invaders are behind the kidnapping of Raynie's brother to get to Zorian & Zach.  There is no way either of them would let this pass once they hear about it.  This is the perfect trap, just a day or so before the festival to boot!

  On another note, I hope the sulrothum can throw Silverlake's plans off as she doesn't know about them yet, however unlikely that is.

  On yet another note, I find it a little amusing that the High Priest is scolding Zach on his lack of faith in angels when it's Zorian whose religious faith is lacking & Zach who was chosen by the angels.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:

            - u/None:
              ```
              They addressed that repeatedly. Zorian advanced so quickly because he was able to use wildly risky and expensive methods over and over without consequences, and because he had the imminent threat of the invasion and his own death to drive him. I think that explanation downplays his intelligence a bit because it's from his own biased perspective, but he's not the smartest guy ever, he just had a unique opportunity that he used to the fullest.
              ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              Well, that makes somewhat more sense, but it doesn't really matter what QI was like when young. The point is that he is now thousands of years old, and still hasn't duplicated his crown despite studying it in depth. To suggest that Zorian might succeed in a mere handful of years makes you appear short sighted, thus the down votes. (Just speculating here - I personally didn't vote.)

      ```
      Huh, don't remember her at all.
      ```

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        Zorian danced with her during the party at Zach's estate. She gave him a rundown of ongoings within the noble houses, before Zorian met up with Zach again, after Zorian's return to Cyoria. She's part of house Aope, an old family of witches who gained nobility status as a condition of turning against the Necromancers in the war that led to their exile on Ulqaan Ubasa. Tinami herself requested a partner to practice mind magic from Ilsa. Zorian practiced it with her in 2 previous restarts. The first one was when Zorian was Ilsa's succeeding disciple, and the second one was in the same restart as the first time Zorian approached Raynie. That time, during their meeting where they practiced mind magic, Kiana showed up and told Zorian that Raynie agreed to a meeting, leading Tinami to assume that Zorian had learned a secret of Raynie's through telepathy and spreading a rumor that he was dating her.

        Forgot to mention, but Tinami also constantly wears a ring with a spell formula inscribed on it. The spell is harmless, but causes tremendous pain on whoever is hit by it. She used it during the party at Zach's place, against invaders and monsters. Also, on top of being interested in spiders, she's very interested in lineage and family trees. Probably part of Tinami's witch heritage. She was very interested to learn that Zorian's grandmother was a witch, in the restart where she told him about the noble families. (Chapters 49 & 50, iirc.)

              ```

              - u/-Fender-:
                ```
                We first met Neolu because Zach was hanging around with her and some other unnamed girl in the very first iteration of the loop that Zorian remembers, before Quatach Ichl partially melded his soul with Zach's. The reason for this was later revealed to be because she is apparently easy to convince about the truth of the time loop, so Zach would occasionally spend a restart hanging around her to decompress and have someone to talk to. Zorian later realized that without Zach's presence, Neolu was incapable of reaching the same results in grades and magical abilities as she did in his first restart, and that she was decidedly fairly average as a mage. 

                The next time she was relevant was in one of the restarts before Zach woke up from his soul damage-induced coma. Zorian's previous restart had ended with him being stabbed in the chest after telling his language teacher about the Ibasans, and so he was understandably reticent to openly warn people about the invasion again. As such, he asked Benisek for advice about how to send a message secretly. As a result, Benisek then promptly spread a rumor all over the city about how Zorian was in love and wanted to send a secret message to his beloved, much to Zorian's annoyance. After a class, Neolu then casually walked by him, and dropped a note with multiple book titles about the subject written on it, as well as many hand-drawn small hearts around the edges. Zorian resisted his urge to burn the paper, and he actually took the time to go through Neolu's suggested list of books, and found to his surprise that they were very good recommendations. He used his newfound knowledge to send many anonymous messages about the invasion to authorities in the police force, the Church and the mage guild, but was disappointed that nothing really happened as a result, and that the city was just as unprepared for when the invasion actually happened. But at least Zorian wasn't stabbed in the chest a second time.

                After that, Neolu only became relevant again when Zorian was attempting to learn the dialect of the people residing on the islands and towns between Eldemar and Koth, to help him reach Daimen in good time, before Z&Z & Silent Doorway Adepts found Bakora Gates on that continent. Neolu came from a noble clan in the area, and was sent away to the Academy as a way of protecting herself while her family tried to resolve some conflicts. She thus helped Zorian at translating a few common words and phrases, to help his simulacrum negotiate for teleports from the locals.

                And the next time she became relevant was for the airship ride, when Z&Z wanted her to help them with her connections in order to get an Ikosian-to-Sulrothum translator, in order to get the surrounding devil wasps' colonies help to launch an attack against the Ziggurat of the Sun. During this airship ride, Zorian thought that Neolu was being strangely credulous to Z&Z's claims. He concluded that it was possible that her third eye tattoo and bloodline were related somehow, and that she has a way to tell if someone is speaking truthfully. This was also the first time that the author mentioned that she has facial tattoos.

                Well, as far as I remember, this is accurate. I can't really recall any other moment where she was particularly important.

                    Two other details. It's possible that her facial tattoos were mentioned when she met Zorian in the library and helped him with his translations, rather than during the airship ride. I think I might have slightly confused the timeline. And the second thing, is that during their airship pitstop at some ruins, Neolu showed that she loves stories that involve romance, and that she finds lizards cute.

                    And NOW that's all I recall about her.

    Well, I obviously won't finish the story in one chapter, so the estimate is certainly off. But I did say it's an estimate, so I think it's fine.

    Anyway, the current plan is to finish the story in 3-5 more updates.

  Thanks for the chapter. I just re read the serie and I have a few questions.

  - In earlier chapter you said that pocket dimensions have the same weight 

  >the weight of the object inside did not disappear, so a chest with several tons of rock inside would still weight several tons, no matter how small it looked.  chapter 78

  So how they could create that orb with Silverlake, Damien, and Xvim in the last restart ?

  - What happened to that orb they made, did they try to bring it with them to escape or not since it require a constant mana ?

  - Do Zach use golem for his simulacrum or it's only Zorian ?

  - Can a familiar increase your mana regeneration by somehow ?

  - How strong is Xvim ? I mean in term of natural mana reserve.

  - Can the dagger control any Hydra or only the princess ?
  ```

  - u/nobody103:
    ```
    *The weight limitation is only valid for the basic pocket dimensions shown in that chapter. The chapter even notes that it isn't a total restriction (in that Silverlake claimed the palace orb could be reproduced through purely mortal magic). Chapter 85 features a mention of Zach and Zorian being able to build the most advanced type of pocket dimensions. ("These objects were not containers with expanded interior at all. They were self-contained pocket worlds anchored to an object.") I though I mentioned there that these ones don't have weight limitations, but apparently not.

    *They did try to bring it with them, but since the only thing to pass through the escape passage was Zorian's soul, it was naturally lost along all its contents.

    *Only Zorian.

    *No.

    *His natural mana reserves are bigger than Zorian's but not particularly large. Magnitude 14 to 16, as opposed to Zorian's 8/10. Still considered fairly average, but on the higher end of that category.

    *Just Princess.

      > They did try to bring it with them

      That's interesting - I remember the knock-off imperial orb they made was powered by a tiny dimensional gate leading to the depth of the local dungeon, so I assumed they wouldn't be able to bring it with them to the real world, since once the portal to the real world was closed it would probably sever the link created by that dimensional gate as well. Or even if not, then at least when the iteration of the loop ended it should destroy the end of the dimensional gate that leads back to the copy-world.

      So the knockoff orb can last for a little while after being cut off from its source of power? In retrospect, there were a few passages coming from the story that suggests a spell formula could keep circulating a certain store of mana even without a battery explicitly being built into it. That exposition about about some wards being able to last months after being cut off from its power source, for one.
      ```

      - u/nobody103:
        ```
        Yes, spell formula usually do have a form of mana storage, and large ward schemes often have massive ones. This is because when a ward fails do to a lack of mana, it's permanently gone - even if you supplied it with mana later on, it would not bring back the spells used to make it. Those have to be cast all over again. Obviously, this is something that makers and buyers try to avoid as much as possible.

        It's not that mana cannot be stores, it's that it cannot keep its attunement when it's done so, making such storages useless for a mage's personal needs. But for spell formula, this isn't important.
