## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  As a relatively minor piece of worldbuilding for a future project, I was thinking about a metamaterial that magically heats up or cools down things on its surface. The origin of this idea was a way to have ultra-hot flaming swords, but I enjoyed thinking about mundane uses, like making a plate of this material in order to replace a burner on a stove, or using cold plates in a refrigerator (probably with some kind of conductor so that you're cooling the whole space instead of freezing a single side of what you put in it), or cooling in the summer and heating in the winter with swappable plates.

  Unfortunately, I'm not an engineer, and a lot of my attempts at engineering are just getting 'close enough' with some fudging on the details. At the moment, for this little corner of the world, I have two outstanding details I need help with:

  1. Could you actually make a workable hot and/or cold sword with this, or some other weapon? The problem with weapons is that contact is usually quite brief, a flaming sword might be a liability, and you would need to compensate in terms of materials if it was actually hot enough to usefully hurt someone. It's magic, so the sky is the limit in terms of energy output, but my inclination is that the sword would be self-heating to a point of useful heat, with relatively low energy used so that it could be cooled down for storage in a cold-sheath. The damage would come from being hit with a hot piece of metal, rather than from direct heat production while the sword was in contact. Assuming that the heat didn't weaken the metal, what kind of energy requirements would we be talking about?

  2. How do you most efficiently build a steam engine? Assuming that you have two materials, one of which generates heat, the other of which sucks heat, both in perpetuity. I'm fairly sure that you could just do a Rankine cycle type thing, with a cold rod in the condenser and a hot rod in the boiler, but I'm not sure that's the best way to go about it. You would also have to deal with what you do with the heating/cooling elements, since they don't shut off. You wouldn't necessarily *need* to do anything with them, so long as you're disconnecting the rotation, but it seems like that would run into wear and tear problems, and make service on it a royal pain.

    >Could you actually make a workable hot and/or cold sword with this, or some other weapon?

    Sort of, but it might be better as a utility item rather than as a weapon. If you want the heat to make it do significantly more damage than a regular sword, it's going to have to get *really really* hot. Keep in mind that high temperature blades are actually commonly used in the real world, but they're called electrocautery scalpels and they use heat from electrical resistance to cauterize small blood vessels in order to minimize blood loss during surgery. With this in mind, there's a range of temperatures where a hot blade might do less harm, rather than more!

    Also keep in mind that the depth of a thermal injury (from where the blade touches flesh) will be affected by both the temperature of the blade and how long that temperature is applied. Typical sword usage would not leave much time for the heat to conduct deeply and cause more than just localized cauterization. That said, let's take a look at a range of possible temperatures, and the effects those temperatures have:

    * 43 °C (109.4 °F): This is the threshold for thermal injury. Body tissues could be kept at this temperature for over two hours without injury.

    * 50 °C (122 °F): Body tissues can be necrotized if they're kept at this temperature for at least one minute. A sword at this temperature would be unremarkable.

    * 75 °C (167 °F): Full-thickness burns (3rd degree burns) can be inflicted within five seconds at this temperature. In *Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants*, McDonalds was found negligent for selling coffee at 82–88 °C. A hot sword with an outlet at the tip which could heat water to this point and spew it at people's faces or clothing would be somewhat scary.

    * 100 °C (212 °F): Full-thickness burns (3rd degree burns) can be inflicted within 1-3 seconds at this temperature. Unfortunately, water turns to steam beyond this point, and steam does a poor job of sitting on people's skin and clothes to cause burns after exposure, so the sword becomes a bit less worrying beyond this.

    * 480 °C (896 °F): This is enough to cause a faintly visible red glow. If the sword does anything extra with stabs and cuts, it would just be local cauterization of small blood vessels; it's actually less dangerous than a regular sword.

    * 730 °C: This is enough to induce a bright red to slightly orange incandescent glow. This is around the range for what would be called 'low-temperature cauterization' with surgical tools. As above, this is less dangerous than a regular sword.

    * 1,440 °C (2,550 °F): Temperatures at or above this are hot enough to cause a bright white glow, like a filament in a lightbulb, so the sword might look like a white lightsaber. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YMFRF8NMNI&t=1m37s) of a cube of tungsten at somewhere around this temperature being placed on a steak (the video claims >3,000 °C). Stabs and cuts will definitely cauterize the wound, and there might be some more extensive burns and tissue necrosis around the wound. In combat though, this might actually be most useful as light source when fighting at night or inside caves or dark buildings. You could have someone behind you hold it so that it doesn't blind you by being in front of your face.

    There's obviously a wide range of possible temperatures beyond this. For example, you could have a white-hot blade which is so hot that its radiant heat could cause burns at significant distances. This would be dependent on the exposed surface area of the blade, so the person holding the blade just needs to wear thermal protection and always hold the blade perpendicular from their body to remain safe. They could then let the flat part radiate heat towards everyone else, though this would quickly raise the local air temperature to intolerable levels and kill the wielder eventually if they don't have some way to shut the blade off.

    > Could you actually make a workable hot and/or cold sword with this

    Fire isn't a very practical weapon. Flaming arrows are mostly a movie thing, flamethrowers were largely abandoned shortly after being invented, Greek Fire was lost and useful technologies generally aren't.

    A flaming sword might be so hot that it causes burns through armor, causing pain and reduced mobility, but armor is very well-insulated to begin with, and I'd also worry about the wielder's hand. Maybe hot enough to incidentally blind someone through the visor? My first guess for this is heating the air around the sword to ~650 degrees C (~1200 degrees F), found by multiplying (heat needed for water to instantly burn someone - human body temperature) * (heat conductivity of water / heat conductivity of air). But that's less than the heat of a campfire, and I've jumped through one unharmed, so I don't think I computed that right. [Edit, I went to make lunch halfway through this comment, so Norseman2 had ample time to ninja me. I'd start with his numbers. I would say that those appear to be the temperature that flesh needs to reach, not the weapon causing the burn. You need much higher temperatures to cause instant wounds, and even higher if you're using a poor thermal conductor like air.]

    Beyond that, there's hot enough to weaken metal armor, but it takes time for metal to weaken, so you'd really need just a boatload of heat for that. With even more logistics problems and concern about the wielder coming with.

    Finally, before abandoning swords entirely, it's possible a flaming sword is used as a banner. Big bright object that you can use to coordinate your army, and unlike an actual banner it's still a sword in a pinch. However, battles are generally fought during the day, so it's not like fire is *that* visible. Still, potentially something dashing that people would romanticize in a setting where it was done.

    Cold swords are harder to guess since a magical cold source is even further from real world experience than a magical heat source. Similar thoughts though - does it flash frostbite people through armor (noting that armor consists of rather a lot of padding)? Does it cool metal so much it becomes brittle?

    > Or some other weapon?

    With enough heat differential, you can make a gun.

    Lobbing molten metal at people with a catapult might work, though it's a waste of good metal until at least the early modern period's equivalent technology.

    Pressing a hot plate to a castle wall or gate allows a lot more time for heat to transfer than a flaming sword does. You could alternate hot plates and cold plates to induce thermal stress. So a battering ram replacement might actually be practical here; it's lighter and requires less manpower than the tool it's replacing.

    Quick thoughts - most efficient steam engine depends on technology level. The key thing about them in this context is they're [external combustion engines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_combustion_engine) - it doesn't matter how you get the heat, so long as you can apply it to water. Traditional steam engines are good, but if your tech level permits you'll want a steam turbine or Stirling engine. In any case, the heater is crucial, while the cooler is a nice bonus - stationary steam engines/turbines aren't usually limited by water reserves, and real Stirling engines are built to function without magical heat sinks - though I imagine they would be a great boon to efficiency.

    Also, the best of using cooling limited to a single point is usually to put it at the top of a closed box, that's generally what fridges do.

    For 1, moderate heat by itself won’t weaken the weapon too much: https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/amp/metal-temperature-strength-d_1353.html

    But cooling the weapon back down for storage likely would damage it overtime from the repeated thermal expansion and contraction.

    For weaponizing these plates properly I think a sword is the wrong weapon to look at.  Any case where you can get touch contact to burn someone you could just cut them instead.  To make use of heating up something I think boiling oil or hot sand flung at an enemy makes more sense.  Once it makes contact it clings painfully allowing for more heat transfer.

    Is the heating/cooling a set amount of energy or proportional to the object mass set against the plate?  If it’s the 1st one storage or inactive use will be an issue (maybe a hot and cold plate against each other to cancel out?), but if it’s the 2nd case just remove whatever is in contact with the plate and let it heat the air to cut its output.

    Does the cooling work all the way down to absolute zero?  If so, with enough insulation and plates, even a primitive civilization could make use of stuff like liquid nitrogen and superconductivity.  Note that a magnet will naturally repel superconductors, a civilization could possibly find crude uses for this without understanding electricity or magnetism.

    I think [Carnot Engines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnot_heat_engine) and thermodynamics in general mean that greater temperature differentials increase the efficiency of any engine using temperature differences.  But smaller differentials are easier to use.  It would come down to a question of cost of working with greater temperature extremes vs cost of more plates.

    As far as weapons go, a hot sword doesn't seem to be the way to go. Instead, you'd want to go with a dart or an arrow, something that's intended to get stuck into an opponent and be hard to remove. Making it burn anyone who touches it would easily do that. The other alternative is something like a net or bolas, where it wraps around a target and is hard to remove that way.

    Mostly, I see the military applications being limited to something akin to barbed wire for the hot version and as a construction material for the cold version. If the cold version is cold enough to freeze water, then it's cold enough that a chicken wire mesh of it could be used to keep something like pykrete cold even in the summer, allowing for field fortifications and (if you can get enough of the stuff) entire self-repairing ships build out of water and sawdust.

  How academically literate could a staunchly Young Earth creationist society be/become?

  Say a theonomous nation emerges in North America sometime in the future, which we'll call Yecland. 

  The national religious institution, the Church of Yecland holds that as of 2000 A.D. the Earth is 6,000 years old, the universe was created in 6 24-hour days by God, the KJV Bible is a factually inerrant piece of literature, (aside from books that are clearly not nonfiction) inspired directly by the Holy Spirit, the only valid form of scriptural interpretation is historical-grammatical, and that the Church of Yecland is the one, holy, universal, and apostolic church that Jesus founded.

  Reason should dictate truth as long as it doesn't contradict the former axioms. 

  Believers are obligated to conform to the all of the Church's doctrine to remain in good standing. They're the only religion allowed to exist in Yecland. Heretics, schismatics, and apostates alike aren't criminalized, but instantly marginalize themselves, risking their professional status and interpersonal relationships. Clergy aren't politicians like in a theocracy, but Yeccish society is centered around their faith, orthodoxy defines all interactions and identities in some way. 

  Yecland is a federal republic not overly dissimilar from the USA with a capitalist mode of production, think [paleolibertarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolibertarianism), traditions are sacred, but so is property. You're not going to get along with most people very well if you're not enthusiastically pious and charitable.

  That being said, climate change, disease, scarcity, mortality, natural disasters, etc. are still very real problems. Consequences of humanity's Fallen nature and the physical results of moral bankruptcy.

  The Church believes God helps those who help themselves and that God gave humanity both the right and duty to exercise dominion over the Earth and overall universe. Genesis in the KJV technically only refers to the Earth, but the Yeccish are historical-grammatical literalists, not obtuse. The Earth isn't flat, there's cosmos out there for humanity to subdue and sanctify!

  Speaking more in the short term, what everyone does for the least of them, they did for Jesus. They must work to minimize suffering. 

  Assuming they start from a roughly 21st century level of knowledge and ability, how far they could go while sticking to their principles? 

  What would be some specific, major stumbling blocks for them?
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    So YEC contradicts cosmology/astrophysics (the speed of light and size of the universe indicates the age of the Earth is well over 6000 years), atomic theory/geology (radioactive decay and knowledge of the Earth’s core indicates the Earth is over 6000 years old), biology (evolution), geology, genetics, and more.  They cannot scientifically advance in these fields or related fields because they will be spending their intellectual capital on developing convoluted models around these problems.  For example, their physicists and astronomers will be spending time working on models of C-decay to explain how light could have reached earth instead of developing other models/theories that are better motivated by evidence.  Maybe with careful double-think, they can get engineering work done (IRL engineering has a higher ratio of YECs compared to other STEM fields).  However intellectual honesty and commitment to truth is going to continuously drive scientists to commit heresy, which will in turn make the Yecland society distrust and not value basic science until eventually they have fully retarded their scientific progress.

    Even nominally safe areas touch on forbidden conclusions.  Studying and managing Global Warming requires studying glaciers which in turn analysis of their pattern of freezing and melting the evidence left in the ice suggests the world is older than 6000 years.  So even if Yecland initially recognized global warming they would have to ban fields of science needed to study it.

    I think IRL, YEC is a root cause in science denialism.  Once you distrust science in one set of areas you stop trusting it in other areas whenever it is convenient.  In Yecland, as fields of science contradict the Orthodoxy, science is distrusted as a whole. This also screws up their goal of reducing suffering, even if they maintain research in sociology, all their sociologists will have seen what happened to the other scientific fields which will have a chilling effect and encourage then to push biased results consistent with Yecland orthodoxy.  Bad sociology in turn leads to bad choices in government and social policies.  I think no matter how good the Yeclanders initial intentions they will be scientifically crippled which in turn leads to bad policies that increase suffering.

      Presumably one could loophole oneself around the worst of the inaccuracies. For example, the size of the universe may indicate that the *universe* is a few billion years old, but that doesn't mean that the *Earth* is - it could have been made later. Similarly, radioactive decay might indicate that the Earth was assembled from old components, rather than that it is old itself.

      Scientists who come up with these 'loopholes' would probably be heartily encouraged by others, who would be glad that their views are not all that challenged... and when they found something that they couldn't loophole, they'd assume that the loophole was merely obscure enough that they couldn't figure it out on their own and they needed to search harder.

        There are Old Earth Creationists IRL, but they are less common than Young Earth Creationists and they get criticized from both angles: they aren’t ideologically pure enough for the religious fundamentalists and they aren’t scientific enough for secular intellectual circles.  Yecland might like them better than all the scientists that keep fleeing for other countries, but they won’t be encouraged in and of themselves.

        These Old Earth Creationists would also waste a lot of time, resources, and intellectual capital on continually developing loopholes and convoluted theories in the scientific side and defending there loophole driven theology on the religious side.  Enough so  that I would doubt their ability to seriously contribute to society.  The paleoliberatian ideology of society will also hurt their ability to get government funding.

    I suspect that science would be completely crippled. I was unable to find any Nobel-prize-winning YECists. [Creation.com](https://creation.com/creation-scientists) identifies only 196 YECist scientists (among all scientific fields!), among which only 152 appear to have PhDs. For contrast, as of 2019 the United States had 4.5 million people with PhDs [[Census.gov](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/02/number-of-people-with-masters-and-phd-degrees-double-since-2000.html)].

    Just to put even that into perspective, as of 2014, about 42% of Americans adhered to the YEC brand of creationism [[Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/170822/believe-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx)]. So, basically, among 134 million YECs, we only know of 152 who got PhDs, or 1.13 per million people. Among the remaining 184 million Americans, 4.5 million got PhDs, or 24 thousand PhDs per million Americans. An America full of creationists would likely end up with less than 1/10,000th of our current scientific capability.

    I expect that Yecland would see enormous brain drain as practically everyone smart enough to get admitted into doctoral programs abroad (like in France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, etc.) would be leaving to do so. Public science funding would probably be eliminated or reduced to bare-bones because of political opposition to scientific findings.

    Apart from science/christianity, the paleolibertarian ideology would cause some pretty immense problems, especially in terms of negative externalities (like pollution). Most of the country would be dealing with the same situation that Flint, MI is currently dealing with (or worse) because the water would be heavily contaminated with industrial waste products. Much of Colorado's water might even be contaminated with cyanide from its gold mines. Across most of the country, the sky would be a hazy gray with no visible sun on most days, and breathing it without a respirator would be roughly equivalent to smoking 20 cigarettes per day, like the air in Beijing. Nixon (of all people) didn't establish the EPA because everything was fine and dandy!

    You could expect to see a massive surge in cancer (due to arsenic, radioactive elements in coal ash, heavy metals, and even outright radioactive waste), intellectual disability due to lead exposure, as well as cognitive impairment (cretinism) due to chronic iodine deficiency throughout [the goiter belt](http://www.doctorsreview.com/history/goiters-be-gone/) once there's no longer an FDA to require iodine in salt. The quality of medical care would also likely decrease significantly since many of the most talented doctors would likely leave the country (like Chinese and Indian doctors do now), making these problems even harder to remedy.

    I think that they have a realistic chance of scientific progress in all fields if they posit that the Universe was created with pre-existing history for them to learn from. 

    In the case of evolution, for example, they know beyond any doubt that the Universe was created 6000 years ago, but the deity creating it left evidence that would show the course of events for a much longer time period before its creation. As their deity helps those that help themselves, and studying the universe to understand it is clearly both an example of helping oneself and an example of worship through studying the works of the deity, then this is clearly an opportunity left for the inquisitive. 

    Clearly, this fossil evidence is meant to show what could happen. Perhaps, it is hinting at what worlds that did not have direct divine attention could develop. Perhaps, it is hinting at the future of our chosen people, should they experience selection pressures. 

    This could be applied to a very large number of fields, but I suspect there's some blind spots that this would lead to that I'm not quite seeing.

      After doing a bit of research, it looks like the "universe with pre-existing history" hypothesis is not very common among YECs. Mostly, they claim that radioisotope dating can't be relied upon basically because "things might have been less radioactive back then", and the flood somehow magically explains all of the geological strata that we see. It's pretty much just a tactic of putting blinders on and pretending that there's not enough data to falsify their belief. The only ones I found that appear to go with the pre-existing history hypothesis claim that Satan (or godless archaeologists) intentionally placed the fossils to deceive people.

  Humans live in a world along with fey-like creatures. Inevitably, human encroachment onto lands controlled by the fey leads to conflict which is laughably one-sided against the humans.

  Fortunately for humanity, the fey hold ancient and deep grudges against one another, and are utterly contemptuous of the species. One fey queen schemes to bring about the fall of another using a human hero, resulting in her rival's soul being bound into the hero's rapier.

  That was forty years ago. Led by the hero, humanity fought a terrific twenty-year war that largely destroyed the fey. Veterans of this war each have a blade forged of steel and the mad, shattered soul of a fey creature.

  The swords have the ability to fool the senses of their wielder, as well as those of anyone whose blood is on the blade.

  Examples:

  * The wielder can render themself impervious to pain.

  * The wielder can overlay senses with those of the bound fey to see past illusions spun by other such creatures. They can also see heat, see in darkness, and sense nearby fey.

  * Reactions such as sound happen far more quickly than those of sight. One bound to such a blade may hear phantom sounds causing them to flinch or duck when needed.

  The blades are bound by complicated oaths which are updated much like modern firmware. Occasional bugs and glitches in these oaths cause erratic misbehavior in these weapons as the bound spirits lash out around them.

  Now that the war is over, many veterans serve as domestic police. They enforce the law, guard against insurrection, investigate criminal activity, and so on.

  TL/DR; I'd like help imagining a gritty police procedural in a low fantasy setting with prevalent mind magic.

  I'm looking for interesting oath glitches, subplot ideas, and other discussion people would find interesting about this setting.
