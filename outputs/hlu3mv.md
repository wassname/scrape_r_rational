## [HF] Pyrebound 14.5

### Post:

I look back at my posts months ago speculating that I'd be wrapping up by now, and laugh.  But hopefully I'll be able to be a bit more regular for the rest of the summer.

[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/07/05/chapter-14-5/](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/07/05/chapter-14-5/)

Pyrebound is a darkish fantasy I've been serializing for the past year and a half.  Every four days an evil star rises in the sky spreading death and disease over the earth, and human civilization is confined to cities built around giant magical fires called pyres.  Life is harsh, society is unjust, and sometimes a kid from the back end of nowhere gets fed up with it all.  If all this is new to you and you want to start at the beginning, [here you go](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thank you!

  Also in PB news, [I did a podcast about it](https://youtu.be/Na3hne7YsKg) with a couple of friends today.  Warning: the audio quality is far from top-notch--I had to use my laptop's microphone, so it cuts out in spots--but it's some behind-the-scenes stuff, a look at the worldbuilding, etc.  Also, I confess my fear that one of you is going to call me on my bullshit.

  I promise my voice is not usually that dweeby.  I think.

  After so long, Ram makes what seems like his final return to Dul-K. I'm hoping Rammash can rally the people and the former militiamen into forming a coalition to oppose or balance out the interests of the elites. Only through institution-building can Ram effect lasting change in the region.

  On the other hand, he could use violence to cow or disable his enemies, but I don't think that would be productive or profitable long term.

    Really, it was too subtle for *Piridur*.

  This work really stands out as a fantastic piece of world-building. The setting is at once harsh, unique, and flavorful.

  The protagonist is also remarkable. He's smart, human, good-natured - and yet, constantly challenged in many ways, often needing to exercise his judgment and frequently compromise to survive.
