  I want to make experiments on mana now :

  **Serie I of Experiences: Do mana have mass?**

  *Experience 1a:*

  Does mana have weight?Two box identical, one with mana, the other without. Is there a difference of weight? 

  *Experience 1b:*

  If mana has mass, what the law of mass concentration like? If a mage sense “two time the mana” in the box, is it equivalent to 2 time the mass? Are “a lot of mana” equivalent to “a lot of mass of mana”?
  Draw the curve: “mass concentration” vs “mana quantity” (we need a way to measure what mana “power” is :  a magical tool which stop working at a precise amount for instance)
  Result: with the curve “weight” vs “mana power/quantity/whatever/” we can measure simply the mana of a region with a simple balance between a box without mana and one with local mana. The curve give then a coefficient between the two values. 

  *Experience 1C:*

  If no weight can be detected, try to detect inertia: send a high velocity bullet against the two box. Do they have the same momentum after? if no, mana have intertia. Repeat 1b to have the curve “inertia” against mana quantity.
  If no weight but inertia is detected, mana is not affected by gravitational force but have a mass (which sound really weird)
  If the weight and inertia is detected, this is an important step to demonstrate that mana is made of normal matter.
  Is weight and inertia are not detected, mana has no mass. 

  **Serie II of Experiences: What are the constituent of mana?**

  *Experience 2a:*

  Try to find a way to “destroy” a magical object with too much mana. can we “enchant” a gas inside a lightbulb? When we put too much mana inside the lightbulb, what is the spectrum? the same that the gas of the lightbulb or other element are appearing?
  If the elements in the spectrum correspond to element not in the gas, we have discovered some constituent of mana. If not but we observe some spectral characteristic, with a few quantum mechanics formula and theory, we can learn a lot about what is mana. If there is no special signal with mana, I don’t know… try to find a signal in ultraviolet? in infrared? 

  *Experience 2b:*

  Are there a way to destroy mana? is yes, can we destroy mana in a box where there is a vacuum? What happen then? are there any deposition on the box? like carbon trace. Is there any gas inside the box? Are the deposition/gas a known material or a new material? what are their properties? 
  If mana has mass, do the mass change? Can we have a conservation law of mass with mana? 

  **Serie III of Experiences: What are the thermodynamics properties of mana?**

  *Experience 3a:*

  Does mana have temperature? 

  *Experience 3b:*

  Does mana have a pressure? Probably not if it can pass inside solid. But artificial zones without mana exist so the frontier can create a separation. A pressure can be exerted against this “frontier” ? This pressure change in function of the local density of mana ?

  *Experience 3C :*

  Can we heat mana if we compress it? Is mana really like a gas? Are mana respect the law of thermodynamics?
  *Experience 3D :*

  If mana can be made colder (with decompression for instance), does mana have different phase? liquid mana ? solid mana ? plasma mana ? other form ? can the mana be used in this form ? do they traverse solid/liquid/gas in the same way ? 
  If heated too much, do me have a decomposition in different elements? (if mana are nanorobots, heat them and you will have the constituent of the nanorobot for instance)


  After all of these experience, and a lot of work on the theory, I think a good laboratory of a few people can have a really good idea of what mana is. If quantum and statistical theory are known, the result of the spectrum and an equation of state can really show what are mana. I’m sure you will have other idea of experience.

  Other random idea : what is the law of concentration of mana in function of altitude ? if mana is influenced by gravity, and pressure, these can explain easily why the concentration increases inside the planet.
  Do mana exist in space? launch a satellite with mana experiment on it.
  If mana have a spectrum, can we detect mana in the sun ? in other star ? a possible detection of life/magic in other solar system ?
  If mana is made of mundane element, can we destroy mana to extract matter ? if mana is made in part of platinum or gold ….

  Where the energy of mana come from? Are mana radioactive? what is the comportment of mana against a radioactive material? Where can we put mana in the periodic table? What happens in a electromagnetic field ? Can we accelerate mana-particules inside a accelerator ? So many questions, so many !science! ….

  I wonder if Zorian and Zach could share mana more effectively since the soul meld.
  ```

  - u/GodKiller999:
    ```
    They both have a bit of the other, so it might be possible.

  I find it interesting that ambient mana is so deadly while mana attuned to somebody else is not.

  It's like magic is sourced from a malevolent (or possibly just Lovecraftian) horror, and souls adapted to its presence to attune mana for their use.
  ```

  - u/GodKiller999:
    ```
    It's actually the very reason people think the dragon below hates humans, cause the ambient mana it creates is toxic to them.

    Though IMO it's just a simple law of magic, it's not cause some things are toxic that they're evil.
    ```

    - u/None:

      Well, MoL's mana is very psychoreactive. It has to be, since things need a brain to think, and you need to think to cast, at least on some level (even if that level is low-level functions of a magi-beast's brain).

      Since mana is psychoreactive, it does make sense that, were a super spooky wyrm exist in the Deep Forgotten Tunnels of Deepness Long Forgotten^TM that shat out enough mana on a regular basis that the entire planet was more or less suffused with it, it could actually be a fairly toxic thing.

      Here's another question:

      How can raw mana only degrade physical structures when "absorbed", whatever that means, if it functions as a sort of radiation that penetrates solid matter?

      How can it be both intangible enough to just say "lol, what nuclear bonds?" and permeate stuff, yet tangible when, for lack of a better term, spiritually ingested? What sort of state-change does it undergo?

      On top of that, why is it presented that souls generate mana from nothing?

      Could it not be that souls have a type of metabolic function on the spiritual level, and that mana is either the or an excretion of that process?

      I mean, MoL has different planes of existence. Souls could be feeding on the plane of infinite punch energy, and simply digest metaphysical punches into mana.
      ```

        >I mean, MoL has different planes of existence. Souls could be feeding on the plane of infinite punch energy, and simply digest metaphysical punches into mana.

        Unlikely that it is another plane since then the time loop would be interfering with magic since it cuts of access to other planes.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          A good point.

          Perhaps it's an inherent factor? Souls on any plane are always siphoning from the Mana Plane^TM?

          I mean, if you have layered realities with drill-through stlye planar tunneling, then it doesn't really matter which plane any given soul is on at any given time.
          ```

- u/DerSaidin:
  ```
  > A soul bond, such as that between a familiar and caster, makes sharing mana easier. Frequent mana sharing between same people will cause them to gradually get used to each other’s mana, likewise easing mana sharing… though only between those specific individuals. Some creatures and bloodlines can innately use other people’s mana with greater ease than normal.

  Hints to Zach's very large mana pool? Zach's original marker is like a soul bond to the sovereign gate that lets him access more mana?
  ```

  - u/cjet79:
    ```
    Maybe, but I thought Zach had said he always had a large mana pool.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > he always had a large mana pool

      IIUC, that's supposed to be the reason why he struggled in his first two years at the academy: he had control roughly equivalent to magnitude 25.
      ```
