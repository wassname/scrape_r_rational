## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have the ability to create regions of space ("voids") that destroy any matter within them.

  * The regions are always 10cm radius spheres
  * You can create them anywhere within the 3m sphere surrounding your body. Created voids must be anchored to a solid object also within the 3m sphere and maintain a constant position relative to that object.
  * Voids stop existing when their anchor is sufficiently disrupted (e.g. broken into pieces or melted). There is no other way to destroy voids
  * Destroying matter does not result in any energy release due to the lost mass
  * Matter can freely enter voids, therefore creating one in an atmosphere would result in fairly rapid loss of said atmosphere.

  What productive uses are there of this ability?

    Disposing of nuclear waste or highly toxic chemical waste.

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    I thought of another use for this ability: nigh-invincible shields. Cover the surface of a shield with voids and it becomes immune to physical attacks. 

    Not recommended for use within the atmosphere, but would be incredibly useful in space. You would coat the exterior of a spaceship with voids, and then you can fly through asteroid fields without fear since all asteroids would be destroyed by the voids before they can hit your ship. Just remember to remove the voids when you want to land your ship somewhere.

    You could also cheaply terraform Venus: get solid objects that can withstand the heat and acid of the atmosphere of Venus, attach voids to them, and drop them down to Venus. Most will probably be destroyed, but some would survive. Over time, their voids would eat up the entire atmosphere of Venus, removing all the toxic gases and greenhouse gases that cause the planet to be ridiculously hot and uninhabitable. Once that's done, you now have a nearby Earth-sized planet that you can colonize. There would still be problems like no atmosphere and reduced distance to the sun, but overcoming these problems is much easier than dealing with the toxic atmosphere of Venus.
    ```

    - u/NoNotCar:
      ```
      The asteroid protection shield would probably be more useful as a cosmic ray protection shield, as you really have to try and hit an asteroid in space and cosmic rays are mainly high energy atomic nuclei which would be destroyed by voids.
      ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Hold on a sec, a void destroys any matter within them, but is anchored to a solid object within itself which, when destroyed, causes the void to stop existing. So whenever you create a void, it immediately destroys its anchor and ceases to exist? Or is the anchor magically immune to the void powers? If the anchor is immune, how would it be broken into pieces when anything that enters the void is destroyed before it can reach the anchor? 

    Well, under the assumption that the anchor is immune to the void's own destructive properties, the next question is: what counts as a solid object? What is the minimum mass necessary? Does a single atom of iron count as a solid, since iron is a solid at room temperature? If so, do military applications count as productive uses? Because the energy needed to accelerate a really tiny mass to ridiculous speeds is pretty cheap, especially with your void negating any kind of friction or air resistance. You could construct a powerful railgun that launches tiny bullets with anchored voids at absolutely ridiculous speeds, and watch them utterly destroy a 10cm radius cylinder with an absolutely ridiculous range. 

    It would also penetrate EVERYTHING. No wall or armor will block your bullet from reaching your target, then piercing through the target, and then continuing onwards, thanks to the matter destroying void. It would only ever stop if it enters an environment hot enough to melt the bullet from infrared radiation alone, (or is somehow electromagnetized/gravitized to a stop, which is ludicrously improbable since there would need to be a reverse-copy of your railgun that has to be in the exact path of the void and activate at the exact time to stop it). You could fire your void-railgun at any meteors too close to the earth, and they'll be utterly destroyed one 10cm tube at a time. Though you would need to fire a really large number of shots, so I suggest doing it in space where you won't destroy the earth's atmosphere.
    ```

  - u/sickening_sprawl:
    ```
    If a void has to be anchored to an object in the void and is dissipated when the object is destroyed, but destroys any matter within the void, then it'd be either indestructible or immediately destroy itself. I assume you had something else in mind?

    Selling to the army for super-armor piercing rounds. Making very good vacuums for scientific experiments. Perfect heat sink/radiators for power generators if it treats photons as matter, maybe. Holding the world hostage or you drop one to the earth's core/drain the ocean/destroy the atmosphere.
    ```

    - u/NoNotCar:
      ```
      Sorry, I meant that you anchored the void to an object in the 3m sphere surrounding you but not contained within the void (therefore setting the void's frame of reference without arbitrarily setting it to the earth).

      Also photons are not counted as matter (especially as it's unclear whether long wavelength EM waves like radio are within the void at all)
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        >Sorry, I meant that you anchored the void to an object in the 3m sphere surrounding you but not contained within the void (therefore setting the void's frame of reference without arbitrarily setting it to the earth).

        Oooh. That makes more sense. Okay, void-railgun will be a little harder now, but still doable. You would just need to anchor voids surrounding your tiny bullets in every direction, so you get a roughly spherical blob of voids with a tiny hole in the center for your bullet. This does mean your fire rate will become slower though, since you would need to create multiple voids per bullet.
        ```

        - u/NoNotCar:
          ```
          Since the railgun projectile core is effectively in a vacuum it would have nothing slowing it down so after hitting the target would travel in a weird orbit inside the earth (net gravity gets weaker as you go further inside) until it melted due to infrared radiation, possibly traveling back to the surface and causing more destruction. This is probably more than you want from a "super armor piercing round".
          ```

          - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
            ```
            Which is why the question is: how small can the bullet be? If the bullet has to be regular size, then it would be as slow as normal bullets and thus be stuck in Earth's gravity well, causing all kinds of havoc on it's atmosphere.

            But if the bullet can be way smaller, like on the scale of atomic particles, you can now fire it at ridiculous speeds. Acceleration = Force / Mass, so with a small enough mass you can probably construct railguns that fire out void bullets at way faster than escape velocity, causing the bullets to just carve out a near-instant ~20cm radius cylinder from your railgun to outer space. Not a whole lot of damage to the Earth overall, but absolutely devastating to anything in its path.

    Some things to note:

    1. Use inside atmosphere will create powerful air currents, which means this is an engine and can self-propell.

    2. If it is anchored relative to the orientation of the object, it can travel (near-arbitrarily) faster than the speed of light.

    3. This is remarkably dangerous and wasteful.

    4. Some things are nearly impossible to destroy, like single atoms.

    5. You can assassinate basically anyone with a matchstick.

  Softer munchkin question: given a supernaturally fast ability to learn any skill (social skills, craftman skills, cognitive debiasing, etc.) or knowledge (academia, world-knowledge, etc.), what are some highly useful skills to have in a late 1800's/early 1900's world?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Mostly the same skills as today? Social skills (and/or con artist skills) to make connections. Science skills and invention skills to make inventions that make your life easier. If you're paranoid, pick up survival skills and martial arts and medical skills, all of which could protect your life in different situations. 

    The only skills that would be different are skills that depend on the era's technology. E.g. computer skills are useless in the early 1900's, since computers don't exist. On the other hand, library skills would be useful since you would need to look up information in library books rather than just google them.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    How fast is "supernaturally fast."? 10x faster than normal? 100x faster than normal? 1000x faster than normal? Is the rate skill-dependent, or does it vary? Strategies vary a lot depending on exactly how fast you're learning.

        You can reach mastery in pretty much everything given two weeks. I'd pick up an instrument, get really good, gain some notoirety (while picking up various charisma and crowd control skills) and then leverage that quickly into fame and fortune as an entertainer, and leverage that into whatever I wanted. 100x speed learning is real broke, as you can reach peak human skill in a profession given about a year.

  You have a notebook that can faithfully answer the question "what would person [X] do in the situation I'm in?" However, it takes 24hrs for you to switch people.

  Edit: Switching people constitutes actually meeting them in person and making them autograph/write something the notebook. You can also simulate non-human organisms by having them mark the notebook somehow.  (ame can be done with objects, but the answer to a toaster's response to an awkward social situation will usually be 'nothing.)
  ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:

    Step 1: choose smartest possible person.  
    Step 2: ask the notebook  

    You situation is having a notebook that faithfully answers the question "what would person [X] do in the situation I'm in?".

    They choose to ask the same question, but with a smarter and smarter person.

    Eventually someone realizes that they're recursing, and comes up with better idea.

    Step 3: Copy that idea  
    Step 4: realize too late that their idea was predicate on being simulated, and therefore involves getting their simulator to unwittingly aid their real-world self in some way.  
    Step 5: Deal with fallout from step 4  
    Step 6: Realize that *you're* being simulated by someone trying to figure out what to do with their magic notebook.  
    Step 7: Attempt to solve unsolved mathematics problems, so your simulator thinks you're useful and continues to simulate you.  
    Step 8: Try not to cry. Cry a lot.

      I'm not sure I understand Step 4. Also, how would someone know if recursion were happening?

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        >Also, how would someone know if recursion were happening?

        If it's possible for a notebook to simulate someone, and it's possible to simulate a person who used the notebook to simulate someone, then it's much more likely that you're one of the people being simulated by the notebook than the base-level simulator.

        Step-4 is just an extension of that. You can assume you're being simulated by someone who wants to see what you do so they can copy it, so you do something that on the surface seems helpful (doing something to further your own goals) so that the simulator duplicates it to further *their* own goals, but really the intent is that the simulator's actions help your "real" self.

        Although that's perhaps too adversarial a view. I could, for example, reveal my time-travel password to the simulator, so they could call up my real self and convince me to help in return for some favor.

    Does person [X] have to be a real person? Or a living one? If so, you now have a tool for determining if someone is alive or real. Quickly ask "what god would do" to determine if god exists.

    If it doesn't have to be real, just ask what an omniscient person would do.
    ```

    - u/ashinator92:
      ```
      Funny how that works. In a situation like this, not only can you perhaps determine whether someone is alive or real, but you also have an objective source of identity(xD) confirmation.

        Hmm, the notebook is a lot less powerful then, seeing as if you could convince someone into signing your shady notebook so you can ask the notebook what they would do in situation X, you might as well just *directly* ask them what they would do in situation X.

        In this case, it would be more useful as a lie detector of sorts, since the notebook would tell you what they really would do, not what they say they would do. You would essentially force or trick someone into signing your notebook and then abuse the notebook to learn all their secrets.

        Just write "What would [X] do if they were somehow forced to say all their secrets?", then, since they are forced to say all their secrets, what they would do is to say all their secrets, and your notebook will show them saying all their secrets. Hopefully your notebook is nice enough to say what those secrets are specifically, rather than just say "They would say all their secrets." If the latter happens, you are going to need more tricky questions.

    Ask people to sign guest book. Steal/copy their visa card and empty the account. (You are in the bank and want to get money, what would person x do? Putting the code in.) You could empty my bank account, if you have my mobile phone and my autograph in the notebook. (Well maybe fingerprint scans would save me, but I also have a normal code.)

    Hard to say what else. Make traps for people, so you can blackmail them. Or get people to confess to crimes. 

    Less illegal: Get an expert, and you can use his/her expertise for your work. Depending on how fast the notebook is, the notebook could be better than the expert. (If it doesn't need time to think.) You could get months of work (blueprints) from experts, with only one day waiting. (If you are in the situation to have worked on a project for the last months.)

  I'm not sure whether this belongs in this thread or the worldbuilding thread, but today is Saturday, so it's going here.

  A world I'm working with has special crystals that can be magically entangled in pairs, such that any light that enters one exits the other, and likewise for sound. Imagine one of the portals from _Portal_, but with a glass barrier preventing matter from passing through, and then make that baseball-sized and omnidirectional.

  Aside from magitech telephones, I'm at a loss for what else they'd end up being used for. I know that wormholes which can transmit information faster than light can possibly violate causality, but setting up the necessary reference frames would be difficult with the setting's current level of tech, and there are already easier methods of time travel available.
  ```

  - u/Nulono:
    ```
    If this works for all vibrations, and not just ones we'd consider "sound" or "light", then these could possibly act as very compact heat sinks. Attach one to your computer, and throw the other one in a giant tank of water.
    ```

  - u/jimmy77james:
    ```
    When you say light passes through, do you mean all electromagnetic radiation or just the visible spectrum? You might be able to do some interesting x-ray optics stuff not really possible in our world, or use them as amazing wifi/coms range extenders.

    Building a massive array of mirrors out in a remote section of desert that all focus light on to one of these crystals might get you an interesting portable light/heat bomb.

    (You build the array first, then when it is dark outside you slip a crystal into the focus point and put its pair wherever you want all that light to end up - e.g. an enemy’s base)

    If you built the array to only hit one side of the crystal, you could attach the matching one to a stick of some sort to make a rod that could be used as a fairly devastating weapon. You might be able to use it for something non-violent like clearing snow/heating a base you’ve built on land that was previously unusable due to cold weather)
    ```

    - u/SevenTrillionNipples:
      ```
      To clarify, pretty much anything that can pass through, for example, a glass paperweight passes through the link between the crystals (with the exception of things like "a bullet" or "a hot enough metal rod"). The crystal itself does have properties of its own, though, so some wavelengths will likely be absorbed rather than transmitted, and images that are transmitted will have a fish-eye distortion.

      The world is mostly preindustrial, so Wi-Fi is out of the question, but I like your idea of using them as "heat bombs", so long as you can find a crystal that doesn't melt or crack under the stress.

    You're still going to need to limit things to lightspeed unless it's canon in your universe that no advanced civilizations will ever arise in the future (which obviously has bad implications for human civilization). 

    The main issue here being that there's almost certainly lots of crystal pairs that are going to stick around for a very long time. So if an advanced civilization ever finds one they could manipulate relativistic reference frames to affect one of the crystals in the pair up to when it was created. This an issue because not only could they communicate using it (perhaps convincing anyone on the other side to follow certain commands using superhuman charisma) but it's also very probably that it could use extremely precise lasers to construct the first generation of self replicating nanobots so it can directly instantiate itself in the past.

  I'm sure I've asked this before, but if I have, I can't find which thread it was in.

  Human beings have an ability (known as "subitizing") to judge how many items are in small sets (about 1 to 4 items) quickly and accurately. This is distinct from counting and estimating in that it quickly considers the group as a whole instead of marking off set elements individually, and tends to have a high degree of accuracy.

  What would be a good use of an unlimited subitizing range? To clarify, this is just a "processing boost", not a supernatural "counting ability", so you could tell how many circles are in [this image](https://i.imgur.com/EW0V6To.png)^\([144](/spoiler)\) as quickly and easily as you can tell how many are in [this image](https://i.imgur.com/RKKeIoX.png)^\([3](/spoiler)\) but you *couldn't* tell how many grains are in [this bag of rice](https://i.imgur.com/DopriwO.jpg).
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    To clarify, is the problem with the bag of rice because you can't see all of the rice inside the bag? So if say, you dumped all the rice out on a flat surface, such that no rice grain is blocking the view of another, you would be able to count them all instantly? In other words, your ability work as long as you can actually see each item and think "yep that's an item"?

    Well, one thing that immediately jumps to mind is that a microbiologist would find this ability very useful. A common thing they have to do is analyze the amount of bacteria that is infesting something. To do that, they take a small sample of that something and put it under a microscope, and then actually manually count the bacteria one by one. (They choose a really small sample so there's only like a hundred bacteria on one). They can't exactly use a computer because some cells aren't easy to recognize for a computer (at least, last I checked. It has been a while since then).

    And that would be a general idea. Look for large populations of items that computers would have trouble recognizing, like faces. Or shoes. A lot of mundane things are actually pretty hard for a computer to recognize just because of how vaguely defined they are (what's a shoe, specifically? What's the difference between a shoe and a sock?) and how different they look under different lighting (our brains automatically adjust for lighting in most cases. It's kinda insane when you think about it). With your processing boost, you would be able to count these things far better than a computer can. 

    This would also be useful for researching the popularity of various events and locations. A single glance would be enough for you to tell how many people are on a street (if you're looking down on them from a building) or how many people are attending an event like a concert.
    ```

    - u/Nulono:
      ```
      Yeah, that's the problem with the bag of rice; spreading them out in a monolayer would let you tell how many there are easily. I only added that clarification because I've asked the same question elsewhere, and got answers such as "guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar" or "counting how many inhabited planets there are".

      You make a very good point about counting things that are difficult for computers to recognize.

    Assuming you don't care about your country, you could just flee. Even if the war is worldwide, there's plenty of wilderness no one cares about, though you would have to adapt to a much lower standard of living since there won't be much civilization in these places. Middle class is enough wealth to stockpile tons of cheap food and water and transport them to your hideout in the middle of nowhere.

    If you're unwilling or unable to move to the middle of nowhere, at least move to a rural area. Cities are basically holding up large "NUKE ME" signs in war, and there's nothing a middle class citizen can really do to prepare against a nuke. Even if you build a shelter and somehow survive in it, you're still stuck that that shelter for years before the nuclear radiation levels drop back to a safe level. You would need something like a fallout vault, and that's way beyond the price range of a middle class citizen.

    >You think there is a non-insignificant chance of a military conflict -- or some other similar crisis -- breaking out near where you live (or worldwide), somewhere in the next several years. Your character is a middle class citizen. What preparations do you make for such possible scenario?

    I think there's a "non-insignificant chance of a military conflict -- or some other similar crisis" happening, considering america is *already* involved in an overseas conflict, and will likely continue to be. And I'm not really doing anything unusual because of that-- it's just business as usual. So I'm going to raise the chance of not just a military conflict, but outright war to "more likely than not" to keep things interesting.

    Because considering that many of us live in the US, a local war begins at "civil war" and ends with "nuclear holocaust."

    That's going to destabilize the entire planet something fierce. So aside from whatever prepper stuff you can afford, you need to go somewhere remote and in the southern hemisphere. I personally would get a job in brazil for reasons I won't get into here, but other south american countries and africa would also be "good" locations.

    Financially, the ideal would be to sell most stocks and bonds, and invest in gold as it tends to outpace other investments in times of crisis. Investments in the US defense industry would also bear fruit-- in the leadup to war, more contracts would get handed out.

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    If we've learned anything from the recent wars in the Middle East, or the conflict in Ukraine, your absolute best bet would be to move to a safer and more stable country before the outbreak of war.

    If you're dead-set on staying where you are, then you'll want to prepare for several problems:

    1) **Loss of utilities:** You'll want solar panels and a rainwater harvesting and storage system to serve as backups in the event of power failure and loss or contamination of municipal water supply. This can be an issue with or without war (as we've seen with Flint) and it may actually save you money depending on local tax incentives and mean solar irradiance for your area. Heating is also a concern - consider stocking up on firewood if you're reliant on natural gas and at risk of experiencing freezing temperatures and inability to cook meals if your natural gas supply ever fails.

    2) **Fire:** Firebombing, nuclear flash-fires and even wildfires (as we saw in California recently) are a serious potential threat. Your best bet is to get a home which offers you at least a 100 foot buffer zone in all directions where you can minimize potential fuel sources. You'll also want the exterior of your home to be made resistant to catching fire from embers blowing in the wind or radiant heat sources (e.g. wildfires and nuclear flash ignition). Brick or concrete construction with ceramic roofing would be ideal.

    3) **Wind:** This includes nuclear blasts, with lower speeds as you get further from any likely targets for a nuclear strike. This also includes hurricanes and tornadoes, which you may face with or without a war depending on your location. Aim for sturdy construction with thick walls, possibly reinforced concrete, storm windows, and hurricane ties to keep your roof down.

    4) **Flooding:** Dams are a major target of potential attack in a war, so consider whether or not your home lies in the path of a potential floodplain. Flooding in general is also a significant concern, war or not. Check out [FEMA's flood zone maps](https://msc.fema.gov/portal) which you can download to see which places are best to avoid in whatever location you're interested in moving to. In general, try to find a location which is uphill of most of its surroundings.

    5) **Famine:** Even if your house is still standing, nearby farms can be destroyed in fires or floods, and routes for shipping in food can be bombed or blocked by flooding or military checkpoints. Stock up canned food and cycle through it, periodically eating the oldest canned food and buying new canned food to keep a fresh supply which won't be expired when you need it. It also wouldn't hurt to grow some edible plants in a garden around your home, as long as you can expand the garden for full self-sufficiency if needed.

    6) **Looting:** Having the one house that still has its lights on at night and didn't get flooded, burned, or blown down puts you at significant risk of getting looted or potentially evicted from your own home. Purchasing a gun and a security system to warn you of a home invasion are likely your best bet.

    7) **Even worse:** War is really messy, and the aforementioned items are just the common things which create millions of refugees. Even worse possibilities include chemical weapons, or organized groups (military or otherwise) who roam around raping/massacring civilians. Against this, you'll want an escape option. An extra can or two of gas, plus supplies for minor repairs and maintenance (replacing a tire, jump starting your car, etc.), and ready-to-go supplies including food, water, blankets, fire-starting materials, basic tools (e.g. a map, a compass, an axe, some screwdrivers, some wrenches, a pair of scissors, a knife, a sewing needle, thread, a roll of duct tape, a length of rope or chain, etc.) would be a good start.

  I've been thinking about mundane superpowers a lot, and one that's been in my mind for a while is the concept of a character with "perfect" vision. The character would probably be artificially created, either through robotics or genetic engineering, with the following abilities:

  * visual sensitivity sharp enough to distinguish individual photons

  * full acuity across the entire "retina" and not just the fovea (and no blind spot)

  * perception of wavelength directly, rather than sensors for primary colors, such that "red light plus green light" is perceived differently from "yellow light".

  * sensitivity to wavelengths outside the typical "visible light" spectrum

  * robustness to optical illusions

  The character would still be vaguely humanoid, so no saucer-sized eyes to pick up the more sparsely distributed wavelengths, and he'd still have to account for the slight blurring of light that passes through his pupil, unless there's some way to mitigate that.

  Off the top of my head, he'd have excellent vision at night and over long distances, including basically being a walking thermal imaging camera, but I was wondering if there might be some more out-of-the-box uses of this power that make it more powerful than it seems.

    A really similar power was recently asked in another Saturday thread. You can see the responses [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/88j79b/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dwl90s1/)
