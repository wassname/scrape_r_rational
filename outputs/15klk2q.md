  I finally caught up to The Game at Carousel, a horror-themed litRPG. The general gist is that people get trapped in a town that runs on horror movies tropes, and are forced into playing different games based on those where at least one party member needs to survive or they all permanently die. RR link is here: https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65629/the-game-at-carousel-a-horror-movie-litrpg#toc. It's also one of the most popular RR stories right now. It's been recommended several times but I haven't seen it mentioned here in the past few months. It's not rational, but it is internally consistent and the characters have decent motivations.

  I was intrigued but not amazed by what I read previously, and got up to a part mid-way through the "Grotesque" game when it was finally revealed what happens to those who refuse to obey the rules and play the games. That was around chapter 35, and the most recent chapter is 89, so there was a decent amount to catch up on. If you've been out of the loop for a while, the games so far have been:

  * The Final Straw II: an introductory game where most of the actions happens off-screen. Let's the protagonist, Riley, learn about Carousel.

  * The Astralist: Riley and his friends investigate a castle-cum-museum where people have disappeared over the years.

  * Delta Epsilon Delta: Riley and co. attend a college party where a serial killer dressed as a rival team's mascot is stalking his victims for unknown reasons.

  * The Grotesque: after a newcomer to Carousel refuses to play, Carousel comes knocking. Riley joins some veteran players to try and get the Hysteric Janette to play along before she finds out what happens to those break the rules.

  * (In between games, Riley and his friends learn about Dina's reasons for coming to Carousel, and some surprising information about how Carousel - or something in it - has been manipulating events to make sure specific people show up)

  * Even More Stories from the Campfire: Fatal Folktales: Riley and his friends get put into a three-part anthology of spooky stories. While it starts as a typical tale, Carousel seems to start malfunctioning, leading to some unexpected insights.

  * Subject of Inquiry: Riley and his friends get jobs at a laboratory in town and try to unravel what is being studied and why the security protocols are so incredibly strict... And why a lot of positions recently opened up there.

  * (more side content about the veterans' plans to explore a strange building in the mountains outside of town)

  * Black Snow: To take a break, Riley and friends join the Bowlers and some other players to unwind at a bowling alley. And then the apocalypse happens (ahead of schedule). This arc just started.

  I think the story overall has maintained and even improved its quality, making it a good page turner. Each arc has some good mystery, spine-tingles, and a bit more of the meta narrative is revealed. I still can't guess where things are going, which keeps it good, and each arc/game is different enough to keep me impressed by all the scenarios the author has made up. My biggest issue is something I noticed with WtC as well: the author clearly has a ton of ideas, but only a handful can get explored. Unfortunately, that means a lot of omens and tropes get mentioned and then purposely ignored, which feels like a bit too much writing spent on things that ultimately aren't relevant. I'd like *more* of the slice-of-life side chapters, but too many of them spend time on content that doesn't advance the plot. Another issue, though smaller, is that Riley is the only fleshed out character. We know the stats and tropes of his friends, but if you skip reading blue boxes, you can list maybe a handful of details about each (honestly, some NPCs are more fleshed out, it feels). This has gotten better over time, but Riley is still the only really realized character.

  Still, overall I'd recommend it, and I'd you (like I) haven't caught up in a few months, there's a lot of good meta-plot development and the horror stories and mystery still remain strong.

    [Assuming that your request included all types of fanfics, not just SI fanfics.]

    Checking my list of 1,982 Worm fics, I see only one "8+/10" fic that was written in late 2022 or 2023. It's [Nineveh](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nineveh-worm.1073690/), a complete 40K "wheels within wheels" novella, which is a pretty good match for this sub.

    I have read a number of good non-Worm fics over the last year, but they tended to be older. Of the ongoing Naruto fics, [The Pixie of the Hidden Leaf](https://archiveofourown.org/works/44908171), a Tanya the Evil crossover, is nice. [Orochimama](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49746/orochimama) started in 2022, updated in 2023 and is now on hiatus while the author is sorting out health issues. It's quite funny.

    Of the older Naruto fics, Rathanel's were nice. The best one was [The Empty Cage](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305950/1/The-Empty-Cage), a Kurama!Naruto story. It was building up to an impressive comedy of errors -- as various parties misinterpreted the evidence in increasingly convoluted ways -- when it died. It's also at least rational-adjacent; there were a few times when I had to reread conversations to make sure that I understood all of the layers. [Swapping the Cage](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7832146/1/Swapping-The-Cage), an alternative take on the same theme, was pleasant. In [Naruto: Ramen Days](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7820743/1/Naruto-Ramen-Days) Naruto gained RPG-like powers; not as good as the other 2 fics, but mildly amusing.

    [Scorpion's Disciple](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5166693/1/) is an older Naruto fic by the author of *Mother of Learning* and rather enjoyable if you can handle SPAG issues.

    [Valkyrie's Shadow](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39336), a rational "fleshing out" of the Overlord (light novel/anime, not the game) universe, started strongly in Book 1 and Book 2, with excellent characterization of truly non-human characters. Unfortunately, the slow pace of the fic got progressively worse in Books 3 and 4. I am currently reading Book 5 and it's a bit of a struggle. Still, Books 1 and 2 were a good read and can stand on their own.

    [A Young Girl's Weaponization of the Mythos](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-weaponization-of-the-mythos-youjo-senki-cthulhu-mythos-crack-parody.1062200/) is not quite as good as the deservedly famous [A Young Woman's Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/), but it's pleasant and, at times, quite funny.

    Ave Xia Rem Y is one of those stories that take it as a challenge to include all of the tropes of a genre, but make it good.

    [Skitterdoc 2077](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/skitterdoc-2077.109765/#post-25732717) has Taylor from Worm swap places with an alternate version of herself from Cyperpunk, while getting Bonesaw's power.

    [Twisted Garden](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/twisted-garden-pokemon-erika-au.1085469/#post-91722453) is a darker pokemon fanfic following Erika, that takes some inspiration from Xianxia.

  I've been reading Godclads recently after seeing it recommended here and overall I'm enjoying it, but about halfway through >!Zein Thousandhand!< shows up and holy hell she is utterly intolerable. It's only been a couple of chapters of dealing with this character and I'm seriously considering dropping the story altogether because it seems to be setting her up as a mentor to the protagonist. It's like an edgy teenager wrote a character they thought would be *cool* and inserted it into what was otherwise an enjoyable story. It feels as though Coldsteel the Hedgehog was randomly shoved into Shadowrun. 

  I originally went on much longer about how frustrating I find this character, but decided to spare us all by deleting the rant. For people who have read more of the story, does she end up sticking around? Nothing against anyone who likes her, I'd just rather save myself the frustration.

  Any interesting space opera?
  ```

  - u/DAL59:
    ```
    The classic would be the 1988 anime Legend of the Galactic Heroes (don't watch the modern remake, the original is already a paragraph by paragraph adaptation of the books, all the remake offers is uglier character designs and even uglier CGI.).  Its a space opera, but only about one in six episodes involve any space battles, instead it is mostly focused on political intrigue between the Empire and Alliance, and the factions and subfactions within them. Its essentially the aesthetics of Star Wars, but without any magic, and much more mature and serious, with an Empire that deals with the real problems of running an empire, and a Rebel Alliance that deals with the problems of trying to have an effective military, and very graphic violence (though this is only used in a few battles, and is not for cheap shock value).  Because of this you get both modern political intrigue in the democratic though highly corrupt Alliance, but also medieval court politics in the feudal Empire. The pacing is extremely good- despite being 110 episodes long, I often have to pause and reread dialogue (because unfortunately there is no dub), because every single scene is important to the plot. There is some early installment weirdness in the first 10 episodes, but it really picks up in episodes 12-18.   

    There are 50+ major recurring characters each with their own personal and political goals creating pragmatic schemes for accomplishing them. The two main viewpoint characters are both extremely proactive, and are Yang Wen-li for the Alliance and Reinhard Lohengramm for the Empire. Reinhard is a fiery but quick thinking man who wants to overthrow the feudal empire, and establish a peaceful benevolent dictatorship by conquering all of known space. Yang, by contrast, is extremely relaxed and just wants to be a historian; he has to defend democracy against a superior foe even though the democracy he is defending is incompetent and corrupt, and actively impedes his war effort. One of my favorite parts of LOGH is the moral nuance- both Reinhard and Yang are good people, and even admit that when they meet in person, so you get to root for both of them.  

    Although the animation in the non-battle episodes is nothing to write about, the hand animated space battles are gorgeous, and the soundtrack, despite just being existing classical music, really fits the series.

  Book 7 Wakespire, of The Weirkey Chronicles, is out.

  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CDQBTQ38

  It is a progression fantasy first and foremost but it does check a lot of boxes for a rational story. Consistent world building, character motivations, fairplay mysteryies, and pursuit of their goals with no idiot balls.

  It has a bit of genre deconstruction. The main character was an isekied hero who was betrayed and killed at the start of the series,  now on a second time through he realizes just how much he was being manipulated behind the scenes and how much of a mess he likely left behind in the past when he rode triumphantly off into the sunset.

    I won't go so far as to derec it, but I wouldn't call it good either. I've given it a fair shot, read up to book 4 hoping it would get better but it just won't. 

    &#x200B;

    The author is just boring somehow, I could spend half an hour theorizing why, but I don't care enough to write an essay on it. A tldr would be a combination of no hook, boring badly written characters with boring goals, and just plain boring plotlines. 

    &#x200B;

    The only redeeming thing is the idea for the power system, but the execution just flops. The mc just knows everything and all he has to do is get the resources. 

    &#x200B;

    My goodreads ratings for the 4 books that I read were: 2\*, 2\*, 2\* and 1\* for the fourth..
    ```

    - u/ReproachfulWombat:
      ```
      I second this. 

      The author is an excellent technical writer and does some very good world building, but everything she writes is somehow… *dull*. It’s very difficult to put a finger on exactly what the problem is, but I’ve read at least a couple of books of all four of her series, and the problem is endemic to her writing. I always finish the first book, but I’m usually bored by the halfway point of the second.

      How on earth she managed to make a story about a human on lizard-people cultivation war involving a PGTE style 'narrative is a real force’ side-plot *boring*, I still don’t understand.

      Edit: I think at least part of the problem is that she writes a lot of power-fantasy, but the *power* part of the fantasy never really pays off. Her *last* cultivation series (Street Cultivation) ended after 3 books with the protagonist being... reasonably strong for his specific weight class, but an absolute nobody by the standards of the actually powerful in the setting, betraying the narrative expectation that he'd eventually become strong enough to escape the corporate dystopian hellscape ruled by immortal CEO's that are destroying the planet, or at least change it.
      ```

      - u/PekoraShine:
        ```
        Your edit nails it on the head. Street Cultivation was an interesting rumination on the similarities between Cultivation power/politics and real world Capitalism and similar systems, which foregrounded the very real phenomenon of people writing Cultivation stories that often rebuild some of the same exploitative hierarchies of reality (I always remember Zac in Defiance of the Fall reinventing scrip/company towns and talking about how obvious an idea it is without considering any ethical concerns).

        However, the fact that she was rigidly committed to this reality made for a trilogy of absolute soul-grinding drudgery as the magic system was just used to recreate an even worse version of the real world and the MC suffered endlessly with (as you say) no real payoff or win at the end. 

        It holds a lot more value as a sociopolitical exploration than an enjoyable or satisfying story.
        ```

        - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
          ```
          > an interesting rumination on the similarities between Cultivation power/politics and real world Capitalism and similar systems,

          If you want a more optimistic take on that idea, I can recommend Wildbow's latest story, [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/). The plot starts out as a murder mystery in a small Canadian town, but goes pretty deep in exploring the magic system as a metaphor for capitalism.
          ```

    - u/TJ333:
      ```
      I've been enjoying Sarah's (understated?) style of conflict as an alternative to the overblown conflicts in other stories. I feel her stories keep things moving without getting hung up on over done/hyped cliffhangers and junk. It handles power gain without being a power fantasy.

      After considering your post I can see how that could be boring to an other person.

      I do agree that Street Cultivation just turnes into a grind.
