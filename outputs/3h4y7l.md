## Custom world creator and other manga with rational worlds

### Post:

[Custom world creator](http://www.mangahere.co/manga/world_customize_creator/c001/)
, [re:monster](http://www.mangahere.co/manga/re_monster/)
and [tsuyo](http://www.mangahere.co/manga/tsuyokute_new_saga/). Their worlds have fairly consistent rules and characters acting rationality. Re:monster has been translated further in story form then manga form at the moment. [All you need is kill is another interesting one.](http://www.mangahere.co/manga/all_you_need_is_kill/)

  I liked the second two. World creator is crap, though. Just pandering to the gamer audience with minimal effort.

  Re:monster is wish fulfilment, but it's the kind of wish fulfilment that's self aware enough to not be grating, with a decently interesting plot. I saw the main character described as a turbo-sue, and have to agree, but that's half the fun.

  Tsuyo is fun because it's basically a peggy sue fanfiction, comic-fied. Not particularly rational so far (enemies are just evil for evil's sake) but does a decent job nob being incredibly cliche and just having a believably, but not massively OP hero.
