## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Some dungeon stories:

  * [Dungeon Man Sam](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50270/dungeon-man-sam-and-the-orphaned-core): If you're looking for a "dungeons as a business with horrible clients" story, this isn't it - despite the fact that it spends the first six chapters trying to convince you that's what the story is. It's a neat dungeon builder combined with "some weird shit is going on with the system" story, just skip to chapter 7 to get there.
  * [Dungeons are Bad Business](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48142/dungeons-are-bad-business): This story is _actually_ dungeons as a business, though in this case it's more like Ninja Warrior than murder caves. It does actually use real business concepts, though, up to and including a SWOT analysis - which, like every SWOT analysis I've ever seen in real life, is completely useless and leads nowhere.

  Edit: also, after making this post I learned that there's a Kickstarter to [publish physical copies of the first three Cradle novels](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/author-will-wight/fantasy-novels-cradle-1-3-by-will-wight); as someone who's recommended those books in previous threads I feel legally obligated to mention it, but I don't think the series is rational enough for a top level post.

    Let’s circle back on this in a stand up next week? I’ve got availability after Wednesday. We can brainstorm to open up actionable efficiencies. 😂😂

    Re recommending cradle thank you. I picked the first three up on audible last month, and then the next six, and then the recent one. It was a fun listen.
    ```

  - u/aponty:
    ```
    I suppose you technically _could_ skip the MC's entire backstory, yes
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      I mean it's like reading an Isekai story that starts out as a procedural murder mystery, and then in chapter six the MC is shipped off to a high fantasy setting after the murderer. 

      People who enjoyed the first six chapters might not enjoy the rest of the story, and people who _would_ like the rest of the story might be put off by the first six chapters.
      ```

      - u/aponty:
        ```
        To me, the story's prime focus was on making things with the system from chapter one, and I can't abide by just abandoning the character ties established.


        ...Though, I can't imagine a less respectable positively-framed mother character.  Her son is doing dangerously delicate work and, understanding this, her reaction is to aggressively interrupt him?

  ManMagnificent posted an Epilogue to  [Unwitting Champion](https://manmagnificent.wordpress.com/unwitting-champion-main/) today. An enjoyable read throughout, though the ending is very open. Not sure it will be to everyone's taste, but I recommend it.

  It's been recommended here before, I believe. It follows Champion Jordan, summoned from Earth to the Kingdom of Althor... Except his summoning was a political power play, and there's no heroic destiny attached. Jordan is from a South African village, and not entirely happy to become the political pawn of an entrenched royal family looking to secure their power.

  The story is extremely grounded, despite the fantasy theming.
  ```

  - u/Husr:
    ```
    Seconding this. An extremely novel take on Isekai, exploring the moral dimension more than any I've ever seen. Very excited for his next ofic too. The first chapter is up for free on his Patreon right now, with the next one planned to start in about six weeks.
    ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    I read a good chunk of this, but dropped it when I caught up to the released chapters >!some time around when Jordan makes his escape and heads for Rowan!<. Didn't feel like checking in regularly for the updates. About how much is after that point?
    ```

  Two requests:

  First, I'm looking for historical fiction to scratch my Stephenson itch. *Cryoptonomicon* is one of my favorite books of all time, and the rest of the *Baroque Cycle* is also rather enjoyable. I really like how accurate, realistic, and in-character the descriptions of history feel, as a lot of lower-quality historical fiction work often feels like it was told through a modern lens. I also find Neal's prose fascinating to listen/read, and the subtle blending of the supernatural is also quite nice.

  Secondly, I'm looking for some good Sci-Fi first- or post-first contact stories with a military/action angle and dipping a bit into the "HFY"-genre. Stuff like Scalzi's *Old Man's War* series or the *Expeditionary Force* series (although I feel that one has dropped in quality significantly as the series progressed). Something with space, aliens, shooting, heroism, etc, but kept mostly rational.

  Thanks!
  ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    I absolutely adore *Cryptonomicon*, but sadly I don't have any good recs for historical fiction.

    As for first-contact, though...

    * I will never miss a chance to shill for *A Fire Upon the Deep.* Don't let the space-opera setting fool you; it is absolutely a first contact story. Top tier in its portrayal of alternate forms of intelligence. Not HFY at all, though.

    * Alastair Reynold's *Revelation Space* is space action with a healthy dose of space horror. Less "humanity, fuck yeah!" and more "why can't we find any living alien civilizations?" It turns out first contact is a more nebulous--and concerning--process than in most settings. Really imaginative tech; it's a bit of sci-fantasy, except everything's breaking down and/or turning into flesh.

    * Finally, [The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/) is probably the closest to what you asked. First contact is over; humanity lost the resulting war, and now serves as expendable attack dogs for the "civilized" alien species. But on encountering a derelict capital ship of unknown manufacture, a team of these grunts starts to learn why their overlords were so careful to bury humanity's past.

      ```
      Spot on recommendations :) 

      I really liked *A Fire Upon the Deep* and *A Deepness in the Sky* and I've already read book 1 of *The Last Angel*--which was also quite good.

      Haven't read *Revelation Space* though, so I think I'll give that a go next!
      ```

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
    ```
    For the second one, *The Lost Fleet* series by Jack Campbell. 

    https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112292.Dauntless

    It's pretty heavy on the military angle and the aliens don't come in till later, but it was a fun read. Though I didn't really care for the "all politicians are idiots" trope that kept getting repeated.
    ```

    - u/jaghataikhan:
      ```
      Seconding the rec. It's got some of my favorite depictions of relativistic space naval combat (fully 3D, time dialation having fun effects, etc.). 

      I will say the antagonists are strawmen of "selfish/greedy corporate executives" (their captains/ commanders/ governors are straight up called CEOs lmao) and "corrupt idiot politicians" whereas pretty much all of the military characters were shown to be "honorable warriors"

      Incidentally, i met the author briefly at a convention about five years ago. Great guy
      ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    *Barkskins* by Annie Proulx is incredible hist-fic, and has the same sprawling feel as Stephenson (and similar length).
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Oh for some reason that reminded me of Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell, which is a magical historical fiction that's also insanely long.
      ```

  - u/andor3333:
    ```
    I only wish I had more recommendations like the Baroque Cycle. That is my favorite series. 

    The Trouble With Humans by Christopher Anvil is a collection of HFY style short stories. Not incredibly rational just a little higher quality than what you’d find on HFY.
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    For your first request, I might suggest looking in to magical realism - Gabriel Garcia Marquez being the stand out author there.
    ```

  - u/k5josh:
    ```
    John Ringo's *Troy Rising* sounds like what you're looking for. Definitely HFY, the first has more of an economic/preparation theme, the latter two are much more action.
    ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    The "Exile" series by Glynn Stewart is mostly first-contact/post-first-contact milSF, and is entirely serviceable.
    ```

  - u/FireCire7:
    ```
    For historical stories, I’m a fan of Erik Larson. Thunderstruck was enjoyable - an intertwined story of the telegraph and a historical murder mystery.

  Elden Ring came out about two weeks ago, and I’ve been sucked into it (Definitely a recommend if you’re willing to be slow and methodical or are familiar with dark souls). 
  Anyway, I’m hunting for some dark fantasy, mostly because of Elden Ring, so if you have anything dark, let me know.

    [Palus Somni](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25475/palus-somni) is a... gothic horror-inspired webserial taking place in a monastery besieged by monsters. Warning for *gratituous* body horror. Twig ain't got shit on this. It's finished, too!
    ```

  Recs:


  [Double Blind] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50553/double-blind-a-modern-litrpg). Seconding last week's recc for this. Protagonist is a little edgy, but the writing is good and it looks like it's going to do interesting things with regards to the devolving situation in the city. Reasonably rational on a character level so far, though of course litrpgs are intrinsically irrational on a setting level. 

  [Takopi's Original Sin] (https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/viewer/1012894). New chapters came out and it is NOT letting up. I know I recommended it recently and I din't care. READ IT. If you're not hooked by the end of chapter 3 give up, but unless it's way out of your genre wheelhouse I can almost guarantee you will be. CW: misery

  The new Batman movie. It's a three hour movie that feels like a two hour movie; there is constant tension and progression that makes sure the pace is snappy and you stay glued to your seat. Very much not a "marvel" style super hero movie. It revels in being dark and edgy, and in having a fundamentally flawed hero up against an extremely compelling villain. I'm iffy on whether to call it rational-- the detective work batman does doesn't exactly allow for "fair play whodunnits", but in terms of characterizations everyone behaves how they do because of their motivations and knowledge. 

  Pokemon Legends Arceus. The graphics are shitty and the dex is too small (and features too few new pokemon) , but from a mechanics perspective it's sublime-- it just feels *good* to play. The core gameplay loop is engaging, the battles and boss fights are challenging, there's always an in-lore correspondence to every mechanical action you're taking. (for example, when you catch pokemon they literally get put in a pasture, and you cans see the pokemon you have in your box from outside), and imo the story is pretty decent too (for a pokemon game). If the upcoming pokemon games take the mechanics from arceus and fix the tiny dex and graphics they're going to be absolutely phenomenal. Also, this story is objectively *Rationalist* fiction, considering much of the gameplay is literally about being a researcher and making repeated observations to learn more about "natural history." 

  [Ranking of Kings] (https://archiveofourown.org/works/34097854/chapters/84826831). Finally got around to watching this. I'm only on EP5 so maybe it gets worse, but so far I can see exactly why it's 8.8 on MAL. This is very much "classical fantasy," and therefore almost anti-rational in nature, but it gets carried by the strength of its characters and animation.

    Loved Takopi's Original Sin. It's a surprisingly brisk read with the optimistic naivety of the lead alleviating the edginess of the narrative. Thanks for the recommendation.

          Doesnt feel like it's the kind of thing content warnings are necessary for, but it certainly isn't my cup of tea.

          Edit: that said it's might fit /r/rational though in the sense of featuring an alien being with different values trying to maximize what it wants without truly understanding humans. Takopi the paperclip maximizer.

  - u/Wispling:
    ```
    Not sure it has exactly the same feel, but Chronicles of Amber comes to mind as a political fantasy thing.

    EDIT: Now that I'm thinking about it, A Night In Lonesome October could also be worth looking into. Much shorter than Amber, of course, but as a standalone work the whole thing felt much more internally consistent to me. With Amber it always seemed like Zelazny was making up explanations after the fact.

    Can I get some spoilers from post >!the third or fourth floor with the pothead camels/floating landscapes they had to defend?!< through the end of this book?


    Mostly looking for what happens plot wise? Anything change about the formula from the first few books? I remember the comedy being quite funny in the first book, but then as I read further feeling like I was forcing myself to laugh at the jokes and tropes and things because I was supposed to, or just skimming them. Probably just a me issue with really comedy heavy books? 



    I remember really being interested in the higher floors, and feeling like a time skip would help things along towards new shit like a confrontation with that one evil god dude (and feeling that 1 or 2 floors per book was a real drag that was rehashing the same things but with a new cat power/secondary character/Tag-a-long teacher/rest stop expansion drama for flavor). 



    Is his shtick still stomping? Anything new with his or the cats power direction? Anything cool with the intergalactic twitch stream aspect of the story? 



    Just ending by saying thanks for posting because it at least reminded me I did like this series at one time, any and all effort (big or small) you put into further answering my rambling is also appreciated. 🤝☺️

      I'm enjoying the series a lot. I think the writing is surprisingly good. While the premise of the novels (earth becomes a game show), the show itself, and the AI running the show all have a "zany" comedy element, the subtext is a lot of real pathos. There is real anger and frustration not only at the deaths of millions, which after all are only statistics, but with the forced individual dramas (the antagonist who was forced to kill her child due to an in-game item, the NPCs who realize their memories are a sham, etc.) The novels really shine when dealing with the political maneuverings of the show runners and other interested parties, and also when painting little tableaus. I like, for example, the cleaner bot, which is really just color. The extended cast is constantly making large and small messes in the safe room, to its endless consternation. Another highlight is the author's obvious and deep knowledge of dogs and cats—the intelligent cat is excellently done, and the impetuousness and and solipsism, but also the situational competence, of cats is well reflected.

      While it's a litrpg, and while the characters are constantly improving, I think it's not really a numbers go up series at core. Rather, it's about everything in the world having associated mechanisms, and Carl stringing things together to get the desired goal. Carl has an engineer's mindset, he takes everything with him and uses most things at his disposal. While he stomps things, his main stick is building things, blowing things up, and performing social engineering. Later in the series, he has a mechanic that gives him some consistent hints and tips, and he must try to maximize their use without tipping his hand to the show runners too much.

      >!There is more god stuff in Book 4, if you like that, and also more PVP. There are, I think, some great fights, and some moments where Carl is really striking back to thwart, hurt, or otherwise set back the show runners. The benefactor and audience elements are fairly major, especially toward the end of the fourth and throughout the fifth book.<

      I think if you liked the beginning, and got a little bogged, it's still good, if not better. Don't take the comedy so seriously, it's really more of a kinetic adventure / fantasy / drama than a comedy. Read for the minor characters, the high concept set pieces and descriptions, the strong depictions of animals as alien intelligences, the game theoretic elements, and the struggle against the system.

    The later Laundry files. Stross started it out as black comedy with necromantic Mythos inspired spies and bureaucracy, but as he becomes more disillusioned the comedy goes from black to gallows. There's still plenty to laugh at, but its counter-pointed less by light hearted horrors such as bosses whose office carpets compel truth or collect the shrunken heads of the losers of winter dead mental politics, and more by things that strike too plausible: Eldritch heads of state setting quotas for capital punishment or religions seeding brain melting parasites in their congregation, and variations on regulatory capture. 

    The series is a lot of fun, even if it's often depressing .
