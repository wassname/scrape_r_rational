## Worth the Candle: What Would A SOC based Juniper Look Like? (Spoilers/Discussion)

### Post:

Not sure if there was ever a discussion already about this, but so far in the story, how would a Juniper who focused on social skills have done things differently?  What would be the biggest changes compared to the most recent chapter and what would have been the most difficult challenges in that scenario?

I think you could argue a SOC focused Juniper would be more powerful later on as he builds out his team and more vulnerable early on, but curious what other people think.

  ```
  Assumptions: Juniper doesn't die from lack of PHY/MEN skills, he goes the "Full Disclosure" path, and events tend to play out similarly despite the different build (e.g. no non-canon companions, no completely different plots).

  Juniper drops down into the Risen Lands, and, once he's past figuring out that he has a game system attached, he immediately dumps points into SOC instead of PHY, MEN, or LUK, on the basis that the zombies don't seem all that fast or difficult, and he's going to need SOC when he meets someone.

  He heads to the nearest town, Comfort, and ducks into an automotive shop, where he meets a pretty girl who, as her first interaction with him, points a gun in his face and starts asking questions, thereby justifying his decision to put points into SOC. He tells her that he's got no idea where he is or what's happening, and when he says he's from a place called Earth, she starts to believe him. She sends him on a fetch quest, assuming that he will likely die, or at worst, draw someone into the ambush that she's preparing.

  Juniper fumbles his way through Comfort, somehow, collecting the seven souls. He eventually meets up with Becca, Sly, and Poul, other survivors, and with better SOC, is able to form more of a bond with them. Sly still doesn't make it (he was bleeding out when Juniper found him), but by talking it out, he discovers that everyone would prefer if he took Sly's soul. With closer coordination, Becca survives, meaning that Amaryllis is presented with three people rather than just two.

  The soulcycle does not fit four people; in fact, the soulcycle doesn't fit three. If it were *just* Poul and Juniper, Amaryllis could kill Poul and be done with it, given his crimes, but with two others, it's not so simple, especially since the crime Becca is in the Risen Lands for is relatively unobjectionable reason (partly accessory to her father's criminal business, but mostly the fact that she didn't flip on him). Because four is too many for the soulcycle, the group decides that they're going to have to get/fix a car instead, which gets confirmed by quest pop-up.

  After some looting and killing, they leave Comfort in a car, whose tank is filled with additional gathered souls from members of the Coterie. They have an argument about whether to go to Silmar City or to head out to the border wall where they will be inducted into the Host, until eventually Amaryllis reveals the existence of the teleportation key and promises riches if they can retrieve it.

  They make their way to Silmar City, which is a bit easier with four people. They go over the wall with a ladder they took from a farmhouse and strapped to the roof of the car. They encounter Fireteam Blackheart in the middle of the city streets, and have a calamitous encounter that kills Quills, Becca, Poul, and Carter. The survivors (Tova, Leonold, Fenn, Amaryllis, and Juniper) declare a truce and agree to mutual cooperation, since it doesn't seem like anyone is getting an extraction, and they still need the teleportation key. They go into Sorian's Castle together and ride the elevator up to the top floors, which is where they have a second, inevitable confrontation. Juniper, having put all his points thus far into SOC, convinces everyone to stand down and work together, convincing them to "switch sides" after the clusterfuck of a mission they'd been given.

  End Book I.

  ----

  They go to Barren Jewel, where a more socially-conscious Juniper is a help with gathering information. By the time the Risen Bile become active, he's learned that a helicopter makes infrequent trips out to Caer Laga, which is highly suspicious. This leads to Aumann, and highly suggests that the team acquire the skills of a warder, which leads them to Grakhuil Leadbraids.

  Grak is willing to practice his trade in exchange for money, and is also in favor of pulling one over on Barren Jewel's resident gold mage. He agrees to come with, at which point Juniper gets a loyalty notification.

  Tova's skills are particularly worthless in the desert, and six is a crowd, so she stays behind in Barren Jewel with a classmate from the athenaeum. The other five trek out into the desert. The first time, Amaryllis falls and twists her ankle, necessitating a teleport back to their hotel room in Barren Jewel. The second time, the thaum-suckers find them early and they have to teleport back. The third time, they make it without much incident, save at the end, and slip within the wards, collecting all of the entads and supplies that are stored there, breaking the ward that Aumann's warder put around the place, and teleporting out without anyone being any the wiser.

  A couple things are different by this point. Tova and Leonold are both in the party, for a start, but Amaryllis also hasn't contracted rat rot, which means that she needs some other horrible disease or poison that can't be cured by anything short of a unicorn, if we want to do that arc. Juniper is probably able to navigate his way through some friendship development, but SOC just makes you better at that, it doesn't necessarily change your placement on the introversion/extroversion scale, nor does it necessarily give you any desire to delve into the past of someone you don't care about. The other big difference is that without Amaryllis captured by Aumann, he's either out of the story, or needs to get worked into it somehow. (And though it won't really rear its head for another few books, Juniper hasn't had cause to burn his own bones, because he never had to use the rocket to cross the desert.)

  If you want to follow canon but with a more social focus, you would probably have Grak suggest that they still hit Aumann's tower, or possibly reveal that had been his plan before, if Juniper didn't know that already. It's attractive, because Aumann is a shitbag and it would only take a single lightning-quick strike to make vast sums of money ... but it's a "let's just rob this mobster" plot, which is questionably intelligent, especially since (unlike canon) there's no worry that anyone knows Amaryllis is alive. Perhaps the Risen Bile plotline actually ends up going somewhere, and ties back in to Aumann.

  But depending on what you'd do from there, it could become a totally different story unless thrust back onto the rails by a DM that really, really wants things to go a certain way.

    I find it kind of eyebrow-raising (in a compared-to-canon way - obviously this story would work fine as a standalone)  that Juniper seems strictly more effective here / this mostly describes Juniper *winning* via SOC, but at no point did the plot change due to *losing* one of the many violent conflicts he found himself in under the canon plot due to insufficient PHYS

    Also I think changing June's role to be less Tank and more Face changes party balance a fair bit. Amy is arguably now the main tank.  Also Amy and June are sort of both sharing Face roles now.  Due to their overlapping main stat the stat boosts from the soul bond thingy don't particularly strengthen either of them now (though Fenn and Grak still provide some benefit).

    Valencia's demon SOC still overpowers June *and* Mary when it comes to manipulation, and Valencia may actually trust Juniper *less* when he has higher SOC (because she can *see* the higher SOC). Also, there is probably now not a single member of the party who could defeat Valencia in combat, so she is a much bigger threat before they trust her. Grak probably gets a much bigger role since June will be better at understanding him. Fenn..I guess either the relationship is saved, ends more amicably, or June doesn't enter the relationship to begin with due to seeing what Val's SOC allows her to see.

    - u/alexanderwales:

      See the assumptions:

      > Juniper doesn't die from lack of PHY/MEN skills ... and events tend to play out similarly despite the different build (e.g. no non-canon companions, no completely different plots).

      Juniper looks more effective here because you don't see the scenarios where he dies to the Coterie, dies to the zombies, dies to Fireteam Blackheart, etc., and the plot doesn't substantially change because this is "full railroad" mode, where decisions matter, but the Stations of Canon are roughly the same.

      Without those stipulations, then yes, you could have things like Juniper deciding not to go to Comfort at all on the theory that too many other people were going there, some of them violent, and instead trudging through the countryside to a different place, eventually making it to the border wall where the Host is waiting with open arms, at which point the story becomes about Juniper adapting to being a low-level conscript in the military of a foreign government, with none of the characters we're familiar with, and presumably new companions ... which is less fun.

      Or, once they get to Silmar City, they never run into Fireteam Blackheart, meaning that Fenn is out of the picture, thrown back into prison at best and dead at worst.

      Or people keep dying because Juniper can't protect them (or more accurately, pull his weight), leaving him jaded and alone, without much in the way of resources or concrete plans.

      (This all sort of rests on the question of who the Dungeon Master is, what he wants, and to what extent he interferes or retcons, which is unknown in the story at the current time, and which I'm not spoiling here.)

        One factor that might make that more reasonable is the most of the magical skills are MEN/SOC.  A Juniper that focused on MEN/SOC could still be combat effective.

          He could, but not at this point in the story, given that the wholly or partially SOC-based magics (flower magic, pustule magic, gold magic, etc) are unavailable until after the Barren Jewel arc. Of course, it would be entirely possible to retcon the story such that they're available sooner, but sticking relatively close to canon, it's not until roughly book 2.

          A MEN-based approach is much more reasonable though.

    It feels like social would have gone a lot better than mental physical. A larger party with some high level characters, no rat rot, Amaryllis isn't kidnapped. 

    Which all makes sense. 

    Amaryllis can cover Juniper not taking mental. She'll still be great at planning. However Amaryllis' social skills cannot cover for the fact Joon's lack of social skills affects the internal party dynamics.

      is this really that good of a comparison? I kind of get it, in that >!he leads a party around, based primarily on some weird charm rather than physical threat!< but that's... kind of where the comparison ends.

      I think "like valencia" is a better comparison. "Toddler with a railgun" and all that. A devastating social power that he doesn't really know how to wield for good (despite wanting to). 

      Honestly, I think "toddler with a railgun" applies to Joon somewhat even in canon, where he has immense physical and magical power that he (again) doesn't have the maturity to wield properly (again, like Valencia).

      What I think the Jack Slash comparison misses is that Joon would still try to be a good person.
      ```

      - u/Takashoru:
        ```
        Joon is a force multiplier.  His own power, though strong, is not what makes their party scary.  That's people like Val and Bethel, who are both world-endingly powerful, and majorly fucked up in the head.

        Joon needs to be like Jack Slash in that he is moderately powerful alone, but massively powerful when orchestrating others.  He needs to delicately tend to the mental health of his team, ensuring they do what he wants, and don't get into unwanted trouble.

        Effectively, it's not that Joon is powerful with a SOC build.  It's that without one, his team is ridiculously inefficient due to their various hangups.  If he was able to trust them all, and they him, everything would be going so much faster.

        Imagine if he convinced Bethel to go with them to Scrutiny, for one.  Or made a stronger connection with the locus.  Or could find a way to turn Grak away from suicide.  Or was able to actually trust Val to use her devils.

        The art of overpowering SOC is no longer needing to take human mental limitations into consideration when it really matters.

  It's pretty obvious that the optimal build is to go heavy on Soc/Comedy and be a hilarious band of wandering murderhobos.

  interestingly the plot simply doesn’t allow for this, because any rational actor who has to prioritize immediate survival in a deadly environment will pour stats into strength and so on. 

  i guess in theory he could now rearrange his stats completely, now that most of the threats are somewhat known quantities. (although i tend to glaze over when aw talks about the details of this, so i’m not sure what’s possible.)

  sorry this is tangential to your question.
  ```

- u/efd731:
  ```
  It’s entirely dependant on how the stats actually affect him, for instance the simulation he’s in crashes when he maxes out his inteelignce(though it’s never clarified whether that’s due to max Int making him realize he’s in a sim that crashes it, or the sim crashed because he exceeded a maximum stack value ((how smart he can possibly be))thus causing an overflow), so it’s implied that the stats don’t add new abilities just enhance them.

  Junipers strength stat allows him to bench press a truck, but doesn’t give him the durability that should be needed so his new muscles don’t tear his own body apart, because amaryllis punching him still hurts him.

  So it depends on whether the game layer would allow it to 

  1) exceed June’s native abilities ie more socially capable then is humanly possible(like Sherlock but for emotions) 

  2) improve or reduce the impact of june’s Actions depending on his intent( a modifier for people’s reactions to him)

  3) raise a flat value  for How positively he’s viewed by everyone who he talks to or is viewed by.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    He never maxed int. It was just that too high int changed his personality into being not Juniper, something not acceptable to the game/GM.
    ```

- u/munkeegutz:
  ```
  I was thinking about this too -- a SOC jun would have won Bethel over and she would travel with them.  Jun would have been weaker, but with more allies (and they would have higher loyalty, and therefore become stronger as a group).  This would have traded pretty favorably with the loss of raw ability, I think.

  &#x200B;

  That said, party member death was pretty likely no matter what, given Juniper's dark past!
  ```

  - u/Weebcluse:
    ```
    I think the opposite. Using SOC to pick up on problems earlier would be helpful, but being good at hiding your true feeling and at manipulation would give you a worse reputation and create new problems. Conversely, being unable to do so makes you easier to trust.

    Bethel dislikes Mary partly because she clearly has the skill set of a scheming noble. I would think a more smoother Joon would also rub Bethel the wrong way.

    I also think Mary would grow to trust SOC Joon a lot slower given what we know about her.
