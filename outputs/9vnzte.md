    Oh, that explains why it has the effects that it does, it's containing something.

    - u/Alphanos:
      ```
      So does this imply that the previous culture may have found a way to contain SCP-3125 at the end, after most of their civilization was destroyed, and then the Foundation broke the containment and released it?  Our goal with a nuclear waste site would be to avoid anyone wandering in from trying to take the contents back out with them.
      ```

      - u/traverseda:

        That civilization still died, and died while employing some pretty powerful memetic to keep themselves hidden. The existence of nuclear waste sites doesn't imply that the world didn't die in nuclear hellfire, and if you see radiation everywhere....

  Ahh, I vaguely remember the SCP before Antimemetics. Not to dismiss the rest of it, but... IMHO, antimemetics is the pinnacle of SCPs.

    The Antimemetics Division tale is one of the best pieces of online fiction I've ever read, although I did read a lot of regular SCPs first (which helps with the background idea, setting, etc). It raises the extremely interesting question of 'how do you fight an enemy that violently redacts its own existence?'

  > How do you fight an antimemetic monster which only eats the best antimemeticists?

  This gave me an interesting perspective on this series.  Up until this point, reading through these stories, I had considered Marion Wheeler to be a highly competent leader of the sole known remaining, and thus most successful, antimemetic organization.  But perhaps I've been looking at things backwards.  She and her organization may not be the most competent at all - they may have been the last ones left because they were actually the *least* competent.  The most mediocre among their allies, and thus last ones to fall to their foe.

  >"Seven years ago there were more than four hundred antimemetics research groups worldwide. Government agencies, military branches, private corporations, university projects. Many of them were GOIs or subdivisions of GOIs. We were allied with most of them. We were at the spearhead of an Antimemetics Coalition which spanned the whole globe and thousands upon thousands of people. None of those groups still exist. The last one ceased to exist some time in the last seventy-two hours.

    Maybe.

    On the other hand, it looks like the Antimemetics divisions suffers from *a lot* of regular attrition that targets you regardless of how competent you are. Eg Alastair Grey kills about a hundred employees, including senior researchers and random technicians, without anyone noticing.

    Maybe they're just better equipped, and regular military projects get wiped out as soon as their start seeing the truth.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:

      > Maybe they're just better equipped

      Yes, I think this is a major part of it. Wheeler says it herself, in u/Alphanos' quote:

      >The only reason we still exist at all is because we have better amnestic biochemistry than anybody else in the world.

      Foundation Antimemetics has almost casual access to amnestics. Upon discovering SCP-3125, any given Foundation researcher stands a better chance of finding an amnestic and erasing the knowledge from the mind, compared to researchers of other organizations. That's why they're the last ones.

      Though u/Alphanos has a point in that Foundation Antimemetics likely wasn't *the* most competent organization in the world. They're as competent as they could be without being so competent that their competence kills them. Like Moreno's did.

      >We're too damned smart!

  This series is so good.

  * Antimemetics is a fascinating topic, allowing for quite complex and compelling plots/conflicts. How do you research something you can't remember? How do you *fight* it? The people who routinely work on both those tasks, what mindsets do they develop?

   How would the world look like, if antimemetics were an actual part of it? Wheeler talks about it this tale: there may be antimemetic aspects to every known field of science, and ordinary people would know nothing of it. History, biology, cosmology â€” what hidden aspects could there be to them?

   It's such an interesting mystery/worldbuilding tool.

  * Antimemetic enemies lead to unique conflicts, in which you either need to come up with a creative plan on the spot then continuously re-discover it after it's inevitably erased from your memory, *or* realize that you're helpless and attempt to escape via amnesia to fight another day. On the larger scale, you're not sure how many such conflicts you've forgotten even after accounting for mnestics, and you could only coordinate with other people and your past selves through asynchronous research in occasional Vegas rooms.

   I'm only sad we don't have a full novel about one of the Wars.

  * Finally, SCP-3125 and the entire tone/theme of the series. The Foundation is opposing an overwhelmingly, terrifyingly powerful enemy, and continues to oppose it in spite of discovering evidence of other organizations, other *civilizations*, and its own past selves losing to it. *There Is No Antimemetics Division*'s ending, in which it inexorably destroys them anyway, was powerful, and I'm excited to see how the sequel ends.

  On a related note:

  >"They were human. They were probably significantly more technologically advanced than we are. They existed tens of thousands of years ago; perhaps hundreds of thousands, we can't know for sure. It's difficult to determine what really happened to them because their entire cultural memeplex was lethally irradiated. Their core cultural concepts, the things they created, and stood for, and valued highly, can never be known or propagated again."

  This is one of the most creatively horrifying apocalypse scenarios I've encountered. (Not *literally* the worst, I suppose, but still.)

  Why didn't it immediately eat Wheeler as being in Moreno's headspace, along with the rest of the division?

    In the comments on [Your Last First Day](http://www.scp-wiki.net/your-last-first-day), the author outlines that the 'talking' beings in the story (like the one here and the (same?) one from YLFD) are *probably not* the 'Overbeing' itself, which isn't sentient. 

    They're connected, and still kill you when you perceive them, but they don't do the 'hollowing out everyone around you instantly' thing. They just attack you with invisible spiders.

    > There's a big aspect to this which I very nearly added to this whole story, but eventually shied away from. I was going to make it so that the huge invisible spider thing in "Unforgettable" was actually being ridden by a humanoid rider. When Wheeler shot at it, she hit the rider a couple of times. In "CASE COLOURLESS GREEN" I was going to have this rider come back and talk to Wheeler, directly antagonising her in much the same way that SCP-3125 apparently does in this chapter.

    >What would then happen is that Wheeler would deduce that this rider person, which claims to be SCP-3125, isn't SCP-3125 at all, but just another manifestation. In this case, some bratty kid which randomly encountered SCP-3125 somehow, and surrendered themself to it in exchange for a boatload of power. The kid thinks they're SCP-3125, and they do wield a great deal of power like free access to this (non-sentient) spider monster, and they think they're leading the war, but the kid is actually like a cuddly mascot strapped to the front of an eighteen-wheeler.

    >The lesson would be that no, SCP-3125 is not sentient or intelligent and does not communicate. It is just a massive primal force/prionic infection which has apparently sentient side-effects, and, in some cases, worshippers/servants. To some extent, it may even be that the SCP-3125's "If you see me, I will kill you" behaviour is just how this kid (and others) have chosen to defend SCP-3125 from attack.

    >So you've got three options there:

    > * Marion was really talking to SCP-3125, and it was giving her traditional villain backtalk (sorry about that, guess I need to work harder).
    > * Marion was talking to a "representative" which believes itself to be SCP-3125 but is actually just another hapless victim of this whole mess; a bratty kid with terrible dialogue and too much power.
    > * Marion was, as she suspects, genuinely just hallucinating.

    > Obviously there's no way you could work out the second possibility there, but that's on me, not you, so it remains a fair criticism.

    > This whole angle made its way into about half of the 30 or so drafts of "CASE COLOURLESS GREEN" but in the end I went in a different direction because it was making the entire story too complex. Although it's easy for me to explain all of this here in a forum post, it's relatively difficult to reveal such complex details in a fun, organic way through the medium of the story without resorting to infodump (and stretching it out past the end of 2015).

      Then what decides whether you get the overbeing or one of its representatives when you understand 3125?
