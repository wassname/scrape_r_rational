  Wow. We went and pushed the story to the top rating on the site.
  ```

- u/DTravers:
  ```
  Can someone explain any this is important? I've never seen this site before.
  ```

  - u/panchoadrenalina:
    ```
    The most important to me is that it has a dark theme so i can read better at night. And the site looks better the previous site.

      I just use reader mode. There are extensions for Chrome and Firefox and it's inbuilt in Safari 

      Royalroad is actually more annoying and it causes my iPad to crash

      I hate how "all* sites look on my phone. If I care about reading an entire long book, I suck it into an ebook and read it that way.

        This. I have numerous scripts I've made over the years for putting various websites into epub format just because I find it much nicer to read.

    This site is pretty popular and it's focused around fantasy/VR/isekai/Xianxia stories. It has quite a few great novels in the speculative fiction genre that our rational fiction community largely overlaps with. If MOL's popularity wasn't enough already, this posting will push it even higher. The previous first place on RR had 15 million views.

    I guess the name comes from the VR game in The Legendary Moonlight Sculptor, a korean novel.

      Such as? what stories Iâ€™ve seen on that website were rather supbar.

        Just to make sure, speculative fiction = fantasy + sci-fi. RRL is mostly fantasy, but there are occasionally sci-fi stories as well. I'm going to soon make a post about two recent ones that I've found. Other ones that I've found there:

        * The Good Student
        * The Dao of Magic (genre-savvy)
        * Shoulders of Giants (not *high* quality, but I'd put it as rationalist-adjacent)
        * Threadbare (very fun)
        * The Worldforge: Warlock Rising (amazing until it was dropped, and I still recommend it. What drew me in at first was the perfect show-not-tell to describe the main character's personality)
        * Universe Online (VR, scifi, realistic engineering+space survival, now on amazon only)
        * Flight of Icarus (YMMV)
        * Eye of Adventure (My favorite VRMMO story of all time, for doing over-poweredness right. If you can ignore poor grammar. It's on an indeterminate hiatus, but it has > 1 million words already, so that's not a problem)

        And those are just my favorites that I found on RR. Most of RR is niche fantasy stories, the good ones being most enjoyable for those who like the genre(s) already. There are more that I enjoyed, but aren't high quality, so I left them out. There are also a lot of hidden gems on RR, but they're difficult for the algorithm to sift through. Luckily, it's easier for readers to find them because you'll usually find reviews saying that it's a hidden gem. There are also stories that I've found elsewhere, but that you could also find on RR if you hadn't yet (eg. MOL now).

    You can adjust font, the amount of space the text takes, and font. Pretty useful.
    ```

      ```
      FictonPress can do those things too, right below the summary on desktop, or at the bottom of the page on mobile. Mobile doesn't have as many options though.

    deserved. just look at what follow and dare say they are better ;)

  get a cover image on there!

  - u/letouriste1:
    ```
    i doubt he made one
    ```

    - u/Banarok:
      ```
      so let's discuss what should be on a cover image!, personally if every arc was divided into a book, the first one i'd have show a spider or marbles, the 2nd a glass globe with a palace inside of it and the third either the gate or the crown.

      the marbles are probably what i'd go with for image if there was just one for the entire series, because they reflect the name nicely.

        [edit: moved geometries down below.]

        oh, wait, there already is fan art! here's a book cover, i'm sure any artist would love it if it were used, but we should check with them first:

        **my vote actually goes to this one:**

        down below are some geometric images that are licensed under creative commons, and free to modify and reuse, even commercially, without attribution.

        [i started by searching for icosahedra, fractal icosahedra, sponges, etc, since the dimensional gates and stabilization frames were icosahedral skeletons with a sphere in the middle, and i thought it would be a decent symbol of the nerdiness, structure, and recursion of this fic without needing an artist to actually design something. what i linked isn't exactly that, since the sponge icosadron i found didn't actually look that good, but i think it's a gesture in the right direction, as well as looking like dimensional portals.]

        - u/Banarok:
          ```
          yea i like your last vote, it's thematic and not very detailed when it comes to Zorian, it's great.
          ```

      - u/letouriste1:
        ```
        So, taking your suggestions into account:
        - first cover: zorian in front having troubles with learning something and in the background=> a spider,xvim throwing a marble,a clock and a masked assassin with a knife. Maybe akoja too.
        -second cover: zorian and Zach but not too close,alanic and zedomir with some skeletons and monsters. Red robe too
        -Third cover: zorian and a group composed of each and the others looking toward a gate with quatach-ichl in the background wearing the crown


        The glass orb is from the third arc too
        ```

        - u/Banarok:
          ```
          i don't want a character on the cover since it spoils imagination, especially since mother of learning is really sparse with descriptions meaning everyone makes a very personal image, that's why i went for simple images.

          &#x200B;

          yea you're right about the orb, the 2nd arc could probably better be a piece of crystallized mana, or alchemy eqipment due to all the Kael stuff.
          ```

      - u/zonules_of_zinn:
        ```
        i went ahead and asked the artist if nobody could use [this image](https://i.pximg.net/img-master/img/2018/08/01/02/43/46/69959210_p0_master1200.jpg) as a cover image on royalroad.

        i wonder if s/he could reprint it without the caption "Caught in the Web" because i think that is a fan-added title.

  Unpopular Opinion here: 

  I actually think its bad for the story and the author to be on royalroad. I like the site dont get me wrong , but the focus there is mostly on xianxia / LitRPG storys and not on  real original works. Also, if MOL should ever be published as a real book, it can be very important for the author to have the best possible control over which parts are freely available on the web. On royalroad there are quite a few trolls that will make it more difficult to maintain this level of control. I think MOL has the potential to be really successful as a print release and as an ebook, and I'd hate to see this success hampered by the release on RoyalRoad.

  So what's Royal Road?
  ```

  - u/TheHoblit:
    ```
    a popular Fiction writing site that is affiliated with Amazon for easier publishing.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    In addition to what TheHoblit said, RRL is a popular publishing platform for wuxia, xianxia, litrpg, and isekai fiction, both original and translated. It's more niche than Fictionpress or AO3 by historical accident, although technically any variety of story can be published on it.

    Nope. It's nearing the end though, estimated 10 chapters left.

    - u/letouriste1:
      ```
      10 is the minimum, the autor expect it to take 15
      ```

- u/soaringneutrality:
  ```
  Super amazing to see RoyalRoad transition from just a Legendary Moonlight Sculptor translation site, to a translation site with multiple, similar works, to one with fan works of these series, and now this :)

  Hell yea

  Time for a reread!
