  To be honest, I am super confused by the timeline and would really prefer that you restructure your chapters before moving forward. If you were doing this purposefully and with date marks (or something similar), maybe I'd be down for the non-linear narrative.


  For now, what exactly is the order that I should read these in?

    ```
    Genin Days 6, then 7, then the next chapter that I'm writing at the minute, then Acceleration.

    The narrative is not going to stay non-linear, it is simply the case that I had to add in a couple more chapters before finishing Acceleration, or it would fall flat. But if I do not put Genin Days 7 at the end now, then people who have the story on Follow will miss it and be confused when I reference events that they missed. So, in two days once they've presumably finished reading I'll re-arrange the chapters back into linear order. 

    Honestly it's a bit of a mess, but that seemed like the best way to do it.

    Edit: for now I'll put a time stamp in, so that it makes more sense.
    ```
