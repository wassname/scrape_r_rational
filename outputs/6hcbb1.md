  Very interesting pacing this chapter.  The ending is cinematic as fuck.

  I'm glad you're experimenting and pushing your limits.  To be honest it makes for a sort of uneven work, and can even be disorienting, but you tried some cool stuff this chapter, and it basically came together, and produced the desired effect.  I think.  

  Shall we try to identify everyone we can?
  > An armoured knight on a motorcycle couched his lance and charged

  Chevalier.

  > A woman carried by stained glass cherubim sang a mournful song that sent a wave of powdered glass crashing at the Simurgh like a tidal wave

  "Shatterbird"?

  > A teenaged girl, no older than me, led a legion of phantom warriors mounted on zebras to break the knight's encirclement.

  Crusader Girl?

    Taylor here feels like she could be my favorite character in fiction.  

    I'll have to study this chapter more deeply.  Thanks.

  Quick note: You mention the energy is 1.6 * 10^2 Joules, but it's actually 1.6 * 10^9 Joules, or 1.6 gigajoules. All the other numbers are correct, including this being roughly equivalent to a 767 in flight.

  And that just a very minor reason why portals are broken,even taking into account that she can get nuke levels of energy if she stores big rocks and acelerates them during months.Anyway since she is a potential extinction event she should be anywhere near the simurgh and even if throwing supersonic  rocks to the simurgh is awesome   it really isn't the best idea .

  yay! It's back.
  I don't normally approve of rational actors fighting out of their league,
  But consider it was done with math and heroic mindset and an action stance (!!!!!), asdasdsa It's good!

  Speaking of heroics, I hope we will see more of this type of behavior in the future. It is disappointing in all the Superhuman fics and or fanfics that don't have heroic/hotblood leads or even support characters.

  Apologies to my beta readers, who've seen every version of this chapter except this one. If I keep letting myself revise and edit and reconsider over and over again, I'll never post anything ever again. This one is going up after minimal spell checking and nothing else, for better or worse.

    ```
    Be honest; you wrote this whole fic just so that Taylor could smack Simurgh down with a supersonic rock, didn't you? ;)
