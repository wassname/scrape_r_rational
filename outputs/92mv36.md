## K J Parker

### Post:

I was wondering whether K J Parkers fiction had already been discussed on this reddit, and whether it was considered for addition to the recommended works.  In my opinion his writing is probably the most rational I've ever read.  


" While Parker's stories take place in [secondary worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universe_(fiction)) with fictional geographies and [world history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_history),  some of the typical features of fantasy fiction such as explicit use of  magic are not present in his novels. His short stories, on the other  hand, frequently deal with magic and the problems it brings for  sorcerers. The stories tend to have [tragic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy)  themes with characters whose actions are unintentionally, ultimately  self-destructive. Other major themes in the books are politics,  technology (especially [disruptive innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation)), and either or both of the former as a means to power.  "  -wikipedia  
Essentially my argument is that Parker's long work embodies every characteristic of rationalist fiction. His characters have realistic motivations, the are intelligent, they use rational thought/cunning/knowledge of science and technology/social manipulation and complex machiavellian plots to pursue their goals.  They don't explicitly teach rational thought, they teach it in an aristotelian manner, you cannot understand his books without being able to comprehend his characters decisions, and they are rational in non-obvious ways. In his few works which do involve magic it's consequences and ramifications are explicit and explored.  
As far as topics go, his works usually explore technological innovation, but it is often wielded and set into motion by very petty or personal reasons.  One of his series involves an engineer who revolutionizes the economy of at least one country, sets into motion an industrial revolution and starts a war that will depopulate a country or two and destroy the local international power, all because he found out his wife was sleeping with his city-state's leader shortly before he is exiled.  
Another caveat is that though he often avoids magic, when non-real elements are present in his writing sometimes he will imply or partially explain how something 'magical works,' or discuss forms of mental exercises, he will always leave magic at least partially unexplained.  


This story "A small price to pay for birdsong" is probably the most rational short story I can find online,[https://web.archive.org/web/20130527092350/http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/winter\_2011/fiction\_a\_small\_price\_to\_pay\_for\_birdsong\_by\_k.\_j.\_parker/](https://web.archive.org/web/20130527092350/http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/winter_2011/fiction_a_small_price_to_pay_for_birdsong_by_k._j._parker/)  


My highest recommendation would be the novella "Blue and Gold." It is extremely rational but not as extremely bleak as most of his work.  


A good overview on where to start reading his work is over here on Tor, [https://www.tor.com/2015/08/18/starting-with-first-principles-where-to-begin-with-k-j-parker/](https://www.tor.com/2015/08/18/starting-with-first-principles-where-to-begin-with-k-j-parker/)  


I thought I'd already posted about this, so I'm sorry if this is a repeat

  I would suggest starting reading KJ Parker with his short story collections, [Academic Exercises](https://www.amazon.com/Academic-Exercises-K-J-Parker-ebook/dp/B00M6BXQVQ/) and [The Father of Lies](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0789SY9MR/). I find that novellas and short stories are perfect format for the kind of story he usually tells.

  I've seen some threads discussing K J Parker here before, but I don't recall if there was a thread as such.

  My favourite K J Parker works are the Engineer Trilogy, but most of the stuff he's written is good. 

  Apparantly K J Parker also wrote under the nom de plume of Tom Holt; I tried ~4 books published under the Holt name, and got no more than 50 pages into any of them before abandoning them. There's a spectacular difference between the two authors, and I would never have guessed they were the same person.

  I've recommended The Engineer trilogy before. It has many rational tropes, and I am quite the fan. :) The Folding Knife was a bit disappointing in that the characters failed to talk to each other. Even though, given their temperaments, that was entirely believable, and may not have made a difference. It also did a great job portraying the random nature of reality--how events completely out of your control can change everything, and you never had a chance to do anything about it. Sure, I know that many armies have fallen to things like an unknown/unexpected disease decimating their ranks, or adverse weather events sinking all their ships. But boy is it narratively unsatisfying!  


  I got distracted by the tangent. Yes, KJ Parker is great!

    I think the biggest divergence from the rational fiction subgenre is that often you can't puzzle out his mysteries beforehand, it's good writing and when done well it mimics the fog of reality but it isn't hewing to the definition of rational fiction as I asserted in the OP.  


    However, his occasional deus ex machina very rarely help the MC, it really is diseases and storms all the way.  


    I might recommend The Company.  It's one of my favorite novels, and it is very different from the folding knife.  I think one of the axis of Parker's writing is between concrete worldbuilding and essentially style/characterization.  The folding knife is really carried along by it's somewhat charming MC, and not enough work goes into establishing the different elements of it's plots, nor the physical locations in which they take place.  
    The Company isn't as expansive in it's reach, but is a much tighter book, and the success or failure or the main characters rests solely on their own abilities.  They aren't lucky or unlucky in excess, other than their prior success in the military.
