Marked for Death is an RPG-style story set in a rational reimagining of Naruto, where thread participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.


The first chapter is [here,](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/) and the story-only thread (if you’d like to get caught up quickly) is [here.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/4993131/) There’s also a [guide to voting](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6283682/) put together by Twofold, one of the thread participants. Drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja. 

The story updates every Thursday (u/Velorien of [Lighting Up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark)) and Sunday (u/eaglejarl of [Team Anko](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko), [2 Year Emperor](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/) and [Induction](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/Induction/chapter_001.html)).

  If you're confused about /u/OliWhail's reaction, note that there is a ~~little~~ boatton of backstory drama associated with this chapter.  Click the '<<' (previous threadmark) icon at the top- and bottom-right for the details.

    Thank Jashin for merciful QMs indeed. *grumbles about threadban, unrelatedly*

    Oh, on that note, I did want to apologize too for any part I had in fomenting the aggression and panic that happened as a result of the update. Though I was threadbanned before it dropped, and I was legitimately upset, it was not my intention to upset anyone. I'd intended to put this inthread once my ban was either rescinded or expired, but faflec's relayed comment warranted my own.

      Thanks, much appreciated.

      In a "lemons from lemonade" moment, I note that that we have far more people in thread than usual.  Hopefully that will convert to a larger community and higher vote count.

        Yeah, I was considering that as a bright side, too. I just hope that I don't end up getting anyone else banned accidentally because of moderators poking around as a result of my appeals. :p

          I hope that they decide to lift the ban and let you back in; you're an active player with good ideas and nigh-always positive contributions to the community.  That said, I wouldn't get your hopes up.  The violations of rules 3 and 4 are arguable, but your post was almost a literal cut-n-paste from the "don't do this" list under rule 2.
          ```

          - u/Cariyaga:
            ```
            My main argument was that given I've only made 11 posts outside of the thread (well, 12 including the appeal), that a 2 week ban was excessive for a 25-point infraction (which does not even yield a single-day forum ban by their system).
            ```

            - u/eaglejarl:
              ```
              That's a good argument.  Good luck with it; hope to see you soon!
