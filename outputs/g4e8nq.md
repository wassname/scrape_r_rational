  ```
  Just read all of Ascent last night.  It was pretty good!
  ```

- u/TheUtilitaria:
  ```
  And that's a wrap - I have another short story, sequel to [Seeker](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/08/30/seeker/), finished today as well - [Frameshift](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2020/04/19/frameshift/). I'd love to know what you all think now that it's finally finished. More short stories to come, stay tuned!

  >Maybe Vash could, for this moment, believe it would all turn out for the  best. Maybe this was what they all needed. Another brave new world.

  And remember you can start Ascent [here.](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2017/09/28/chapter-1-necessity/)
