  I think you underestimate how negatively the average person responds to murder. You might be interested in reading the book "On Killing." An ex-infantryman-turned-psychologist analyzes behavior surrounding death. Interestingly, it was a significant war problem throughout most of our history - he provides a fairly convincing amount of evidence showing that only a small fraction of any given soldiering force prior to the 1970s were actually firing *at* their enemy. Most gunfight participants in history spent their time firing *near* their enemies instead. It was a significant problem for generals on both sides of WW1, for example. 

  Given that, I don't find it hard to believe that being pulled out of math class and facing death might involve some suboptimal behavior. That being said, I suspect Joon is far more brutal than the average person might be when faced with those circumstances.

  Joon gets desensitized over time, if that's your main concern.
  ```

    Second the On Killing recommendation - the author does overstate his point, pulling data primarily from new recruits and extrapolating it to the mean soldier, but its still eye opening and in Joon's case "new recruit" overstating his abilities. His reactions to these situations are utterly normal, and I enjoyed these moments as a sign of good storytelling.
    ```

    - u/AHaskins:
      ```
      In fact, I definitely remember having the thought that Joon was unusually bloodthirsty. I explained it by way of the game layer conditioning him, personally.

      And I agree that the author does exaggerate his case, but I followed up on a few of his sources (I'm also a veteran-turned-psychologist, and got curious). I would be surprised if he were wrong in an absolute sense, rather than just in terms of degree.
      ```

      - u/8gigcheckbook:
        ```
        I agree that Joon seems unusually quick to adapt to frequent murder (it was my first thought when reading OP's question). I think the game layer conditioning him is a reasonable thought, given how it alters other aspects of his thinking.  I also attributed it to Joon having been a hunter who regularly killed and dressed deer and other mammals, though I'm curious if the data (if it exists) would support that hunters would be less squeamish about killing humans.
        ```

        - u/AHaskins:
          ```
          Ah, I need to clarify. I wasn't suggesting that the game layer directly changed his brain function. 

          I meant that a combination of detachment ("clearly none of this is real"), positive reinforcement (orgasmic level up), and the vaguely positive soft language used (coterie "defeated"!) explained how he got into a gaming mentality of death being cheap. Honestly, I thought it was a really cleverly subtle way of justifying his behavior.
          ```

          - u/Bowbreaker:
            ```
            On top of that the first enemies hr kills (in melee nonetheless) are zombies, creatures that look very human but we have been conditioned by media to see as more acceptable targets than rabid animals.
            ```

          - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
            ```
            IIRC - and maybe this has changed in an editing pass? - there are definitely fights where the notification states "Killed" rather than "Defeated". A quick search through some fight scenes shows this not to be the case, huh.
            ```

      - u/Law_Student:
        ```
        It would be interesting to know to what degree the hesitation to kill changes after significant combat experience. Does it change for most soldiers? Only a fraction? I could see it going either way.
        ```

        - u/AHaskins:
          ```
          Been a long time since I read that book. I vaguely remember the assertion that less than 10% of *any* fighting force prior to 1970 actively worked to harm the enemy. The other 90% are just mostly supporting (covering fire, spotting, reloading, whatever). I disagree with his numbers, but not his overall conclusion.

          The conditioning programs implemented after WW2 definitely had a demonstrable effect, though, so this is less true today.
          ```

          - u/Law_Student:
            ```
            I've also heard that having soldiers practice shooting man shaped targets made a big difference?
            ```

            - u/AHaskins:
              ```
              That's part of the conditioning I spoke of.
              ```

              - u/Law_Student:
                ```
                Gotcha.
                ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    What about pre revolution? Seems like most people would be struggling if they can't kill.

    Most of our history seems unlikely to me.

    I just can't imagine cavemen being broken up about killing neanderthals. One only has to look at the sack of cities after a seine to see that people didn't seem to have a problem with completely optional evil like rape, theft and murder
    ```

    - u/AHaskins:
      ```
      Pre-revolution was actually the most convincing to me. I remember him trotting out various war histories, pointing to times that two armies did the Napoleonic march-n-shoot from point blank range. The record time for those engagements was something like 8 fucking hours. I don't care how inaccurate a musket is, if you fire 480 times and miss a wall of dudes standing 30 feet away every single time - you aren't really trying to hit them.

      I don't think he ever gave me a satisfying answer regarding pre-gun history, though.

      EDIT: All these numbers are suspect, btw. This is a memory of a book I read about a decade ago.

    Yeah it's completely different in tone from basically every other LitRPG I've read, and I've read quite a few. There's elements of deep mystery and horror, the world building has incredible scale and variety, and the characters and characterization don't just feel like simple tropes.
    ```

    - u/Namelis1:
      ```
      In WtC, LitRPG is just set dressing to frame an opportunity for the author to flex his worldbuilding muscle.

      "*Yeah I guess it's a LitRPG, here's a paper thin excuse for the world to exist as it does and some bullshit numbers so that the character can keep involved with the plot. Whatever. Now, let me tell you about frongal legs, memes and the futures value of teleportation items.*"

      Note, I'm quoting a fever dream I had once, not the actual author. 

      Point is Wales takes that opportunity. A lot of authors seem to be content with *just* a LitRPG. Woo. Numbers.

        Don't dies numbers, it can be really enjoyable when done right - it's like "here's a bunch of numbers and mechanics, find a way to break it and then get the payoff of it *actually happening* when the character does exactly that next chapter!

        This requires the character to do the obvious (or not?) exploitation, which requires a certain amount of intelligence/rationality of course.

        Think of LitRPG as the logical extension of formalised magic systems.
        ```

          >Think of LitRPG as the logical extension of formalised magic systems.

          Know what, you changed my mind, just a bit. That viewpoint makes sense.
          ```

    Even though it's technically a LitRPG, it doesn't feel any other LitRPG. It's like a real world with numbers reflecting that reality, with a bit of added bonus. Compare that to most LitRPGs, where numbers are the real world, and that "bit of added bonus" turns into OP as fuck.

    Worth the Candle is *really* satisfying.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      I don't understand the distinction. Could you clarify?
      ```

      - u/Green0Photon:
        ```
        In Worth the Candle, it usually seems more like numbers are the statistics measuring what reality is. Compare this to most LitRPGs, where the numbers are literal. They're the way the world works.

        In WtC, let's say you tried to look at someone's stat sheet, who isn't Jun. You could do it (ie, via essentialism). But you can't really just change someone's number. Or, if you can, that's the game layer abstracting over a ton of info trying to figure out what that person would be like and what it means for that number to be something different.

        The point is that those numbers reflect reality, just condensed. Normal statistics. Jun's just has that process going further.

        In other LitRPGs, this is not the case. The game layer *is* reality. There is no fancy set of calculations or anything, that person's number is literally how reality is.

        Think of it like this: in games, we can't model everything as complexly as reality, so we simplify things. WtC treats reality as reality, like any good story might. There's just an interface showing some fancy stats. Other LitRPGs is reality literally being as simple as the game. Yeah, putting it like that, it doesn't make sense, but that's why most LitRPGs are bad! They try to treat reality as normal but at the same time they try to treat it as a strange simplified mess, which only works when you can you're playing an actual game to keep that Suspension of Disbelief. Thus, many LitRPGs end up feeling like Crack fics.

        Funnily enough, that manhua manga which inspires so much fanfic actually did it pretty well. Reality wasn't that simple, instead there was a super power making things easier.

        [Shinobi: The RPG](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/shinobi-the-rpg-act-1-naruto-si.36903/) is an interesting LitRPG fic because it tries its hardest to make it a simplified reality for the SI, but a normal reality for everyone else. It's the only fic I know that plays with this aspect.

        In any case, my point was that good LitRPGs are like normal stories where reality makes sense and the game layer is just a superpower, rather than fucking with reality to make it more like a game.

        I hope this helped. 😊

  I think you should keep with it. I find WTC to be one of the most interesting stories I've read.

  Imo he gets better... I was pretty annoyed with some of his early decisions too~
  Give the man a break, he just woke up and is kind of disoriented... He gets better after they get out of zombie apocalypse land~

    Also, he's got all of 2 points in SOC. What else can you expect from a man with a dump stat?
    ```

- u/obrmao:
  ```
  As far as I can see he does stay a bit sentimental throughout the story and I don't think he really thought about what would happen to the last guy he brought to Cypress. It does reveal more of Cypress's character to him and that's what I think it has mainly been about.

  It's rather disturbing to me that the main character (who is already killing people) in your eyes "gets better" by becoming \_more\_ murder-hobo-y.

  Yeah he changes a lot as a person over the course of the story, mostly for better.
