## LF Rational HP fics (NOT HPMOR)

### Post:

So, I'm looking for 'rational' stories that aren't self-sure mary sue wankery - HPMOR is, in my opinion, and I've met few more that made me drop this line of fics, but recently I've met link to "[Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9950232/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Perfectly-Reasonable-Explanation)" and loved it. 

So, I'm looking for similar stories - MC being properly awed and confused by magic world and ignorant in magical life the same way mages ignorant of muggles, non-MC characters actually being smart and having their own agenda, magical world with it's own reasons, magic being 'magical' or having different base rules to known muggle sciences, and so on.

  TVT also says:

  * [*Child of the Storm,*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm) a Mega Crossover that started as simply between Harry Potter and Marvel Cinematic Universe, is written at least partially in this style (it helps that the magic is drawn heavily from The Dresden Files), with the author noting that his main interest was in exploring the consequences of mixing worlds, with the reactions to the premise (Thor was James Potter, as part of a first run at the whole humility thing), and the reactions to those reactions, driving the plot. ...

    >Too Young to Die

    I have to give an anti-recommendation for this one. As stated it has a "ruthless" protagonist, which in this story translates to edgy with a really slapdash tragic start.

    If I hadn't seen it here the premise alone, of an emotionally-abused-by-Lily-and-James Harry with a spoiled twin who defeated the dark lord, has enough red flags to make me drop it. The first tragic event happens before I can connect to anyone and falls completely flat. Later I find that "ruthless" means he casually casts dark magic on people for little more than the pleasure it provides?

    I'm having a lot of trouble connecting with anything in this story and given how the first few conflicts were handled it seems to have at least an order of magnitude more "self-sure mary sue wankery" than HPMOR.

      On a more positive note, out of that list I rather liked [*Forging the Sword*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword) and [*Temporal Beacon, HP & the*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon)

        There’s also [a recursive one-shot offshooting from Temporal Beacon,](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10721988) so once you get finished with the Beacon, you could try it out as well.

  Wasn't there a weird HP fic posted here a while ago where everyone's names were subtly misspelled and wizards discovered spells basically by performing some kind of hashing algorithm?

    HP and The cup of magic! Unfortunately not enough to google it, but is very similar to that. "Previously,the highest thaum concentration ever measured was in the cup of midnight during the ritual that enacted Merlins Interdict. The thaum concentration in the cup of magic was 20 million times that". 

    EDIT: searching for "cup" here on /r/rational did it https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12299677/1/The-Universe-Is-An-Optimisation-Problem

  Harry Potter and the Natural 20? It's a fic following a DnD character that's transported to the HP-verse. Also the police eventually figure out what's going on thanks to technology.

      >"I remember you when you were *this* tall," she said, gesturing to about her waist. "A wide-eyed, innocent young Hufflepuff, not that that's anything to be ashamed of, in my Transfiguration class. Such *promise*. Such *potential*." She shook her head slowly. "And what do you do with it? Prank every little boy who comes your way into thinking they're secretly the Boy-Who-Lived. Honestly, I don't know *how* you sleep at night."

  [Applied Cultural Anthropology](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or) is a great fic centered on a Slytherin!Hermione.  Includes psychologically realistic development, a smart/competent but not overpowered protagonist, and a sufficiently "agenty" cast that it doesn't feel as if the protagonist's actions alone are driving the narrative.

  [**The Arithmancer**](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer) is a good read, though not strictly rational. It focuses on Hermione, who in this fic has an eidetic memory and a love of maths, and delves deeply into (obviously) arithmancy and spell creation. The book goes through years 1-4 in Hogwarts. I enjoyed it more than its sequel, Lady Archemedes (covering years 5-7), which I didn't actually finish... though looking online I think I just got to the end and never went back, as it's now finished. I might do so at some point...

  I remember a lot of talk a while back about [**Horry Patter and the Philologer's Stone**](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12717474/1/Horry-Patter-and-the-Philologer-s-Stone), but it's not really rational. Like, at all. But it appeals to a lot of readers on r/rational (somewhat like how Unsong does, I think) so it might appeal to you too. I'm not up to date on it, but it basically sets up the world of HP as an alternate timeline where everything is slightly, uncomfortably, *off*. Don't get confused by the character names when you're reading - they are definitely different people than the normal HP timeline, and the seemingly annoying changes to the spellings are that way for a reason.

  And [**Significant Digits**](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html) is the unofficial (but endorsed by Eliezer Yudkowsky) sequel to HPMOR if you haven't read it yet. 

  Finally, I second the other recommendations for Harry Potter and the Natural 20. It's highly amusing if you have any fondness for D&D. It's also unfinished, though; we've had, what, one update in the past three years? So be warned of that.

    Horry patter captures a lot of the mystique of the original hp series
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      Hmmm, it definitely has mystique but to me it felt more like "The Magicians" than "Harry Potter," despite the obvious HP setting and influence. Rather than magic feeling mysterious and cool and amazing, it felt like magic was powerful and fearful and dangerous. It felt like a disaster was always looming just out of sight, and things would come crashing down at any moment. It's a sign of good writing that it inspired that uneasiness in me, but it was definitely a different feeling than when I read HP for the first time!

    It came across as rather masturbatory.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      That's... nowhere close to the word I'd use to describe the series. I disliked the series as it went on because Hermione seemed to become a Mary Sue who could do no wrong. Exploring the magical world and making sense of its rules? I loved it. Mastering those rules when convenient and becoming an overpowered shounen protagonist? Eh... not appealing to me.

  I don’t have any recommendations, but if you’re looking for terminology to narrow down your search, the category of ratfic you’re looking to avoid is called “competence porn”.
