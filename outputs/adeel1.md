  God damn. Worth the Candle, Mother of Learning, and The Good Student all updated within a day.

  I thought Christmas was on Dec 25th, not Jan 6th.

    Orthodox Christmas is actually today so you're sort of right.

  ```
  Winnum Roke is starting to grow on me as a character.  She has her own agenda, and she's maybe/probably an antagonist, but I still like her chats.

    I definitely like Winnum Roke, but this was an annoying development to me. I had to eyeroll at the cult reveal - I guess I was expecting something more novel than ~spooky cult activity~. Iâ€™m already looking forward to getting this done and over with so we can get back to more interesting things.
