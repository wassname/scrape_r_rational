    Since you play DnD, I'm wondering if you watch Critical Role. The protagonists eventually get a bag of holding that they usually put monster parts in to keep them from decomposing.

    This is essentially the same item. I definitely thought it was cool at the time.

  They should make pocket dimension bullets for their magical railgun. Imagine how much damage a pebble-sized boulder would do. And if hitting the target messes up the pocket dimension, all the better.

    I was kind of wondering if destabilizing pocket dimensions followed conservation of momentum.

  Hmm. Is this the first time Zorian casually edited the memories of someone that wasn't an enemy?

    Considering he spent a restart attacking random aranea and rummaging through their minds for practice, that question is kind of moot.

- u/gbear605:
  ```
  So how many restarts do they have left at this point?
  ```

  - u/Aretii:
    ```
    As of the conversation with the Guardian in chapter 73, they had 42 left.

    I believe they're now down to about 26, but I may have miscounted the ones that have gone by since.

    - u/TheAtomicOption:
      ```
      the last number I remember was ~46, but that was a little while ago. I think they're somewhere in the high twenties or low 30s right now. It's going to be a bit close considering they have to not only steal all of them, but also take them to the box, figure out how to use them AND figure out whether they can both leave at the same time (and if not, who should leave first).
      ```

  - u/scalymonster:
    ```
    I counted the restarts out on a spreadsheet. Provided I didn't miss any, they have 23 restarts left at the end of this chapter (down from 52 when they met the guardian).

    Yeah red robe leaving the loop early really feels like a dumbass move to me. Like, even if Zorian and Zach have "disrupted all his plans" he should be able to figure out they won't be leaving the loop any time soon, and spending additional *years* becoming an even better mage before leaving is not a replicable opportunity.

    Something's fishy there somewhere.

            Yeah, the Aranea were
            ```

    - u/Kahandran:
      ```
      To add on to what others are saying, Red Robe knew he was against mind-magic user(s) since his encounter with Zorian in the Aranean den. He even took a mental blow from Zorian. Mind magic fuckery can basically turn you into a vegetable or change you forever so it's reasonable to want to gtfo as soon as possible to avoid that. Plus he thought they wouldn't be able to leave after he did.
      ```

    - u/GoXDS:
      ```
      do remember that he thought only 1 person could leave. ie. he *had* to be the first to leave
      ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      He erroneously thought he knew that somebody managed to find out enough about the loop to enter a whole bunch of spiders into it. Given that assumption, it's not unreasonable to think that that person is 1) well connected 2) a good mage 3) knows about the loop menchanics. At that point it's simply too dangerous to sit in the loop, where you can be mindraped/soulkilled/erased when that person exits the loop first. Not an unreasonable reaction on his part IMO.

  >Just like that, another six restarts had gone by.

  I feel like it's going to be quite the rush to get out when they finally get all the key pieces.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Then, when they finally get out of the time loop, they see a bunch of Silverlakes on the outside. Not because she's Red Robe, but because she found out how to tunnel through the primordial cage ages ago and didn't bother to tell them.
    ```

  - u/KJ6BWB:
    ```
    > Just like that

    Yes.  They seem very casual about using more restarts, "Oh, I'll just put that off for later..."

    For instance, the cranium rats in this chapter.  They were just put off for later.

    Anyone tracking how many they have left?  Isn't it only like 30 more restarts left?
    ```

  - u/Zorian42:
    ```
    They were planning to try to convert the orb into black room, that could change length of one restart (30 days + 2 black rooms = ~ 75 days) to more?
    ```

    - u/Elec0:
      ```
      I really doubt that would work. Didn't they bring the orb into a black room at one point and have it immediately start then stop because the actual amount of space inside it matters, so the orb made the power consumption huge?
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        Yeah, because they put orb into the old room. Idea was to turn the orb *itself* into a new Black Room, abusing the fact that it's so isolated because of dimensional stuff to get higher rates of time acceleration that in a normal room.
        ```

- u/bruhman5thfloor:
  ```
  So  Silverlake caves and hands over the research in the end. She’s probably the most dangerous person to bring in on the time loop after they get out.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Eh, she lived for hundreds of years already. Suppose she made use of the 5 year equivalent of loop left-over doing her research without fear of consequences; it would gain her, what, equivalent progress of 20 years of ordinary research? That means, not so much.
    ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      You forgot the cruсial difference Zorian pointed out in the previous chapter: the opportunity to conduct destructive research on precious/irreplaceable materials and have them back in a month. It's possible that some results are virtually unattainable without such means of analisys, and they would be precisely what Silverlake needs for a breakthrough. Time for her may not be an issue, but this - is.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        Then again, Silverlake doesn't strike me as a person who would hesitate over destroying irreplaceable divine artifacts XD.
        ```

          Not if she wants to keep actually using them :)

            I mean, if she thought she could recreate their function...
            ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    I am something like 95% confident Z&Z can kick her butt in combat if need be, and 85% confident Zorian is paranoid enough not to fall for various subterfuge methods of attack (e.g. poison in food-he probably uses his own snacks). There really is no effective way for her to force them to do anything with a stick. Furthermore, she just admitted that Zorian can instakill her with any heavy mind attack because of the dead man switch. She can't really do anything.

          There's damn near always a crisis. To the point where I'm genuinely uncertain as to what you're talking about specifically. Net Neutrality? The President? The overall resurgence of populism and anti-globalism? All of the above and more?

          Before those issues you could've used the excuse of the election. Before that I don't know because I generally try to avoid US politics, but there's *always* a lot of passion and *always* a pet issue that seems like the end of the world at the moment. 

          There's subreddits for this sort of thing for a reason. They pretty much all suck, which just furthers my point.

          It's like Christian Rock. [You're not making Christianity better, you're just making Rock And Roll worse.](https://i.redd.it/5iqvu91yz0ly.jpg)

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  Is it just me or do they seem to be wasting so much time they could have spent hiring people to drive a simulcrum progressively closer to the newest key piece so they can teleport their immediately subsequent loops.  If they can get to Koth in a week they can get there sooner.  They're running out of loops and they're just sitting around grinding levels
  ```

  - u/CorneliusPhi:
    ```
    Their problem is a categorical difference between the two continents that they need to get to.  The first they were able to island hop, doing basically what you asked for here.  Now they need to get across an ocean that can't be sailed across in a month.

    Also I believe that at this point they are using Bakura gates to get to Koth so there isn't any optimizing that further?
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      >  Now they need to get across an ocean that can't be sailed across in a month.

      That's Blantyre, Xlotic is *on the way* to Koth
      ```

  - u/silver7017:
    ```
    teleport has range limits. the only reason teleporting to get to koth worked was because there are islands to serve as stops. teleporting flatly will not work to get to any other continent.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      They can already get to a continent  *past where they need to go* in under a week,
      ```

      - u/nobody103:
        ```
        The place they want to go to is in the middle of a giant, hostile desert. It may be closer in the absolute sense, but they can't get there by hiring teleporters like they did with Koth. It's just like European explorers were entirely capable of sailing around the Cape of Good Hope long before they could travel into the center of the African continent.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          How far could a simulacrum-golem travel on foot in a month? And how much attention would it attract from the wildlife? If they could establish a teleport chain from a Xlotic Bakora gate into the interior, that would presumably only take a day or two at most to traverse (and a simulacrum could do that and then gate them in).

          Regular simulacra need to sleep, but it's not clear whether that applies to golacra.
          ```

          - u/nobody103:
            ```
            It would attract just as much attention from the wildlife as the original. Most creatures can't tell a simulacrum is fake.

            Yes, they intend to use Bakora Gates as a way to reach their destination in future restart, but by dedicating a restart to the attempt and reaching the closest gate in one fell swoop. 

            Also, keep in mind that the reason Zorian is so fixated on the airship is because he needs it to reach Blantyrre, which cannot be reached through teleportation jumping, not because it would be impossible to reach the Xlotic interior without it. Using the airship to reach Ziggurat of the Sun just a side benefit.

      That's exactly the impression I got.

      He's in the position of, say, a dad whose son's car broke down. The son insists on just going to a mechanic, but the dad *knows* it's just the air filter or the sparkplug or something.

      Equivalent of teaching a man to fish instead of giving him a fish.

      I hope that makes sense, I found that oddly hard to express.
      ```

  - u/mp3max:
    ```
    The difference being he's an already accomplished proffesor in a very prestigious academy while Zorian is just a student (at least from the professor's pov). 

    Giving a bit of help for free to an student? sure why not?.

    Paying money for a translation when you're a young student just for "convenience"? I mean, it's not bad but i get why the dude would try to convince Zorian against doing that.
    ```

  - u/PresentCompanyExcl:
    ```
    Could be start of a quest chain. Zorian discovers link between language and spell engineering, or a language and artifacts and goes back to prof for more info. Professor reveals that it's his area of research and asks him for Damiens help retrieving more artifacts. Zorian does it himself... or something like that.
    ```

- u/PurposefulZephyr:
  ```
  So what exactly did they do in this update, and consequently in those six months?

  * Got someone to translate airship's schematics (as well as start learning the language used)- most likely able to steal the ship next update.
  * Incrementally improve their pocket dimension skills, allowing for containers with additional effects 
  * Zorian learned the psychic Mind Blank, making him again as sneaky (if not sneakier) than a normal mage.
  * Secured cooperation with Silverlake, giving her means of keeping info between restarts.
  * Various smaller improvements, mentioned after the last break (kinda notable are imminent Zach's simulacra- massive boost to combat, if not much else).
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    You know, I don't think that simulacra will be such a massive boost for Zach. They will help, of course, and he can maintain more of them than Zorian can. But they don't really help with his big advantage, namely large mana reserves. I suppose they would allow him to trade endurance for a massive opening salvo, but without mind magic they aren't the force multiplier that they are for Zorian, nor do they have the same capacity for research (since they have to transfer results the old-fashioned way).
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      For magic related stuff, they're a bigger boon than they are for Zorian. He would no longer need to divide his attention between attack and defense, he could spend longer shaping spells without the cost of leaving himself open, he can be in multiple places at once even if he would only be at partial capacity, etc. Even if Zach has 4 simulacra in a fight, each has the mana of a normal mage, and all of Zach's skills.

      For learning stuff, yes they're inferior to Zorian's, but then that's to be expected.
      ```

  - u/Zorian42:
    ```
    >steal the ship 

    To get to next two parts of the key (ring in Xlotic desert, staff in Blantyrre).
    >Zorian learned the psychic Mind Blank 

    To sneak through primordial's pocket dimension without having to confront the primordial at all.
    >smaller improvements

    Increasing simulacra army size? So 10 simulacras for Zorian in next chapter? 

    Also Zorian is trying to find out how to use Bakora gate by himself == being able to get to distant places in the very first day of restart ...
    ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    * Artifact research-potentially arbitrarily great returns, up to and including making their own, or just using the ones they already have for any of the million problems they have. Plus, easier to discover key features maybe.
    * Leveling soul sight skill-potentially super important in fighting QI, red robe, figuring out how to get out of the loop, figuring out the key functions, etc
    * Simulacrum 1:likely further magic gun research in preparation for QI takedown
    * Simulacrum 2:likely further simulacrum golem research in preparation for lichification post loop. See Soul Sight
    * Simulacrum 3:likely further senses/mind editing research, potentially super great
    * Simulacrum 4(?):research into cranium rats/hydra, in preparation for turning all simulacrums into one awesome SWARMMIND
    * Experts et al: Spell and golem refinement, new crypt breaking spells, finding the key location in Blantyre, etc, etc, etc
    * Invasion: Probably incrimental memorisation of QI defense/offense arsenal by sending Alanic and others after him. Z&Z don't have to be personally present to test things.
    * Gate research by experts-always nice.

    Really, I think they are moving along nicely. They have three major meta problems:
    * Find the keys
    * Escape the loop
    * Defeat invasion afterwards
    First involves finding the keys (task best left to experts), getting to the keys (airship-a slow process), and then getting the keys (hard to estimate what skills will be needed, but presumably combat+defence, which they already have in abundance, plus fortifying holes in their defence-mostly soul sight for soul defence at this point). Furthermore, they need a way to break into the royal treasury, and a way to safely kill QI.

    Second involves god knows what, but some things seem likely to help. Soul-related skills are likely to be useful, since time loop deals with soul transfer. Same with mind magic skills. Dimensional skills are likely to be useful, since time loop is dimensional in nature. 

    Third involves mundane logistical optimisation (Alanic) and defeating QI. My personal best bet is a really long-ranged magic railgun with a dimensionaly-folded bullet with one of those soul-tearing spell formulas Kael did once.

    Finally, artifacts are wildcards, so they are useful any time you don't know what the problem might be, and studying them is useful.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      You're forgetting that Zorian can maintain six golacra, not three, and two of them were working on golacrum body refinements.

      It would be awesome IMO if they devised a golem body that simulacra could freely possess and leave, with standard animation in their absence. So, you send in an army of 50 golems, with 6 simulacra amongst them as commanders, and whenever a simulacrum gets severely damaged, he jumps to another golem body and keeps going.

    They don't know for certain that the Key will get them out - especially Zorian, whose original body already contains a soul. It's their best lead and they're chasing it, but Zorian is also working on a backup plan using the primordial prisons as a bridge.

    And that plan involves large-scale pocket dimensions.

        After all, Red Robe was presumably perfecting the invasion process for use during the real month at the end of the loop, though honestly you could argue he was using the invasion to grind skills or something and that they'll exit by the end of the month or something.

          It would be interesting if every loop took something in the nano-
          or microsecond range in the real world (and indeed, we have no evidence each loop takes any time, or at least any subjectively experienceable time, in the real world—the gate seems to only be limited in how many loops it can run by the mystical power available from the planar alignment, not the passage of real-world time). Then if Zorian and Zack make it out via the keys, Red Robe would literally still be in the room with the gate when they do.

      But they don't really have the time to do everything anymore. Gotta focus at some point.

        They have a lot of helpers. Daimen tracked down this Key piece for them, and Silverlake is tutoring them in dimensionalism rather than them researching it from scratch. So, their time usage is very efficient.

          Still lots of pieces to find.
