## [D] Dyson Sphere feasibility vs shoddy online journalism

### Post:

I've been sprucing up a wikipedia page for a [transhumanist author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dvorsky#Dyson_Sphere) who [wrote about](http://www.sentientdevelopments.com/2012/03/how-to-build-dyson-sphere-in-five.html) the prospect of making a Dyson Sphere in the near-ish future. AFAICT, he cited his sources and got all the facts pretty much dead on.

A journalist [tried](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/04/03/destroying-mercury-to-build-a-dyson-sphere-is-a-bad-idea/) to shoot him down using some really bad numbers. It was pretty terrible because his core argument was that it would take 174 years to disassemble Mercury using the entire output of the sun at 1/3 efficiency. By contrast, when I do the calculations I get 4 *hours*. Even worse, using his own numbers gives me 1.75 years.

Two media sources [[2](http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-04/why-death-star-attack-mercury-harvest-solar-energy-not-worth-it)] [[3](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/forget-wimpy-plans-and-nimbys-let-s-solve-the-energy-crisis-by-blowing-up-mercury)] and one popular skepticism blog [[3](https://worldofweirdthings.com/2012/04/05/why-we-wont-build-a-dyson-sphere-soon/)] followed up on the story, all of them taking Knapp's 174 year number at face value despite him never explicitly giving the math.

Anyone else have a similar story to share, and/or want to check my math in the WP article?

Edit: Just to clarify, Knapp's [claim](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/04/03/destroying-mercury-to-build-a-dyson-sphere-is-a-bad-idea/) was that 174 years is the bare minimum based on fundamental energy constraints, not that it was a more realistic number given human factors or any such weaker claim that might be defensible. The 4 hour figure and 1.75 year figure are based on the total output collectable by a sphere, one surrounding our sun at 1.0 AU in the first case and another with his proposed surface area which also gets 1.4 kW/m^2 from its star.

  That number discrepancy made me laugh so much. It's sad how basic science gets thrown under the bus with shock journalism.

  Even if it took 174 years, that's going to be a fraction of the time the project as a whole would take, and even that's not a good argument about its validity.

  I would expect a classical Dyson sphere (a globe of independent habitats and manufactories orbiting the sun) to be the work of millennia... but it would pay for itself within a few production cycles because the process itself would produce valuable energy supplies, resources, and real-estate. Even if some part of the process took a long time to *complete* that's almost irrelevant as an argument against it!

  Edit: I remember the Forbes article as well, and it was so bad that it wasn't even wrong.

    Hi Argent! *waves*.  Small world, isn't it?  Let's build bigger ones :-).

    If it can pay for itself quickly, why would it take millennia to build? I figure it's an exponential growth thing. Once you've got the technology you need, you send a satellite to orbit the sun, beam the energy to a receiver on Mercury, use the energy to build more satellites, and the next thing you know there's so many satellites that the new ones don't get much sunlight and now you've hit peak solar and if you want more energy you'll have to look elsewhere.

    And now I want to write a story about someone about to finish a Dyson sphere and there's tons of worries about hitting peak solar and losing a bunch of jobs etc.

      Depends on the demand curve, how much of the energy goes to customers and how much gets ploughed back into production. New infrastructure is a customer, and if it's not paying as much as the paying customers, it's not going to get built.

      You're falling into the supply side fallacy that's been screwing up the US economy since Reagan. I mean Walmart can afford to build a zillion more locations and staff them, but they won't, because they don't project demand. So cutting their taxes won't convince them to build more stores... they'll just bank the difference.

  Did he just assume we'd take mercury apart from the earth's orbit?

  The Dyson Sphere (swarm) is barely conceivable, but I really wish we would concentrate on the more plausible next step in space.

  If we can get a permanent colony on the Moon, that would be a good start to a real presence in space.  A Moon colony would help us answer a lot of very important questions about human habitation in low gravity, and large-scale long-term closed environments.

  The Dyson Sphere concept just seems like pie in the sky when we don't even have one permanent colony on any other planetary or moon body.

    I don't think a Dyson swarm is something you set out to build. At some point, sending solar panels to the sun becomes a cost-effective energy source. When you run out of places to put them, you now have a Dyson swarm. There's no particular advantage to building a complete one. In fact, the energy per satellite starts going down once you get enough for them to occlude each other.

    I guess it would be useful to have a full one for Nicoll-Dyson lasers. And those things are probably pretty important for near light-speed travel. Rockets get exponentially more expensive as delta-v increases, but radiation pressure just gets more efficient.

  It will take an average of 4MJ to move 1kg of material from Mercury throughout the project (8MJ to start, gradually going down to nothing when we are left with the final 1kg chunk). If we assumed we started with the entire solar output dedicated to the project at 100% efficiency, we need about 10^30 J. We get that in 10,000 seconds, about three hours. At 1/3 energy collection efficiency and 1/10 mining efficiency, as the article assumes, we still finish in 300,000 seconds -- a little over three days.

  The problem isn't so much with how long it takes to pay off. It's with the time it takes to dismantle a planet.

  [The definitive guide to destroying planets](http://qntm.org/destroy) suggests using a large number of mass drivers expelling matter at 11km/s. We only need to hit 4km/s, fortunately, since Mercury is small. That's 8MJ to move one kilogram of Mercury (or iron or silicates) into solar orbit.

  That number will go down as we expel more of Mercury off Mercury, of course. We have 3.3×10^23 kg of Mercury to move.

  We're starting with a 1km square of solar generators capturing 1/3 of incoming solar energy, and that's positioned within spitting distance of Mercury -- we'll say it's in a polar orbit around Mercury, oriented for constant exposure to the sun. Mercury is about 7×10^7 km from the sun. 4×pi×r^2 gives the surface area of a sphere at that distance -- 6^16 square kilometers, give or take, and we're drawing power from one of them. The sun's total output is 3.8×10^26 W. That leaves us with ~10^9 W.

  Since we require 10^29 J to launch 5% of Mercury into orbit, our dinky solar array lets us launch 1/10^20 of our payload into orbit per second. It'll take 10^20 seconds to move that entire slice of the planet. That's 10^13 years. (Give or take. I'm doing order of magnitude here, people.) Not so great.

  But, all is not lost! In the first month, we launched about half a kilogram per second. We're assuming everything is roughly as dense as iron at 10g/cm^3 , and let's say a solar array is 1cm thick. To build a 1m array we'll need 1,000 cm^3 or 10kg. That's 200 seconds of mass driver output, which means we get 18 square meters of solar generator every hour, or 400 per day. Or to put it another way, our 1km solar panel takes 10^7 kg of material, which is about 2×10^7 seconds, which is about eight months at the starting rate. The third array comes at the one year mark; the fourth comes at 15 months; the fifth at 17.5 months; the sixth at 19.5 months...by two years you've got the fourteenth array well under way. In ten years, we're around five million. Once we reach twenty million, we can produce one per second -- just 4,000 days into the project. And at nineteen years, we're extracting a million tonnes of material for 100,000 new solar arrays.

  A million tonnes per second is a lot, possibly more than we could manage. But is it good enough? According to the guide:

  > At a million tonnes of mass driven out of the Earth's gravity well per second, this would take 189,000,000 years.

  Mercury is 5% the mass of Earth. I'm not holding my breath.

  But what if our mass drivers are perfection itself? Well, we probably don't want to add many more solar arrays near Mercury's orbit. It'll start interfering with Earth's incoming solar radiation, but the losses have been deemed acceptable. We're getting 3.3 gigawatts per, and we're making 100,000 per second. Every three and a half minutes, we increase extraction rates by one per second. We're roughly doubling every year. We need to reach 1×10^23 kg in one year, and then we'll be less than a year from completion.

  At nineteen years, we got 10^9 kg/s, or 10^16 kg/year. We'll get to 10^23 kg around 42 years into the project. We'll finish the project after 43 years.

  It's actually a bit better than that. About 35 years in, we'll have excavated a large enough portion of the planet that the energy costs for extracting more will go down measurably.

  > In fact, we could conceivably get going on the project in about 25 to 50 years, with completion of the first phase requiring only a few decades.

  Sure, assuming magic technology. But the article says 90% of the energy goes to things other than moving matter -- mining it, maintaining the mass drivers, that sort of thing. So it works out to several centuries, and that still requires magic mass drivers and magic energy transfer systems. Also, this gets us a Dyson's sphere at Mercury's orbit, whereas we need one at ~1.1AU.
