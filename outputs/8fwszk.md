  This.  This is what I've wanted since Cat was first given her knife.  She is beginning to lay ground rules between heroes and villains, that **both** sides will stomp on if violated.  No more Lone Swordsmen **or** Diabolist turning entire cities into graveyards.  The battles between Above and Below will be fought by those sworn to Above and Below, not innocent bystanders.  Greenskins and Praesi will not be killed or tortured as Willie "city-killer" of Greensborough did. 

  This is why I love this story.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Reminds me of the unwritten rules in Worm.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Unwritten rules were being set up and enforced by a secret third party with an infinite money supply, a source of powerful parahumans with a debt to them and a few ridiculously OP individuals. Cat's power base isn't nearly strong enough for that yet.
      ```

      - u/aeschenkarnos:
        ```
        I can see that coming, though. She could obtain an infinite money supply, she can collect up some more powerful Named (possibly Grey Pilgrim), and she *is* a ridiculously OP individual.

        However, there remains the two Chekhov's Guns of the gnomes, and the Red Letters.
        ```

        - u/RynnisOne:
          ```
          That's one Chekhov's Gun.  The Gnomes are the ones who *send* the Letters.

          In this case, it shouldn't even be a problem.  The Gnomes only care about technological advancement, which this has nothing to do with.  Furthermore, *Praes* has been sent Letters, not Callow.
          ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  10 chapters later, one of the Heroes calls upon Heavens and Cat gets a major power boost due to the opposition breaking a deal with a fae queen.
  ```

  - u/Rheklr:
    ```
    Damn, I didn't even notice how Cat stacked that story in her favour. And she didn't even need to make any real concessions to do so, as the stuff she wanted to ban was stuff she didn't want to do in the first place.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Well, she can't do stuff like, say, trick the heroes into killing the demon but keep the standard with the company of ancient devils, and she'll need to talk with Warlock and Hierophant about restrictions on diabolism, but yeah. I'm surprised the Pilgrim didn't try to ban fairies or assassination of the officers. Guess he either has a good way to deal with those or that would hinder the crusaders too.
      ```

      - u/Rheklr:
        ```
        The point of the terms was to avoid mass indiscriminate slaughter and allows the two sides to lower the stakes - cities not being sacked and surrendering without death or torture. Assassination of officers doesn't affect either and is standard warfare, and the Fae are a targeted weapon, one Cat needs to balance out the 14 heroes, so she can't say she won't use them without the Grey Pilgrim withdrawing Heroes in concession.
        ```

    - u/OmniscientQ:
      ```
      11 chapters later, Catherine realizes she won't be able to use that narrative boost without giving herself over completely to the Fae side of the Force.
      ```

- u/momanie:
  ```
  Dude holy shit, this was Blacks end game in a sense. He got what he wanted at least for now. Evil fucking won, Cat being an Evil Queen of Callow is changing eon old narrative, no wonder why Black was supportive of her and fine with letting her take the throne, even offering his help. This was what he wanted all along way back in the earlier books when he said he wanted evil to win, this is so fucking cool. Callow has always been good but now its evil god damn black be playing 5d chess.
  ```

- u/HallowedThoughts:
  ```
  So glad we finally got to see a more reasonabletake on a Hero. He still sticks to his beliefs, but he wants to help people at the end of the day. Hopefully their rules of engagement work out well and help with the Liesse Accords, whatever those end up being
  ```

- u/Sarkavonsy:
  ```
  A mature and reasonable hero! About time, huh?
  ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Gray Pilgrim seems to have missed a step, asking for a ban on demons and devils.  The thing Black Queen threatens to summon is Fae.
  ```

  - u/IDKWhoitis:
    ```
    He didnt miss a step, they were discussing WMDs. The fae are dangerous granted, but they are still conventional soldiers/weapons. They are banning the equivalent of nerve gas and nukes, not planes and tanks.
    ```

    - u/AweKartik777:
      ```
      Yup, and even the banning of devils was only a last minute addition (as in his mind the Angels vs Demons trade wasn't equivalent) - even Devils fall into the conventional soldier or planes/tanks category.
      ```

      - u/IDKWhoitis:
        ```
        Older devils can become pretty dangerous, as they also become fully sentient. And if you got the right pacts, you can call on some REALLY old devils.
        ```

        - u/Zayits:
          ```
          Yeah, and if this particular demon of Absence was indeed the one that ate the Ninth Crusade, it would have salvaged at least whatever troops were posessed by the mage-taking firefly devils. 

          It wasn't intentional, but retreating so the Hell Egg would be in he midst of the crusading army may pay off. Or it may just disappear the whole barony. Depends on how well the heroes prepare, really.
          ```

        - u/AweKartik777:
          ```
          True, I meant more like the lower Devils which we've seen used as fodder in this story. Same way high tier Fae like the Night Prince is on a nuke level, but normal Faes aren't.
          ```

- u/DarkArchon_:
  ```
  I would really love to see a heroic interlude from the perspective of the Grey Pilgrim as he goes over the results of their meeting with the rest of the heroes.
  ```

  - u/Sarkavonsy:
    ```
    Oh man, that would be such a great introduction to the rest of the crusading heroes!!
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    I want this specifically so the other Heroes get to wonder at how eminently reasonable the Black Queen is being. It's harder to think your enemies are pure evil when they're deliberately sparing civilians and banning WMDs and inhumane treatment of sophonts.

    This looks exactly like something to get the Heroes to the table in the Liesse Accords. If she demonstrates that agreements made with her are always honored, they should feel much more comfortable with making concessions.
    ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  > I’m willing to settle for the lesser prize. What I can’t break, I would regulate.

  Nice callback. I don't think we're getting Break and Regulate Aspects this time, but if the terms hold, this may well turn into an invasion story instead of a proper Crusade.

  Of cource, given the fact that Princes' Graveyard will still hapen despite Catherine's oath about sparing officers, I'm somewhat gleefully awaiting the good guys fucking this up.

  EDIT: Nevermind, the terms they discussed were about *prisoner* exchanges, not about refraining from targeting *officers*, both Headsman and targeting princes are very much in the cards.
  ```

  - u/xland44:
    ```
    What does the regulate aspect do?
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      > "My teacher dedicated his entire life to breaking this game, but that’s a reflection of his flaw – he can’t conceive a world where he doesn’t win. I’m willing to settle for the lesser prize. What I can’t break, I would *regulate*."

      Given that Catherine's initial pair of Break and Take stemmed from her having "something that would use what it could not break and break what it could not use" at her core, and mirrored Black's own Destroy and Conquer respectively, the distinction noted here would probably either diminish her enemies' power on breaking some kind of condition, placing a restriction on both her and the opponents-to-be, or empower her allies when enforcing some kind of pre-established agreement.
      ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        Plus, if her Fae aspect has anything to do about it, it should be amplified greatly, as deals and bargains are sort of their thing.
        ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  That went way better than it had any right to.
  ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  Oh, well done, Cat.  You even got the hero to give you brownie points for foisting your own dreaded problem (the Hell Egg) off on the heroes to solve.

  This chat went a lot better than any of the heroes visiting Cat to assassinate her, or even the parleys with Hasenbach.

  On another note:
  >“Simply by being who you are, you darken Creation,” the Grey Pilgrim replied calmly.

  >[...]

  >“Heed an old man’s advice, Catherine Foundling,” the Pilgrim said tiredly. “The world can only be healed so much.”

  >[...]

  >“There is not a single life I’ve taken I have not regretted,” the Grey Pilgrim sighed. “No matter the deeds to their name. To inflict death is to end the possibility of redemption, and that is the greatest gift the Gods have granted us.”

  Does anyone else get the impression (reinforced by the name) that Pilgrim started out on the same path Cat did (acting under an Evil Name with Good intentions), and then was redeemed to the side of Good?
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Nothing points specifically to a villain-to-hero redemption - even the last quote can be largely attributed to his regret of having to eventually outright kill the villains. That said, Levantine heroes are by and large more brutal than average, he easily may have done something that led him into his current Role in an attempt to redeem himself.
    ```

  - u/grokkingStuff:
    ```
    I think it's a reflection of how he has a Good Name but understands Evil Names & the need to choose the lesser evil. Sure, he's still Good but he's had to do his fair share of evil deeds while trying to overcome villains and he isn't as die\-hard as most heroes with a Good Name. I'd imagine dealing with the Above for fifty odd years doesn't let you keep the belief that they can only do good deeds \- hence the "gray" part to his Name \(I'm assuming he transitioned to this name\).

    Or it could be something else completely. I dunno :\)
    ```

- u/CFCrispyBacon:
  ```
  Cat's endgame continues to be the rational solution to this world.  I look forward to heroes and villains scheming for the dire stakes of...winning an election, or legislative changes.
  ```

  - u/Sarkavonsy:
    ```
    Kind of like that one empire on the larger continent, that's ruled by a hero and a villain simultaneously? Perhaps someone else somewhere had the same idea as Cat, a long time ago.
    ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      Oh, Rey. If only you'd taken Kylo Ren's offer in Snoke's throne room.
      ```

- u/themousehunter:
  ```
  Excellent chapter!! I loved the dialogue between Cat and the Pilgrim and the terms that got set up.
  ```
