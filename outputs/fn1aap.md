In which Peter faces the consequences of his actions.

### Comments:

- u/Flashbunny:
  ```
  It's pretty well-written, but so far it seems to be an alternative explanation/version of canon events instead of an actual divergence, which... isn't really my cup of tea. To me, it makes the story feel pointless.

  Still, that's a matter of personal preference - objectively speaking, it's well-written and makes sense, so I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't feel the same way I feel about this style of story.
