  I really liked how she carefully considered the options Catherine had, made intelligent and reasonable deductions, and came to a completely wrong conclusion. It's nice to have a mastermind type villain who can be wrong sometimes!

  I wonder what the full terms of the treaty are. It has to be something that would prevent Catherine / Callow from attacking Praes, and it probably is on the stick side of things rather than carrot. My guess would be that since it's a formal alliance between Praes and the Dead King, if Callow attacks Praes than the Dead King can attack Callow. That would seem heavy handed though.

    I mean, she wasn’t wrong. Catherine would have to be a complete moron to be going to the drow. It’s not that she didnt correctly assess the incentives so much as that she just didn’t really account for Cathering being herself.

  I groaned when I figured out the viewpoint character. I think that some antagonists are more interesting as an opaque, all-knowing enigma. On the other hand, this was a neat contrast with Cat:

  >"She was not Catherine Foundling, to carve out pieces of her own soul at a whim."

  What does Cat want? Cat is like the ruler of a 4x strategy game: she WILL stabilize her empire, and eat whatever the cost turns out to be. Her interpersonal relationships, whatever Indrani says, have been largely transactional. It's not that Cat has much to offer to the rest of the Woe. Instead the members of the Woe were chosen because they have something to offer Cat. In exchange they are granted a narrative weight that is impossible to find anywhere else. 

  Cat & co. succeed not because they have protagonist superpowers (everybody in the Guideverse has some level of plot-armor). Cat is successful because she managed to make her story into Callow's story. When she was up against the Wayward Prince in book 1, she had the full weight of an entire nation.

  There is some evidence for my claim in tonight's chapter. Notice how the countermeasures against Cat are things that would make her less popular. The Dead King succeeded in crafting a nation where his (evil) leadership enjoys the consent of the governed. If the Underdark campaign ends well then Cat might enjoy the same advantage during book 5.

    I agree that I liked mysterious Malicia, but this is a chapter that really humanizes her and adds a lot more depth to the character (perhaps setting the stage for Malicia vs Cat?) and works as an exposition chapter too. She's already had a lot of interaction (say vs Dwarves or Gnomes), so we already have a sense of her, she can't really be kept as an omniscient power.

    This was more about her relationship with Black, her trying to weigh him up with cold rationality and failing.
    ```

    - u/earnestadmission:
      ```
      Agreed! I groaned at the beginning but the rest of the chapter was really engaging. I think that the nature of Malicia/Black's relationship is genuinely new information. 

      There aren't a lot of loving relationships on the side of Evil, but now we have Malicia/Black, Masego/TheDads, and possibly Archer/Ranger (though that one is complicated by abusive power dynamics & neglect).

      This was the first chapter where Malicia's goals were a plausibly worthwhile alternative to Cat's.

      ```
      Yeah, Malicia seems a bit disconnected from reality here.

      I mean, she recently had a huge chunk of Callow's administration murdered, including extremely popular people like Baronness Kendall, and yet she thinks she can still get Callow back as a vassal state with a puppet queen.

      Forget cultural spite, there's not a single country on the continent that would accept this kind of shit without constant rebellions.
      ```

      - u/LordSwedish:
        ```
        To be fair, we don’t know what timescale she has planned here. If we saw her sketch the start of her plans against Ubuas mom it would have probably seemed weird at the time if we didn’t know it was decades in the making.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          I'm not sure what timescale Malicia is operating on.

          But I don't think she's planning on a scale of decades, or if she does, I think that's evidence of her being deluded. There's no way her plans will survive contact with the Dead King, the First Prince, Catherine, Black, the mad Tyrant, the Wandering Bard, and all the major heroes for long enough for Callowans to go from "kill every single Praesi we can get our hands on" to being part of the Empire again.

            She explicitly considers the decades-long ramifications of killing Masego on her relationship with Wekesa.
            ```

            - u/CouteauBleu:
              ```
              It's almost kind of poetic. It'd be insane to make decades-long plans because the events that will unfold in the next year will forever alter Calernia's political landscape in unpredictable ways. And it's very optimistic of her to rely on Wekesa forgiving her after a few decades, because there's no guarantee either of them will live that long. :P

  - u/tavitavarus:

    The Wayward Prince? Do you mean the Exiled Prince? I'm pretty sure the story that killed him was 'arrogant noble relies on magical equipment and gets killed by irony'.
    ```

    - u/earnestadmission:
      ```
      Magic items’ failure rate seems like an ad-hoc explanation for observed patterns and not a predictive model of the Guideverse. Considering a hero with a magical sword, how should an observer distinguish between the narrative of “rightful king returning to the throne” and “over reliance on magic item”? It seems to me that there’s a determinant of narrative direction (i.e. narrative weight) around which magical items’ success or failure acts as a sort of crumple zone. It’s easy for the magic effect to have a hiccup, so that’s how the narrative gives an advantage to the more important character. When there’s no magic item involved, the narrative manipulation may have to become more extreme or visible.

    I liked the insight. I'm getting a real Vetinari vibe from Malicia but without the near-godlike powers he gets from the even more story-driven realm of the Discworld. I haven't come across any character that even holds a candle to the Patrician and I'm glad that Malicia does. True mastermind characters -mildy believable ones at least - are rare.
    ```

    - u/AntiChri5:
      ```
      No way, Vetinari would have been able to keep Cat well and truly on side without pushing her too far.

      Malicia has made countless blunders. What we are seeing here is a mastermind falling.
      ```

- u/Agnoman:
  ```
  So Black's alive! Probably. I thought an offscreen death would have been a little ignoble an ending, even if I was willing to take it. Pilgrim must have an angle here for keeping him alive, risky though that might be. If Amadeus really *is* nameless, then that might have played into the decision.

  >Callow might be somewhat stable, but it was one bad winter away from effective collapse. If Alaya ordered most royal granaries torched, starvation would afflict half the realm after the snows came

  So Malicia could effectively end Callow at her whim. I can't imagine Malicia's agents can be rooted out at this point, if Thief's and Black's people can't avoid Malicia knowing most everything there is to know that's going on in the kingdom.

  And hopefully Cat has a plan for all the hungry mouths she's about to add to these already strained granaries.

  >"Lord Black’s legions are in full retreat through lands they’ve already pillaged. The Dominion’s armies are in pursuit.”

  I'm not too sure what they're doing here. There's no good exit behind them, the mountain path was closed back when they fought the crusade and Ranker noted that the only paths of retreat were months of marching away. Is there a plan here?

  >“Get in touch with our envoy in Laure. The full terms of my pact with Keter are to be revealed.”

  Well, this should be fascinating. Say what you want about Malicia, but she's very good at playing the game of nations.

  >How could she tell this familiar stranger that they had been one for so long some days she could hardly tell where she began and he ended? Maybe debt could have been the sum of them, if after the civil war he had treated her a figurehead – as was well within his power. If he’d proved himself yet another cage, this one gentler than the last but no less a prison for it. But he’d understood, that it was not comfort or a furious avenger she craved. Kindness, consolation, all the sweets words their tongue could offer. Those things she could have measured and paid back in full. But instead she’d been offered something priceless:  a world of endless paths, and someone to walk them with her.

  Black and Malicia's relationship is great to see - I only wish we saw more of it.

  But this:

  >She was not Catherine Foundling, to carve out pieces of her own soul at a whim.

  is quite the burn.

  >The Everdark was a mess of primitive warring tribes, effectively impossible to mobilize quickly and highly unpalatable allies regardless

  It's quite interesting that Malicia, who is one of the most well informed people on the continent, seems to knows nothing about what's really going on with the Drow and the Night. More evidence that powerful Mighty have not, for some reason, ever left the Everdark and made the sort of impact you'd expect people with that kind of power to make.

  Malicia also immediately dismisses the Drow as possible allies and such a ludicrous idea she doesn't even entertain the possibility. It makes me wonder, again, why both Cat and Juniper leapt to the Drow as the obvious choice when all they believed was that the Drow were treacherous and unreliable savages.

  But I quite like Malicia, and this chapter was a good look at some of the things she knows, and some of the things she doesn't.
  ```

  - u/TaltosDreamer:
    ```
    I feel like it was less an obvious choice to try the Drow, and more that all other options were taken away. At least as far as Cat knows. 

    Malicia just made a mistake of knowledge. She knows Cat has more options and that some alliances might still be possible. She assumed Cat knows this as well and therefore overlooked the 2nd to last choice.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      It was an obvious enough choice, from the perspectives of Cat and Juniper specifically, that they both jumped onto it without hesitation or pause for thinking through it. (Or at least Juniper specifically did - we didn't see Cat's initial line of reasoning.)

      Other options outside of the Drow do/did exist. Malicia talks about one she finds more compelling here, and it's important to note that she considers the fae to be fucking crazy even as she dismisses the drow as compleltly unviable. Being worse than a terrible option does not make for a ringing endorsement.

      Cat and Akua also had a talk about alternatives a while back (although that one was after finding out about the Drow, which solves some problems and creates a whole bunch more - but more to the point all the alternatives raised here where viable *before* Cat set of to the Everdark).

      The Drow were a complete gamble when all Cat knew about them was four pages from one book, and that didn't even paint a very positive picture. Most of Cat's knowledge could be summed up as the drow being the ruins of a former empire, having no centralised government with which to treat, being infamously violent and treachourous and being far behind the curve technologically.

      Juniper herself said of the drow "we’d need of a functional army for that to have any degree of success. Nothing we’ve heard leads me to believe they have one".

      This is what she ran off to see, when running off left Callow more vulnerable in that moment, as Malicia herself pointed out.
      ```

  - u/haiku_fornification:
    ```
    Burning Callow's granaries would effectively be suicide on Malicia's part. The Empire has been dependent on their grain for over twenty years and if Callow was starving it's likely the Empire would follow. 

    I think fae are considered to be the primary choice because that's what Cat would do before Second Liesse. She had a tendency to double down on long shots because she's always pulled through in the end and I could see her believing she would weasel out of any oaths she made to get their support. 

    Since then she's become more aware of her fallibility and is less prone to extreme risk taking. That's why the drow are the only option - worst case scenario she's wasted a couple of months for ten thousand weak bandits. If she went with the fae, worst case scenario is they take over Calernia. In essence, Malicia still believes Cat is reckless and arrogant enough that such gamble would be taken, when it's no longer the case.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      >The Empire has been dependent on their grain for over twenty years and if Callow was starving it's likely the Empire would follow.

      I question how much grain Callow is sending towards Praes at this point. Both because they're already running low and, you know, that whole enemies thing they have going on.

      >is less prone to extreme risk taking. That's why the drow are the only option - worst case scenario she's wasted a couple of months for ten thousand weak bandits.

      I'm not sure this line of reasoning holds up - Cat realised the Drow weren't a bunch of weak bandits, and are in fact extraordinarily dangerous, fairly quickly and then doubled down on the Drow as an option.
      ```

      - u/Chesheire:
        ```
        >I question how much grain Callow is sending towards Praes at this point. Both because they're already running low and, you know, that whole enemies thing they have going on.

        Isn't Callow's main export grain? If that's true, that no matter what Praes can and will receive grain - through proxy merchants, second-hand purchases through the wasteland, or etc, but if Callow is both exporting (period) and the leading exporter of grain as I'm lead to believe, then Praes can probably get their hands on some form or amount of despite the currently strained relationships.

        It's how a lot of countries work through embargoes today, after all. Real-life precedent in this.
        ```

        - u/Agnoman:
          ```
          >Isn't Callow's main export grain?

          It is when they aren't already at a point where they're struggling to feed themselves.
          ```

          - u/Chesheire:
            ```
            So following this down the line, is this why Callow is having monetary economic problems?

            Ultimately, I'm questioning how much grain is currently in circulation throughout the lands - as was mentioned in previous books, Callow is **THE** breadbasket. The most fertile lands with the greatest output. If that's the case, than how would burning that down not cause trickle down effects to the surrounding areas? If Callow is not providing grains, then who is? And how much can the provide to offset the loss that is the greatest exporter?
            ```

            - u/Agnoman:
              ```
              >is this why Callow is having monetary economic problems?

              I expect it's a huge part of it. The destruction of much of their farmland to the south (from Summer and Akua) is not something that's great for GDP, nor is losing large chunks of the population needed for tilling the remaining land.

              Add onto that the cost of outfitting armies for all the battles, the loss of most of the government, and the destruction of Liesse, amongst other things, and it's not a great situation.

              >than how would burning that down not cause trickle down effects to the surrounding areas? 

              Malicia wasn't considering burning down fields, she was looking at burning down the *granaries*.

              >If Callow is not providing grains, then who is?

              This is a good question. I wouldn't be surprised if Pres is running into food problems as well.
              ```

      - u/haiku_fornification:
        ```
        War is an expensive enterprise and Callow doesn't have any other trade partners that would purchase grain. Regardless, even if they don't trade with Praes it would be counterproductive for the long term interests of the Empire. If Callow is starving, it means it doesn't produce surplus of grain, which means eventually the Empire will starve too. It would be a very short sighted move.

        What you've said about the drow is certainly true, however it's still a more conservative option. The risk of using fae lies in giving them a foothold in Creation, potentially dooming both Callow and Calernia as a whole. The risk of obtaining drow forces lies mostly in getting herself killed or just wasting her time (in the case where they turn out to be weak). Add in the fact Cat is very difficult to kill and I think she did chose the less extreme gamble.
        ```

        - u/Agnoman:
          ```
          >Callow doesn't have any other trade partners that would purchase grain.

          They also don't have *grain*, period, so...

          In terms of it being a short sighted move, I also just want to note that Praes is not required to destroy all of Callow's food forever to break the country. Destroy this year's supply, watch riots, famines and diseases do their thing, and then let a weakened Callow move back towards building up that surplus. Praes isn't going to be getting good from Callow this year either way, so they can afford to play the long game. (Although obviously there are other considerations in play here).

          >The risk of obtaining drow forces lies mostly in getting herself killed or just wasting her time (in the case where they turn out to be weak)

          I'm talking about the case where they turned out to be scary-strong and with cultural and magical incentives towards being really, really bad neighbours who would like nothing more than murdering everyone in Callow if given the option, and Cat just led all aboard that train with a bunch of magical oaths (that definitely aren't a big obvious target for any story) and is maybe going to put Larat in charge.

          Personally I think that indicates a certain level of risk tolerance.

    ```
    The difference is the ranking of the other choices. It's not that they're particularly wrong about the drow, it's that they're wrong about summer: first, summer and winter are irreconcilable. Second, the wild hunt rides; summer is gone and cat already has the hunt. 

    It's not that cat sees the drow as the better option, she sees them as the only option, and other players think there's others left.
    ```

- u/night1172:
  ```
  Is it wrong that I kinda hope Black is dead now? A Praes that decides to go all out would be terrifying. They've always wanted to conquer the continent (or just Callow) but if Blacks dead then Malicia has absolutely no reason to keep anyone in Procer alive

- u/AntiChri5:
  ```
  Fucking Malicia. Even as her Empire teeters on the brink while faced with an enemy crusade and it's greatest champion is captured she is plotting how best to attack a former ally she pushed into being an enemy. And contemplates how far she can push her most powerful remaining ally without turning him hostile.

  Sounds like someone stopped keeping her Name in line a while back. Just another Dread Empress, barreling towards the usual end.

  EDIT:
  > We need a new guarantee that she won’t gate in and burn a few miles of farmland to the ground every time she’s provoked.

  I have a fun idea, you could just not fucking provoke her.

  - u/Agnoman:
    ```
    > Even as her Empire teeters on the brink while faced with an enemy crusade and it's greatest champion is captured she is plotting how best to attack a former ally

    I figure Malicia is doing this precisely *because* her empire is on the brink. She wants to secure her borders and consolidate her power.

    >contemplates how far she can push her most powerful remaining ally without turning him hostile.

    Personally I thought the point of that segment was to show that Malicia's bond with Black is so deep and important that she refuses to risk  losing him, even for the sake of a fairly major strategic advantage. She has to be pushed into looking at the situation coldy, and then outright refuses what the logic of the situation is telling her.

    >I have a fun idea, you could just not fucking provoke her.

    That ship sailed with Liesse. Which itself was probably a bad idea and unnecessary to boot, but is now a thing that happened and it has to be lived with.
    ```

    - u/AntiChri5:
      ```
      > I figure Malicia is doing this precisely because her empire is on the brink. She wants to secure her borders and consolidate her power.

      And creating enemies is a terrible way to go about that.

      > Personally I thought the point of that segment was to show that Malicia's bond with Black is so deep and important that she refuses to risk losing him, even for the sake of a fairly major strategic advantage.

      As others have pointed out, that part was about her musings on how much she would be able to target Masego before she antagonized Warlock. As it stands Warlock is her biggest remaining ally and she is sitting there wondering if she was just *subtle enough* could she get away with arranging his sons death? Praes in a goddamn nutshell. The ship is sinking and she is sharpening her knife to stick into the back of the guy bailing water.

      > That ship sailed with Liesse. Which itself was probably a bad idea and unnecessary to boot, but is now a thing that happened and it has to be lived with.

      Liesse was a terrible idea that never would have worked. It guaranteed Cat would turn on her, but it guaranteed that that would happen *one day*. It wasn't an immediate threat. As far as Cat was concerned Malicia was on the back burner, a problem for another day. Then Malicia just keeps pushing and pushing and pushing, throwing plot after plot at Cat until Cat *has* to prioritize her.

      When she murdered half of the people running Callow Malicia turned herself from something to deal with in five or ten years to Callow's biggest threat, to be deal with as soon as possible.

      Every step of the way she has unnecessarily antagonized the person picked out by her partner as the key to solving Paes' biggest long term problem.
      ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      > Personally I thought the point of that segment was to show that Malicia's bond with Black 

      I think AntiChri5 was referring to Malicia considering murdering Masego.
      ```

      - u/Agnoman:
        ```
        Murdering Masgeo? She considers "arranging a failure to protect Hierophant from vengeful nobles" and then having him "imprisoned for a few years rather than involved in a brutal knife-fight between the Woe and the Empire where death was a real possibility".

        But you're probably right that this is what AntiChri5 was referring to - I just got distracted by the Malicia-Black relationship, which I kind of love.

        I still don't think her musings on Masego are that bad though? He's on the opposite side of a serious conflict now, and that's going to have to be dealt with. It's going to suck for everyone involved, yeah, but that's not a good reason for just ignoring be the issue.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          Yeah, but he's here at his father's request, to defend the Empire against a common enemy. I think there's a degree of "never attack or lock up people you promised guest rights to" at work here.

          Also, I think the "arranging a failure to protect" plan would end up with Masego dead, which is why she'd rather just throw him in a dungeon.
          ```

          - u/Agnoman:
            ```
            >Yeah, but he's here at his father's request, to defend the Empire against a common enemy. I think there's a degree of "never attack or lock up you promised guest rights to" at work here.

            At a certain point it's also on Masego for walking I to the lion's den - Prasei don't really do guest rights so much as they serve guests poisoned wine, and the invitation he received didn't point towards there being any immunity. Masego himself acknowledged that his main protection against being locked up is his incredible power and his father's unwilling to use his own full might against him.

            And if the alternative is having him killed in  a conflict .. locking him up probably has better outcomes for all relevant parties here.

            Plus, they're Evil.

            >Also, I think the "arranging a failure to protect" plan would end up with Masego dead, 

            Don't mind me, I just failed a basic literacy roll there. Cheers for pointing that out.

            I still get why she considers it though: she has a country to run, Hierophant's one of the main  threats to that country, and Malicia is a stone cold killer, who was happy for Liesse to be destroy led for questionable benefits. This is sort of what OG Practical Evil is about.

    Well fuck you too, Malicia! Maybe Catherine would self-mutilate less often if you didn't keep throwing her into meat-grinders, while tearing down anything she tries to build at the same time.
    ```

  - u/Mountebank:
    ```
    Malicia's, and Praes by extension, weakness in general is that they don't understand using goodwill to win loyalty and alliances. She could have treated Cat well and gotten her allegiance, but instead she needs to have leverage to hold over Cat to keep her in control. Her relationship with Black is the exception, as seen at the end of this chapter, and even then she has plans in place to stop him and actively chose not to use them, knowing that it was probably a mistake to do so.
