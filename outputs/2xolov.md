    > Jesus Christ, is our cult contrary.

    You mean, "is our phyg pbagenel."

  - u/BadGoyWithAGun:
    ```
    Also appropriate for baby showers!
    ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    I thought it was appropriate. As well as the ceremony being held in a planetarium.
    ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    To be fair, this was meant as the lead-in for a pair of shinier, happier speeches.
    ```
