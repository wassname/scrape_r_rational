  Hmm. The opening was strong, but I think it really fell apart when /u/Aquareon chickened out of the "vaccination" and decided to just make it Xianity.

  Still, memetic "zombies" that retain their intelligence, oh my. A really great concept.

  [Why would the ](#s "inoculation tech start handing out shotguns and gas cans if she was a zombie too?  For that matter why did she do the presentation at all instead of just grabbing people as they came in? And even if they were going to do it this way, why not have more zombies mixed in with the crowd? I thought the zombies kept their intelligence?")
