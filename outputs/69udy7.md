  ```
  I kind of wish the near-mutiny after the hydra fight had actually been written out instead of summarized. I would have liked to see the actual dialogue of the grieving man confronting Zorian and blaming him for the death of his friend, and I would have liked to see Zorian's response in the moment.
  ```

  - u/notgreat:
    ```
    Either that or removed. It's in an awkward spot of taking up enough words to seem important but glossing over all the details.
    ```

  - u/Tringard:
    ```
    I expected the hydra fight and resolution to take the bulk of the chapter with only a hint of what was to come next in the remainder. I was surprised by how much he tried to cover here. The whole privacy ward  discussion as a quick solution to the mutiny is surely another setup, but I struggle to imagine why we'll return to those jungles until some future iteration where this mutiny won't matter.
    ```

    - u/UNWS:
      ```
      I dont know, I feel it is not that important. Why would Zorian interact with Damian again? And even if he does there will be no killing of teammates and probably the team wont even know about Zorian. I believe this to be a dead end.
      ```

      - u/valeskas:
        ```
        > Why would Zorian interact with Damian again?

        Daimen, self identifying as famous treasure hunter, would probably want to participate in searching for imperial ring and staff.
        ```

        - u/UNWS:
          ```
          But he doesnt have enough info on the rest to warrant them taking him and his team. (it would take a lot of convincing plus at least getting the orb again which would take a lot of time). So even if they decide to ask for his help it would probably be brief and only for his current research/tips rather than he and his team  for help recovering the actual artifact.
          ```

          - u/valeskas:
            ```
            > But he doesnt have enough info on the rest to warrant them taking him and his team.

            He has experience, *can* be convinced, and is capable of narrowing down the location by himself, saving Z&Z time.

            > So even if they decide to ask for his help 

            I expect that Daimen would ask to be included, not Z&Z ask for his help.
            ```

            - u/UNWS:
              ```
              Ok I concede, maybe they would get him. To your point, while it took them almost the entire restart this time to get the orb, the next time should be much easier since they know where it is, the protections around it and get reinforcements for the hydra. Maybe even start the encounter with the final trap in place. 

              The reason why I was opposed to them getting Damien was that he wouldn't leave without the orb and it is a waste of time to try and get the orb if it takes the entire month to do so. But if it takes less than half the month it might help having his experience. That being said, having him on wastes as much as half a restart (lots of foreplay with convincing him, his future in-laws, his team, then hiring reinforcements, then getting the actual orb), so his experience at least better reduce their search time by more than half, if he is going to be useful.
              ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                Or, they could teleport into the cenote (they've now been there, and there are no wards or Daimen's team would have detected them), and show up at the Taramatula estate carrying the orb. Should save some time.
                ```

                - u/spanj:
                  ```
                  The only thing that I would be worried about is if you teleport right next to the orb, the sudden appearance of a hydra wouldn't be very nice...

                  Assuming this is viable, what's the benefit of having Daimen know you have the orb?
                  ```

                  - u/thrawnca:
                    ```
                    The hydra didn't leave the pocket dimension until summoned. If they're quick or stealthy, they should be able to collapse the portal and box it up.

                    If they want Daimen's help seeking the other Key pieces - and they're imperial artifacts, so he ought to be useful - then turning up with the orb should help their credibility and save time convincing him to switch missions.
                    ```

  - u/MistahTimn:
    ```
    I agree. This whole chapter overall just seemed a bit too short for the amount of plot important information it covered without actually smoothly dealing with everything.
    ```

  - u/SnowGN:
    ```
    Yeah...

    This chapter almost felt like a tl;dr of the actual chapter, in places. I'm not very happy with how the story is being written lately. Zodiac feels way too disconnected. He has no emotional investment in anything. Which is making it hard for me to care, as a reader.
    ```

- u/GeeJo:
  ```
  Ah, the classic D&D Wightpocalypse.

  Back then you did it by virtue of the "Locate City" spell.   
  You see, most *dangerous* spells strictly limit the number and range of targets, for obvious balance reasons. You Magic Missile a specified number of people, you Grease a small area in front of you. And so on.

  Locate City is a harmless Level 1 spell available to most spellcasting classes; its innocuous purpose is spelt out in its name - it locates a city. That's all it does. But its purpose perforce means that it *targets an entire city*. This presents a loophole in the limited targetting rules that can be exploited using two otherwise unrelated rules: 

  1. Dungeons and Dragons includes "metamagic" skills. Rather than learning *new* spells, you can increase your general spellcasting ability such that the spells you've already learned are empowered. These skills might let you increase your spells' duration, or their strength...or add additional effects.  

  2. Certain evil-flavoured effects reduce character levels rather than cause physical damage. When a character's level is reduced to zero by an an outside effect, they die, and they are reanimated as a type of undead called a "wight". Wights are intelligent, evil, and can drain living beings by touch, turning them into more wights. Wights are nasty low-level threats, but necromancy is limited in range and targets, as mentioned above, so you tend to only encounter one or two at a time.

  The so-called "Locate City Bomb" uses metamagic skills to add a level-draining effect to the otherwise harmless but immensely wide-target Locate City spell. This causes every commoner within the targetted city to lose levels, with no "saving throw" to prevent it. As a result, **thousands** of wights are spawned, all of which immediately leave the city and begin turning every living being in the surrounding countryside into more wights, which spread out further and...you get the idea. 

  The starting population of several thousand wights increases exponentially. It soon becomes a continent-spanning existential crisis that even epic-level parties struggle to bring under control without divine or GM intervention. All from an innocuous Level 1 spell that any beginner spellcaster can learn, a few mostly-useless metamagic skills, and a basic life-drain effect that several races get as a *free bonus*.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Ah, so that's what u/melmonella was referring to.

    My Google-fu only turned up the version where you physically hurl the victims out of the blast radius if they fail a reflex save (dealing hundreds of thousands of HP damage in the process).
    ```

  Alanic confirmed as a really useful person to have around. Not only for asking useful questions, but also for quickly taking down Sudomir. Interesting that both spells he used required touch.

      Good point... Probably VERY hard to touch someone in normal magical combat though.

      The author said that Hsan practises mystical kung fu (shaping exercises taken to the extreme), so probably.
      ```

- u/waylandertheslayer:
  ```
  So Sudomir's building the equivalent of a nuke. I wonder what the odds are that Zorian ends up using it himself? On the one hand, it would definitely be a culmination of his knowledge of necromancy. On the other hand, I think (character-wise) it's completely out of the question.

  The one thing that does worry me about all this dangerous knowledge that Zorian's effectively gathering is that his duplicates have been slowly becoming more and more independent, and that seems like it could be leading up to one of them going rogue.
  ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    Overall though, even if they're becoming more independent, they still all seem to have the best interests of the main Zorian in mind, and are all working towards the same goal. The most I see one of them doing is foregoing morals and doing something brutal that the main one wouldn't have been willing to do, but that would still help him. 

    Good point that the wraith bombs might be related to a future plot with them. There's also still the mind magic.
    ```

    - u/waylandertheslayer:
      ```
      > The most I see one of them doing is foregoing morals and doing something brutal that the main one wouldn't have been willing to do, but that would still help him.

      This is more what I mean by 'going rogue' - Zorian's very dangerous if he's not constrained by his morals. If one of his duplicates decides that nuking a city will make it easier for him to (for example) steal an item from the royal treasury, it just might go ahead and do it.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Well, the specific example given wouldn't work, because filling Eldemar with soul-devouring wraiths would be the opposite of making things easier. Especially for a Controller with a broken marker, who is probably vulnerable to soul damage without triggering an automatic reset...
        ```

        - u/waylandertheslayer:
          ```
          I was thinking more hitting a *different* city, to draw resources (like guards or special countermeasures) away from the target.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Ah.

            That makes *slightly* more sense, but sounds very inefficient and unreliable. What if it results in the capital assuming the country is under assault and beefing up security? And there's no point in drawing away any "special countermeasures" for wraiths, because priests were not the obstacle to robbing the treasury in the first place.

            Plus the moral implications, because souls are indestructible, so this will have eternal implications despite the time loop.
            ```

      - u/Iconochasm:
        ```
        The duplicates can only diverge by a month at most.  That's not too much room for serious values realignment.
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    It's not quite a nuke, more like grey goo...
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  Wait, wraiths can consume souls? I thought souls were indestructible?

  I guess it would still be possible to twist and reshape a soul into a tool, as necromancers do...so it wouldn't be "consumption" in the sense of using it *up*, just using it.

  And aww, missed opportunity for Zach to fight the troll/dragon...

  ETA At least Zach will get the satisfaction of fighting the hydra without Daimen's team next time. Of course, that *might* actually make it easier for him; no need to protect anyone except Zorian.

  Plus, in theory stealth might now be possible. If they can sneak past the chameleon drakes, then Zorian can un-deploy the orb and seal the hydra inside. Because why stop at a portable palace when you can also carry a Pokemon?
  ```

  - u/Overmind_Slab:
    ```
    I thought that wraith mechanic had already been introduced but then I realized that that's just how wraiths worked in Pact.

      I recognized it from Dungeons and Dragons. Though in that case there's also wights, shadows and spectres.

- u/SageOfStupidity:
  ```
  Didn't we already hear some other reason Sudomir wanted the souls? Something to do with his wife? I guess I'm just misremembering. 

  Also, can someone remind me what his political gain was for supporting the summer festival attack? It's gotten fuzzy.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    It's in [chapter 52](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/52/Mother-of-Learning).

    Collecting the souls and invading Cyoria was all part of making him politically powerful (ie indispensable), so that he could make necromancy legal and turn his wife into a lich. Plus it was payment to Quatach-Ichl for helping him with the wife-becoming-lich part.
    ```

    - u/SageOfStupidity:
      ```
      Ahh, that's it. Thanks!
      ```

- u/melmonella:
  ```
  Whoop whoop, first key! And sudomir's plan is basically Locate City Bomb, isn't it? Turning dnd shenanigans into plot points:priceless. Only at nobody103.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Hmm...I don't see how the two are similar except that they both kill lots of people. Locate City Bomb is about adding extra energy/damage types to a wide-area divination, causing everything (or at least every creature) in the targeted area to be flung away and killed. Whereas the wraith bombs are about releasing self-replicating destroyers, leading to necromancy's version of a grey goo scenario.
    ```

    - u/TwoxMachina:
      ```
      There's the negative level version of Locate City Bomb. That could enact the wight-o-pocalypse too.
      ```

- u/vallar57:
  ```
  Pokeball: GET.

  A really fun chapter, with some very good action and interesting plot.

  I think Sudomir's transformation is madness-*induced*. I mean that he has to get himself into that mad state to trigger a pre-casted transformation. Though it could be just a side effect, but I like the idea of an emotion-based trigger.

  Or the room won't start up. Worth a try anyways.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    It probably *would* start up, but I'm not grasping your plan here. What's the extra benefit; just having more space and more to do? Assuming that the time dilation still applies, yes, that could be somewhat helpful.
    ```

    - u/evil_shmuel:
      ```
      things can live in that orb. can they live there when it is in orb mode? 

      If so, you can put a whole castle full of people inside the black room, and have them all train.
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        The hydra definitely lived in that pocket dimension. I don't see why people couldn't. The only problem would be the deterioration of the castle. But oh well, even if the castle is uninhabitable, money could buy them some cozy tents. The main value is the extra space.
        ```

        - u/evil_shmuel:
          ```
          the hydra lived there when it was deployed. not as orb.
          ```

          - u/Xtraordinaire:
            ```
            Well, yes? The idea is to deploy the orb from inside the room.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              Besides, if the hydra was deliberately created as a magical guardian, as Zorian suspected, then it probably did live in the orb all the time.
              ```

      - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
        ```
        >If so, you can put a whole castle full of people inside the black room

        Unless the difficulty of creating big time-dilation rooms is an intrinsic issue of space-time magic in general, not just 3D-spatial magic. In which case trying to bring the orb into the room in an effort to cheat the system will only show that the experimenter doesn’t understand the principles on which the spatial magic works in general.

        Would depend on a word of god though.
        ```

        - u/tokol:
          ```
          Remember that the entire narrative is already taking place inside a really big pocket dimension. I don't think we've seen any practical limit to stacking effects.

      With a castle sized accomodation, you basically negate the main limitation of black rooms.

  >“Don't look at me,” Zach protested. “It was Zorian's idea.”

  The lack of all the excuses that usually serve as idiot-ball nesting ground is very nice in this story.

  >The moment he had launched the rain of flesh-dissolving blades at the hydra, before he had even known whether it would hit its target or not, he was already casting another spell.

  -

  >The other had his arm pumped full of venom when the hydra's grazed it with its jaws. Daimen immediately cut off the limb in question and then directed one of the mages to teleport him and all the other wounded away from the battlefield.

  These scenes read like they’re out of [H×H.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HunterXHunter)

  >All that was left to do now was to wait for Quatach-Ichl to leave for Ulquaan Ibasa so they could make their move. There was some worry about that, as Quatach-Ichl didn't seem to be getting ready to leave. Xvim had raised the issue that they might have tipped Quatach-Ichl off somehow, and a fierce discussion sprung up about whether to go ahead with the assault anyway if that was the case. Thankfully, the question turned out to be irrelevant in the end – Quatach-Ichl still left on schedule, and the mission could proceed.

  So whatever makes the lich leave is something unexpected and very important. Does [conservation of detail ](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail) state in this case that Zach and Zorian will get involved with that something eventually? Maybe lich has an additional unresolved conflict\fight happening with some other group elsewhere?

  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    You're missing something important. The orb is a pocket dimension *controlled by a soul marker*. And the emperor who died there - who was not the original Gate user - was able to deploy it. How did he get a marker? What else could/did he do?
    ```

    - u/valeskas:
      ```
      It is *controlled by a soul marker*, not *controlled only by a soul marker*
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        OK, but even then, whatever else could theoretically control it is likely going to be an artifact on the same kind of level. And the emperor didn't have any other Key pieces on his person when he died, but he was able to deploy the orb. So it seems to me that he probably did have a marker, somehow. Perhaps the emperors were in the habit of using the Key to mark their heirs, in preparation for the next Gate activation (or out of tradition, without knowing what it was really for)?
        ```

        - u/-Fender-:
          ```
          Possible. Or else, the orb works like any other magic artifact and can be operated by mages normally by infusing mana in a specific way, but it simply has an additional function of also being affected by the marker as well. It probably has more than one failsafe to return it to its original shape once deployed, beside interaction with the marker, in case its owner dies before doing so.

          The fact that it's an imperial artifact responding to the marker neither confirms nor denies that Ikosian royalty all have a marker as a bloodline (which is especially doubtful), or are capable of transferring it.

          Damien had a spell that could find it, it's reasonable to assume there's a spell that could collapse it too.

        You're actually missing some of the info. It's controlled by a soul marker in the time loop. Most things act normally in the timeloop, but the keys do not necessarily (they absolutely don't in at least one way - they don't allow people to escape the timeloop when they're not in it). Whoever made the keys might've keyed them into the maker only during the loop.

      So, how about an old theory that Zach is the descendant of the first emperor and the marker is hereditary?
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Nah, I reckon not. The Guardian told them about the ways the marker could be placed, and it didn't mention inheritance. Plus it would mess up the whole "there can only be one Controller" thing.

        Zach might well be a descendant. But I think the marker was placed directly on him, not his ancestors.
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          Not genetically inherited. Rather the gate is active (in low power mode) at all times in the real world. As soon as the marker bearer dies (that would be one of Zach's parents) it chooses a new one (Zach)
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            > As soon as the marker bearer dies...it chooses a new one

            Again - the Guardian listed the ways to obtain a marker, and that wasn't one. And the Guardian isn't in the habit of silently concealing information; either it tells them what they ask for, or it tells them that they're not allowed to know.
            ```

      Maybe it can be turned into the pocket dimension without a marker, but only reverted with one?
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        That wouldn't really make sense; are we going to assume that the emperor never used it until the day he died?
        ```

    - u/theplqa:
      ```
      I think all the keys are controlled by a soul marker while in the time loop. The marker probably allows its users to get the keys no matter what. In this case it can force the orb out of its activated state so loopers can actually retrieve it. The gate is designed very well and it wouldn't make sense for the keys to be unobtainable. The actual control for them in the real world is probably something else.

  Well that hydra fight went relatively easier than what I expected, wonder what Daimen used to hush that Alachi guy. Zach was the MVP again and interesting info about the orb, expecting another cool fight in the next chapter.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Daimen probably took the opportunity to inform him that Zorian is, in his own way, just as dangerous as Zach. And remind him that they still need Zorian's help in finding the orb. And point out that Alachi was lashing out emotionally instead of logically; Zorian's actions were reasonable and helpful, the presence of the hydra wasn't his fault, he saved some of their lives during the fight, and Alachi is just understandably upset about the loss of his friend.
    ```

      ```
      What? No man, that's no fun. He must have threatened him with something . Maybe regarding a crime he committed and the police coming or called in a favour.

        I would have gone with 'Zorian is such an OP mind mage that, were he manipulating us with mind magic, we wouldn't even be discussing this.
        ```

        - u/UNWS:
          ```
          That doesnt really work. Its kinda circular reasoning. Any argument against or for mind magic cannot be based upon current mental state.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            > Any argument against or for mind magic cannot be based upon current mental state.

            I'm not sure I'd go that far; so long as you ignore the whole "everything I do and think is perfectly controlled by the mentalist" possibility (because you would be helpless in that case, so it's pointless to consider), then you can still reason about the presence or absence of mental tampering based on your current thoughts.
            ```

- u/throwawayIWGWPC:
  ```
  I'm curious how Zorian would be able to kill the hydra on his own given enough time, training, and attempts.

  My guess is a group of specialized golems plus some mind control. Maybe he could learn that slicing spell Zach used in combination with an anti-teleportation field.

  I'm also curious what abilities or insights could be gained by making potions out of the corpse. I hope these questions get explored later!
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    On his own, why would Zorian kill it? His skill set would be better suited to evading the chameleon drakes and collapsing the orb with the hydra still inside.
    ```
