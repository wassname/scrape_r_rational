## I have created a chat room for us

### Post:

Hi! I have created a chat room for us. 

We can use it to bounce ideas off each other and discuss stuff that would be too small or too off topic to create a thread on this subreddit, but is still interesting to talk about with our community. 

I think it will be more convenient than weekly off topic threads, and could also open an interesting conversation that wouldn't otherwise take place on reddit.

It will be pretty fun and awesome, so I suggest you guys join it =)

Go [here](https://raymestalez.typeform.com/to/TIiWEA) to receive an invite.

    Yes, it's pretty much IRC, but more convenient.

    Thanks, I also hope it takes off =)

  Don't we already use #HPMOR or #lesswrong for this sort of thing? why not another channel on foonetic? with maybe a webirc link pointed there for people who aren't already lounging on IRC?

  Yeah no, it's way more annoying than just using IRC

  I like the idea and the thought, so I voted this up, but Slack is such a pain to use compared to IRC that I will not be joining in.
