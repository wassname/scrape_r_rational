    Yes, that's why I said it takes a few updates to get good. The first meeting honestly feels a bit out of place compared to the rest of the fic.

    For what it's worth, the author does a good job of interrupting the progress that he makes by keeping him out of the lab for most of the narrative. This keeps him much more balanced. Also shard fuckery is part of the setting so I'd bet that the drive to conflict is calibrated even more closely with him (not spoiling past the 3rd threadmark, just speculating)

        you are correct; that is a vestigial line. i originally had written:

        >this keeps him much more balanced than the CYOA "inspired inventor" that his power is based on.

        sorry about the confusion

  H+ Mayhem focuses on a transhumanist tinker whose ultimate goal is to kill Jack Slash. His speciality is human augmentation with a side of mental alteration. The fight scenes are good, the world makes sense, and he doesn't waste time angsting, but that is not why I am linking it here. I am linking it here because it has some of the finest characterisation I've seen in a worm fic in a long, long time. It is subtle, it is understated, and it blows me away. 

  It takes a few updates to get into the swing of things, so don't stop after reading just the first one.

    Well, you've convinced me.

    I've really enjoyed this. It feels like his abilities could become over powered very easily but right now he has certainly suffered enough setbacks to keep things interesting.  
    This feels very original flavour, for the most part it's a grim world full of hard choices and consequence but there's definitely enough notes of humour to keep things from straying into the depressing.

  Yes, this is good. If you like this, I also recommend Agent of Cauldron.
