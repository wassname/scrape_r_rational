  All according to plan.  After all, everything will go well, and Ana didn't have a plan to actually *extract* Aaron from UNSONG, just to get to him.

  Ana's (first half of a) rescue is necessary so that the Vanishing Name teleports him from/to "imminent rescue" instead of from/to "imprisonment" or "interrogation".

    That seems like exactly the amount of crazy which is normal for this universe.

    Vanishing Name is so broken if you can get the variables correct.

    He was in a building filled with enemies, with one undetected friend. He will go to the same situation.

    Erica is undetected, and on a train filled with UNSONG enriched folks.

  What the *fuck* is the equivalent situation to *this*?
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Plot twist: Somebody else discovered the Vital Name at the exact same time and is *also* undergoing interrogation at this time. 

    Of course, that person used the Vanishing Name too, so they'll just switch seats.

    Mafia interrogation?
    ```

      I think the official comments section suggested BOOJUM, which seems as likely as anything else to me.

    One undetected friend in a building filled with enemies. Erica is on a train filled with enemies, and literally passing through a suburb of Hell as well.

  Does anyone else have problems reading this with a TTS engine? I kind of liked the first few chapters but feel like it would be really hard for someone just like, one step more blind than me to be able to understand it. Not sure there is anything you can/should do about it I just wanted to bring it to your attention.

    What is a TTS engine?

      ```
      Guessing from context it's text to speech
      ```

        Anything I can do to make it easier?

      It's our universe's version of Llull.

      Text to speech, it is what people with poor/no vision use to read.

    I'm blind and read it just fine with Eloquence, but no one gives out Eloquence licenses legally anymore. I haven't tried it on my phone.

  Idea for a nigh-unbreakable klipah:  first, get a large set of words that start with each letter of the alphabet (or just random words, really).  Next, use the "A" word to represent the first syllable of the Name,  the "B" for the second, and so on.  A sample Name would look something like this:

      APPLE BANANA CANTALOUPE DRAGONFRUIT ELDERBERRY APPLE ELDERBERRY CANTALOUPE 

  Use a *different* set of words for each Name, so another one could look like:

      ATOM BARYON COULOMB DECAY ELECTRON FIELD BARYON GRAVITY HADRON

  If you want to be trickier, then throw non-klipah words in the middle of the pgrase as well, but make sure that *all* of the licenced users use the *same* filler words.

  Anyone who knows cryptography want to poke holes in this?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    That's kinda like a [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad). In theory unbreakable, but not actually much of an encryption because you would need a new key for each message, and if you're gonna distribute a specialized key you might as well distribute the message itself.

    One of the requirements listed is "that the signal be separated from the noise; that the parts which represent letters are fixed in advance and not separated by other parts representing other letters."

    So maybe there isn't much signal in that klipah? Your system is much closer to a random scrambling than an encryption.
