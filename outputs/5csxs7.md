  This chapter reinforced my initial doubts about Veyers the Red Robe. If he is *that* unstable, and his focus is just fire magic, he is really not fit for a time loop passenger role. (Counter evidence: RR's fit of rage in soul kill restart?) 

  Speaking of fire magic, Alanic Boranova, anyone? What? Too crazy?

  Back to Veyers!RR. Another issue is the theory that Zach sought out Veyers and Veyers took over. It does not add up, Veyers went missing *before* time loop started. If Zach tried to contact him in the loop (very improbable on itself, but whatever), he'd failed to contact the boy. The only reasonable solution to this conundrum is that it was Veyers who sought out Zach (why?) in the first restart, and became a passenger. This is... very weak, I think. Right now, I'm kinda out of ideas.

  And the situation about the red robe (physical object) implies that RR is a high ranking cultist.

  Another suspicious thing is that Veyers is also an orphan, and of course, the Weeping is to blame.

    Alanic Boranova idea isn't too crazy, but there is an easier explanation: we know that Alanic has a divine treasure that allows him to heal any burns, and we know that he is very stoic. So he probably underwent some lengthly high risk - high return training, probably burnng himself very badly in the process a few times, but healing just fine after that.
    ```

    - u/Nickoalas:
      ```
      I just had an entertaining/horrible thought.

      Would it have been possible to use Alanic's divine treasure as a treatment for the Weeping?

      It completely heals burns so long as the person is still alive. No fire based injury is beyond saving.

      What if we burn the everloving shit out of anyone who has the weeping and use the artifact to keep them alive until we've destroyed every last trace of it from their bodies?
      ```

      - u/vallar57:
        ```
        We don't know actual capability of that artifact, but it probably wouldn't work. Burns are the most obvious, but not the only damage fire does to human body: there is also smoke, and, more importantly, heat itself, raising body temperature as a whole to the point where brain and other organs would shut down far earlier than infection dies off. Also, if you are using the trasure to keep a human alive, you are probably likely to also keep it's microflora/fauna alive... which also includes the infection. So yeah, two points where it could go wrong.
        ```

        - u/Nickoalas:
          ```
          I don't see any way to remove the disease from the brain without instantly killing the person, and there could also be a soul component to the disease that would remain unaffected.

          There are many, many things wrong with this idea.

          Edit: I'm really interested in the weeping now. I have a sneaking suspicion about something and I'm going to look it up and see if it holds water.

          I've taken this way off topic. Sorry folks

      Oh, right, completely forgot about that one. Well, that was a fun yet short-lived theory :P

  - u/Cheese_Ninja:
    ```
    It's still pretty much impossible to find a good theory for RR.  If, as Zach and Zorian are currently assuming, he's a member of the Dragon Cultists inner circle, how the hell did he get a marker? Why would he remove all memory of Veyers from Zach? 

    Further questions of RR's identity aside, it was a fun chapter. 

    >"Well, in the case of that mage I memory probed, it mostly involves him being 21 and healthy again," Zorian said. "And having a bigger penis."

    It's a cliche, but that doesn't mean it's not true.

    Wonder how much time next chapter is going to be spent on the Black Room, and how much on the aftermath. I figure that Zach and Zorian are going to be kind of sick of each other once they get out.

    Alanic as a Boranova would be a fun twist. I don't think it's likely, especially since he doesn't have Veyers weird snake eyes, but who knows?
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Erasing memory of Veyers is a great way to create a distraction. Oh you find it suspicious that you had your mind trawled for memories of this specific person? Yes you do. Have fun wasting time and mind space on this dead end.

      Since red robed cultists are also high ranking officials, it's kind of trivial. Zach tried to persuade such people that the invasion is coming. And since they want to subjugate the primordial via mind magic, at least one of the red robes is a structured mind mage. 

      EDIT: I mean, let's rationalize a bit, what would this cultist local boss of mage Guild would do if Zach came to him and tried to persuade him that the city is going to be invaded soon. First he might ask the boy some questions confirming that Zach has top secret information. To Zach those questions seem perfectly normal. Then he tells the boy to return say next day to discuss this matter further. Then uses this time to prepare surprise attack. Executes said attack, uses mind probe, learns about time loop. Freaks out. Places a geas on Zach to return to him in the next restart. Erases memory of the current restart, kills Zach. Now he has a month to hijack the marker somehow.

      The question is how do you copy the marker.
      ```

      - u/Dwood15:
        ```
        > kills Zach

        Only issue with your theory- Zach dies the loop restarts.
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          Well, that's the point, since the geas stays.
          ```

      - u/Cheese_Ninja:
        ```
        Most of that looks pretty good. Bonus if these Cultists had kidnapped Veyers themselves in order to study his bloodline, or invited Veyers with promises of teaching him to control his innate magic. In that case, erasing Veyers from Zach's mind means not investigating Veyers, which makes it harder for Zach to stumble across them coincidentally. 

        We still have the problem of marker + how well Geas/mind magic work to bring Zach back to them in a later restart. Can a geas be applied unilaterally?  It seems like all the instances we've seen had the cooperation of the individuals with the geas. Could Veyers be used as a hostage against Zach, even though they hated each other?

      Not sure about the Veyers connection, but RR being a mind mage plus cultists would make sense for gaining the mark. Zach assaults some cultist cell before he was stupidly powerful, loses without dying, RR finds out about the loop through memory probing, and uses some soul magic to imprint the mark on his own soul.

      >Wonder how much time next chapter is going to be spent on the Black Room, and how much on the aftermath. I figure that Zach and Zorian are going to be kind of sick of each other once they get out.

      I hope the next chapter only contains a summary. I don't see anything interesting enough happening in the black room to warrant direct screen time.

          If they start fucking, yeah I expect some coverage of it, but I honestly don't expect it. The author mentioned he doesn't intend to have any romance in his story, as it tends to consume stories if the romance is intended to be done well, in addition to the time loop making romance difficult.
          ```

    - u/clawclawbite:
      ```
      If Veyers was secretly apprenticed to one of the RR cultists, he could know where the robe of his mentor is, and take over using his looped info, once he has that. That may also give him some access to unusual magics too.
      ```

  - u/vallar57:
    ```
    As for Veyers!RR thing, I think there is also a simple explanation. Back when Zach was the only time traveller, he probabaly still tried hard to counter invasion. He likely even saw some success, since the invasion plans were not keepeng up with him, and mistook it for his own skill. He then probably found a lead into the Cult, and tried to follow it, only to get captured, instead of getting killed, like usual. And probably found himself on the operating table of 15 capable necromancers, who clearly saw that something was wrong with the boy. They found the marker, and tried to copy it, and, that being very hard, only one of the copies actually worked.

    Now how's that for "too crazy"? XD
    ```

  - u/Nickoalas:
    ```
    The caretaker's testimony is on pre time loop Veyers being unstable.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Yes, and I meant that such unstable person can not hijack the marker if Zach the looper tells them about it in one of the restarts, because such a feat requires patience and subterfuge. Fire magic and explosive temper do not help.
      ```

      - u/Nickoalas:
        ```
        Fair enough. I thought you were saying RR's behavior didn't match with Veyers.

        You bring up some good points

        Edit: Maybe Veyers was the most expendable member. 
        If you're transplanting a complex marker with untested and risky soul magic, I would not be performing the ritual on myself.
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          If anything RR's violent outburst is evidence that RR *is* Veyers that grew to control his temper (somewhat).

          But I can't see young Veyers being the one who stole the marker. But maybe Veyers was chosen by someone more skilled as a recipient of the mark. Maybe the fact that Zach and Veyers have so much in common eased the transition. 

          I mean, they are of the same gender and age. Both lost parents to the Weeping. Both became heirs of Noble Houses as a result. Both have a bloodline. Both, presumably, have troubles mastering it. Both had troubles controlling their magic (remember, Zach was terrible at shaping because of his inhuman mana reserves). Kinda suspicious.

          Ah, but you're forgetting something. Soul damage to non-Controllers *doesn't matter*, because they all get reset with new copies from the template. So, if you learn about the time loop, and have no ethics worth mentioning, then you do indeed attempt the ritual on yourself, because the worst-case scenario is simply that it doesn't work.

          And you would be very hesitant to give someone unstable and dangerous the possibility of succeeding - especially when that person similarly has no significant ethics, and will be free to do anything to you inside the loop without consequences.

    > Back to Veyers!RR. Another issue is the theory that Zach sought out Veyers and Veyers took over. It does not add up, Veyers went missing before time loop started.

The only reasonable solution to this conundrum is that it was Veyers who sought out Zach (why?) in the first restart, and became a passenger. This is... very weak, I think. Right now, I'm kinda out of ideas.

    Zach has been absolutely desperate for company in the time loop. To the point that he literally tried to convince every student and teacher in the school, as well as most of the important officials in Cyoria. Only a couple people ever believed him.

    You're operating under the assumption he never had access to knowledge about the time loop. How to add people to it with a temporary marker, and access some of the other hidden functions. But his mind has clearly been tampered with--we don't know what he started with.

    Boranova is an unstable ass, yes, but he also has great reason to be desperate, and to seek revenge on pretty much everyone around him.

    If Zach brought him into the time loop on either the normal fixed limit the time-loop entity described (I don't remember many loops it lasted), or completely unlimited, he might have had time to grow,  tamper with the memories of a younger, more naive Zach, and save scum his way to power.

    Heck, he might have been able to find a working version of the ritual by torturing his family members in ensuing loops, making him more stable fairly early on.

    >"I would never have used such a spell," Zach immediately said, correctly guessing what Zorian was about to ask. "Never. Why would I torture myself by bringing people into the loop, knowing that they would suddenly go back to their old, ignorant self in just six restarts?"

    Zach believes this now, sure. But is that his original believed, or a mental geas or other programming put on him by Red Robe? He's awfully reluctant to let Zorian look at his mind, which could be natural fear, or a compulsion.

    Of course, this could just as easily be a clever ruse deliberately planted by the third time traveler to make Zach and Zorian focus on some innocent patsy (he could easily have just erased Boranova from the time loop, if that's not his identity.), but it's not that far-fetched that it really is who he is.
    ```

    - u/Lord_Drol:
      ```
      Looking back at the earlier chapters, it now seems very obvious that Zach indeed used that spell that brought others temporarily into the loop.

      >"Neolu finished in only half an hour," said Akoja after a brief silence. "I bet she'll get a perfect score again."

      >"Ako…" Zorian sighed.

      >"I know everyone thinks I'm jealous but that's not normal!" said Akoja in a hushed but agitated voice. "I'm pretty smart and I study all the time and I'm still having problems with the curriculum. And we've both been in the same class as Neolu for the past two years and she was never this good. And… and now she's beating me in every single class!"

      >"Kind of like Zach," said Zorian.

      >"Exactly like Zach!" she agreed. "They even hang out together, two of them and one other girl I don't know, behaving like… like they're in their own private little world."

      >"Or like they're a couple," said Zorian, before frowning. "Triple? What's the word for a romantic relationship between 3 people?"

      >Akoja scoffed. "Whatever. The point is the three of them do nothing but waste time together and antagonize the teachers and get perfect scores anyway. They even refused the chance to get transferred to 1st tier groups, can you believe that!?"

      In retrospect, knowing what we know now about the time loop, they certainly are temporary loopers brought in by Zach.
      ```

      - u/SpeculativeFiction:
        ```
        What? No, they were explained. At least one (maybe both of them) just find the idea of time travel romantic, and want to believe in it.

        Zach just helps them study/cheat/whatever during the loops he spends in class, and they go back to being average/below average when he doesn't.

        Zach is a lot more hormonally driver than Zorian, so he's spent a fair amount of time chasing women in general.

        If he had more information on the time loop, I think Red Robe erased it a long time before the start of the story.
        ```

        - u/Lord_Drol:
          ```
          What? No, I don't recall that. Could you please point me out the chapter that definitively establishes that? As far as I remember, this point is never revisited save in some of Zorian's musing. Zorian thinking to himself that this is the explanation doesn't really prove anything, nor does he think about it in too much depth. He is almost certainly mistaken.

          There is no way whatsoever that just a bit of extra studying is enough to explain their sudden talent. They're that good by the first day of class, really? Maybe if Zach teleported to their houses first thing and immediately started training them nonstop until class started, but even then, you don't suddenly become top of the class with a few extra days of training.

          But, if they've been in a few loops... I'm not actually disagreeing with anything you've been saying about them other than that. Yes, they go back to being average/below average. Yes, he's more hormonally driven. Yes, he's spent a fair amount of time chasing women in general. Which is *exactly why* it would be absolutly something he would do to bring his groupies with him as temporary add-ons a few times through the loop.

          Come on, that is *exactly* what Zach would choose to do with the power to add others temporarily to the loop. Compare with him wanting only half jokingly to bring girlfriends with him in the time dilation rooms. This is *absolutely* in character for him.

          How I imagine it went is something like this: Zach. being his normal self, chases after the girls. Some of them find the idea of time travel romantic, and Zach offers to bring them along, and they accept (Or they don't believe him and Zach proves it by bringing them along). So they've been through the class before at least once before, which is why it's so easy for them. Once Zach isn't around to bring them through the loop again, they go back to being their normal selves. It's possible they are in a few of the loops during which both Zach and Zorian are in a coma for, until the loop limit on temporary loopers runs out, if that's how it works.

          The thing that makes this interesting is that it would mean that Zach didn't lose his knowledge of this until some time after the story started, which is a quite interesting fact, if true.
          ```

          - u/Xtraordinaire:
            ```
            Chapter 7 explains Neolu. She is indeed just that impressionable. 

            The identity of the *other* girl is never established, and that's a red flag for me. Zorian could have included her in his list in ch57, but whatever the reason was, she didn't catch his eye.
            ```

          - u/cjet79:
            ```
            The problem with them being loopers is that the other time traveler already existed prior to Zorian being brought in.

            The evidence is how the invasion plays out.

            When the attackers were being fed information by the third time looper their artillery strikes targeted the dorm that Zorian was staying in. Zach had mentioned that Zorian almost always died in that initial barrage.

            So in order for those two girls to be in a time loop then the third time looper had to have already existed, but only managed to get control over Zach after the start of the story. Which would also be strange, because if Zach was the only original time looper then he would have noticed that the invasion's effectiveness was changing during different loops. 

            I think the girls being loopers introduces to many strange inconsistencies.

      > You're operating under the assumption he never had access to knowledge about the time loop.

      Um, no. I'm operating exactly under the assumption that he had. 

      > If Zach brought him into the time loop

      Here is the rub: he has no *reason* to, and it is *harder* than bringing any of his schoolmates in the loop. Remember, Veyers went missing 3-4 days before the loop starts. Suppose uncorrupted looping Zach does want to bring Boranova as his companion. *[A huge assumption on itself, because who'd want an asshole of his proportions to be their companion when they can have a harem of pretty girls instead?]* But assume for a second he does want it. This attempt doesn't go well, because... Veyers is missing! And his house is not cooperative unless you force them. It just doesn't make sense to waste so much effort on an asshole, while there are literally hundreds of better and easier candidates around you.
      ```

      - u/SpeculativeFiction:
        ```
        >This attempt doesn't go well, because... Veyers is missing! And his house is not cooperative unless you force them. 

        He got himself kicked out of school before the time loop, yes. But he's missing now almost certainly because he escaped the loop or was erased from it by Red Robe to throw people off his trail.

        For all we know he spent every normal loop trying to get back into school, or just sulking in town.

        Zach and Veyers have a lot in common, if you think about it. 

        * Both were pretty much failures in school. Zach had no mana control, and studied poorly, while Veyers got screwed over by a ritual.

        * Both are kind of the last of their line (Veyers is the last of the core family), taken in by people they feel have betrayed them.

        * Both are probably pretty resentful of the government, for much the same reasons. 

        Veyers was an asshole, sure, but he also got screwed over pretty badly. I can see Zach pitying/sympathizing with him.

        >Here is the rub: he has no reason to, and it is harder than bringing any of his schoolmates in the loop.

        Most people don't believe in the time loop. Only a couple of girls tentatively believe him. I can see Veyers being told about it, and being very insistent or eager to be added to it.

        I mean, his whole life is basically down the tube at that point. The ritual fucked his emotions up, he and his family hate each other, and he got kicked out of the academy.

        Zach spends a number of the loops kicking the shit out of his "Guardian" Tesen. I can see him empathizing with Veyers losing his temper.
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          I realize Zach and Veyers have much in common, [in fact I've just written about it a couple of hours ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5csxs7/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_61_anthills/d9ztit5/) but you miss or ignore the part about him going MIA 3 or 4 days before the loop starts and he clearly doesn't show up. 

          So yea, technically possible that he comes to senses in the original timeline, and returns... Then Zach contacts him and entrusts him with a great secret (why would you do that? he's an asshole), and then he is careful and patient to copy soulmarker and fuck Zach with mind magic, and become the Red Robe. Now that he left the loop, the original Veyers persona is missing for good. 

          But it's sooo flimsy.

          And then there is a much simpler solution. The Red Robe is actually a high ranking cultist, say that Mage Guild boss. Zach told *him* about the invasion and got fucked by an actual malevolent skillful mage.
          ```

          - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
            ```
            >  and got fucked by an actual malevolent skillful mage.

            which that malevolent mage could easily do by: 

            1. Erasing Zach's memories of that encounter and about how the loop works
            2. Placing a geas on him to compel him to avoid having his memory analyzed by anyone else
            3. Setting up Veyers as a red herring for a fallback measure by finding someone Zach knew whose "starting position" at the beginning of the loop wouldn't be found by anyone (since people ejected from the loop show up as dead bodies in their starting position in each subsequent loop), ejecting that person from the loop, and erasing that person from Zach's memories so that if Zach or someone else ever got past the geas and went snooping, it would lead them straight to Veyers who's a dead end.

            I think that's pretty likely.

            But doesn't your dismissal of Zach being the original looper, telling Veyers, and Veyers managing to get himself onboard somehow assume that Zach knew what was going on when the loops began? If he didn't, he wouldn't even know that he should be careful about revealing his secret. Zach was telling everyone who would listen about the invasion, revealing his secret in the process. This could have happened after he was wiped when he no longer knew what was going on or that he should be careful, but if he was ignorant about the whole situation when the loops began, he would surely have done the same thing and could have told him then. 

            There's plenty of reason to doubt that he was properly informed when the loops began:

            1. He doesn't have the looping artifact anymore since his family's belongings were taken
            2. He's soul-stamped, but his parents died when he was young during the Weeping, so they may not have had a chance to tell him things about it
            3. He's slow to learn to develop his soul sense, making it unlikely that he ever had control of it unless a malevolent mind/soul mage could erase a *sense/skill* from him. This suggests that he never knew what was going on to begin with so he never trained it. Either that or he got screwed *really* early on in his looping days before he could learn to control it.
            4. The loops didn't start at the optimal time during the planetary alignment

            One other possibility: Quatach-Ichl blended Zach's soul with Zorian's when he found out what was going on with Zach. If you turn back time and put people in the same situation, they'll do the same things. Maybe Veyers was the bystander that got blended with Zach the first time, bringing him into the loop, and then he eventually screwed Zach and managed to wipe his memory, either alone or with help. Though him having the red robe at the beginning is evidence against this hypothesis. 

            That said, based on learning that the higher-ups in the mage's guild are involved with the primordial thing and that Red Robe was working with them, I think it's most likely that one of the higher-ups screwed him when he went around looking for help with the invasion and they figured out his secret. (Though it's also possible that someone plotted to piggy-back off Zach's soul-stamp even before the loops began and that's why they had his guardian help them take the looping artifact from him.)

              We know thanks to Zorian's marker tracking ritual that RR was not brought into the loop using the same method as Zorian.

              RR does not have an identical marker... wait did he ever perform the ritual before RR left the loop? This story man... I can't wait until that mystery is solved.

              I find it strange that Veyers the heir of unstructured fire magic has not used any fire magic.

              Zorian even mentions that just erasing the memory of Veyers was strange. I think Veyers might be a Red Herring instead of a Red Robe.

      Not so easily. Ejecting a soul from the loop would leave behind a body. And since RR has left, he certainly isn't cleaning up that body...although it does occur to me that since Boranova apparently ran away a week before the loop started, it's possible that that body is in some random location.

    About the "missing before timeloop start" thing, I thought that it could've just been a mundane case of not talking to people rather than outright disappearing. I wonder if divination magic can tell whether someone was at a certain location in the past week rather than whether they can be found in the present. (And whether the fact that the world is created anew each reset would cloud those divinations.)

    Veyers, if he really was the third looper, could've certainly found some things to help control his temper over the years. But yeah, right now it can go either way - some pieces of evidence fit in (motive, attitude), some don't readily (red robe & connection to cultists).

    EDIT: And how he found a way into the loop is also evidence against, yeah (saw your other comment, I didn't think of that).

    ```
    I'm thinking something along the lines of: imagine you are a powerful cultist who wants to recruit among the rich and powerful. Who better to recruit and influence than a stupid, angsty and manipulatable heir of a noble house? So around the time he's about to be kicked out of school he gets contacted by a cultist and thinks 'now i'll be able to exact revenge and get what i deserve'. Zach then goes and talks to Veyers who goes "i know high level people who can help you" those people capture a less experienced Zach and erase all memories of the incident including memories of Veyers. The reason he can't be found is that he's currently hanging with the cultists at the start of the loop or he was ejected from the loop to tie off a loose end.
    ```

      ```
      They might've tried to influence him, but induct him into their cult? Why? For a collection of high-ranking mages, he has nothing of value. He's unstable, weak, and was likely to lose his heir position at any moment even before he got expelled.
      ```

      - u/Areign:
        ```
        not everyone in the cult is a high ranking person. What does the average cultist have to offer? a desire for vengeance and a lack of moral scruples? it sounds like he could fit in fairly well and if he can get over his block then he could be even more useful.

  Wow-la. Now this was a pretty exciting chapter. Things started moving really fast, and I can't wait to see where it all leads.

  Obligatory point-out that one possible stumbling block on mind-controlling primordials is the very fact they're not human. On the outermost cases, it's possible they don't even have a capacity to think the way humans do. (Of course, this comment too is wild speculation because the story hasn't yet featured or discussed Zorian attempting to mind-magick anything much inhuman yet.)

      I was more wondering how he knew there was a stash of spells in there.

        Well you see, the giant catfish was a wizard who messed around with transformation magic. 
        It's a tragic story, everyone assumed he was attacked by the giant catfish and have been trying to take revenge for years.

        The only way to protect his life's work was to swallow it. He's waited for years trapped in that body, waiting for someone to strip off those soul clothes. Waiting for someone special to give him that sweet release and make him feel like a man again.

        Tragic.

            Not necessarily. Remember kids, always buy your potions from Lukav.

            "The problem is that sometimes people overreach and end up transforming too far, so you end up with a mage, say, transforming into a troll in both mind and body and killing his entire family before the spell runs out of mana and he reverts back to normal. Or they attach the transformation shell too firmly to their soul and can't change back, and are then stuck in the form of a sparrow or something and can't talk to people or meaningfully interact with their environment. That's why a lot of people don't do transformation via invocations and rituals any more, and just buy transformation potions from people like me who know what they're doing..."

            It's also possible a random mage decided a giant catfish was the best place to store his valuables.

                We know that enhancements use a small portion of the soul's mana reserves to maintain themselves (Although they affect the soul directly and aren't soul clothes).
                The soul is still a power source, so I think it is possible for a transformation to be maintained in a similar fashion if it is bound too tightly to the soul.

    Don't think so, and his actions don't seem to support it. The invasion, release and enslavement of the primordial are pretty much indefensible as being a good thing. RR put in quite a bit of effort into refining it to the point of perfection, so I rather doubt he's actually good.

      true but if you look at it from a perspective of nothing that happens in the time loop actually matters, perhaps he's not quite as evil as we think. OTOH, I don't think that RR has done a single thing that can be interpreted as "good" so far.

        The question isn't really about morality of his actions in the loop, but rather morality of his intentions that we deduce from his actions.

          He may have a belief that he would simply be better suited to deal with the threat and that only one looper can escape which would explain his hostile treatment of other loopers.  

          However, I believe he is evil and going to be a problem simply because if he was on their side the ending would likely be too easy by far.

          I guess he could've been cooperative to get as high up in the cult as he could get in 30 days to learn as much as possible about the ritual, the cult and the primordial as he could so he could maybe be in the best possible position to stop the whole thing once he's out of the loop.

          Him being hostile to loopers could be explained by him fearing that they'll screw up his plans to stop the invasion that he made such elaborate and lengthy preparations for. From his POV it might have looked to be much easier and  more definitely successful to just kill the loopers and remove their influence from his plans entirely than try to convince them to help even if his intentions were good, since he had no real way of knowing how evil the other loopers were and whether they'd stab him in the back sooner or later.

          Or maybe he needs a mind-controlled primordial to stop an even greater evil, like maybe the gods aren't dormant but super evil and are gathering power for an attack on earth.

            - u/Frommerman:

              Allow me to speculate and ask myself what we believe and why.

              We believe Primordials are evil. There is nobody alive who can tell us this first hand, and in fact the first Zorian heard of them was from a priest of Eldemar's official religion. All we can really be certain of is that the gods of that religion opposed the Primordials. It is highly likely that they imprisoned them as well, though all of this happened so long ago that they could have just been taking credit for someone else's work.

              We know the gods vanished several centuries ago, so we have no direct accounts of their character. We know Zorian thinks these gods were probably less good than the church would have you believe, and though there are no accounts of the gods slaughtering entire cities for merely existing, it is entirely possible that a corrupt church desperately searching for a way to stay relevant in a godless world could have suppressed any such accounts.

              We know releasing a Primordial requires blood sacrifice. We don't know how the seal was set up in the first place. However, we do know that it is possible for mere mortals with sufficient fanaticism to release a Primordial from a prison supposedly designed by gods. This seems to indicate either massively incompetent gods or that the prison was not designed by them. If it was designed by evil gods, they could have just set up the prisons to require blood sacrifice to open to make the Primordials seem more evil than they actually were.

              We have further evidence of incompetent or powerless gods in the design of the Sovereign Gate. The weak AI that runs the thing clearly did not know about soul magic or that it might be possible to create additional permanent loopers with it, indicating that this was either an intended bug (seems unlikely) or an oversight by whoever designed the loop. Either the deity who made it did not consult any of their buddies for failure modes, or it was made by a mortal. In addition, the arbitrary one month cut off seems super, well, arbitrary, and allowing loopers to circumvent that seems like a cop out on the part of the Gate's creator, neither of which are behaviors I associate with anything I would consider worth calling a deity.

              So. We have a gods who are not present to tell their side but are basically required to be either massively incompetent or possibly malevolent and playing a bigger game than we can understand. We have Primordials who these incompetent or malevolent deities opposed. The deities won, somehow, and probably imprisoned the Primordials, then continued being incompetent, then vanished for no known reason.

              How do we know that Primordials are evil? The only sources we have are known to be both unreliable and inaccessible.

    Since it is a time loop, going on a killing spree doesn't really require being evil, just sufficiently sociopathical and unstable. After all, everyone will be fine in a couple of weeks. In fact, fine-tuning the invasion despite the fact that a lot of things will be different in the real world (demon summoning) kinda supports that RR views it all as a mere game (not a strong argument).

    On the other hand, messing with other time travellers is... and RR has done his share of that. So yeah, he probably is a bad guy even outside of (relatively) morality-free consequences-erasing time loop.

      His actions in this regard could’ve been forced from the false assumption that only one looper can leave the loop (essentially, not die), so there could be no possible peaceful resolution with any other loopers, so there’s no point in trying to enter into a dialogue with them at all — it will only increase the risks to his/her person. 

      A bit similar to the dilemma of approaching strangers in a post apocalyptic setting: they may share information and resources, but they may also turn out to be a manhunter and\or backstab and kill you. Only here the risk to lose everything is much higher than the chance of gaining something valuable.

      His interaction with Zorian (right before Zorian's suicide via fall/explosives/carnivores) is very important in trying to understand him (which does rather highlight how little actual evidence we have of anything, when that brief conversation is a highlight). For example, his only question to Zorian was, "How many time travellers are there?" He didn't ask how they entered the loop; does that mean he thought it would be straightforward to duplicate his own entry? He did offer to teach Zorian a few things, but he made that conditional on getting the info he wanted, so it could well have been a lie; he didn't show very much willingness to cooperate - or even coexist - with other loopers.

  I feel like anyone coming out of the time loop would have to be really careful readjusting to the real world. The story suggests that there was a king 400 years ago that went through the time loop, and that he was in the time loop for 'many lifetimes'. How did he not accidentally get himself killed within a few months? Your whole perception of risk and danger would be so screwed up after dying a few hundred times.

      Magic competence and CONSTANT VIGILANCE (Mad-Eye Moody style) are entirely different things though.

  I find it strange that I've yet to see my favourite Red Robe theory for the past 20-odd updates show up as a discussion, so time to pitch in!

  Zach is RR.


  Now, bear with me on this. Anybody who becomes the third looper needs to have a copy of the marker inscribed on their soul. We know it's possible to merge the marker into another soul in such a way that the marker heals onto the subject, but this process is incredibly risky. There is, however, a reliable method for creating another marker that has been brought up on numerous occasions.


  Simulacrum.
  We've been told a lot about simulacrum, spread out over many chapters, but the key piece of information here was hidden in a discussion on ethics in soul duplication. That is, the spell duplicates the outer layers of a soul, which would mean it duplicates the marker. If Zach were to do this, it would create a looping individual with complete knowledge of the original and no body to return to.


  Zach knew Simularcrum, tried to cast it, and has now forgotten the spell, forgotten it's location, and has no interest in trying to cast it again.

  I think that "Red Robe" is Zach's original personality, jaded by the death of his loved ones and his subsequent betrayal by those they trusted most. At one point he created a looping duplicate. Either "Zach" was made as is, or the two fought for the right to their original body. I suspect "Red Robe" is the Simulacrum, but it works either way.

  "Zach" is a hollow shell of a person. Compelled to maintain Mind Blank to hide his edited personality, he avoids magics and approaches that could conceivably catch "Red Robe" off-guard, holds almost no grudge against the nation that destroyed his family's legacy and brute-forces all his problems. It's possible that, if he's the original, he's been tasked with doing the boring grinding of his skills and mana. He's a custom-made shonen protagonist.

  "Red Robe" started the Loop a month early to ensure the destruction of Cyoria. He is friends/allies with Veyers, who holds similar feelings of betrayal and so made sure "Zach" wouldn't run into him. He assumed "Zach" was somehow behind the Areana (likely by creating another Simulacrum), which is why he went straight to "Zach" the first chance he got. It's also why he panicked and immediately left once "Zach" had no idea what was going on, since he has no idea how someone could Loop without being Zach.


  There's also the Plot angle, where presumably "Zach" will revert (possibly after merging into the same body with the simulacrum) and Zorian will find himself up against a powerful archmage who knows all his tricks.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    This is a poetic theory, but the data is strongly against it.

    Zach is the real deal. Pre-loop Zach was nice enough to be kind to pre-loop Zorian, who was, to put it bluntly, a whiny angsty bitch. In the past two arcs lots of Zach's character traits were examined by Zorian and were repeatedly found to be consistent with the current Zach. His jovial personality, his now-rectified academic failures, all fits. At this point we only do not know about Noveda bloodline and Zorian hasn't met his caretaker in person. These are the biggest white spots that could potentially surprise us.

    The rest of the theory falls apart rather quickly. If Zach were to be evil, his obvious target would be royalty that betrayed him, not the low-born citizens of Cyoria. As it stands his caretaker and the king come out completely unharmed.

    > the spell duplicates the outer layers of a soul, which would mean it duplicates the marker.

    Nope. The marker is woven through the entire soul, and specifically designed to resist copying. The simulacrum spell almost certainly wouldn't be able to duplicate it.

    Also, Batak the priest explained to Zorian that simulacra *don't have souls*, which is why the church doesn't think that dispersing them counts as a human death. So they surely couldn't be grabbed by the Guardian and inserted into a new body. And since the simulacrum isn't in the template, what body could the Guardian give it? It just doesn't fit.
    ```

    - u/MaxDougwell:
      ```
      Not quite. The Marker anchors itself in the entire soul, but nothing says it requires a whole soul to function. Zorian entered the loop with only a chunk of it welded onto his own soul, so a complete outer soul layer with the marker would be plenty. 

      It doesn't resist copying, it invalidates older Markers when a new one is placed outside the Loop, and inside the loop the process for giving someone a new Marker is a forbidden action. Simulacrum handily bypasses that by duplicating the outer soul instead, which just so happens to be engraved with the Marker. No need to assign a new Marker.

      Simulacrum duplicates the less important outer layers of the soul, so the resulting being "doesn't count" ethically. Once again, the Loop seems to grab all soul-stuff hooked up to a Marker, so it'd grab the hollow soul shell.

      The last point is valid though. While there's several ways I could see it working (reassigned starting point, soul mobility, Gate fail-safes) none are confirmed to be possible. The simulacrum spell could still be one giant, red-robed herring. But the fact Zorian is being faced with a similar bodiless problem when he leaves the loop makes me think we'll see a work around soon enough.

        I suggest re-reading chapter 39. The way Kael talks about the marker - being designed to consult the core of the soul, send signals to the Guardian, etc - is not consistent with the mere shell that you're describing.

        And Zorian doesn't have just a piece; take a look at the end of chapter 31. Apparently the marker grew throughout every part of his soul.

        By the way, where do you find the statement that the simulacrum spell copies *any* part of a soul? I can only find discussions of simulacra in chapter 26 and chapter 51, neither of which makes that statement (indeed, chapter 51 is where Batak states that simulacra copy the person *except* the soul).

  Am I really the only one who's pretty sure that Red Robe is actually Daimen, Zorian's brother? 

  If not, the fact that his name keeps getting brought up every couple chapters, usually along with references to some super-secret amazing discovery he's recently made, makes him the biggest unfired Chekhov's Gun(man) in the whole story. Both Daimen and his big discovery are in Koth, the southern, habitable portion of the [continent of Miasina](http://mother-of-learning.wikia.com/wiki/Miasina), which also happens to be ~~where~~ the same continent where the Ikosian Empire rose and fell. The Ikosian Empire, which gave rise to the modern forms of magic used by almost all humans, was founded by one Shutur-Tarana Ihilkush, who is very likely the last Maker-level user of the [Sovereign Gate](http://mother-of-learning.wikia.com/wiki/Sovereign_Gate) if not its creator. Five of his possessions are the keys required to identify as the Maker to the Guardian of the Threshold, so it seems logical that he was the Maker, or at least managed to obtain said keys and use the gate with Maker-level privileges.

  Zorian just happened to be disguised during his only direct confrontation with Red Robe, so Red Robe doesn't know his identity, either. And that was almost the only time he's ever felt the need for a disguise. That seems a little too coincidental.

  I also find it suspiciously strange that it hasn't occurred to Zorian to go find his amazing relic hunter tomb raider supermage brother and ask for help finding the four keys they don't know the whereabouts of. Fine, they aren't close and Zorian hates him, but help is help, and not dying seems like it would be worth it. Yeah, Daimen's supposedly on another continent, but that seems like a not-insurmountable problem given the kind of magic and technology in the setting--they have fast, mana-powered trains and teleportation but not boats/blimps/airships/planes/levitating conveyances?

  It just feels right from a narrative perspective. If Red Robe isn't someone we know or know of, what was the point in making his identity a secret?

  My current theory: 

  Daimen is Red Robe. He found between one and four of the Gate keys in Kosh along with enough information about the Sovereign Gate to activate it while marking himself as Controller, probably using one or more of the keys. The documentation also included use of the spell that he used on the aranea/mercenaries in the Soulkill loop to exclude them from future loops. He used his fame, wealth, contacts, and considerable magical talent to find and gain access to the Gate in the time dilation research black site in the Hole (freshly arrived there after its recent donation to the Crown by Tesen Zvari, caretaker/looter of House Noveda and Zach) at which point he activated it as the Controller. He is the driver behind the Cult of the Dragon Below's plan to summon and yoke the primordial, with the goal of achieving immortality and near godlike power, and he activated the Gate a month earlier than its maker intended (at reduced efficiency) because the primordial summoning had to occur exactly on the planar alignment to have the best chance at successful yoking. He activated the Gate to allow him to brute-force perfect the process of summoning and yoking the primordial without the huge existential risks that failure would bring. He's also behind the invasion, as he needed Quatach-Ichl and the Ibasan's military might to pull off the summoning, although they think he just wants to summon the primordial as an unguided weapon of mass destruction against Eldemar. The Ibasans already had the motive, he just had to point them in the right direction. He may have also needed Quatach-Ichl's crown for the Gate activation process, which would have necessitated an alliance.

  However, like the Gate and it's creator, he didn't count on another Controller already existing in the Gate's pocket dimension.

  House Noveda are the remaining descendants of Shutur-Tarana Ihilkush, who was either the last person to use the Gate (probably at all, certainly with Maker-level privileges) or its creator. After exiting the Gate and finding he was unable to use it again, he magically modified his bloodline. His modifications include the massive mana reserves Zach has and a copy of the Brand, the soul marker that designates one a Controller within the pocket dimension of the Sovereign Gate. He had to slightly alter the Brand to make it hereditary (or it isn't hereditary, but has been altered to allow it to propagate such that it can be passed down via a simple ritual implantation of a soul fragment from a bearer of the Mark to another, which is exactly how it got accidentally passed to Zorian via the lich's Soul Blender spell on the first restart we witnessed) which accounts for how Zorian could get it by accident and why it seemed partially broken--it was hacked by Shutur-Tarana Ihilkush to make it propagatable but still functional as far as the Sovereign Gate was concerned. (I'm slightly leaning toward Shutur being the last Maker-level user but not the actual creator of the Gate, keys, and Brand for this reason.)

  The Sovereign Gate copies everything--including souls--for simulation in the time loop, so when Daimen activated it, it copied Zach, who already had the Brand on his soul, accidentally initiating a loop with more than one Controller. That's when Daimen's plan started falling apart. Another Controller made the loops far less stable and made it that much harder to brute-force the primordial yoking process. He tried to mitigate the damage by using mind magic to corrupt Zach's memories, retard his progress, and distract him, but with the eventual introduction of Zorian and then the aranea to the loop, the risk of another Controller figuring out how to leave and trapping him became too great so he left the loop, thinking it would collapse and eliminate the threat upon his exit.

  Edit: Problems with pieces of my theory: 
  * The Ikosian Empire was in the northern, now desertified, region of Miasina, not in Koth, the southern region of the continent, where Daimen supposedly is now and where his and Zorian's parents are heading to visit him.
  * As far as I can tell, primordial's summoning ends the loop, no matter when it occurs during the course of the loop, so it would only be good for the brute-forcing the invasion and summoning part but not the yoking (by far the more challenging part of the whole enterprise).
  * IIRC the primordial was summoned before the planar alignment during the loop where the army attacked the mansion.
  * Even if the loop didn't end every time the primordial was summoned, the loop seems like an unwise method of attempting to brute-force yoking a primordial. If it knows any mind or soul magic equivalents at all, even a looper might not survive a failure.

  I still think the key points of the theory—Daimen = Red Robe, who activated the Gate, and Zach is a time-traveller because he already had the Mark before the Gate was activated—are on the money.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    It's an *interesting* theory, and kudos for identifying the weak points. However, I have some more weak points to add:

    - The Gate is in Cyoria, Daimen is (as of the start of the loop) in Koth. How is he supposed to have activated it?
    - The Guardian already explained that marking a Controller invalidates the old marker. I'm not sure that inheriting a marker would be feasible in any case, but even if so, it would be void once RR was marked.

    On other points - there is no indication that the first Ikosian emperor had higher access than any other Controller.

    And it isn't really coincidental that Zorian would use a disguise on the one occasion where he knows that he's likely to meet RR, in a situation where RR will know he's a Controller. The only other time they met was just previously, when RR and QI crashed the party, and Zorian was just blending into the crowd.

    However, the idea that the cult deliberately activated the Gate early does bear thinking about, simply because there has to be some reason why it was activated then despite the costs.
    ```

    - u/pleasedothenerdful:
      ```
      As to your first point, we don't know that Daimen is in Koth; all we know is Zorian thinks he is and his parents are travelling there to visit him.

      As to the second...you're right. The Guardian outright said that a new Mark invalidates all old ones before Gate activation and can't happen after. Still, the fact remains that somehow two marks were active in the loop, so the Guardian must be wrong. Red Robe must've had a mark to be able to leave as a Controller, and it was a different mark than Z & Z have or Zorian would have been able to pick up RR with his Mark locator spell (hrm--or RR had already exited before Zorian used the spell). The Guardian is a programmed interface that only knows how it was designed to work. We're definitely well outside the Gate's designed operating parameters now, though. The only question is whether that's due to a bug or due to a purposeful exploit by someone with intimate knowledge of those parameters (via Maker-level access) and lots of time to figure out how to do so.

      Regarding the 1st Emperor having that Maker-level access, I really must disagree. The memory packet message said Zorian'd need the five pieces of the key to leave and that they were the Ikosian emperor's crown, ring, orb, dagger, and staff, all long lost on the continent of Miasina. The Guardian said the Gate was barred, and the only way to unbar it was with the five pieces of the key. The Guardian said only the Maker or his agents (with the key) could create a Mark on someone and start the loop. The Ikosian Emperor certainly used the key (his stuff, or what history now remembers as his stuff) and Gate, so it's hard to believe he wasn't viewed by the Guardian as the Maker or Maker's agent.

      That said, upon further review of Chapter 55, I think Red Robe/Daimen needed all five pieces including the lich's crown to complete the key, Mark himself, and begin looping, which might explain why the invasion. The lich wouldn't have just handed over the crown, but certainly might have offered its brief use for one part of a grand revenge plan to topple his hated enemy. I doubt RR told him what it was really for, though.
      ```

        ```
        > The Guardian said only the Maker or his agents (with the key) could create a Mark

        I read it a little differently. The actual wording was, "The Controller is marked by the Key, by the Maker, or by its agents". My take on that was that the Key is a *third* way to mark someone - not the tool of the other two. The identical wording - "by the..." suggests a list. Zach seems to assume the same, a few paragraphs later, when he says that the Key is long lost, and the gods (probably including the Maker) have long been silent, leaving only the Maker's agents to mark the Controller.

        It's not impossible, of course, that the emperor was someone extra-special. He might have created the Key from his imperial treasures. Or he might have gathered them *because* they were the Key. Data insufficient.

        > (hrm--or RR had already exited before Zorian used the spell)

        Indeed he had. He apparently vanished shortly after attacking Zach in the bathroom, and Zorian didn't learn to sense his soul or perform the tracking ritual until much later.

        > due to a bug or due to a purposeful exploit by someone with intimate knowledge of those parameters (via Maker-level access)

        Clearly a bug, IMO. Someone with Maker-level access wouldn't *need* any exploit. The Maker can change all the rules. The Guardian clearly hasn't been able to work out that there are multiple Controllers, which it would if the Maker told it to do so.

        > we don't know that Daimen is in Koth

        Strictly speaking, perhaps not, although presumably he had been in contact with his parents before they decided to visit. He might be able to return and yet conceal his return - but why would he bother to conceal it?

Once the protagonists are sure they are done with whatever testing they need to perform to take on him in the real world, they could just banish him and waltz into Ibasa or wherever he hangs out to collect the crown at the beginning of the loop iteration in which they intend to exit (likewise with all other keys that may be in possession of anyone troublesome).
