  Is any of this going to be fun for someone (i.e., me) who knows The Culture but is entirely unfamiliar with Warhammer 40K?

    As someone familiar with both, I tried this a while back and gave up several chapters in - it wasn't compellingly written or interesting, I didn't care about any of the characters so it was really tough to care about anything that was happening. In Iain Banks' Culture books, I always cared about the main characters. Even if I did not agree with their goals, methods, etc - as in, for example Use of Weapons - I still felt they were fully realized characters and was interested in how their stories played out. In that portion of the Warhammer fiction that's I've read that is not terrible, the same has also been true. However, in what I read of this fic before giving up I didn't care about basically any of the characters at all so the fic as a whole failed to engage me.

      It's really more of a thought experiment than a story, but it's a fun one.

      There's an assumption in the WH40K universe that a culture as utopian as the Culture could never arise- the universe is presumed to be so cruel that any civilization would be crushed into a state of dystopia.  To me, a fully formed Culture struggling against that assumption is an interesting enough premise that it works even in the absence of actual characters or human drama, though I can see how some would feel differently.

      Thanks, that's very helpful.

      Is there any The Culture fanfic which you would recommend? (I haven't found anything good yet, but then this was only the second I had come across.)

        The harry potter cross [Culture Shock](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3983128/1/Culture-Shock) came closest to not sucking of the culture fanfic I've read. 

        Spoilers for the fic follow hereafter:

        Problems with it:

        - Diziet Sma feels a bit Mary-Sue-ish, as does Harry. Dumbledore got run over a bit in the fic.

        - The story was just getting to interesting bits when it stopped updating. At this point, six years since the last update, it's probably deader than Iain Banks and is unlikely to ever be continued. 

        - The canon plot was about to get hit by a truck - at the end of the last posted bit, Minds were about to absorb all magical knowledge meaning they would be likely to be uber-Hermiones and get all the plot details that are in any magic (or other) textbooks and, and they were also Uber-Harrys and get all the plot details that can be heard by being invisible (or operating flea-sized surveillance drones) and also have infinite carrots (in terms of wealth and the like) and also have infinite sticks (in terms of military power). So any continuation of the plot would have to cope with the fact that any villains are about as badly overmatched as it's possible to be - and also the principal characters (Harry, Diziet, Dumbledore, et al) are basically irrelevant in comparison the the Culture's temporal power.

        - Why did the Culture stopped surveilling the Earth apparently after finding Harry there and seeing the whole flying motorcycle thing? I would think there would be 10+ major ships around Earth pretty fast and for the duration "until they worked out what was going on down there". 

        Good bits: 

        - Harry felt genuinely different as raised by the Culture, and I liked the Diziet/Harry relationship in the fic - it generated and used characters I cared about well.

        - Dumbledore's (and others') perplexity was hilarious at times 

        - Writing quality was reasonably high / technically proficient.

        - I liked the Troll 'fight' scene (if one can call it that) a lot

  I went into this with no prior knowledge about The Culture and some about the WH40K and so far it seems ok. Not terribly engaging, but a decent procrastination aid.

  I have a question though. How come the citizens of the Culture are so dumb? What in-universe explanation is given for this? How have they managed to develop that level of technology when they constantly make blunders a modern human of average intelligence could avoid? 

  From what I read so far the Culture seems to be a bit of a dystopia in its own right. An eternity of wondering the stars with ships full of stagnant human level intellects enforcing moral preference of majority on anything in sight with magic tech. Quite chilling. 

  And no matter how much you capitalise the M in Mind, they do not display any cognitive heavy lifting in story. Some good processing power is shown, but they apparently have about the same level of cognitive ability as a human (so basically they are dumb really fast). This scale of intelligence thingy that pops up from time to time is confusing as well.

  Should I even try reading the source material or am I just going to be pissed off at how nothing ever went FOOM, even though the tech is apparently there?
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    They consciously avoid going full FOOM, in that the noted endpoint in universe is a process called 'Subliming' which is essential Ascension. There are extant Sublimed beings, group minds, and in some cases species which exceed the power of the Culture in their own home universe.

    They have numerous other cultural hangups. There is a general distaste on living for over about 500 years, though some choose to live forever and are not prevented from doing so. Small groups have chosen to Sublime or to come together in group minds.

    It's actually pretty complicated.
    ```

    - u/AugSphere:
      ```
      So, basically, it's a story about technophobic retrogrades left behind by the ones that did go FOOM. I guess that explains it. 

      It just seems silly that they are still on modern real world human level intelligence. I could understand the adaptive use of different levels of processing power and differently optimised cognitive systems in post-singularity society, but staying a baseline human just seems comical.

      Thanks for the reply, though. It clarified the situation a bit.
      ```

      - u/okaycat:
        ```
        Not exactly.  When people Sublime they enter some sort of extradimensional space and rarely interact with the physical world afterwards.  Most of them leave the material world behind forever.  The Minds are worried that Sublimation will somehow strip someone of their identity so they are leery of it.

        They also view Sublimation as the easy way out and selfish.  By leaving the material universe, you are leaving the younger inexperienced civilizations to fend for thenselves.

        Also Culture biological citizens can enhance and change themselves however they want.  I think genius level intellect is standard
        ```

        - u/AugSphere:
          ```
          I can understand the reasons for avoiding this nebulous "Sublimation". But why not just self improve without subliming? What bugs me, is that the default setting for citizen intelligence is "human level" instead of something better. Supposedly they know how to reach higher, and yet they don't. 

          It's a tricky subject, but my position would be this: first uplift the intelligence in question to your best capabilities (without Subliming), while preserving their values, then let the newly enhanced individual work out their best course of action themselves. If they decide that they are better served by being as dumb as a human, they can self-modify accordingly. Just leaving them at the default level seems a bit cruel and callous. It's like leaving an addict to his own devices. Sure from his current point of view, he may not even want to be cured, but it's not like it would be impossible to go back if you magically cured him. It's pretty fucking tough to read about the enhanced individuals (Minds) lording it over the whole society of average humans without uplifting them.

          Are the Minds in source material actually smart though? Or do they just have a bunch of processing power strapped to human-level cognitive processes? I've been going on the assumption that the Minds are in fact more intelligent, and not just faster.

          Edit:
          > Also Culture biological citizens can enhance and change themselves however they want. I think genius level intellect is standard

          Somehow missed this part of the post. Still, current human level of genius is a pretty low bar to aim for. Compared to what they could achieve it's like changing the setting from "monkey" to "smart monkey" on the scale of human intelligence, sure it's higher, but not at all a significant improvement. My point about going as smart as possible at least for once in their lives still stands, I think.

          Edit2:
          > Culture biological citizens

          Wait, what about the rest of them? I hope this specifier is there because non-biological citizens self-modify as a matter of course, and not because only the biological ones are allowed to self-modify.

            Even if you have no interest in the books, you might be well-served by reading the wiki page for [the Culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture#Citizens). It goes into some detail about what the Culture actually comprises.

            Citizens (biological or artificial) are free to modify themselves pretty much as much as they want - but the Culture is hedonist, and so more intelligence is not really the be-all end-all of their lives.

            > first uplift the intelligence in question to your best capabilities (without Subliming), while preserving their values,

            This is considered impossible. In-universe, a "Mind" is an entity capable of Subliming by itself. The Culture makes at least one Mind per ship, and of the Minds created, nearly all Sublime on the spot. All those who remain are in some way slightly deranged; it is believed that any psychologically stable entity capable of Subliming will inevitably do so.

            And all Culture citizens can modify their own intelligence however they like; most choose to stay at the same level as the rest, but this, like most other self-modification consensuses in the Culture, has long-term fads, and it may go up and down from century to century.

        Hmm, I think if you actually read the books (not fanfiction) you'll see that "technophobic" is the wrong way to describe them. The reason there's lots of real-world level humans (besides the fact that real-world level humans usually make for better stories) is that life is already good enough that any sort of personal upgrade won't make it any better. Their level of technology is so high that they just don't see any point in further advancement so a lot of the focus (of the society and of the novels) is on philosophy and ethics and social interaction and technology is just a facilitator. Their technology isn't unique or even the close to being the best in their universe but what sets them apart is the stability and longevity of their society.

    Life in the Culture isn't really touched on in this fanfic, but what makes it a utopia in the novels is the degree of personal freedom and the complete lack of scarcity.  Some Culture ships are worlds in and of themselves, with billions of inhabitants and enough room for every single one to live in a mansion surrounded by gardens if they chose to.  Since Minds are willing to do all the work, humans and drones can choose to either help out, spend all their time creating artwork, pursuing hobbies and games, and having passionate love affairs, or do useful things outside of the Culture, usually working with Contact or Special Circumstances.

    They're hedonistic and not extremely ambitious, but not really stagnant either- the Culture produces a lot of lower-case 'c' culture, and while it's implied that their level of technology is nearly as advanced as it can get without them Subliming to another plane of existence, they do make technological advancements from time to time.

    In general, the Culture actually doesn't force its morals on other civilizations unless it's threatened.  It certainly doesn't have a Prime Directive, but it engages in ordinary diplomacy with less advanced civilizations, along with the occasional back-room deal or clever bit of political intrigue to stop a genocide or stall an atrocity.  Of course, when directly threatened, it responds very aggressively.

    In the novels, the intelligence of the Minds is shown by them doing things like having individual conversations with millions of people at once, pulling off complicated Xantos gambits and conspiracies, or being able to imagine things far outside the scope of human capabilities.  Not seeing a whole lot of the clever plans in this fanfic, but then they are trying to puzzle out this universe without the benefit of a sourcebook.

  I enjoyed the 'negotiations' with the Necrons.

  In story, the Necrons (Oldcrons for those familiar with 40k lore) have an internal fault state in their AI which prevents them from trading with the Culture, despite it being in their best interests, or even discussing or negotiating for such. They get around this by effectively starting a short war with both sides 'claiming' the trade goods as spoils. the Necrons wanted [spoiler](#s "Intelligence engineering techniques, presumably to fix their own broken AI")

  Which cannot possibly end badly.

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  So I hit Chapter 40, and a Tzeentchian Chaos Sorcerer has just started acausally trading (ala Timeless Decision Theory/Basilisk) and blackmailing with the Eldar and a Necron who I assume is Orikan the Diviner. They are using pre-commitment and future sight in order to fight whole proxy wars on the future timelines. It's interesting, if alarming.
  ```

  - u/thakil:
    ```
    That was pretty much my least favourite part, as I found each Tzeentchian chapter absolutely atrociously written, to the point of being essentially unreadable....
