## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  In settings where people can visit an infinite number of alternate universes, there's a problem that arises with the question of how people can find universes that are remotely similar to our own, and also not wind up in the vast empty space between galaxies.

  A simple but interesting solution occurred to me the other day.  You have a device that can open a portal to a similar device in another universe, but the device is connected to a box, and will only open a portal to a universe where the contents of the box are exactly identical.

  So, if you put something complex in the box, you'll wind up in a universe almost indistinguishable from your own, but get some extremely pure metal, etch an English dictionary on it in tiny letters, evacuate all the air from the box and make absolutely sure there are no contaminants, and you'll be able to link to an incredibly alien universe where the inhabitants just happen to speak English.
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    The thought occurs that this could also justify many cheap alternate-universe tropes.

    Like the existence of an alternate /u/artifex0 and an alternate /u/Chronophilia in a universe where e.g. dragons exist. By normal, everyday causality, it would be fantastically unlikely for the same set of parents to meet and fall in love, let alone have a genetically similar child, let alone have this happen once every generation!

    But if the box contained a photograph that you appeared in, then naturally both universes would contain someone who looked like you, dressed like you, and shared at least one interest with you (whatever you happened to be doing at the time). While still containing seemingly-absurd differences e.g. whether the dragon in the background is real or an odd sculpture.

    I'd envisioned the "box" as a natural phenomenon outside human control, to prevent people from trying to exploit it by putting in an object they specifically want.
    ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    I was thinking of writing some extremely detailed book, such that since the parallel universe would also have had to had that exact same book, the book would contain descriptions of every detail of reality you wanted to keep the same.

    However if you want to connect to a universe exactly the same as your own a better solution came to mind: Nothing about your description of the box seems to say you can't put a person in a spacesuit in the box. If you put controls to the machine in the box as well, then you can put yourself in the box.   
    This would guarantee that the parallel universe was exactly the same in every way you knew of.
    ```

  - u/rineSample:
    ```
    Wouldn't this also result in an infinite number of universes that still match the criteria, or do I misunderstand multiple worlds theory entirely?
    ```

    - u/artifex0:
      ```
      Sure, but that could work as a plot element.  Once you opened a portal, you'd have to leave it open for as long as you needed to access that universe, since closing and re-opening it would link you to a completely different universe.
      ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    I had an idea a while ago, which I've consistently failed to work an actual worthy story around, where there are these portals that, upon activation, split the universe in two (like a quantum event), and the portal in universe A connects with the portal in universe B.

    There'd also be a variation that's activated twice (well, half the time): the first activation splits the universe and does nothing in universe A, and the second activation in universe A causes the portal in universe A to link with the portal in universe B at the moment of the first activation.
    ```

    People can find similar universes is because the universes that are the most similar are closest to each other in term of 'distance'.

    If you want to go to a widely divergent universe, you would have to travel a long way.
    ```

    - u/artifex0:
      ```
      Sure, I've heard that explanation used before, but how do you objectively define similarity?  If it's just distance into the past when the universe diverged, then I think you'd be severely limiting the setting.  There might be a somewhere in the multiverse where, for example, humans co-exist with a vast sentient jungle that gives them powers over animals, but the divergence point would have to be so far back in time that the chances of recognizable humans evolving- and therefore the chances of finding that universe through random exploration- would be impossibly slim.

      In other words, if the divergence point greatly pre-dated humanity, then anything really recognizable would feel like a contrivance, while if the divergence point was more recent, you'd be stuck with alternate history settings.

      If instead you try to define similarity between universes by number of shared concepts, then you run into the problem of what really counts as concepts.  For example, lets say that that universe with the sentient jungle shared 70% of it's concepts with our own universe- so that there was a 30% chance that any new concept you encountered either doesn't exist in our universe, or exists in a different form- a hypothetical instead of a reality, or vice versa.  So, is there a 70% chance of encountering a McDonald's?  What are the chances of the world existing at all?  Not 70%, because you have to include the chances of the solar system existing, the galaxy existing, the arbitrary group of every third star existing, and so on, perhaps infinitely.

      Basically, the implications of that definition confuse the hell out of me, which again, to me, makes the setting feel contrived.

      The thing I like about the box idea is that you can bring elements like humans or English into a very strange setting without raising any question of probability at all, since their appearance is explained by the mechanism.

        Branching multiverses at least have a veneer of science around them.  Omniconceptual multiverses are utter nonsense with no basis in reality (though fun, I'll admit, I do love Rick And Morty).
        ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Universes are infinite, but infinity here is countable. Like natural numbers, there's a distinct progression from universe to universe, rather than having an infinite variety of universes between each universe. So even the closest universe to ours still might have diverged 20 years in the past, or has an earth with 99.999999999% the same elemental content as ours, or has the large hadron collider in the same place.

  I need help fleshing out a magic system.

  1. There's an alternate plane of existence that overlaps prime reality, called the alterum. Things in the alterum are normally invisible and intangible.
  2. It's possible to plant a crystalline tree into your head, which will exist only in the alterum.
  3. These trees are home to some number of damiad, small crystalline entities like cut gems which live in the trees.
  4. A functional tree gives you access to a third eye and second sight (so you can see into the alterum), a second mind (which allows a few preternatural abilities), and the ability to give commands to the damiad.
  5. Damiad have different roles within the tree. Some just sit around, others create and prune branches, and some come in to embellish the branches. Better trees attract more damiads, so there are some feedback loops, and different kinds of trees attract different sorts of damiads.
  6. Someone with a tree can issue commands to their damiads to effect change on the prime reality, but there's a strong chance that the damiads will simply not listen. The chance that they'll listen to any given command goes down when less novel commands are given, or when more commands are given.

  The idea basically came from "how do you make internet communities into a magic system". Trees are forums or subreddits, damiads are users. The person whose tree it is must then be something like an admin, though one who only has a loose understanding of what the damiads are actually "talking" about. The admin role also has some features, like the ability to ban users or make a blanket prohibition against new users, but no actual ability to communicate policy. The "topic" of a tree is sometimes the person wearing it, but can also be something like woodworking, fashionable hats, or pure mathematics. This is not known to the person who has the tree, at least by default.

  But the magic system itself seems a little bit too loose right now, especially with the big question mark over what effects it can produce. I've got a 95% complete story right now, but without some grounding, simply saying that the damiads can do anything that they can be convinced to do makes it seem a little too vague.
  ```

  - u/Aabcehmu112358:
    ```
    How exactly do seeds/trees and damiads transgress the boundary between prime and alterum? Maybe thinking about how exactly stuff, or at least information, can and does go from one side to the other when it normally can't will help hammer out what sfx the damiads can pull off.

    e-

    Also, out of curiosity, why and how are trees and damiads 'crystalline' when they appear to be largely detached from prime in general and the properties of crystals in specific?
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Given that the tree is literally growing out of someone's head, perhaps you could have it so that it is "watered" by that person's thoughts, and therefore specify what type and ability of damiads attracted to that tree can do?

    For example, a person who love maths (not just a mathematician) would attract damiads that can and will do exceedingly complex calculations, while a person with severe wanderlust could have damiads that grant them extrasensory capabilities. 

    Then, you could say that a damiad can inherently produce any effect, but it gets harder to "convince" one to do an effect the more removed it is from the topic of the tree. Like, a Math damiad would do an engineering task with only some minor grumbling, but it would take a lot to convince it to do anything purely physical.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I think I'll probably end up going with that in combination with what /u/gabbalis said. But more abstract and alien.

      To take the metaphor further, let's say that you're an admin of a forum whose language you don't speak. You don't have access to a dictionary, they don't use pictures, and all you really have to go on is the following information:

      * Who's currently online.
      * Who's a mod.
      * Timestamps of comments.
      * Length of messages.

      You have some vague sense that the users are reacting to you, or the world around you, but it's *really* difficult to figure out what they're all on about, let alone to steer their conversation or control the growth and direction of the community. You bought an apple and saw a new thread being created with a dozen hurried replies to it; are they talking about apples, fruits in general, commerce, the person you bought the apple from, botany, foods, bodily functions ... or is this just the equivalent of an off-topic thread that has virtually nothing to do with your purchase?


      So the damiads *do* have varied skillsets, and different trees attract different skillsets, and damiads prefer to do things that deal with the topic of their tree, but the correlations aren't obvious even to a scholar of damiads (in the same way that it would take you a long time to untangle why this subreddit has a much higher than average number of software engineers as compared to the general population).
      ```

      - u/Aabcehmu112358:
        ```
        Out of curiosity, how aware of the world are damiads, and on average how willing are they to establish greater communication with their 'admin?' Are they able to understand any language? Or at least able to understand some sort of symbolic system?

        If they are sufficiently able in these respects, it seems likely that, *eventually*, a precocious mage will eventually figure out a way enter into explicit communication with their damiads. I don't know how, if at all, that will actually enhanced their ability to do magic, but it certainly seems like it'll do something. It might incredibly unlikely, but unless it's impossible, then a sufficient time abyss will leave it happening eventually.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          The damiads are fully aware of the world and capable of seeing everything within it, however they're also quite apathetic to what goes on the in world unless it affects the alterum. Their language is the language of the trees; every new branch on a tree is a statement, every embellishment on their crystalline facets holds meaning. These meanings are in theory accessible to anyone with a third eye, but it would take a huge amount of work since not only is the "language" very foreign, but the mindset behind the language is *also* very foreign.

          There's very little evidence for the damiads being capable of learning human language or adopting human mindsets. They do sometimes seem to respond to speech, but it's unclear whether this is because of the medium or the message; it might be that the speaker just hit the right series of sounds to be interesting.
          ```

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    Damiad are the users, trees are the forums. It seems best to continue the metaphor from there if possible. 

    Not all members of the forum know how to do everything. Certainly on a fashionable hats forum most of the members know at least the basics about fashionable hats, but only a subset know anything about pure mathematics. Therefore I think each Damiad should have different limits in how they can interact with the world. 

    Then getting Damiads to do something then wouldn't be just about convincing them, but also about figuring out how to produce a community with the right technical skills. Maybe the Great electromancers of the world are those that manage to make trees that attract Damiads that specialize in manipulating real world electrons or something.

    The weakest of mages would have trees with topics unrelated to the prime world, and their Damiads would only have 'layman's knowledge' of anything to do with manipulating it. Of course, ludicrous quantity could always make up for quality.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    What exactly can the admin perceive of the forum? You can't moderate something you don't see.

    Otherwise, I'd suggest having damiads be able to interact with the physical world at the cost of some scarce, but otherwise useless resource. So damiads are ready to do the admin's bidding since it's the only way they can profit from the resource (and trade it for premium privileges or whatever), but they're not going to spend all of it on something they don't care about unless they really like the admin.
    ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    You only need a fairly small physical ability to make this work. Information transfer is the main ability, anything else is a bonus.

    Telekinesis? Or whatever you call it when an intangible being moves an object it's phased through. An individual damiad can only exert a tiny amount of force, but a large enough group working together can rip a person apart from the inside. (Metaphor for DDoS, I suppose.)

    Moving heat from one world to the other.

    Generating electrical impulses or currents.

    Performing certain classes of chemical reaction. Maybe they can ferment sugar!

    Oh, and whatever effect you choose, they should be able to build machines or trees in the alternum that have a continuous effect on the material world. Which would require regular maintenance, and be vulnerable to sabotage from other damiads.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    ...the first thought to come to my mind is that two magic users can't get too close, or their crystalline trees will get tangled (they might be intangible to the Prime Reality, but surely not to each other) and this will (a) be extremely embarrassing for both of them, (b) probably damage one or both trees, and (c) likely result in each tree's damiads taking revenge on the owner of the other tree for the damage to their tree.

    (From the point of view of a non-magic user, there will simply be two people glaring at each other, and every time one of them moves his head, the other one gets his head moved)

    This may have a certain number of effects on society; you can't book two magic-users into neighbouring seats at a theatre, for example, or on a plane, and theatre- and plane-booking systems must take this into account (or they will have dissatisfied customers).

    ...given that the trees *are* intangible and invisible on Prime Reality, this also means that it's possible that a magic-user backing into a wall might get his tree entangled with the tree of a magic-user on the opposite side of the same wall. (For maximum awkwardness and danger, one of the two magic-users may be inside an elevator currently in motion...)

    This, of course, all assumes that the tree is firmly anchored to the skull. If it's only attached to squishy brain tissue, then this sort of tangling is likely to be immediately fatal to both...

  A lot of times when writing fiction based off the real world, people introduce one new technology and sees where it goes. But usually that new technology is always rare and scarce.

  What if we make it a commonplace?

  I've been trying to think up a world where teleporters of any size can be made by any seven year old with a science kit, and seeing where that goes. Discovered early enough (say, by Graham Bell with mythology of "seeing stones" and whatnot from before), there would be little to no infrastructure linking anything together. Perpetual motion is also a commonplace, also part of the same kit.

  I'm not so sure about the effects it will have the outcomes of wars though. Definitely lots, seeing that supply lines no longer need to be maintained, but I don't have enough knowledge about specific conflicts to know how they would be affected.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Alright, let's say for the sake of argument that Alexander Graham Bell discovers teleporter technology in January of 1914, six months before WWI, and doesn't have the good sense to keep his mouth shut about it.

    Navies disappear basically overnight, since there's no need to ship anything across the ocean, and thus no need to protect shipping lanes. It's possible that the nations of the world are able to stay together, but I think it would be a near thing, since no borders can effectively be enforced. The global economy goes flat in an instant, since now shipping costs virtually nothing and anyone can compete with jobs against anyone else. This is probably a disaster for nearly everyone. Real estate in the country is now a lot more valuable, and conversely, real estate in the cities crashes through the floor.

    World War I, if it happens, is going to be a game of spies and sabotage rather than armies and navies. Borders are indefensible. People can be defended only to the extent that their location can be kept secret.
    ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    The idea of a nation state would effectively dissolve, so I think wars would be a nonissue. Instead, we'll see bastard children of unions and corporations wielding the most power, with the ideology of their members and their goals determining which conflicts they involve themselves in.

    Pertinent question before more speculation-- can teleporters get you off planet?
    ```

    - u/eniteris:
      ```
      Oh, sorry, the teleporter technology is more like gates/wormholes, so you build a pair at one point and have to move the other one to your destination. Any size of teleporter, but the only way to turn them off is to destroy them. Stargates.

      Yes, which makes loads of fun.

      Planetary colonization becomes trivial, once you get a teleporter to your location. Probably interstellar probes with teleporters on them have been sent out, with pressurized water propulsion from the bottom of the ocean.
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        I assume you can move teleporters through teleporters?

        What happens if you use a teleporter in the middle of a teleporter's portal?

        Also, you might want to figure out some way to negate infinite motion-- getting stuff at sufficient velocity to vaporize the planet would be really easy.

    Is it possible to build arbitrarily small gates? A pair of finger-sized gates could make a reasonable bug - sound still transmits through it (just make sure the guy on the listening end is *really* quiet).

    Is it possible to "roll up" a gate, such that it can pass through a *smaller* gate?

    Alternatively, can a gate be mostly-assembled here, then have the bits passed through a smaller gate and finally put together on the opposite side?

    If either of the above are possible, then a single spy in an enemy country can sneak a really tiny gate past the borders (perhaps disguised as a monocle, by placing glass in it?) and then, after some time, quietly let in an entire army.

    Telephones could work off gates as well; you have one gate in your home phone and the matching gate at the Exchange - the operator merely attaches your Exchange gate to the Exchange gate of the person you wish to talk to (and releasing poison gas at the Exchange can probably depopulate most of a city).

  I'm planning an AU Naruto fanfiction, based more on the beginning of the manga and ignoring most of the last third or so. I'd like to get some feedback on how I want to make Chakra work. Warning, it's quite long and maybe a bit more technical than interesting.

  So, a few things that I decided *must* be an outcome of the system, for setting reasons:

   1. Only ninja have large chakra reserves, but it's not because of heritage (so clan ninja don't automatically have much more chakra available)

   2. Most people can't spam high-level abilities. Kakashi, as per canon, can only use 4 Chidori in one fight, and he's one of the stronger ninja.

   3. Chakra is composed of two parts, physical and spiritual/mental. Each part must be developed separately, although both grow over time.

   4. Bloodlines are hereditary, but not purely based on DNA (so you can't splice some DNA and then gain someone's powers). Sharingan, Byakugan and Rin'negan are all explained.

   5. Nature Chakra should be a massive power boost.

   6. Conservation of Energy isn't important, neither is Conservation of Momentum, but no matter can be produced in large quantities (the energy costs are too high) - so no The Waves Arisen-style [spoiler](#s "world is being flooded")

   7. Sealing makes some sort of sense.

   8. Almost all abilities from early Naruto (i.e. pre-timeskip) as well as some from post-timeskip can be explained by the model.

   9. Tailed Beasts make sense, although they can take any of a number of forms from super smart to super dumb.

  Everything else I was ready, in principle, to sacrifice in order to make these parts work.

  The system I settled on works via the idea of souls in the sense of mind-body dualism. Basically, in an extra-dimensional way, there's a substrate that has human minds in it (they don't overlap). Where the spiritual energy that makes up the mind meets physical energy in the body, produced by the cells, chakra is created, allowing the soul to control the body. Control happens through the head, but very skilled people (e.g. Tailed Beasts, Tsunade) can keep operating even without a head and then heal/regrow it.

  Ninja have their chakra 'unlocked' when they join the Academy. (I'm doing more, unrelated, worldbuilding with regards to learning.) What this means is that essentially, a technique breaks open parts of their chakra network, causing a drain that gradually increases over the course of several years and leading to an excess of chakra being created. When the drain stops, the ninja has starting-level reserves. I'm aging all characters up to 16 when they become genin, and they start school at age 4-5 (same as in the UK), so they might have a starting growth happen from age 5 to age 10 or so. After there's a decent amount, it can be increased simply through expending it. However, the 'trick' used only works for people of a certain age - start too early, or too late, and you can cause horrific damage & death. It was reverse-engineered from how the Sage of Six Paths gave humans chakra originally (makes more sense once I explain Rin'negan).

  Chakra has a physical component and a spiritual component. They come from separate sources, and combining them produces energy, although it's not immediately discharged. Think of two rivers meeting and merging, and the story's world as being a cross-section of the meeting point for a rough idea of where I'm going. By causing some eddies and currents, the objects in the river can be moved.

  Nature Chakra is effectively 'downriver' - where the chakra flows to after it's been used. It's a huge resource, and access to it is a huge power boost. Mokuton is so strong because the wood is fuelled mostly by nature chakra, and therefore very cheap for the caster to produce and manipulate (compared to water or earth techniques). It also causes a range of problems; once you tap into it, if you stop using it, you will die. It hardens the body and you need more nature chakra to be able to move at all, including breathing and heartbeat. On the plus side, it makes you resistant to damage. It can be stored in the body in small amounts. Nature chakra users have bursts of action followed by short rests. They aren't common.

  A person has a body and soul. Both come from the parents - the body is formed as in our world, but the soul is created by a combination of the mother and father's souls (note: soul isn't meant in a religious sense - it's basically a mind implemented in a non-standard medium). Special techniques, affinities and bloodlines can therefore be inherited.

  Tailed Beasts are rips through which huge amounts of physical and spiritual energy rush. Attempts to contain them and use them have generally failed in the past. Sealing them into other creatures led to insanity and massive damage. What basically happens is that a mind/soul has a live mains wire attached. However, over time, more and more soul pieces were left attached after the energy source broke free, and a weak personality appeared over time. Some souls were left attached more or less intact.

  Sealing is basically meta-magic. It's a way to modify chakra and physical & spiritual energy using chakra. The seal Minato used on the Kyubi is one that repurposed large parts of his own mind to create a filter between Naruto's chakra network and the demon's, which is why it killed him. Most seals are much safer, as only small amounts of energy are needed. Most seals that have an effect have a storage component that is charged, and loses power over time. Better seal users can make their storage parts more efficient, so they last longer. The writing on seal paper is used to guide the seal master on where to weave chakra through the material, and has no meaning of its own. Copying the writing doesn't do anything.

  The Rin'negan are eyes that see all dimensions. You can literally look into peoples' minds, and tear out their souls to absorb their knowledge. You have perfect control over your chakra because you can see where the components flow, and how to change them (nobody else can - it's like trying to paint in the dark for them). You can absorb attacks, because you see the structure and disassemble it piece by piece as it hits you. There are a range of sealing-like things you can do - for example, give other people access to chakra. The Rin'negan won't have the same powers as in canon, but they'll be similar-ish.

  The Byakugan are a weaker copy of the Rin'negan. They see only in the physical world (albeit with massively increased range) and chakra. There is no way to block them, although they only see in monochrome so using two similar shades of different colours can let you write messages they can't read (red on green, for example - think of colour-blind tests).

  Those two were relatively easy, as there's a communal theme. Finding a theme for the Sharingan was hard. They're an offshoot of the Byakugan. A Hyuga with a gift for medical techniques modified his eyes so they would store whatever they saw. He had to give up some of their usual functions, however. As his splintered-off family experimented more and more with new powers to add, they gave up core parts of the Byakugan and were left with a much weaker eye that could however learn and grow. The main Hyuga clan cast them out, and further experiments were banned within the Hyuga family.

  The Uchiha, as they named themselves, developed their eyes further and further. The Sharingan could see chakra still, and store that knowledge. Over time it would become stronger and stronger. The eyes would be dormant until the owner felt true fear of death for the first time - a short time later they would activate. The Mangekyou is triggered by guilt, and the way it works is by taking the strongest abilities it's seen and mimicking them, at the cost of the eyes' internal structure, both physically and spiritually.

  The eyes (both Sharingan and Byakugan - the Rin'negan can't be passed on; the Sage's set is the only set) are passed on by eye-to-eye contact from someone who has them to someone who has the right genetics and chakra for them. A chakra 'seed' that can grow into an eye is deposited, and develops over time into a full-fledged eye.

  The Sharingan only makes sense if someone (or several someones) deliberately created it, imo.

  That's most of the chakra-centred worldbuilding I've got so far, although there's more worldbuilding and also some plot. I don't plan on explaining this in-universe, but I need an explanation out-of-universe so I don't accidentally write things that don't make sense.

  If anyone has feedback on what they subjectively liked or didn't like, for any reason or none at all, or what they think of the system as a whole from the perspective of a potential reader, I'd like to hear it very much.

  A while back, I discussed a protagonist for my next story in the superhero genre.  He is no longer human in his biology.  If you imagine an amoeba made of a rubbery, wax-like substance, that's close.  He is a reluctant hero because his powers came with a big problem. Constant hunger that cannot be sated.  If he eats more mass than he uses, he grows larger, and more hungry.  As his size increases, he also becomes less capable of rational thought.  As he grows larger, he can also eat faster.  This combination scares him, with reason. 

  He can consume anything organic, but has weaknesses to solvents and temperature extremes.  He does need oxygen, but can absorb it from the air, water, or even some digestible solids.

  I've been trying to think about how to introduce him.  Here's what I've got, tell me what you think.

  First, when he first got his powers, it was during a super villain attack on his place of work, a research lab.  The subject of research was a living plastic that would be introduced to landfills to recycle organics into said living plastic, which would then be harvested.  He became this substance.

  Specifics withheld, but he ended up consuming a super villain while instinctively trying to fight back.  Three of his coworkers also disappeared in the battle.  He is certain that he ate them by accident.  He tries to convince himself that they were already dead, because he saw them being attacked before he was thrown into the plastic vat.  But he doesn't know.

  It was possible to verify through various means that he didn't intentionally kill anyone, so he was not imprisoned.  But he doesn't trust himself, so he asks to be incarcerated anyhow.

  A compromise was made.  He would be incarcerated, as he wished, but he would need to pay his own way by acting as the first line of defense against other prisoners escaping.

  The first scene will be a small group of heroes going to the prison to try to convince him to be more active in the world.  He's stopped more than twenty super-powered prisoners from escaping, a perfect record.  Despite causing some mental trauma to a few would-be escapes, he hasn't eaten (much) of any of them.

  His name has also changed.  I originally wanted to call him 'Bandit' but he has too much self-hate to give himself that name.  He will, instead, start with the name 'Lump,' which is appropriate because he is an amoeboid with the surface consistency of wax.  He is capable of taking humanoid shape, but requires an artificial endoskeleton to do so.  Even when he forms himself into a human shape, he doesn't really look human up close, and makes people uneasy in his presence even when he tries to be unthreatening.  Uncanny Valley territory.  When he fights, he intentionally tries to unnerve opponents by flaunting his inhumanity as a psychological weapon.

  Does the concept of using a self-hating super-powered individual who insists on being imprisoned as a prison guard make any sense to you?  I've thought through it, and I think it will work, but I'd like to know what problems you folks might see.

  Hey guys. So, supposing I was making a world that uses functional magic and has "temperature" as a major theme - as in, thermodynamics. What attributes would you expect to see in a magical system like that? I have some ideas already. Also, what kind of natural phenomena do you think would proceed from such a system, and how does it effect the world?

  I was thinking of having the world effectively be like a lava zone from a video game, with lots of molten magma and lava everywhere - what kind of climate could maintain that, and also not kill everyone living there?

  Again, I have some ideas as to how I'm going to pull it off, but if you think of something especially unorthodox that I might not have thought of, please go ahead.

    Magic for converting energy between different forms? Ie, heat into kinetic energy or vice versa, or into creating complex chemicals that wouldn't form on their own but which only use the elements at hand. If non-sentient organisms can use simple magic, maybe there are plants that feed just on the excessive heat, and cool themselves by turning deadly heat into harmless wind current, allowing them to survive in way too hot environments?

  How well can we predict morality 40 years in the future? Some things I see drastically affecting the status quo in the near (relatively speaking) term:

  * sexbots
  * extremely realistic VR
  * basic income
  * erosion of privacy
  * better advertising techniques
  * better techniques to change someone's mind
  * designer babies/superior cosmetic surgery

  But it's difficult to predict how all of these things will interact.

    I doubt anyone can give a concrete answer to this question that does not boil down to "People will figure out what I've been saying all along." You make some really good points about what will change morality, by the way.

    As for what I expect:

    - People will be even more relaxed about sexuality.

    - People will have betters models and working theories about the ethics of communication and manipulation.

    - There will be a gradual shift towards transhumanism.

      >People will be even more relaxed about sexuality.

      See, I actually think sexuality is going to look really weird from our perspective. People are becoming sexually active later and later, especially in wealthy countries with low birthrates (think Japan, Germany), but that's coupled with much larger access to porn. What I think will happen is that individual fetishes won't be nearly as stigmatized, but attitudes about actual sex will become less relaxed.

    I'm expecting self replicating robotics to have their day in the sun sometime soon. Factories that produce other factories should have a big economic impact here on earth when they arrive. And if deployed in space, they would have essentially no launch cost beyond whatever the initial starter unit costs, so coupled with the various advantages of space (no gravity, etc) the industrial network could actually grow faster there.

    (Futurists often roll the possibility of self replicating factories in with nanotech, but it's distinct -- we have the bones of a plan to do this in the form of existing macroscale industrial equipment/systems. Just incrementally keep automating it, until it's automated from beginning to end, and you have a crude replicator.)

    From a story perspective, I'm not sure how to make this feel distinct from a generic post-scarcity scenario. Basic income definitely seems important since jobs basically won't exist, but maybe you could go the other way and have a society where citizens are encouraged to own their own chunk of the means of production, kind of like home ownership is encouraged today.

    Another thing is that maybe in 40 years the AI won't be good enough to run these factories entirely, so people will use telerobotics to sub in for it. That is a reasonable use for hyper-realistic VR. That would also tend to limit the factories to close earth orbits or the ground. It would also keep a large segment of the population employed, potentially making them much wealthier in the long run in the interplanetary economy, compared to those who sit around and collect their basic income checks.

      Dude, just take this idea and write a book already!

      You have a novel (as far as I've seen) but neither dystopian or utopian view of the future.

          Of course, you still need a plot, but this alone makes the bones for a pretty good setting.

    Instant futurology:

    In forty years, we'll all be in our late 50s and early 60s. Social change on these timescales is driven more by people being born and dying off than individuals adapting to the changing times, so to a first approximation our attitude to those things will be the same it is now.

    Imagine how someone born in 1958 sees the world today. That's how you'll see the world of 2056.

    My guesses are

    * Blow-up dolls with vibrators in already exist, what more do you want from a sexbot?
    * Not much to be said on VR from a moral standpoint, unless you have strong ethical opinions about graphics cards.
    * Basic income will have had some small-scale trials. People in pubs have back-and-forth arguments as to its merits.
    * Privacy schmivacy. Your medical records and bank statements will be fine, everything else is fair game. People in pubs pinpoint the loss of privacy as the moment when this country\* went to shit.
    * I haven't seen much evidence that advertising technology is getting that much better. Adverts may be more advanced today than they were twenty years ago, but they're no more effective at getting people to actually buy stuff.
    * Changing someone's mind is a subset of advertising. Same answer.
    * Designer babies: a subject of contention and occasional protests outside clinics. Just as abortion debates were dying out, too.

  So, I got a story where a conspiracy of immortals are controlling a seed generation ship.

  Somebody from the outside(a trans-dimensional traveler) came in, disrupt the status quo, and give said generation ship a new hope, an 'out' of the situation they found themselves in. 

  As a result of the disruption, a power struggle broke out, and the good guy immortal wins over the 'bad guys', who are all corrupt and lazy. The assembly all got assassinated. 

  Now, you're in a rapidly changing society where people are starting to get a fresh look on thing, including the conspiracy theories that the guys at the top are all immortals.. Naturally this is all done in secret, and there's no proof that such a cabal exists, beyond floating conspiracy theories.

  There's a strong tradition of immortals having masks, but it's going to come unraveled sooner or later, especially since there are little in the way of propaganda, political, or secret police functions in that particular society.

  So I am thinking about how the immortals(which are the nominally the good guys) are going to survive the transition without getting killed or relegated to a jail, preferably without using EVIL methods to win.

  Here's another magic system for you all.

  Parallel to ordinary matter and energy, there are three substances which permeate most of the universe. These are Light, Radiation, and Dark.

  Light and Radiation oppose one another. Light is introduced into the universe when there is 'creation,' which is most exemplified by the process of nuclear fusion, while Radiation is introduced by 'destruction,' most exemplified by nuclear fission. They are only removed from the universe when they encounter one another. Dark, meanwhile, grows wherever there isn't Light or Radiation (iron and iron minerals tend to be rich in Dark).

  Due to an interesting sequence of events, human nervous systems are abnormally suited towards hosting both Light and Radiation, which in turn is insulated from the rest of the body by an abnormally high concentration of Dark in the rest of the body. Ordinarily, Light and Radiation are present in roughly equal amounts, which has some minor health benefits in terms of resisting poison and infection, but interestingly, it also mean that, by passing through the right mental state, a person can cultivate the Light or Radiation in their system, destroying one another and being replenished by eating, drinking, and breathing. When it reaches a certain density, it begins to push against the Dark in the rest of the body, and eventually causes the Dark to 'crack open' and fall away.

  If this process is performed by cultivating Light, this leaves the person with a bright aura of one of five colors (Red, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue), and two corresponding supernatural abilities (Heat Generation and Passion Inducement, Light (the ordinary kind) Generation and Panacea Touch, Electric Current Generation and Anti-Decay Touch, Time-Slowing and Calm Inducement, Restoration Intuition and Wound Undoing), while if it is performed with Radiation then the person gains a blinding white aura and the ability to wither or disintegrate things. Regardless of which version someone undergoes, their cast off Dark becomes a second being, who is black such as to be a three dimensional silhouette of their originator, whose default disposition towards their originator is distinctly negative, and whose action carry a sort of inertia, which makes undoing them via means that are not also Dark more difficult. For example, a ball thrown by a castoff Dark being would be more difficult to stop, unless you stopped it with something rich in Dark, like a metal bat.
