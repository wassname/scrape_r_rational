## [META] Who else wants a Weekly Thread on Thursday?

### Post:

For completeness sake, and also so there's something going on here every day to keep people coming back, I'd like to discuss some ideas for a themed thread on Thursday. I know I'm supposed to find a demand before trying to create a product, but there's no harm in discussion.

  Weekly "weekly thread creation" thread.

    ```
    There is always a poll for a new weekly thread isn't there.
    ```

  My suggestion is straight up brainstorming ideas for stories, since it's still fun to do but we (for good reason) can't make posts about it all the time. Maybe we could specifically limit it to fanfiction, undeveloped ideas, or specific elements of stories like characters and themes.

    Shameless self-promotion thread would be good (I don't write anything). Sometimes communities can seem unapproachable, and I'm always on the lookout for new stories and authors to check out. It's tough to put yourself out there, so having a way to do that and not worry about being judged harshly seems like it would have massive benefits.

      On that thread, perhaps a goals and achievements thread? It can be anything from e.g. updates on how a story you're writing is going (including self-promotion) to talking about how your C25K progress is shaping up, maybe?

    Do you participate in /r/rational Discord channel? There is a "brainstorming" thread.
    ```

      I've never used discord before so I don't know how to get it or use it.
