## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I've been thinking a lot about ancestor simulations lately, and that if we could make one accurate enough in the future we could resurrect the entire human race in the future by putting their data in a cybernetic body at the instant they died within the simulation.  Even if this isn't feasible I would love to read a story about it.

    You might enjoy the Overwatch fanfic [The World As It Appears To Be](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9402014/chapters/21285149) >!The world of the story is a simulation of history, that diverges because of a monitoring process corrupting!<

    You might also enjoy Spider Robinson's Deathkiller books, especially Lifehouse. The books are thematically related but can be read independently. >!People time travel back in time to infect all of humanity that ever lived with nanotech that backs up their memories until the moment of death, so that all of humanity can be resurrected in the far future!<.

    That takes a lot of computing power per mind, though, and may very well not be fully accurate. A much simpler solution to the problem of simulating minds that were worth simulating is to go for a more all-inclusive approach.

    Consider this:

    - Any human mind fits inside a chunk of computational hardware the size of a human head.
    - A finite number of bits worth of information can be encoded in a finite volume of space. Therefore, there are a finite - albeit extremely large - number of possible human minds.
    - A simulation will not want to simulate *all possible* human minds, because a person who is currently being subjected to the most terrible tortures for no reason is also a human mind. Therefore, there are minds that it is desirable to simulate, and minds that it is not desirable to simulate.
    - Desirability of simulation is not a binary on/off state, but rather a continuous spectrum - minds can be more or less desirable than each other to simulate.

    Therefore, consider this potential simulator.

    - First, a mathematical expression is calculated that assigns a number to how desirable a given mind is to simulate.
    - Second, hat expression is used to generate minds, in order, from the most desirable mind to simulate towards the least. (Naturally, the program never completes due to the heat death of the universe - the least desirable minds are thus never simulated).
    - Each mind is simulated for exactly one clock tick per possible sensory input - cycling over all possible sensory inputs. (It is not necessary to simulate a mind for more than a single clock tick, since the following clock tick it will be a similar but slightly different mind - which will in turn be simulated during its turn in the sequence of simulations).

    In this manner, those historical, or fictional, or even non-existent people which are most desirable to simulate can be simulated for exactly as long as they remain desirable to simulate.

  As promised / threatened, I took a lot of photos on my trip up north, and I'm sharing them with / foisting them upon you now:

  They include my excellent commentary. 

  Had a great time, except it was hot! 40 degrees + every single day (usually up to about 44 degrees). My last day was a Sunday and everything was closed so I literally grabbed lunch and then spent 3 hours in my dorm reading.

    These are great pictures! You have a habit of leaning your camera to the right out of alignment with the horizon, though.

    Thank you very much for sharing!

  I'm working on some ideas for the spooky challenge today and I'm wondering what are some examples of writing that actually spooked people in this subreddit before?

  Mine is HP Lovecraft's works and the House of Leaves.

    I get spooked pretty easily, so I might not be the best person to answer. I get too spooked to play scary games - my wife makes fun of me for having put Amnesia down after the first ten minutes (I first tried it in the dark, alone, with headphones, as suggested, but it was still too spooky playing in the living room with people around).

    As far as prose:

    * A number of [SCP](http://www.scp-wiki.net/) entries, mostly those that have mission logs and work by omission/redaction/implication. I can never remember the numbers though.
    * *John Dies at the End*, or at least the parts that aren't comedy. Helped by having originally read it late at night, when it was a web serial instead of a book.
    * Chunk Palahniuk's *Haunted*, which is a story collection. Not all of them landed for me, and it's somewhat a mix of body horror and gross out with actual spooks.
    * Seconding *House of Leaves*, though that book really benefited from me reading it while sick with a 104 degree temperature and having mild hallucinations.

  A small thing I just wrote that is too short to deserve its own post:

  [Radical Freedom](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16542038)

  It's a 200-word Matrix fanfic on the topic of 'choices'.
