    My favorite is still the one in the lower-right corner of [this post](https://i.redd.it/hwblcwfugdp01.png).

  [She folded her arms, and I noticed she was wearing a different shirt from the night before, this one with “Boning by the Bay” written on it. I was partially successful in suppressing a giggle.](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27769449)


  I had to draw this as soon as I read it.

  ```
  I guess I just pictured Amaryllis with a much larger build. She seems sort of slight for the bad ass armor-wearing sword swinging future Queen.
  ```

  - u/dellexip:
    ```
    Ohh that interpretation definitely makes sense, I may try and draw her with more mass next time. :o

      ```
      I pictured her as having Korra's build from the eponymous "Avatar: Legend of" series. Lean, well-muscled, every lesbian's dream.

  Why is Amaryllis so perfect

    Thanks!

  Is that what this character is supposed to look like? I have no idea.
  ```

  - u/dellexip:
    ```
    Well, it's my interpretation based on the descriptions of her in the story, so I guess it's as good as any other. :p

  ```
  Considering the levels of polyamory there, that shirt is not very surprising.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Wait, really? I don't remember the story ever really going into poly themes. Did I miss something?
    ```

    - u/GeeJo:
      ```
      There is the whole 'A Key For Seven Locks' quest thing going on, even if Joon's not touching it with a bargepole.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        This is true, but the story definitely treated it more with respect to harem tropes rather than actual poly relationships. And did a good job of dealing with it without being unfair to the idea of poly relationships in general - just to relationships among these characters in particular.

        Edit: correcting wording, I mean that the text does not support the idea of relationships among these various characters and Joon, except for the obvious exception.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      maybe hes talking about amaryllis being insanely hot even though joons already in love with fenn
      ```

  - u/HeartwarmingLies:
    ```
    I'm sure it has noting to do with the bone magic academy by the bay.
    ```
