  >So I guess we can try to…gradually start removing evil from the universe. Then if something goes wrong, that was probably the thing God was worried about.”

  Jesus H christ and all the the other true prophets. Euphemism. 

  So the second spell they discover gives them 20/20 eyesight, while they talk about terrible outcomes of their plans... Obvious foreshadowing to the "hindsight is 20/20" proverb is obvious, in this case "foresight is 20/20"... Euphemism!

    It occurs to me that this might be a story about a world where God's creation bootstraps itself.  I wonder what God would consider Friendly?

  ```
  The Jonah whale / Noah ark puns were extremely terrible.

  I am surprised that things appear thus far to be going as well as they are - I sort of expected the computer program thing to end in disaster really fast, and instead it seems to be either all going according to plan (or the disaster is comparatively slow and subtle).
  ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    Perhaps the computer program has become smart enough to know what it's supposed to appear to be doing?
    ```

      All that happened is that the computer got a soul. This does not mean in any way that it is self-aware. The computer didn't get general intelligence just because it got a soul.
      ```

- u/Darth_Hobbes:
  ```
  I wonder if you go on a list when you suddenly quit your job at a Name Factory after having been given a really long name. Also, are Aaron and Ana not able to just buy their own new Apple rather than involving a third party? I think it might be worth racking up a bit of credit card debt in exchange for omnipotence.
  ```

  - u/itisike:
    ```
    That kind of thing has never happened, and so nobody thought to check for it.
    ```

  - u/Aegeus:
    ```
    Probably someone checked by reciting the names that Aaron was working on before he left, but they wouldn't find anything because the name he found wasn't on that list (because of the "meh, meh, meh" bit).
    ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  Aren't they screwed as soon as Llull says a name that UNSONG has claimed? How large is the namespace?
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Depends how the listening name works. It's entirely possible the listeners will just hear a very short bleep of static because Llull is talking so fast.
    ```

    - u/lanless:
      ```
      Which, for a clever Sentinel, would be the most terrifying thing ever.
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        I now need a short story about a sentinel who heard just that and is, as you'd think, freaking the hell out. 

        (I'd write it myself but we don't know nearly enough about Sentinels yet, so I guess it's something for the backburner)
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          It started with hisses.

          "Hank," Terry said, "did you hear that?" 

          They were slowly panning the city in a black unmarked van. Hank's coffee sloshed slightly as he turned a corner - Terry had no idea why the man drank it, it wasn't like anyone would bring him in for speaking the Wakening Name - probably the taste, as odd as that sounded, Terry couldn't stand the taste himsel - *hiss*.

          "Hank," Terry said, again, "did you hear that?"

          Hank turned his head. "What, you mean *hiss* those hisses?" He shrugged, pulled up to a stoplight. "Yeah, I- there's one."

          Terry hadn't heard a hiss.

          *hiss*

          "Probably nothing," Hank said. "Tinnitus, or something."

          *hiss* *hiss*

          Terry stared out the window.

          *hiss*

          That couldn't be right. If it was right, the hisses would disappear if they started driving right now. And so it was probably noise from the radio. 

          The radio was off.

          Solar flares, Terry thought, desperately, it's solar flares directly inducing current in the speakers.

          Uriel had debugged solar flares last year.

          And Hank was hearing them at different times.

          *hiss* *hiss* *hisssisis*

          Terry turned his head and stared at Hank, and he said thus:

          "*Hank, trust me, we need to get the FUCK out of the city*"

          "-but-"

          "**DRIVE!**"

          Hank drove.

          *hiss* *hisssisis* *hisssss* *hiss*

          The sky turned black behind them, and the sun burnt red.
          ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    The first time an individual says a name, it doesn't count as a standard use; instead it tells you what it does, and nothing else.
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      Aaron spoke two new names this chapter and it didn't say he had to remove that nonstandard use.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Word of God is that saying a Name *without knowing it's a Name* gets you the vision. But if you already know it's a Name before you say it, every invocation works.
        ```

        - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
          ```
          Obvious safety feature for Llull: have it give you a fake name instead of the real one with fifty percent probability.
          ```

  - u/UltraRedSpectrum:
    ```
    They describe how the Sentinel Name works in this chapter. The agents are listening for voices they don't recognize, but the computer isn't saying anything in a way audible to the human ear. They'd hear a  very short, high-pitched whine.
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      And they could be able to track it.

      >“Whenever you use a protected Name of God,” I continued “UNSONG agents with the Sentinel Name tattooed above their ear, and the Names involve tattooed on their foreheads, can track your location. In practice they rarely do, because a million people do that every day and they don’t have a million agents or a million jail cells to put people in. But if a dozen people use all sorts of Names in the same spot every day, they know it’s a place where singers hang out and then if they’re bored then they come and raid you. This is probably what happened in Colorado.”

      >(“We have no idea who UNSONG can and can’t track,” I said in my imagination. “The Coloradans weren’t stupid enough to consistently use Names in their hideout because no one is that stupid. So something else went wrong. We could do everything by the book and all get arrested tomorrow.”)

      (Forehead then, Back now?)
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Hmm. Maybe UNSONG has klipotic transliterations of Names in a publicly accessible database? Llull would then just have to apply a klipotic transformation to the names it comes up with and match them against the database before speaking them. So long as the klipah is one where encoding =/= decoding in reverse...
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      No need for klipotics, i.e. making sure that the name still works afterwards. And they wouldn't do that if the namespace is small enough that the sweatshops of the world might happen upon an already discovered name, because computers could just apply the transliteration on all the namespace and keep what is in the list.
      ```

- u/ulyssessword:
  ```
  Well, this is a different sort of value-alignment problem.  Most of the time it's basically "how do we build something that shares human values, even after it has (figuratively) god-like powers?" while this one is "how do I ensure that *my* values become like humanity's shared values, because I will soon have (literally) god-like powers?"
  ```

- u/BT_Uytya:
  ```
  So, at the end of this chapter, we have Ana left alone with Llull running on Apple.

  *Ana* is suspiciously similar to *Eve* passed through easy (but not *so* easy as Caesar) substitution cipher. And *LLull* is similar to *Lilith*, as someone pointed in comments.

  Unfortunately, I have no idea how to get *Adam* out of *Aaron*, so it could be a coincidence.
  ```

  - u/Lord_Drol:
    ```
    Everything is interconnected, you just need to try hard enough.

    What's the difference in gematria between Aaron and Adam? I'll tell you: it's 217.

    And that is… unexpected.

    Quite literally so. 217 is the gematria of "לא צפוי", which means "unexpected".

    And indeed, you didn't expect there to be a connection, did you? Q.E.D., there's your connection.
    ```

- u/kreschnav:
  ```
  I have an idea on how to make this safer, but it's based on some assumptions that I'm not 100% sure are correct.

  1. If you don't know that something's a name, then you get the vision of what the name does and the name doesn't activate. This is true even if someone else has used the name before.

  2. If you know that something is a name, then the name activates without the vision even if it's the first time you used the name.

  Based on 1 and 2, the current system is that Llull is outputting a name without activating it, and then Aaron, knowing that it's a name, activates it without knowing what it does. This seems so obviously dangerous that I don't understand how Aaron and Ana don't see it.

  My idea is to have Llull output a list of, say, nine dud names and one real name. If Aaron reads this list, will the real name give him a vision and not activate? Does knowing that one of the names is real sufficient to activate the name without a vision?

  ```
  Wow, this whole chapter is just full of kabbalistic implications.
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    Hm. You know, I might have just come up with a crazy fan theory. Is Unsong actually—bear with me here—about kabbalah? Didn't one of the characters once mention it?

    Ah, it's probably nothing.
    ```

    - u/itisike:
      ```
      Euphemism you.
      ```
