## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Here's my attempt to make a cool magic system out of the "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" thought experiment, if the answer were NO, there wouldn't be a sound. That is, if events required observers in order to happen. 

  The key concepts in this metaphysics are *potentia*, *auctor*, and *gravitas*, which produce the *sagma* magic system. 

  **Potentia**: an event scales according to how much effect it has. e.g. A tree falling has less *potentia* than a nuke exploding, which has less than a star going nova. 

  **Auctor**: An agent capable of observing an event of any given *potentia*. e.g. The tree fell because there was an *auctor* to observe it fall. 

  **Gravitas**: the scaling quality inherent to an *auctor* which enables an event of any given *potentia* to occur. An ant has less *gravitas* than a fox, which has less *gravitas* than a human. e.g. Despite being riddled with insects, the tree only fell when a human auctor was close enough to observe its effects. 

  **Sagma**: The name given to the metaphysical system by which an *auctor* can manipulate the relationship between *potentia* and  *gravitas*. e.g. Initiate Bob expended *intrapotentia* to knock a tree down, but Wizard Dave resisted with his superior *gravitas*, and it remained upright. 

  Thoughts?

    Refrigeration is easy: put anything in an airtight box. As long as you don't smell the food going bad, it stays fresh.

    Mummification stabilizes all wounds on someone unconscious. If nobody can tell they're bleeding, they don't bleed.

    A blindfold could be armor, if the person wearing it had enough authority to cancel out other observers. "You peasants aren't authoritative enough to observe me getting hit by your arrows, and I can't see the arrows... so they don't hit me."

    I think you need extra rules about when "observation" can come into play, since otherwise a lot of basic processes - plant reproduction? seasons changing? - would get deranged. So, say that "observation" magic is optional, that it has certain triggers, it's not always active.

    Skilled fine-scale "observation" should let you really bend reality. It's like the Neo-in-Matrix rule: your belief about reality not changing inconveniently becomes truth.

    If you're a skilled enough observation-monk not to observe yourself falling in the water, you don't. You just walk on water.

    If you're an authoritative enough observation-noble not to observe people disagreeing with your orders, they don't. People just follow your orders.

    Delusion and ultimate power could become the same thing.

    To give it more solidity, I'd add rules about how you get observation-strength. Like, do you have to build up a "ideal palace," like a "memory palace," that holds your vision of how reality is supposed to work? That sort of thing. Something people have to do, to refresh their ability to make the world privilege their observations.

    But it's a cool idea, as long as it's not totally automatic everywhere.

    so this is kind of like the quantum magic of the deathgate cycle yeah?

    ...this has a number of interesting, immediate consequences.

    Firstly, things need to be observed to happen. Therefore, things that are not observed do not happen. Therefore, there needs to be a widespread system of observation - like an army of deployable observers - just to ensure that things are observed as-and-when necessary. This will have a certain impact on society;the job of being an Observer will be a low-skilled but nonetheless vital part of society.

    Second - anything can be observed. There must be some interaction between observed and non-observed places - perhaps Wizard Dave can use his gravitas to ensure that he can get a thing that he wants (say, a large lump of gold) out of an unobserved location. With the complexity of the desired object making it harder to find (a lump of gold is easier, a smartphone is *way* harder). But this ability to create things comes with a consequence... what happens if you use it to create *another observer?*

    Thirdly, is it even possible to kill the world's best Observer? Given that he never observes  timeline in which he is dead (because he would be dead), and given that his observations override anyone else's, how is it possible that his life can end (short of someone else becoming a better Observer)? (Of course, he can still be injured...)

  Random superman :

   a random person gets superman esque powers. Completely invulnerable can fly super strength etc

  After a year they lose their powers and another random person gets it.

  Thoughts?

  I was just imagining this in the last thirty years. Probably Taiwan would be conquered. Many dead celebrities/rich people 

  Revolution perhaps?

  Edit: Some random ideas for what they might do:

  Canalman - goes around building canals, like Kra canal, linking Caspian to Black Sea, linking Baikal to Aral to Caspian 

  Moonman - goes to the moon and makes a big happy face on it or something - at this scale I am not sure how long it would take for superman to do something like that

  Xnationalist man - really loves their country and tries to do whatever it needs, so if they're Chinese conquer Taiwan, can superman stop the entirety of the American nuclear arsenal? would the USA threaten that? after all they could just fly to washington and kill the president directly. how many carriers would he need to sink before the USA just let Taiwan and South China Sea go?

  doesnt do anything man - some happy person, maybe just had a kid or got married, doesnt want to do anything with their powers, for the rest of the world looks like a year has been skipped

  Fuckthesystemman - one thing this power would do would be to encourage the elites to make the lower class happier, cause there's a lot better odds of the lower class getting this power than them, and when the lower class does there is nothing anyone can do if they decide to kill every person with 1 billion+ dollars, etc. 

  Just cause I have a hammer not everything is a nail man - does something else with their powers that aren't using the force, perhaps just lets themself be tested or whatever

  Anyone have a link to a random person generator that will give me a country randomly based on population?

  I made one.

  Here is an example from the last 40 years, using 2010 population data because I'm lazy:
