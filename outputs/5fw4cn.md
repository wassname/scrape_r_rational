  Corollary: Israel is nothing.

  >Hear, **0 Israel**, ...
  ```

  - u/Blackdutchie:
    ```
    0 is real?
    ```

    - u/___ratanon___:
      ```
      It's an integer, duh!
      ```

  - u/Evan_Th:
    ```
    Alternatively, as proposed in the comment thread over there:

    > **Hear 0, Israel...**
    ```

  ```
  >“Negative infinity isn’t simple!” said Ana. “You have to put the minus sign in front of it! That’s a whole extra pen stroke!”

  >“That’s only convention,” Erica protested.

  >“SPARROWS CAN’T HAVE NEGATIVE NUMBER OF WINGS!”

  >“Aren’t religious people always talking about how the Bible is a source of **absolute values**?”

  These puns are getting physically painful.

  Does anyone else really want an UNSONG t-shirt?
  ```

  - u/oliwhail:
    ```
    I particularly want the Theodicycon 2014 shirt from this chapter, because I want all my friends to groan as hard as I did reading it.
    ```

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  It never ceases to amaze me, all the convoluted coincidences Scott manages to leverage into his Kabbalah. Bravo, sir!
  ```
