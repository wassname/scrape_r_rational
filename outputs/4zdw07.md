  ```
  This chapter finally introduces a nontrivial conflict between the Black Knight and Lady Squire. I can see the end game being him, crazed with trying to *win*, while she is only concerned with establishing a stable future for the empire and thereby Callow.

    ```
    Conflict? To me it seemed like she was completely converted to his point of view. And he didn't even ask her to *do* anything she wouldn't have done anyways, so it is unlikely to arise in the future.

    Stable future for Callow *is* the way for Black to win, since it implies that Callow broke it's pattern for being grasped, and empire broke it's pattern for grasping.

  Wow. Now THAT was a good chapter! No action, but a major reveal toward where the plot might be going.

  I really need to reread this series again from the beginning!

  ```
  Finaly a chapter worth posting here.

  So, in the end game we will have to fight Angels and the Choir.

  Some God will ahev to answer to our Villains.

  ```
  That speech was oddly inspiring. I really want to see him do it now, too.

  >Just to prove that it can be done.

  I guess only time will tell if, ultimately, his hubris will be his undoing.
