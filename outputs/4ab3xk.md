## [Recommendations] Xianxia is a good genre and you should all give it a shot if you're remotely interested in it.

  So, the thing about the xianxia genre is that it's extremely homogenized. Xianxia as a genre has basically gone through the Moloch grinder and traded off a WHOLE lot of values to pursue a weird, ruthless quality of storytelling that I don't see anywhere else. For this (and other reasons), I find the Xianxia genre really interesting, both on its own merits and partially as a case study.

  Basically, in Xianxia settings, magic is scarce. To get better at magic you need to consume large amounts of magical materials and use them to upgrade your physical form, and competition over nonrenewable magic materials leads to every practitioner being incredibly, incredibly ruthless. In Xianxia, the BASELINE for survival is to either be Mad-Eye or Quirrellmort; Harrys and Hermiones can't survive in that competitive world. A common trope is 'if you want to live happy, stay mortal. If you want to LIVE FREE no matter what, pursue magic.'

  In that sense, it's not that Xianxia isn't rational. The problem with Xianxia in the context of r/Rational is that it doesn't work like most stories. In most stories, because the author has prematurely closed off logical routes of story development due to various reasons, applying logic to those stories EXPANDS the field of development and enables more diverse stories. In Xianxia, it's the opposite; cruel logic has been applied to the extreme to create settings bereft of the human element, and making those stories more 'rational' is just a change in quantity, not quality. In other words, adding Rational elements to Xianxia doesn't diversify the scope of possible stories- it narrows it even further.

  What Xianxia as a genre needs is more personal development and diverse motivations and actual characters that are not Literally Voldemort. Seriously. Holy fuck I am so sick of reading about Xianxia 'protagonists' who in a different story would literally be the BBEG. More ruthlessness and cunning is NOT what Xianxia needs, it has WAY TOO MUCH OF THAT ALREADY.

  Edit: AND ENDINGS! Xianxia stories need to FUCKING HAVE AN ENDING! There are way too many long runners which don't have endings and just pile on dimension-rending existential enemy after dimension-rending existential enemy! "It's basically anti-spirals all the way down" is one description I've used before.

    You may enjoy the first story arc of [My Discipline Died Yet Again](https://scryatranslations.wordpress.com/my-disciple-died-yet-again/).  The main character is a female computer programmer from our world, and the typical xianxia MC is a different character whose OPness is a product of a bug in the system that the programmer needs to fix.  

    It's actually pretty good.

    What's strange to me that the current crop Xianxia seems to be so much less sophisticated story-wise than even the Wuxia stories of decades ago. Jin Yong's novels have them all beat in terms in prose, diversity of characters, and development arcs that are emotionally moving. The only thing Xianxia has going for it is turning the power level up to eleven, even if that utterly breaks worldbuilding.

      My amateur armchair anthropologist wants to ascribe it to the relatively recently-formed divide between Wuxia and Xianxia. The 'respectable' bits of chinese fantasy stayed in Wuxia, and Xianxia instead split off, transformed from a legitimate literary genre into a societal stress-relief mechanism, and lost all literary merit in the process.

  I don't think I understand. What exactly is rational about this genre? We're more enlightenment and industrial revolution than Confucian ideals and vague quasi-magical superpowers.

        Upvoting because it sounds like you did what you could, but for any commenters with a similar problem, the solution might be to make a thread on the appropriate subreddit and then post a link in the off-topic thread.

  Most Xianxia novels don't really fit /r/rational, but I would say that the one that I think is most relevant is [Transcending the Nine Heavens](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/transcending-the-nine-heavens/) primarily due to having a main character that uses brains more than brawn.

    In a similar vein is [Peerless Martial God](http://totallyinsanetranlation.com/peerless-martial-god-index/), about a reincarnated man from the modern day who uses his modern knowledge of language and politics to his own ends.

  They're not strictly rational, but ISSTH at least might appeal to a number of people here. The main character is moderately rational, and the world has a sort of alien logic to it that I've found interesting so far. I would note that it took me a few chapters to not dismiss it out of hand, but the writing isn't as weak as it initially appears. It also has a kind of unselfconscious bombast to it that I find entertaining.
