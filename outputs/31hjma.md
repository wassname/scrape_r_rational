## Rational Fullmetal Alchemist

### Post:

Here there be spoilers. 

That's right, its everyone's favorite dynamakinetics who use their amazing powers to build sculpures. How would one write this stetting for a rat!fic, or how you would munchkin it.


In the interest of avoiding the mess of mechanics that is the 2003 anime, let's stick to the manga and brotherhood.

  It's a setting that looks scientific - standard table of elements, conservation of matter and energy - but when you try to munchkin the more magical elements too hard, the godlike being (superintelligence?) that runs magic declares that would be "getting something for nothing" and levies an ironic equivalent-exchange cost.

  The dwarf-in-the-flask *is* AI.

  Sounds like an awesome setting for a rationalfic, yeah. Go nuts.

    (I'm assuming you're being sarcastic here)

    I agree that the setting has issues. The initial homunculus and the big reveal that [] (#s "you are the truth, its you") are big issues for the setting. Still, they could be related to souls being high energy identity constructs. Maybe human transmutation triggers some cosmic error code that queries the soul for a fitting punishment and also decrypts some of the admin data that they have access to.


    If you weren't being sarcastic, my apologies for misinterpreting your post.

      Oh, no! I was perfectly serious. I think FMA holds together surprisingly well under stress-testing.

        OK, I officially have no idea what the hell you're talking about.

        Time to give FMA:B a rewatch.

    I wouldn't mind the ironic cost thing so much, if Truth actually paid out what you wanted after taking his pound of flesh.

    But instead of a human resurrection we get a mutilated zombie and a homunculus.

    And there's no sign of *other* alchemy failing to give you what you asked for, so if you don't get a human resurrection then we can only assume that this is a direct result of Truth fucking with your transmutation like "AHAH! Not only do you lose body parts but you don't even get the thing you were transmuting in return! Let that be a lesson to you about trying to overcome arbitrary natural laws that I just this second made up!".

    And in my opinion, that *isn't* an equivalent exchange.

  As I mentioned in the OP, I see the setting as having dynamakinetics who, with the aid of concentration devices, can manipulate energy to reform matter.

  But, details aside can we talk about Barry's line mentioning animal souls? If thats true, then any slaughterhouse ca just mass-produce [] (#s "philosophers stones")
  ```

  - u/ThatDamnSJW:
    ```
    Presumably, animal souls are lower quality than human souls.

    I mean, if it was possible to use animal souls effectively, they wouldn't need human sacrifices.
    ```

    - u/Igigigif:
      ```
      Fine, but if animal stone aided transmutation even marginally better than unaided transmutation, then it is still viable.
      ```

  I think that if you're planning on abusing Alchemy, you need to be really clear about what it can and can't do. Most of the alchemy performed in the series was pretty basic and obvious stuff, building walls, remaking clocks, etc. At worst there was just one degree of logic you had to follow to understand the conclusion. If you're gonna go into more exotic territory, you need to be very clear about the ground rules, and don't make it too easy for the protagonists.

  Alchemy is itself a skill that is shown to be quite difficult to learn in-series, requiring years of dedicated research to really understand its principles and the composition of the world on a gut level. With just a few hundred alchemists around tops, that makes the world more consistent. If a useful application of alchemy hasn't been discovered yet, that's probably not so surprising; even low hanging fruit isn't always grabbed when there are few people to pick it. Which is a point in favor of FMA being a rational fic.

  On the other hand, I don't feel like there's a lot of logical failings that the protagonists make. They're generally on the more intelligent side.

  There is definitely potential for trying to properly exploit the FMA-verse, the obvious route is to have Edward and Alphonse not just give up on resurrection after their initial failure (after all, Edward did say while he was in the gate that they weren't wrong about their theory, they just didn't have enough knowledge). but I'm not sure if you could really incorporate that well into FMA's canon storyline.

  Exploring the afterlife in some detail might be necessary to properly put things into perspective. It's ambiguous whether FMA has an afterlife or not, but if it does, then that mostly makes taking advantage of the stone ethically impossible. Otherwise you could just transmute people on the verge of death, then use the stone to help many more people.

    My interpretation of alchemy is that:

    * the source of the energy of the "transmutation" is deeply ingrained in the processes of mastering the art. meaning that you can't just switch from geothermal energy to the strong atomic force
    * canonically the first step in alchemy was understating. To me, that seemed to be the purpose of the circles, and the reason that exposure to [] (#s "the truth lets you transmute without circles"). Any later steps relied on the definitions established in the circle, explaining why circle alchemy can create detailed and vastly varying results.
    * however, the entire process of circles is ultimately a crutch, and can be circumvented with the application of sufficient energy
    * equivalent exchange is just a poetic way of saying conservation of mass, "[] (#s "souls")" are expensive to transmute due to the energy involved and no other reason.
    * [] (#s "I'd compare 'souls' to the whatsits from deamon; extra-dimensional identity constructs. FMA 'souls' just have a ton of energy somehow.")
    * You can only alchemise constructs which you can perfectly visualize
    * you cannot manipulate matter beyond the atomic level. no making new elements [] (#s "without a p-stone"

    In my opinion, the biggest missed opportunity in the series is Al's armor. Why does it have to be human-shaped? Why does the core have to be so unprotected? But I wasn't talking about the events of the series, so much as the setting.

    I'd say that there is no (detectable) afterlife in fma (remember this isn't the 2003 anime). the issue with transmuting people on the verge of death is that their minds are perfectly and dynamically preserved using the resulting stone would be literally killing them.
    ```

    - u/RolandsVaria:
      ```
      --If the core of the understanding is just in the circles, that would make it rather easy to figure out a very large variety of alchemic possibilities. There must be more to it than just that, don't you think?

      --It is kinda quirky that the amount of alchemy a soul can do seriously gives you a value for a human soul. A human soul is worth "X" amount of alchemy. You could actually find that out, if you aren't morally concerned.

      --If there's one thing that struck as more on the illogical side about the series, it's that a number of alchemists seemed to take "equivalent exchange" to be some sort of life principle, rather than just a rule of alchemy. I get how being so dedicated to a scientific principle could make you start seeing patterns like that in life, but life simply does not run on equivalent exchange.

      --Alphonse's armor is curious. I can accept that you could bind a soul to something with alchemy, but that doesn't explain how it moves or talks. I presume it's just dramatic license in that regard. I do like that they established that it was both extremely difficult to pull off and not an immortal form, otherwise people would be all over that.

      --Souls are also very strange things. Except for Alchemy and the Homunculi (which just seem to have random superpowers somehow), the world of FMA largely seems to operate on real life principles. So exploring the nature of the soul would be fruitful.

      --But even if a soul is perfectly preserved as a philosopher's stone, they're basically imprisoned, unable to do anything (since apparently souls inside of Philosopher's stones can't move on their own for some reason, unlike the armor). It's kind of a fate worse than death. There'd be little point to keeping them alive at that point, so the dilemma still stands.

        ```
        * You would still need to know how exactly to parse the symbols and their meanings, but yeah, the only limiting factors with alchemy are energy and knowledge. I does explain Ed's knowledge of the periodic table and inzumi's approach to training
        * You're getting distracted by the word value. A soul is worth some amount of energy (which may not be constant), but you have no way of knowing how much energy it takes to do a thing in alchemy, so that knowledge isn't terribly useful.
        * totally agree with you on that point
        * you misunderstood me, I'm asking why Al doesn't alter his armor, not why others don't do it. By worm standard self-propagating ferro-kenisis is ridiculously OP
        * Well, Greed just has a pair of preset transmutations he an run at will (regen and armor) Gluttony operates on the same vague mechanics of the gate of truth. Envy just has very detailed self-transmutation. Sloth has optimized regen, and lust could have a reason behind her spear. Wrath and Pride are complete bullshit though.
        * If they stay sane and are isolated from other souls, it seems that they can act, just look at [massive spoiler] (#s "Hoenhim's scattered stones doing the reverse transmutation in the big finish")
        ```

        - u/RolandsVaria:
          ```
          --Yes, the limits are energy and knowledge. But what I'm saying is you should need far, far more than just knowledge of how to make a corresponding circle in order to work a transfiguration. Otherwise Alchemy wouldn't be so difficult.

          --I know. I'm just saying, in most stories the soul has incomparable value, but in the Fullmetal Alchemist world, a soul can be equated to a certain (and very much finite) amount of energy.

          --Even ignoring Wrath and Pride, a normal human can't do what the Homunculi can, no matter how great their alchemy. Especially since human transmutation automatically brings you to the gate. It's clear that the Dwarf in the Flask and all its spawn work with different rules from everyone else.

          --Well, if you put several souls together they fall apart into a maelstrom of chaos and quickly lose all individual thought. The people in that particular stone could only be made to act again because much time was spent bringing their consciousness back to the surface.

          Still, if it's just one person to a stone I could see them maintaining their personality. Of course their ability to do most things would be shot, due to being a stone that can probably barely move. All the same, that should be an effective means of preserving someone if you want to, there's certainly merit to it. So then it's not a matter of making stones to use for helping others, but that making stones is desirable in and of itself.

            ```
            * I think we might have different definitions of difficult; To a semi-experienced alchemist, preforming a new transmutation is not difficult. Becoming a semi-experienced alchemist is the challenge. Given that alchemy is portrayed as a science, it would be unsurprising to find out that sufficient knowledge of chemistry, physics, alchemic theory, and alchemic symbology is all that is required to do alchemy. Yes, it does fall flat from a narrative standpoint, but that's not the point I'm arguing.
            * That's right, don't forget that this isn't a soul in the traditional qualia scene, but an extant, physical thing.
            * We know that  there are ways to brush up against the taboo. Mustang transmuted a human corpse, and medical alchemy is a thing. One might argue that the taboo isn't so much "human transmutation" as "soul generation". That way the homunculi pull a kubey and just keep their selves (and accompanying maton limits) in their cores. That leaves their bodies transmutable.
            ```

            - u/RolandsVaria:
              ```
              --But if that were the case, you'd expect Alchemists to know all sorts of transmutations. Yet we see several alchemists (Mustang and Kimbley are the most obvious, but there are others) who only seem capable of one variety of transmutation. If learning different transmutations just took learning how to inscribe a circle, you wouldn't expect that to be the case. You'd also expect a lot of theft and hoarding of alchemical research. This does not seem like a particularly good development.
              ```

              - u/Igigigif:
                ```
                Let's not forget that most of the alchemists we see practice are using alchemy for combat. Knowing how to do other transmutations and using them effectively in combat are very different. Plus, some transmissions are better than others. Mustang uses fire because he is literally the only one able to do that. Armstrong uses an extremely refined muti-purpose circle. As for Kimberly, my headcannon is that beyond basic alchemy, he only has his explosives reaction. He's not terribly bright academically, but is an incredibly component combatant.
                Moreover, who's to say that independent researcher don't hoard developments?  Master Hawkeye took his gaseous transmutation secrets with him to the grave, and the elric brothers aren't even surprised that Inzumi never taught them circle-less transmutation. And lets not forget that **all** alchemical notes are, as a rule, encrypted. Is that sad, yes, but also believable.
                ```

                - u/RolandsVaria:
                  ```
                  Yes, the combat focus and reluctance to share research does seem to be a big bottleneck on actually getting anything done with Alchemy. But still, if all you needed were alchemical diagrams, you'd think more people would have caught on to more varieties of alchemy more quickly. I just don't get why you think the circle itself is so important. Yes, you need certain alchemical diagrams to do certain transmutations, but thinking that just getting the circle does the lion's share of the work for you just makes the FMA-verse woefully underoptimized when it would be so easy to change that. I said at the start, making things easier for no reason, when what you're getting at doesn't much bear out in canon, seems silly.

                  ```
                  Alchemy is kept so guarded in FMA because it's dangerous. Really dangerous, more so than anything we have in really life. If you remember the scenes of the Ishval war, Mustang is shown destroying enormous areas (what appears to be entire neighbourhoods) instantaneously with no chance of injury to himself, and is said to have lain waste to cities in a day, which puts his destructive capabilities at or beyond nuclear weapons.

                  There's a good reason you wouldn't want how to do that to become common knowledge, and it's also the reason (as I've stated before) that alchemists are used as weapons instead of in R&D - there's no weapon you can make in 1914 that's going to be nearly as powerful as a man who can destroy a city with a snap of his fingers.

      * The source of the energy for Alchemy is a massive reservoir of souls/p. stone under Central, and the source of Alkestry is some kind of pervasive chi/lifeforce field. I'm not sure it's possible to power transmutation with energy sources from standard physics, despite Father's lies.  
      * They still have to make a circle, but they can use their own body for it, hence the clapping.  
      * I don't see why you couldn't engage in the classic transmutation of lead into gold, beyond the whole "understanding" stage being perhaps rather difficult without many years of R&D.  
      Since Amestris is an aggressive, genocidal military dictatorship ruled from the shadows by an eldritch abomination and his twisted progeny, with it's elite forces and brightest minds powered by tormented souls…I think I'd like Winry to be the protagonist, and we can explore the oft-overshadowed human-machine interface technology that is automail.

      - u/Igigigif:

        Alchemy being powered by father's stone is debatable at best. The assumption made in the series is that father can use his stone to obstruct the alchemical prosses. Alchemy continues to function after he dies is fairly strong evidence for genuine geothermal energy.

        On the other hand, a philosopher's stone lets you ignore circles and Scar's brother's alchemy discards them altogether.

        There are no canonical elemental transmutations, and it seems like its impossible, especially given that there is no indication that subatomic particles are known.

  "Ed, tell me more about alchemy. I've heard you say equivalent exchange a lot. But then you do things like throw up walls from nowhere, right when you need them, and clearly a wall you really need right now is worth more than whatever was there before and not saving your life."

  "Well, Winry, it's kind of complicated. When you cook food, the food is better than the potatoes, raw chicken, and the fuel for the fire, but some of that comes from your skill. You've invested a portion of your life, that time is gone and paid, to learn knowledge about how to cook, what work to perform. For an alchemist, transmutations circles are kind of the same way. We burn away our lives in advance, studying, to learn specific tricks that may or may not be useful in certain situations. That time is gone from our clocks. It's spent, and irreplaceable. Each of the circles we learn to make perform a specific trick. We specialize, because nobody has time to learn every trick, and if everyone tried to learn all the simple tricks we'd run out of time to live before even making a dent. So we forge a path. Mustang studied for a very long time to learn to transmute against chemical stability, to split the air and water, to make oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen! Holy balls, free monatomic nitrogen. To shape the effect. That circle is on his glove. It's a seven hundred layer lattice he had to etch with individual threads of silk... That's way beyond my skill. I can't even strip wood into its component atoms and make soil from it. But I can make sugar from it."

  ```
  Well if you're protagonist has seen truth, have them get put a circle on the bottom of their boots, people who have attempted human transmutation still need a circle they can just visualize the filling (that's what the clap is). A small metal ring in the heel of his shoes would give him essentially spontaneous transmutation.
  ```

- u/Bobertus:
  ```
  In one of the early episodes of the 2003 anime (and probably he magna/brotherhood, too), Ed gives this speech about how he is a scientist, so Ed definitely thinks of himself as what we would call a rationalist. One could play that up. Though I wouldn't like it so much if they were to literally speak about 'rationality', that's too much like a religious tract. The world also fits very well with writing about science, philosophy and the people and institutions that do them, a bit like Anathem (the book by Neal Stephenson).
