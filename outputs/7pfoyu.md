  So, Hayate was under a genjutsu to think he was a shadow clone instead of the original. Now the question we should be asking is, was the genjutsu just to switch the original and shadow clone, or was his first use of shadow clone part of the illusion and he never actually got to warn the guard post?

  In one of the possibilities, Konoha will at least know that there was a suspect moving around, and it looked like they came from the area Sand is staying. In the other possibility, no one knows this.

  Or the direction the figure was coming from was *also* part of the genjutsu, and they were trying to pin this on Sand. (Once you know the perspective character has been in a genjutsu, you have to question *everything* about that scene. Anything could have been part of the illusion. We don't know when it was first cast.)

    Nice! I was wondering if I made that one too subtle. Then again, you're the first to point it out, so maybe I did?

    Well, I shouldn't spoil too much by confirming or denying anything. Next chapter will provide more answers, maybe. Or raise more questions :)

    Also, I demand credit for coming up with chapter titles that fit each of the scenes involved: Chiyo being delusional regarding Sasori, Hinata being put under a genjutsu and having to make her choice, and Hayate being fooled along with his 'dilemmas are for civilians' bit. It's something I do to try and tie the scenes together, but nobody ever notices my cleverness :P

    I honestly cant tell when the genjutsu was cast. Was it when he saw Yugao? Or it was possibly while looking at the moon, but then the Moon's Eye plan would be complete and there'd be no need to kill Hayate because everyone would fall under its sway. Fuck, I am so not clever.

      Ok, I think I can reveal this one, because it's not a very important plotpoint. I intended for it to happen at this moment: 

      >The world shimmered around him, and then he was watching himself vanish in the direction of the nearest watch post. 

      In other words, at the same time as he cast the Shadow Clone technique, to cover up any incongruity that he might otherwise have noticed. 

      Originally I wrote this story under the rule that the narrator never lies, so you could tell if the viewpoint character was under genjutsu because it would say for example "he remembered seeing" instead of "he saw". I ended up dropping that rule in favour of getting into the character's heads more, but I still use this trick to drop hints here and there.

        Thank you. Now that you've explained it it seems so obvious.

  Typos

  > They soon arrived at guesthouse and entered into the luxuriously appointed chamber

  at guesthouse -> at the guesthouse

  ----
  > No sooner did he catch the enemyâ€™s scent or he cast the transformation technique

  scent or he -> scent as he
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    >at guesthouse -> at the guesthouse

    Whoops! Corrected.

    >scent or he -> scent as he

    Ack, I keep doing that! My subconscious keeps telling me that it should be "no sooner or" because "No sooner than" feels ugly, but it's probably just because it's a habit by now...

    Anyway, thanks for the corrections!
