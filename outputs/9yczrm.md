  What is this and why is it worth reading?

    In a world with superpowered individuals as either heroes or villains, with a great deal of governmental oversight of powered individuals, one man, Hector, maintains a clandestine existance as a normal IT guy alongside a secret existence as 'Delphic', an identity which claims to be a superhero who has uploaded himself to the internet and who provides mercenary services for the government via amazing surveillance and hacking capabilities.  In actuality, Hector is just a powered human whose power is to be able to remotely view locations, including the past, and he is using the Delphic identity as a cover alongside talented hacking capabilities.

    The story follows Hector's interactions with US and Canadian supers, many with their own agendas, the government's attempts to control 'Delphic', interactions with a potential mad scientist super-villain, and Hector's home life in something of a slice of life series, while he attempts to maintain his secret.

    This is a superhero story, but very different from other superhero stories posted here such as Worm.

    The main character is intelligent, relatable, and very human. He relies on the support of family and friends. He has blind spots, like any real person, but tries to overcome them. Unlike most protagonists, he has the need, ability, and inclination to cook and feed himself.

    The world is a reasonable picture of modern life with supers, not some desolate wasteland full of starving wretches. There are no laughably evil villains, and the good guys are just as complex.

    I'd say the best thing about this story is how each character seems like a real person, with real emotions. While you might not get the whole picture, you get the sense that they grew up somewhere, that they have a history that shaped who they are today.
