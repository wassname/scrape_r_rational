  Seems like they rebuilt Hogwarts pretty fast. Did you forget it was nuked in Following the Phoenix? Ignotus did talk about rebuilding it, but it's been less than 6 months since it was destroyed.

    Ermmm...no. There's absolutely zero chance that I would forget something that significant. *cough*. Um...look! Shiny object!

    Yes, Ignotus gave them the spells and then Dumbledore and a whole bunch of other very powerful wizards did the swishy-flicky thing and boom! Rebuilt school. That's my story (literally!) and I'm sticking to it. 

    Although, in fairness, once you have the spells it shouldn't be time consuming. IIRC, the founders raised Hogwarts either overnight or over a weekend, I forget which. I refuse to believe that there are no other wizards in the world as powerful as Dumbledore, and there's plenty of money available to hire them -- I guarantee the Ministry would shell out, and plenty of noble families would as well.

      Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

      In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

      Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

      “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

      The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

      Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

      Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

      L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

        Seems like it might well happen now that the spells are known. Widely known, too, since it required about twenty wizards to match the power of the original Founders, and they came from all over the world.

        None of which was canon, but now it is because I just said it.

        > Fair enough. So why hasn't anyone opened a Yogworts just across the street? You know, the knockoff, state funded, Korean-run franchise magical educational center, with half-priced admission and 100% fewer Death Eaters on the board of directors (and enrolled)? Muggleborn and poor-as-dirt blood traitors would fucking flock to that obvious hole in the market.

        Because they are *British*, and that means there are *ways things are done*, and they do them that way, and no way else.  You are asking this because you think like an *American* ;-).

  So Hogwarts, one of the most impressive magical constructs in Britain, was rebuilt after a few months even though the founders were supposedly more powerful than any wizard now living and it even includes the room of requirement which very few knew existed and as far as we know nobody knew how it worked.

  Your son comes in with a magical firebird and your first reaction is to make a joke and calmly consider that it probably has something to do with the wizards? What happened to the mission that the phoenix is supposed to take you on when you first get it? And then your second question is what the boy named it? And then he finds out it's sentient and wants to uplift humanity and your though is something along the lines of "neat, I should help."? **Wait, what?!**

  Why don't the researchers recognize Harry when they see him? This is the biggest historical event of these researchers lives, magic has been confirmed to be real and an entire shadow government has been discovered and not only was it close to declare war on Britain but nukes went of in Scotland! During the past few months this would be the only thing they talked about on all news channels, in all newspapers and all research communities and the face of Harry Potter would be on everything.

  These things just took me completely out of the story as it doesn't make any sense unless the magical equivalents to the Hogwarts blueprints were somehow discovered, Nancy and Fred are hermits or work with government work that require them to lock themselves into a vault without outside contact and Joel's father is insane or confounded.

    > Word of God says Felix Felicis doesn't exist in HPMoR. Is that an intentional change?

    I looked around to see if it was in or not, and the only thing that I found that seemed to speak to it was [this post](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=722rasd1fu9p8mn5fdcbp572&page=158#3934) in which Eliezer said "If it exists".  I checked in with hezzel to see if it was in FtP; she didn't have an opinion either way and didn't know any more about HPMOR canonicity than I did, so I decided it was a thing.

    > Also, Harry appeared on Muggle television in Following the Phoenix as leading negotiations with the magical world. He would be instantly recognised by the researchers.

    They're both American.  Our reporting doesn't cover the rest of the world very well, and not all of us actually watch the news.

        Oh well. Looks like the fan3fic differs from the fanfic. I was planning on nerfing it pretty hard anyway.

  Oh Harry.  You're so funny when you try to badass boast while almost going dark.  I mean, the problem is, *you're not the one with a phoenix*.
