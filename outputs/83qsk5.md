## Fantasy Interstellar Empire at War with Great Man of History Theory Turned Up to 11 [Munchkin this Setting]

### Post:

So I had a thought for a setting that might be interesting to consider. I don't usually go for design-a-specific-setting posts, but I thought this one might be interesting for /r/rational to try and munchkin. The idea sort of grew out of what I know of Nanoha, except I've never actually watched Nanoha so it probably doesn't look much like this. The main points are:

* An empire stretching across a thousand or more planets

* An enemy that represents a serious existential threat to the empire, with no hope of reconciliation or integration - it's a fight to the death. For the sake of conversational consistency, say they're legions of demons invading from Hell destroying entire planets.

* An incredibly low incidence rate for high-level mages/fighters -a few dozen in the entire empire at the top-end (we'll call them "Champions" here, again for conversational consistency), each capable of winning battles not involving other Champions or a similar level of force single-handedly

* A much higher incidence rate for much weaker mages/fighters - an asymptotic relationship between power and commonality perhaps, such that cannon fodder is plenty, but only really serves to try and tip the scales aiding stronger fighters, or if none are available desperately hold the line until one can come or at least slow the enemy's advance


What would the structure of such an Empire look like? Would the Champions be ruling the Empire through an inability to meaningfully oppose them, or would their being absolutely vital to the war effort and inability to leave the front lines prevent this? What would an interstellar army/navy based around supporting a few key individuals look like? How would they prioritise and plan a war where a fully inhabited planet is worth less than a single Champion, unless one of those people also happens to be a nascent Champion themselves? What would a society look like where people are told they can't ever be as important as these few heroes, but are still a non-negligible factor in supporting them when taken as a whole?

And most importantly, what innovations would you implement to try and squeeze out those extra few fractions of a percent of probability of winning the war and saving the empire/human race?

  The thing about people with that staggering level of personal power is that they pretty much do what they want. If the empire still exists, it means that a fine-tuned propaganda machine is making sure that most Champions are holding the front lines... But if a few decide they'd much rather seize political power, nobody's going to be able to stop them. As a result, you've probably got a Champion aristocracy that desperately pushes the message of how it's incredibly noble and glorious and inspiring to go fight the Demon menace, especially Champions, not them, no, don't you see how it's just as important that they remain back here, organizing the war effort? And they probably believe it, too, even if a regular Joe could do just as well with training.

    A sadly possible state of affairs, though if the enemy was sufficiently strong enough that not having every Champion on the front lines meant the probable defeat/extermination of the empire, do you think they'd all stay out fighting out of necessity, or would a few seize power anyway, to rule over the collapse and death of their people? I suppose it would depend on the sort of people the Champions are...
    ```

    - u/None:

      Very much so... But if it's a close enough thing that one Champion is the difference between destruction and survival, then I think it more likely that things would reach an equilibrium, with the Empire retreating and ceding volume until the remaining Champions were enough to defend what remained, probably with a volitile oscillating border region where Champions and Demons batter back and forth, mostly just trying to avoid losing any further systems.
      ```

    I think one way to stabilise this would be if the Champions had a weakness, or a need, that can be satisfied only by the rest of the Empire. Think of something like Navigators from Dune, that need a constant flow of Spice. There could be a resource whose extraction depends on the Empire, and without that their magic runs out. In that situation they'd be more compelled to cooperate. In peaceful times they'd probably start their own internal feuds over who gets to rule the others, but a common enemy might just be the thing to unite them.

  The thought I had that made me come see what you guys made of this was the idea of Orbital Drop Shock Healers/Medics being deployed en masse into a battlefield to attempt to stabilise/extract a wounded Champion, as their lives are worth so much less than a single top-tier fighter. Or those same healers being deployed into city where a wounded Champion is, and just going straight through buildings and infrastructure on the basis that the tiny chance those seconds saved matter is more valuable than the cost of repairing those buildings.

  The absurdity of a setting where this was considered not only possible but obviously a good idea appealed to me, and inspired me to post since you could probably come up with some other fairly wacky concepts based around such extreme scales of value (that's probably not the right description, but I'm struggling to come up with a better one.)

    Exactly how many champions are we talking about here? Hundreds? Thousands? Less than 50?

    Also, I would recommend that you read To the Stars.

    >In the latter half of the 25th century, humanity finds itself locked in total war against alien invaders.
    >The Cephalopods attacked without warning and for no discernible reason. Their weapons have a significant technological edge over humans, and the science with which they build their wormhole generators to spread into human space is inconceivable to humanity's most brilliant minds and AIs. The only hope for turning the battle in humanity's favor lies within its aloof allies: the enigmatic Incubators, and the direct consequences of their meddling into human affairs: nigh-invulnerable augmented superhumans able to bend the rules of causality itself.
    >They are known as... magical girls.

      >a few dozen in the entire empire at the top-end

      Less than 50, though I could probably have made that stand out more, since it's arguably the point the entire setting/thought experiment hinges on. I'll edit it for clarity.

      I am indeed reading To The Stars. I very much enjoy it and I can see the similarities, though that doesn't have quite the level of "entire worlds are sacrificed rather than expose this one mage to unacceptable levels of risk" levels of absurdity I'm looking for here.

  Need more detail to this Empire.  What method of communication and FTL does it use?  How long has it existed?  Is the Emperor/Empress also a Champion?  How is leadership determined... is it by bloodline, whoever can seize power, whoever the mightiest Champion is?  Is the leader actually in control or just a figurehead?

  Knowing these details helps set up a baseline by which you can develop their enemies.  For instance, if your Empire has some Star Trek/Star Wars style of FTL (where ships have a vastly reduced travel time that can go almost anywhere if they spend time plotting a course), and their 'existential enemies' have another kind (say, rolling with the "Demon" thing, they don't really use FTL so much as open gateways through which their troops move), you can set up the threat that way and give each side different advantages and disadvantages.

  How do the Champions "level up" and what is the reasoning behind such limited numbers?  Does the power come from an outside source that grants it?  Is it based on some simple, yet horrific method--ie: each person you kill grants you a tiny piece of their power, thus encouraging the tabletop murderhobo mentality to slaughter as many things as possible to raise in levels?  Is it a Highlander thing where each time a Champion kills another they gain their power, and at some point that power was once spread out over a larger population but is slowly coalescing into one great uber-being?

  >What would the structure of such an Empire look like?

    That's why we need details, as above.

  >Would the Champions be ruling the Empire through an inability to meaningfully oppose them, or would their being absolutely vital to the war effort and inability to leave the front lines prevent this? 

    Again, as above.  Is a Champion the Emperor/Empress?  Or is there some system of controlling them, whether concrete (some magic or tech item or power that enforces obedience) or abstract (a warrior code like *bushido* that ensures they have no desire or time to bother with ruling).

  >What would an interstellar army/navy based around supporting a few key individuals look like?

    This one's easy.  Basically the "typical" sci-fi nation's interstellar navy.  The Empire, assuming it uses ships with FTL, will still need non-military ships like Freighters, Tankers, and Transports to haul all its men and material around, trade allowing worlds to flourish where they normally lack certain materials needed for survival (mining world needs food, industry world needs resources, farming world needs goods--miniature "triangular trade").  Because of this, there will need to be many military and police vessels.
    The influence of the Champions depends on how well they function in space.  Can they grant powers or be a power source for their ships?  Can one high-level fighter leap from vessel to vessel across kilometers of void whilst cutting half-mile long starships in twain with a slice of his massive space-katana?  Or are they more like Super-Marines whose job is to inject themselves into enemy flagships and neutralize them.

    Chances are, they'd have specific ships made just for them, with the vessel itself conforming to their style.  Mage Ships would likely be large, complicated things with massive "thaumic sails" that gather standing magical energy like a solar sail but direct it toward the center Sanctum of the craft for the Mage to cast massively oversized spells from all the focused mana.  A high-level fighter's "ship" would be either some massively overarmored vessel that can soak up tons of damage so he can deploy into the middle of the enemy fleet and start breaking things--or just have it drop from orbit (perhaps with some adamantium-style 'base plate') and crush an enemy army whilst producing an "instant fortress" on the enemy's world... or it could be more of a giant mecha rather than a 'ship' allowing him to use his skills on a much grander scale.

  >How would they prioritise and plan a war where a fully inhabited planet is worth less than a single Champion, unless one of those people also happens to be a nascent Champion themselves?

    Define "fully inhabited".  How is that measured?  Is it enough for its main industry to reach a certain level?  X millions or billions of people dependent on size?

  > And most importantly, what innovations would you implement to try and squeeze out those extra few fractions of a percent of probability of winning the war and saving the empire/human race?

    The most obvious would be determining the basis of the Enemy's own "Champion" system, if it exists, or a Pacific Rim-style possibility of assembling a team of powerful Champions to raid the Enemy's own home territory and stop them at the source.

  Ooh, this reminds me of something else, actually - the xianxia-derived world of Cradle, by Will Wight. It's a super hierarchical society based on practicing the paths of the sacred arts. Each level is exponentially stronger than the last one, and exponentially more difficult to reach. As an example, one of the plots has a bunch of fantastically powerful forest sects politically maneuvering around each other, trying to squeeze a motherlode of magical resources dry as quickly as they can. Why? Because they're level n at highest, and there are vague rumors that a level n+1 will appear and take everything. The only society is really kept in check because a level n+2 has seized the position of Emperor and wrangles the otherwise impossibly powerful level n+1 leaders of the local branches of clans into fighting against terrible, terrible threats. The only reason the whole thing is even stable is because of benevolence from those at even higher levels stepping in occasionally, and even at the highest of levels, there's a constant battle against chaos that's constantly on the edge of being lost.

  Well. Have you heard of [Warhammer 40,000](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Warhammer_40k_Wiki)? Because what you've just described is - not exactly, but to some significant extent - the [Imperium of Man](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Imperium_of_Man)(where the [Primarchs](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Primarch) would be analogous to your Champions).

  First, I imagine the political system would look very feudal. There would be a head champion (king) who rules the empire, with the rest of the champions acting as lords who check the kings power (constitutional monarchy). A government composed of regular people would have no way to make champions follow them. Arguments for morality and responsibility only go so far. With great power comes great responsibility, however. This ruling class would go to war frequently, and fighting and winning against demons would be the main source of prestige. 

  Militarily, I imagine that the Champions would focus on mobility. There are very few of them and a large area to cover. To compensate, the champions would travel around in groups launching decisive strikes and then redeploying elsewhere. Spreading the champions too thin drastically increases the risk that they will get caught and killed. By fighting in groups, they will be able to cover each other and retreat if necessary. 

  Finally, the empire would focus a lot of effort into producing more champions. The way someone becomes a champion is not specified, but however it occurs it would be encouraged. If being a champion is genetic, we would see extensive obligations from the family of champions. Arranged marriages designed to produce champion heirs would be common. If being a champion is decided randomly at birth, we would see a massive empire wide fertility program. More babies would increase the chances of getting a new champion. If champions are made through learning and skill, we would see massive investments in public education, and the formation of battle schools (like Ender's Game).

  About squeezing your chances... I would try to increase the total amount of Champions. 

  I guess the easy option of cloning wouldn't work, but I would create a system to track the development of every person in the empire, and try to learn which factors cause more Champions to appear. Experiment with those factors to prove the hypotesis, and implement it on a large scale when proven.

  ```
  Any spacefaring yet planet-focused society is fundamentally anachronistic. "A thousand worlds" sounds like a lot until you realize that they're using about 0.0003% of their available resources, and that's only if you very charitably count the interior of the used planets, even though it's mostly used for nothing but bending space to make down.

  The obvious play is to rkv all champions in support of the demons from hell in their anti-imperialist struggle.
