    But she just wants to get back to her aristocratic family and restore their fortune built on centuries of violent oppression of the underclass!

    Okay, she's willing to kill people and manipulate a girl who was nothing but kind to her to achieve that goal, but it's okay because she hates herself and the people she's killing are mostly disgruntled members of said underclass anyway! It's not *her* fault they refuse to see that the aristocracy that has manipulated them and mind-raped them for centuries has only done that for their own good!

  > A tall woman, the white phosphorus man, the two Hiras, and Ana sat next to me on the crimson beach.  Another man leaned against the cliff, with his hands bound and a bag thrown over his head.

  How the hell did Ana survive? Last chapter Clementine was about to slit her throat.

  > “We lost three people,” said the man.  “I knew two of them.  Don’t be a prick.”

  That remark aside, they're all pretty chill about this.

  They just lost of a third of their squad, and came pretty close to getting all killed. Ana and Wes almost getting killed makes sense, because they're amateurs taking on trained terrorists, but the Rose Titan is an experienced special force operator. There's no way she could take these kinds of losses on a regular basis and still be alive by now.

  > “You did good, Queen Sulphur,” said the Rose Titan, patting me and Hira on the backs.  “All of you, well done.  I’ll talk to the major, see if I can get you raises.”

  How much *are* they getting paid?

  Because they just took on an entire terrorist base by themselves, facing three supers plus a small army of normals, with prolonged torture on the line if they got captured.

  Keep in mind that was a critical operation, that could trigger a foreign invasion if something went wrong. And yet Major Brin acts like it would be a waste of resources to give Ana, one of the key resources of said operation, a body that isn't in the process of decomposing.

  My point is, I'm pretty sure Ana is getting exploited here.

  > “I don’t want their handouts,” said Ana in a flat voice.  “Or their pity.”  She stared at me, clenching her teeth.  “I’m not going to manipulate good people to squeeze what I want out of them.”

  See, this is the exact opposite of the mentality you should have in this type of work environment.

  > I sighed.  The Elmidde Chronicle, my family’s newspaper, cared about integrity.  Stewardship.  Morality.  If people read it more instead of Afzal Kahlin’s manipulative whaleshit, none of this would be happening.

  It's cute that you believe that.

  And by cute, I mean disgusting.

  > Left-Hira nodded, sipping from a chocolate ice cream float.  

  > Hira stuck his hands in his pockets.  He’s using his Vocation.  “If he joined us, he might still betray us or defect to our enemies.”

  Shouldn't this be "she"? I'm pretty sure this is girl-Hira in this scene ("left is a lady"); it could be that Wes thinks of Hira as a guy regardless of body, but still, it's a little confusing here.

  > “Acceptable,” said Professor Brin.  “But you’re responsible for him.  If something goes wrong, it’s on you.”  His voice tightened.  “And if he goes rogue, I will put him down.”

  I'm not sure of the logic here.

  If it's not safe to keep this guy even in a maximum security prison, then it's even less safe to let him live on his own? Also, it's a little weird how Brin keeps accepting completely random, untested people into his spec ops squad that specifically does jobs he cannot afford to be linked to, without giving said people any training or even basic psychology checks to make sure they won't crack at the next mission.

  > “I don’t accept your apology,” Ana said.  Her expression didn’t change. “You might still be fooling yourself, but I know exactly who you are, Weston Ebbridge.”

  Ana may have terrible salary negotiation skills, but she's not an idiot.

  > The Shenti War had only ended around a decade ago, but they still felt like a mythical enemy, an ancient nightmare brought to life by the Black Tortoise that brought the world to its knees.  A foreign government on the other side of the ocean, responsible for the largest war in history, was trying to take over the country.

  Little aside about the Shenti War.

  It's interesting that Pith does the exact opposite of most fantasy stories with its setting: it makes it very immediate.

  Most stories have a super-important background war that happened A Thousand Years Ago (or an empire that's a thousand years old, etc), even though it doesn't make sense. Eg in western culture, a thousand years ago takes you before America as a country, before the French Revolution, before the Hundred Years war, and before most European countries had anything close to the shape we know today. The idea that the political landscape could stay remotely the same over that kind of timespan is ridiculous.

  Pith does something interesting, and makes all the relevant events extremely recent instead; to a point it feels a little jarring at times.

  Like, the Shenti War is a decade old. To put it in perspective, "a decade old" takes you to the beginning of the Syrian Civil War (2011); 9/11 is two decades old. Yet the characters talk about the Shenti War like it's a backstory element, like we talk about WWII. It doesn't feel like something the country is *actively recovering from*. When Wes talks about the war, she talks about her mother's recollection of it, and not, say, her own childhood memories.

  There are a lot of other elements that feel like they've been around for longer than 10 years. People learning about the Masquerade. Democratic institutions. Non-state-controlled media.

  Ana talks about the Paragons like Taylor Hebert talks about the Protectorate; like they're an institution she grew up hearing about, and not like a desperate spin-control by the establishment to keep its superpowered enforcers that would have been announced around the time she was 15 and her new body started breaking down.

  I'm not sure whether this is a problem. It's not too jarring, and the worldbuilding is mostly coherent. I think it would fit a lot better if most important event were moved back 10-20 years (so the 20-yo characters maybe remember hearing about them as a kid, but mostly grew up with the new status quo); but that might break other parts of the timeline.

    I get the sense that Brin casts a pretty wide net, and most of the mercs he hires don't survive more than a mission or two. He'll pick a nobody that shows promise and toss them at a situation or two that they can't really make *worse* (like the Honeypot thing), then once they prove themselves over time they get trusted with more and more sensitive situations. If he does it right, the damage they can do is pretty limited. His assets don't actually know much, beyond the fact that he hired them and what they would need to know for their missions, and none of them are really in a position to be going public with their knowledge.

    Regarding the worldbuilding, I tend to agree with you. I quite like that we're looking at things in a time of upheaval, but the timeline doesn't quite make sense for how people relate to a lot of institutions and concepts. Hell, I'm not sure the timeline makes sense at all. Projectors were forced to go public 13 years ago, Ana's been wearing her shitty body for 11 of those years. 2 years seems like a *very* short amount of time for something as drastic as changing bodies to become such a ubiquitous concept that even the poorest in society are taking part.

    >My point is, I'm pretty sure Ana is getting exploited here.

    I think Brin isn't just giving her a body because he thinks that that is the primary incentive for her to be his personal merc, and he just hasn't realized that Ana is crazy enough that she'd probably be more than willing to go on life-or-death missions just to stay in her student assistant position.

    > Shouldn't this be "she"?  

    I read this as left-Hira is drinking something while right-Hira is putting their hands in their pockets.

    > Also, it's a little weird how Brin keeps accepting completely random, untested people into his spec ops squad that specifically does jobs he cannot afford to be linked to ...

    I think the strangest thing about this whole set-up is that he isn't concealing his identity at all. Like every one of his personal mercs would give up his name under the methods of torture we've seen so far (there are probably quite a few vocations out there that can make people talk too).

    I'm kind of curious why Ana can't put money down on a body and pay it off over time like a car/house/expensive-appliance. Seems like the only workaround would be if bodies are so exorbitantly expensive that even the downpayment for the cheapest bodies are still outside her price range or maybe some weird cultural/economics handwaving could be done here.

      Deniable asset doesn't mean "I don't know who my employer is," it means "the only proof of my employer's identity is my own testimony." If they get caught and are compelled (via torture or mindfucking) to confess that Brin hired them, it doesn't really change much of anything. Brin is the head of the Principality's intelligence services, so any enemy of the state that gets targeted by shady mercs is probably going to assume he's involved anyway. And if their hypothetical captors try to go public and say "look at these shady mercs, Brin hired them, that's what they told me," Brin can just deny it all. He can claim they were hired by his enemies to discredit them, or that they've been brainwashed/tortured to accuse him, or any number of things, because the only proof of his involvement is the testimony of a couple of shady mercs.

      It doesn't matter that Brin isn't concealing his identity, because there's no paper trail and no proof beyond the testimonies of those involved.

      Well, for starter, it's a lot harder to confiscate a human body.

      People aren't going to buy a car, refuse to pay it off, then go off the grid with a warrant on their head. A car just isn't valuable enough to go on the run. A human body is, if you're in Ana's situation.

      So even if a downpayment system exists, you probably need to show some paperwork to eg prove that you have a stable job, and a backup body you can go back to if your new body is confiscated, and a family that can pay off your loan if you lose your job, etc, none of which Ana has.

      (*Brin* could totally buy her a body and have her work to pay it off, but obviously he has incentives to string her along for as long as he can)
