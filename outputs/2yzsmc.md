    Thank you! I have not thought this through fully, but presumably the lady in the holocron knows many teachings off-limits to the Jedi, and she is quite resourceful in achieving her goals. 

    *"Pretty tough considering the placid nature of the Order during this period."*

    I think you've guessed the theme of the next few chapters...

      It's an interesting story, but we kind of need to see at least the first conversation or so before you can move on. If this was a story about someone else, and we the audience were to discover that they were influenced by a Sith Holocron later on, that would be a good way to write it. But he's the main character, and the influence these teachings have on his philosophy and methodology are kind of important, so we need to see more of that journey than you've shown.

      Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

      In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

      Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

      “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

      The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

      Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

      Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

      L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  I read it, it was good. What time period is it set in? Will we see any of the big names of the series? I didn't recognize anybody's names, so I'm going to assume they're all OCs. Followed, I'll be watching. Write more.

    Thank you very much! I thought of the events as taking place roughly simultaneously with the KOTOR games, give or take a couple of hundred years. I haven't decided whether any of the characters from the games will appear...any plot suggestions would be most welcome :)

  An excellent piece of work. There's been some discussion here of a rational star-wars, but no-one has actually put pen to paper until now. Have all my upvotes.

  Well done.

  Hmm, seems to be set in the Old Republic.

  Interesting that he seems to be taking a Grey Jedi route. I would have liked to see more about what he learned from the Sith Holocron that got him so far ahead in lightsaber combat.

  Of course, it could be as simple as "The masters don't deign to teach you anything important until you've been accepted" and "The Sith in the Holocron did."
