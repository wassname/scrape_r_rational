## [FF][DC][WIP] What if Harry and Quirrell in HPMOR had the personalities of Rick and Morty from "Rick & Morty"? Chapter 2

### Post:

Hi all. Following the positive reception to my spiritual crossover of HPMOR with Rick and Morty, I was inspired to elaborate on it.

  I feel like EY made Quirrelmortâ€™s fascism too cool and suave.  Your fanfic does a perfect job of tearing down that image by putting his fascist rants in the mouth of Rickelmort.

  Haven't watched any R&M and don't know anything about the show's characters except what I could infer from this, but still found it hilarious. Thank you!

    If you liked this, then you'll probably like R&M, but I recommend looking at the IMDB scores because the writers *really* drop the ball sometimes. (For example, Season 1's "Raising Gazorpazorp" is basically just telling the same joke again and again)
