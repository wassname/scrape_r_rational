## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  The God of Legalism created a ritual that lets people swear magical oaths.

  Standard form is something like, "If you do [thing I want] then I agree to do [thing you want] or suffer [penalty]."

  The ritual allows people to agree on wording in advance.  Multiple people can make simultaneous promises, so you can deals like: "as long as you're loyal to me, I'll be loyal to you"

  Once the ritual is done, people feel a strong mental pressure to perform their part of an agreement, up to the point where they invoke the penalty clause.

  How would you exploit a world with magical contracts?  What precautions would you take before swearing one?

  ----

  Going a level meta, you're the God of Legalism.  

  Applying mental pressure costs you power.  You get power when people perform the contract ritual.  And you get [some of?] the power sacrificed in penalties.

  How do you tweak the contract system so that it's used and you get as much power as possible?

    How is vague wording interpreted?  To take your example, if you swear to be loyal to me, who interprets what counts as disloyalty - you, me, or the God of Legalism?  Does my knowing or not knowing about your arguable disloyalty change things?
    ```

      That's a good point.

      Let's start by saying that the God of Legalism likes descriptive linguistics.  Your pile of metal objects counts as a "heap of coins" when ~90% of native speakers would agree that the pile is a heap, and that the objects are coins.

      Magic is backed by a 'platonic realm' where everyone's expectations of 'coins' shapes a platonic form of 'coinness'.  Every contract has to be in a language that's reasonably popular.  And everyone involved needs to be speaking the same language.

      So, "remain loyal" will only prohibit stuff that basically everyone in our culture would agree is solidly disloyal.

      Concepts that are too vague or complex to have a well-understood meaning will cause the spell to fail.   The common work-around for subjectivity is to explicitly name a standard.  "I'll remain loyal unless the tribe chief banishes you."

    Ok so if you can inflict arbitrary penalty clauses then you can easily leverage this to godlike power. Thus I'll just assume that the penalty is something to do with mind control just like the "mental pressure". Of course depending on the strength of the contracts compulsion it may well be totally superfluous to even include a penalty clause.

    Now if the compulsion that's part of the normal contract isn't good enough you can always set people up so they're guaranteed to fail their contract, and then have the penalty invoke whatever mind control you want here.

    Anyway if this works like I think it does then the first competent person to get access to this will coerce some people into agreeing to a contract that makes them unquestionably loyal to him. Then all of those people go on to threaten _more_ people who are assimilated into the contract army.                      
    Point is this inevitably ends either one person having absolute control over humanity, or several such empires in constant conflict.

    Honestly given there's no limitation on coercing people into contracts it seems inevitable that this leads to political power becoming totally centralized, and thus allowing those in power to act with utter impunity since their citizens are literally incapable of opposing them in any way.

      Like a zombie apocalypse. Except the vaccine is simple. Get all the uninfected to make an impossible oath to the God of Legalism with the penalty that they can no longer make oaths to the God of Legalism. Now even if they are captured by the infected, they can't make any oaths, so they can't be infected.
      ```
