  Cool! Apparently qntm is looking into publishing through non-Amazon services as well which I’m personally more interested in, I’m not a fan of Amazon.

  Notably, there are also paperbacks of other works by him. He has them under "Sam Hughes" instead of "qntm." [See more here.](https://qntm.org/paperback)

    I had no idea, and have now four books waiting in my cart for me to have a sudden lapse of control, thanks!

  Is this identical to the online version?  Or does it have extra stuff that's only in the print one?
  ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  Does this include the "What the Dead Know" part of the story?

  If so, did qntm manage to get ahold of sirpudding to get permission and/or compensate them?

  If not, aren't the dead people going to come out of nowhere?
