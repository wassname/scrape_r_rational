  Ah, we're back to my favorite part of the story.  Reading random short stories and trying to divine what interpretation they should have and how it relates to the main storyline. 

  I know that sounds sarcastic, but it's legitimately an absolute joy.

  I think this might be the diagram?

  I may have misinterpreted, the rotation itself may not have been symmetrical.

  Edit: This is a 90 degree rotation, not a 45 degree one.  45 degrees looked weird, and by the time I went back and reread to make sure, I had flattened the layers already.  Maybe it was supposed to look weird, but also considering they started rotating with respect to each other, it looked like this as some point.

  I did not understand why Nic was not more upset about the story, like Dizzy and Simole were. Unless I misunderstood, the mage took over the woman's body at the end and she did not seem to care.

  I suppose another interpretation would be that the two of them would share her body rather than him taking over completely.

    No, she thought he meant he wanted her to give up her life for him so he could live on but actually he gave up his life and gave her the last spell so she had all his power.
