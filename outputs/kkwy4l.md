## Pyrebound 15.4

### Post:

This actually went up yesterday, but I didn't advertise it for ... reasons.

[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/12/25/chapter-15-4/](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/12/25/chapter-15-4/)

Pyrebound returns after a four-month hiatus.  I'll try and make it more regular from now on, I just hit a really dumb rut and rewrote the next update so many times I quite literally lost track.  If this is new to you or you just don't remember it (can't blame you), PB is an original world dark fantasy, currently hovering a bit over 200k words.  Humanity lives under siege in a desert world plagued by regularly recurring disasters, and one young man gets stuck trying to fix the unfixable.  The first installment is [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2020/12/25/chapter-15-4/).  Thanks, and happy new year to all!

  Awesome, thank you! I started it last week and was sad when I got to the last chapter. I really enjoy your world, reminds me of Glimwarden but you have fleshed out a lot more worldbuilding. Ram is frustrating sometimes but that's because you do a great job of keeping the characters consistent. 

  And every few chapters you show me a word I've never seen! Vocabulary lessons!

    That last bit is a new one on me, but you're certainly welcome, and I'm always glad to have new readers.

  Had to reread 15.3, but I think you did a great job with 15.4. I can see why it would have been a very difficult chapter to write.

    Glad to have you (and Walter) still with me too, of course.  As ever, lemme know if there are issues or oversights.  It's all going to need to be fixed by and by for the print edition.

  Thanks for writing. I too had to backtrack and reread the prior chapter, but I suspect that's just a function of time. I liked the content and the plan for the future. However I thought the chapter was too dialog heavy. I look forward to the next one.

    Ten-four, and thanks for the feedback.  I can see what you mean about the dialog, looking over it.

  I started reading your fic today and breezed through part one. Your writing style is very smooth and easy to read, and the plot started off with a bang. I love how even though Ram's world and culture are completely foreign, his problems definitely aren't, and that makes him relatable. I'm already invested in seeing how Ram handles the bad hand he's been dealt. Worldbuilding is great too, makes his harsh world seem beautiful. Thanks for writing!
