  Mother of Learning is just one serial that frequently posts to this subreddit; that I can think of off the top of my head there's also:

  - Worth the Candle
  - The Optimized Wish Project (I don't read it)
  - The Practical Guide to Evil
  - Pok√©mon: The Origin of the Species (I don't read it)

  Why do I point out the ones that I'm not reading? Because it highlights that there's more to this sub than just my experience.

  And then we've got the weekly threads, one-off fiction, and random links. I'm sure that once one of the current crop of serials wraps up, someone will start posting another serial to fill the void.

  (I have one serial three-quarters-written and one in planning, which will be posted here when they're done. The 3/4-written one is seasonally pinned, so it can only be posted on a certain date, but the other one would be more free-form.)

    Marriage and Monsters is another regularly-updating fic with huge potential.

  Nope. It's slow going because the community isn't that large, but people keep updating either ongoing (origin of species, MOL, PgtE, etc.) or newer (I quite liked the psychic comedian that was uploaded a couple weeks back) stuff, and more people keep lurking for them (such as yours truly).

  It's not a party, but this sub is certainly alive.

  No more than the subreddit was doomed when UNSONG concluded in 2017.

  Talking of Mother of Learning ending, any word on what nobody103 will be doing next? New story? Retirement? Break? Squeal?

    He's got a decently large patreon now. I'd wager he's already working on a sequel series or something set in the MoLverse.
    ```

- u/GlimmervoidG:
  ```
  While MoL is generally a little higher, comment counts on new  Worth the Candle chapters are often in the same ball park.
  ```

- u/Nimelennar:

  Just MoL ending?  No, that wouldn't do it.  But, if I remember correctly, A Practical Guide to Evil, Worth the Candle, and, a bit more tangentially, The Gods are Bastards and The Last Angel: Ascension, are also all on or approaching the home stretch.

  &#x200B;

  Still, I think there's enough other rational fiction out there that people will still find stuff to post and read.

  ```
  We are't /r/HPMOR, so I don't think we'll end up completely abandoned when a major fic closes up shop. If anything, it might open up the "rational fic" marketplace for new and interesting fictions.
