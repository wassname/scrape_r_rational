        I'm guessing you're not a fundraiser, marketer, SAAS provider, or psychologist. If you prime a visitor with a low price, they might exceed it, but only slightly. You want to provide a lowest price that people can step over, a "reasonable" price that you push them toward, and an upsell price that primes people to think of the reasonable price as reasonable. This is basic stuff and you see it on almost any successful Kickstarter or Patreon. Check out Thinking Fast and Slow if you want the long version.

  When mind-controlled by Fallatehr, Amaryllis reflects that the group isn't that far from the stereotypical "murderhobo" RPG party. They have killed *a lot of people* in the name of "It was more convenient that way".

  I mean, yeah, they do need to access that fortress before the locust dies, and there was no way they could let Fallatehr live (though they were kind of casual about killing his minions), and Larkspur and his minions needed to die because... he made a deal with Doris Finch, I guess?

  And when you're looking at it objectively, beyond the whole "The hero killed 20 gazillion people during the movie", there's not that much evidence that the protagonists are "The heroes". Everyone is assuming that their quests will allow Juniper to become some sort of god and rewrite reality to not completely suck, but they don't really have any evidence that will happen (especially since it obviously didn't happen to Arthur).

  Also, one of the main objectives is to get Mary back "in power", somehow, but do we know if that would even be a good thing in the first place? She obviously has the loosest ethics of the group (I keep thinking that Fenn and Joon weren't wanted serial murderers before they met her); she's argued before for "It's okay to steal things because us getting more powerful is an inherently good thing". We don't know exactly how she ended up in the Risen Lands with a Black Ops squad after her (she claimed to be on a semi-official mission to retrieve the key, but I think it's fairly obvious she was striking on her own), except that it probably involved her family being assholes. But... given that we know of her, it's not ridiculous to imagine that she was banished because of something awful she did and had to work from there.

  Overall, a lot of this is giving me the same vibe as I got from Welexi's crew in *Shadows of the Limelight*, except that Joon has more agency and a better read on Mary than Dominic did. All of that to say, if my read on this is right, then I look forward to seeing this house of cards collapse :D

  Miscellaneous comments (wow, it's been a while since I've done those):

  > “I was under Esuen’s sway when I took it from the rail company,” said Souno. “I am the only one who knows of your malfeasance.”

  Sounds like Souno is *not* happy about this situation. We're getting a lot of "Character is mind-warped but retains their personality and agency" this book. I like it! I hope we get more of his perspective in future chapters.

  > “It is,” said Val, looking up from her book. “And that’s not okay.”

  I love the idea of Val being shaped and becoming more assertive by reading Harry Potter. She's being raised by J.K. Rowling like the rest of us, the only difference is for her it's happening of the course of weeks, not years.

  > Amaryllis placed a hand on Valencia’s shoulder. “We’ll leave V behind. She’s the most capable of us, and if things don’t go as planned, she’ll be able to get you to safety, beyond the reach of the other tuung. Either we’ll be back within a week, or she’ll be more than capable of taking care of you, especially given the resources that we plan to leave you with.”

  "Guys, you know what goes well every time? Splitting the party. Let's do it again!" Well, I hope she wins a lot of archery-and-soul-drinking contests while she's offscreen.

  > and then I was inside the black void of the glove, a place so familiar that it was becoming like home.

  "Guys, you know what goes well every time? Traveling inside the glove. Let's do it again!"

  Subplot! Also, not cool, Fenn. I like these little moments where she reminds the group that she's actually pretty racist.

        Most people in life or death situations, even in rational fiction, maintain behaviour that is not too far outside the bounds of ‘normal’. When there is a significant chance you and your closest companions are going to die within the next minute in a dark bottomless pit in a foreign land after spending the last half hour fighting for your life then I’m unwilling to judge you poorly for any but the very worst of behaviour.

          Oh my god.

          The thing is, I thought about including a "Yes, I'm aware that Fenn was in a tense and deadly situation and had to deal with the stress of having just killed a large amount of people, which she had previously expressed discomfort as, I'm not trying to demonize her, but I still think her slip is interesting and reveals unpleasant parts of her personality, whether racism or something racist-adjacent" disclaimer, but I thought, nah, brevity is the wit of the soul, I don't want to spend my time justifying myself every time I comment on a r/rational story, yet here I am!

            What you’re saying in regards to ‘over explaining’ is of course very fair but saying an action ‘is not remotely cool’ is a comment that is hard to take as character insight rather than judgement. I would not by default infer everything you have said above to such a comment.

    This is especially a concern in the context of no quest for Amaryllis regaining power.  I definitely see a conflict between them.  Especially considering that she has control over all of their gear.  Perhaps if they are lucky, Amaryllis will be too focused on the coming technological revolution to worry about political power.  She might actually turn out to be more powerful that way, so it's not the worst idea.

    One important difference between Amaryllis and Welexi is that Joon has the loyalty of the party, so that interaction won't be quite so one-sided.  I do think you're right however: these are the protagonists, but they are definitely following their own path (which is not that of a hero).  Until recently, however, almost everyone that they fought/killed was evil in some sense (Aumann, Lakspur, Fallatehr), and I can justify killing Fallatehrs lackeys because they were in many ways copies of him.

    >  Also, not cool, Fenn.

    Well, that guy was *pretty weird* by any standard.  Suicidal or crazy in some sense.  Speaking of which, oh shit what happenes if he interferes with the arrow?
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Do we have strong evidence that Aumann or Larkspur were evil?

      Aumann, I can sort of buy. He kidnapped Mary at gunpoint, left the heroes to maybe starve to death in a desert fortress, and *maybe* tortured Mary before rolling it back with time magic. I'm not sure it makes killing him and the people who worked for him morally justified, but fine.

      Do we have any evidence Larkspur was evil? All he did, he did in the name of catching a group of known international terrorists. He tried to negotiate with Juniper. He *maybe* set Fenn up to die Task Force X style, and *probably* made a deal with Doris Finch (and the cousin marriage thing is gross)... but we don't know if the Fire Team had orders to kill witnesses at all, and the deal with Doris is more shady than evil, the kind of stuff intelligence agencies do all the time. I'm not sure killing him and his men is justified, especially given that he was running out of duns to track them down.

      > and I can justify killing Fallatehrs lackeys because they were in many ways copies of him.

      Yeah, but the "copy" part would have reverted over time. Really, there's not much difference between them and Valencia, but Valencia was Joon-bait and the others were generic henchmen NPCs, so they had to die.

      > Well, that guy was pretty weird by any standard

      It's more the "birdfucker" part I was objecting to.

        >Larkspur and his minions needed to die because... he made a deal with Doris Finch, I guess?

        > Do we have strong evidence that Aumann or Larkspur were evil?

        They're both ruthless people who wanted the party dead or captured at best. *Not* killing them would have been stupid and risky. Especially Larkspur, who became desperate enough to use the strategic elf Bone reserve and make deals with people in forbidden areas, and was constantly on their heels.

        Any protagonist who tried to keep them alive would have been painfully, unbelievably moral, from my point of view, and a chore to read about.

        I don't see the moral quandary over someone killing the assassins hunting them. Or killing a mage that has captured and tortured  someone they know, and has an ever-growing thirst for gold that they sate by taking it from wherever they find, killing whoever is in their way. 

        Amaryllis has some sketchy morals, especially with her recent idea of the ends justifying the means, because June will be a god later, and can fix everything then.

        This whole recent mission has certainly been a lot more morally grey-black than earlier missions. But that doesn't mean the party have secretly been monsters the whole time.
        ```

      - u/munkeegutz:
        ```
        Well, Larkspur tried to negotiate with Joon, but as soon as Joon tried to run, Lark chased after him.  Then, Lark tracked his group down and sent five choppers full of people after them.  Aside from that (which isn't conclusive evidence by any means), we're mostly going on Mary's word (which is fallible, but becoming less so as time goes on).

        At high levels of soul magic, we don't know that the copies revert over time: presumably, you could make a set of values that were more self-consistent (and therefore, stable).  Furthermore, repeated application of the soul hacking will likely adjust other values into a more stable configuration.  Finally, those people were originally sentenced to the same prison as Fallatehr, so it's a good guess that they're evil.  Since they value Fallatehr, they are likely to want to save him at any cost, and would be tremendous pains in the ass anyways.  Valencia, lacking a soul, is immune to soul magic, so it's not a concern with her.

  The ecology, physics, geology, etc. of the Bottomless Pit boggles the mind. I now get why its a capital M Mystery. 

  It gets ever wider and has no end, meaning the WHOLE of Aerb is floating above it; what happens when its circumference comes unto the hex boundaries? 

  Whats happening with the water deficit in the above world? Over geological timespans that should have an impact! Very rough calculation: Yangtze flowrater of 10^3 km^3/year vs earth water amount of  10^9 km^3 gives us a million years for one earth water unit to drain. Even if Aerb is 10 times bigger and the flow rate that much smaller its a HUUUUGGEEE problem! Also erosion(!).

  The energy cycle is *really* weird, deepsea like. A of nutrients in the form of fish/soil from the river - I'd expect fish-snapping batlike creatures in the upper kilometers and plants that grab the soil from the water, like in rainforests. 

  For energy some point you need to resort to rock-dissolving lichens/bacteria. A really low flux energy source - but the area is infinite! (possibly, see hex boundaries) - see also the life of the Tuung in that area. (WTF is up with that super fucked up sort of life?) Magic as external energy source would be invaluable. Also the excluded nuclear energy - maybe instead of thermal vents and volcanism (can't have volcanism because ALL OF AERB IS FLOATING ON THE PIT!!! ) we have Oklo-style natural reactors as hydrothermal vent equivalent? 

  What sort of hyper efficient vertical transportation infrastructure do the Tuung have? 

  How deep can a suffiently funded probe fall and give feedback? I am imagining some sort of heavy, high-terminal-velocity aerodynamic radio torpedo, and a big horizontal hanging antenna. How high is absorption in the wet air? There are frequencies that dont get absorbed that much. A couple lighthours? Heck even lightseconds would be incredible!

  And...Whats up with the air pressure? That *must* be automagically stable, or we would have dropwinds. If pressure increases towards the bottom, suffiently well equipped people just die of O^2 partial pressure toxicity.
  ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    We don't actually know the bottomless pit is bottomless though.

    > Whats happening with the water deficit in the above world?

    A physically realistic model seems like it should at some point evaporate and flow up out into the sky, but of course it's not clear that the model really is physically realistic.

    > How deep can a suffiently funded probe fall and give feedback?

    Better, how deep can you go and still be able to teleport out? There's no theoretical limit, which means you get arbitrarily deep colonization if you can skip the whole teleport key security issue.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      How would evaporation happen? There is neither sunlight nor magmatic heat available. 

      Teleport is a good point; I think with teleportation nobody would want to risk loosing the teleport key.  Arbitrarily deep colonisation: the limiting factor for colonisation is probably not depth, but quality of life -  quality of life at even shallow depths is already extremely low.
      ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        Evaporation happens at any temperature. If I understand correctly, the only way this wouldn't happen is if the temperature just kept dropping as the water fell, and eventually outright froze, or (maybe) if the air pressure just kept rising arbitrarily high.

        E: https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/10470/how-does-water-evaporate-if-it-doesnt-boil
        ```

        - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
          ```
          Yes, that is true. However for the question of geological water cycles evaporation has a double meaning. Literal evaporation and the convective air flows that transport that evaporated water/ water heavy air somewhere else. 

          If all the water from the river evaporates due to arbitrarily long falling lengths, it still needs to rise; since there is no heat source, that just doesnt happen.
          ```

          - u/Veedrac:
            ```
            In the real world humid air has a tendency to rise because it's lighter than normal air, but we run into the problem that this only holds due to a pressure gradient, which I'm not sure we could safely assume exists in Aerb.
            ```

    - u/renegadeduck:
      ```
      In order for it to balance out, the entirety of the river would have to evaporate and then diffuse out of the top.

      (I'm not a chemist, physicist, meteorologist, or mage. Take this with a good heap of salt.)

      It probably would all evaporate. If you imagine a starting point with an infinite expanse of dry air, and then drop a river into it, you'd expect the river to eventually evaporate entirely (see [vapor pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure)]. Because the space is infinite, you will always find more dry air the further down you go.

      I'm not quite sure how that interacts with pressure and temperature.

      There's also the interesting question of gravity. Assuming that the hole is infinite, you would expect “downward” gravity to fall off as you get deeper, but “sideways” and “up” gravity to increase. This potentially means that you could have very cold, low pressure (I think?) atmosphere on the bottom of the world.

      Actually, this reminds me of another thing. The world is closed but apparently flat (see [Common Knowledge About Aerb](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26627424)). If you travel far enough in any direction you get back to where you started. Assuming that this applies vertically as well as horizontally, then you expect that if you go down far enough you'll eventually end up falling from the sky.

      (Assuming that the world is on a [hypertorus](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4xgwpl/eli5_a_hypertorus_universe_that_has_the/), and that my ability to reason about higher-dimensional geometry is good. (It's not.))
      ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        I don't really get how you're modelling gravity. I find applying things we learnt from Earth topology to things that are not rather suspect anyway. I would not be surprised if gravity and the atmosphere were simply uniform everywhere, for instance.
        ```

        - u/renegadeduck:
          ```
          If you imagine descending into the Earth, gravity will get weaker and weaker as the amount of mass below you decreases, and the amount of mass above you increases. Eventually it will balance out and you'll be perfectly weightless at the center.

          If we imagine Aerb as a finite, thick plane, then we should see something similar as we descend. At the bottom, gravity will be exactly the inverse from the top.

          However, we know there is a big old hole. Let's imagine that plane again, except that there's a cone cut out of it with its tip at the top. As you descend one of the sides, more and more of the mass is above and to the side of you.

          I'm not quite sure how this works at the top of the hole, though. If the cone is obtuse enough (it's wide instead of narrow), would you notice an effect at the top of the hole?

          ---

          **Edit:** Of course, we already know that gravity is different because Aerb's star isn't crashing into the ground.

          Amusingly, you could almost explain this with a hypertorus, but it would be metastable at best. And then there's the whole day cycle thing which just says fuck you to geometry.

          (I've been trying to imagine a geometry that allows for a day cycle, but I'm not coming up with anything.)

    ```
    Why is there a water deficit?  Even if the pit is boundless, once the waterfall gets long enough, there will be an equilibrium where the amount of water evaporating from it is the same as the amount entering the pit, no?

    (This is the same reason rivers emptying into a lake or ocean don't dry up.)
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      The water deficit happens on the upside of Aerb. The water that falls in has no way out as far as we know it - usually that would be evaporation. Meaning, normal Aerb slowly gets dryer and dryer. 

      But magic and gods and simulation, so... *shrug*
      ```

      - u/dalitt:
        ```
        I’m claiming that water will evaporate from the waterfall itself, and exit the boundless put through the same (large) hole the party entered through.

        - u/renegadeduck:
          ```
          If the hole is infinite, then the evaporated water will diffuse throughout it, not just up and out. Naïvely, I expect that most of the water would be lost.

          - u/dalitt:
            ```

        - u/sparr:
          ```
          Do we have numbers on how wide the pit is? How fast would the water vapor (and air around it) need to be moving upwards in a constant wind out of the pit to balance the amount of water entering through the waterfall?

  Well that was intense. Poor Taft, I liked him.

  More relevantly, can the party even use Kuum Doona as a reliable base of operations, given its ~~wanderlust~~ automatic relocation defence ability? They can teleport to any place they have been to before, but if Kuum Doona doesn't occupy the same space it occupied when they last been to it, would they still be able to return? In fact, I would imagine this ability was added to it *specifically* to counter teleportation and the like.

  Perhaps it could be stopped, or the teleportation key could be somehow synchronized to it?

  That battle would have been a great time to use some enhanced arrows again.  That's an ability to *abuse*.  Approximate destruction range for a void arrow is (500 ft/crystal)*sqrt(2000) = ~4 miles (!!!)  However, if each arrow had a small flash-bang grenade attached, (or a real grenade attached, depending on the desired lethality), you would not have had much of a fight at all ;-)

  I wonder what kinds of magic can be embedded into an arrow?  Likely flower magic.  Wards?  Put a little bit of warding power into an arrow, and then shoot the arrow.  If you embed the destructive kind of warding against life, and key it to activate appropriately, you could have wiped out the army without risk.

  Speaking of which, that bow is a *fantastic* wealth multiplier.  Forge an arrow out of gold!  Fire arrow into unpopulated desert plain!  Profit! 

  If the bow can replicate a void crystal and the required electrical circuitry to make the thing trigger, it'll definitely replicate a computer chip.  I wonder if you could duplicate a cell phone (or any other small object with a sufficient value/mass ratio)

  In short, that bow is very, *very* useful.  Possibly one of the most useful items they have

  This sentiment keeps cropping up. See also: Juniper wanting the game to supply more information where there is none.

  The party accumulated a lot of information. More than I realized, I think. Maybe this is what it's like to be about to start the internet, and then also populate it with data.

  Ow. (And again, not something very game-y.)

  Lack of trust is also the reason they can't just ask to make the approach on the fortress. The tuung can't be told about the whole druid business, even though it's important.

  This raised my eye. Surely they just think they're subduing some thieves?
  ```

  - u/JanusTheDoorman:

    On the last bit, summarily executing tourists because the boat they're on screwed up its check ins would probably raise some eyebrows. The tuung may think they've got solid evidence that these guys are up to something, but that probably warrants arrest at most.

      Maybe, but the pitched channel might already have given them away. Rattle-Clack might even have departed in anticipation of the fight.

      In my imagination they might also have noticed that the ship is nowhere near where it claims to be. Not sure what sort of system they'd have for that, in an absence of radar, leaving magic. If they trust the operators, that suggests duress.

        Grak can see a mile through the dark/mist with his warder's sight. What happens when you put a warder's monocle on a telescope? There could be observation posts around the pit that can see everything with a magical trace.

          I suspect that this is actually surprisingly hard with the ~WW2 era tech they appear to have, combined with the short period of transmission from the ship.  We could do it today with an array, but they don't look like they can pull off beamforming or interferometry in Aerb ;-)

          Sparrs warder telescope sounds like a winner though!

  Thank you for the great chapters, the tension was great and I can't wait for the rest.

  Also nice that we finally saw gem magic in action, turns out that fighting a gem mage is pretty much like playing a bullet hell: you'll probably die a lot.

  Why does Joon keep burning his own bones for magic?  In the beginning, didn't he walk around with a bandolier of chicken bones or such?  I get that he can now fix his bones through soul magic, but why burn them in the first place?
  ```

  - u/nicholaslaux:
    ```
    The bandolier requires him to touch the bones he wants to use, and I think there was also a comment or something else indicating that humanoid bones were much more potent than chicken bones.

    Could also just be that it's a renewable resource now, similar to having your healer in an RPG cast cure rather than use healing potions?
    ```

    - u/PresentCompanyExcl:
      ```
      He could strap bones to his limbs, serving as secondary armour and bones to burn.

      > renewable resource

      Doesn't he need to burn bones to undo dead rib bones?
      ```

      - u/nicholaslaux:
        ```
        Not with soul magic anymore, now he's just copy/pasting various bones from the other side of his body.
        ```

        - u/PresentCompanyExcl:
          ```
          Oh, now I see why he's using it so much.
          ```

      - u/moozilla:
        ```
        He should copy and paste duplicate bones throughout his body in places that won't get in the way.
        ```

    Why wouldn't he? Are you just worried about the reload time?
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      He's damaging himself. It makes the bones fragile, and it means that he needs to take time to fix them before he can keep going. In a fight, needing to take time out to fix self-inflicted injuries is an ad idea. 

      Basically, what advantage is he gaining?
      ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        Ah, my interpretation was that the fragility was a longer term effect of soul-death, not an instantaneous result.

  Am I the only one that thinks Joon should have responded to the Fools Choker strike by having Rattle-Clack respond into the radio with:

  "Oh god, I'm so glad you guys saved me, I don't know what would have happened to me without you.  Let me clean up all of this blood and I'll be heading back up in 15 minutes."

  Thus, winning some extra time before they are attacked.  In this case, it would have turned out to be enough.

  How do photons work in this universe?

  It's an infinite plane so they should be curving down and making the horizon infinitely tall.

  I have this issue for my own dnd world and don't know how to solve it
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Whatever the answer is, I wonder if it's something the Anatheneums have discovered and explained through mathematical formulas, the same ways ancient Greeks (and probably other civilizations) theorized that Earth was spherical and calculated its size.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      Well it would be very hard to discover special relativity in a world where light seems to ignore gravity but in the distances they're exposed to and the time period it's set in they wouldn't need any further explanation. No one thought light was gravitationally influenced for most of our history

    The land loops in on itself and works on a hex system IIRC. Maybe you can't see more than one hex away or some form of culling. I'm interested in what you would see from a sufficient height.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      I can only presume that if the land loops that would function as an infinite plane physically. 

      If you can't see more than a hex away it doesn't help for photons at an angle of almost vertical (at least as I understand the phenomenon). And what does that mean if you look through a telescope at an angle? The stars disappear to a void? Be a small arc of the sky but still part of it

    Look for longest sightlines. [Off the cuff](https://beyondhorizons.eu/lines-of-sight/) I found 450 km, but that’s for mountains in ideal conditions. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visibility) mentions 300 km, but limits this to objects on the ground and reasonably sized, the latter of which mountains are kind of not.

        This is addressed in the chapter:
        > (The saving grace of the plan to steal the Down and Out was that it was better than the alternatives, which we’d discussed in some depth. The most promising of them was looping Esuen in on the teleportation key and then trying to see whether her worldline was such that she would be able to put us within a few days climb of Kuum Doona, which had seemed like a stretch. Other options, like quickly-built, makeshift aircraft or abuse of the Immobility Plate while skydiving, had been vetoed on feasibility grounds.)

    Their plan does seem extremely dangerous and reckless. On the one hand, they're pressed for time, on the other hand, there was nothing stopping them from starting to plan in the train. Eh, whatever, chapter's over anyway.

      I've looked it up a few times, and just never been able to internalize it. And it's not just that, it's an inability to internalize that there *is* a rule, which means that I don't stop myself when I get to the sections where I'm going to be using it.

      There are a few grammar rules like that; I constantly fuck up the "x and y" pronoun rules unless I'm going really slow and deliberate in my copy-editing.

  Maybe that's just me, but it seems something changed recently (happened already with chapter 85) on archiveofourown that makes FanFictionDownloader unable to correctly parse the contents from that web site (it only gets the chapters titles).

  Not a big deal, but I can't find a way to download a selection of chapters from the website either, but maybe that's something only members can do ?

  Also, the download > mobi button has repeatedly not worked form me today... but just with that specific story : with an other, randomly chosen, one it worked ok. I'd suspect the difference of size in that case.

  My current workaround > get the whole epub and edit the book with calibre \^^
