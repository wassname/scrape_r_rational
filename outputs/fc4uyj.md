  I have to say the Onion fight was a high-water mark of the entire series for me. What an excellent battle.

  I fucking fell out of my chair.

    Fucking with Onion was a consistent highlight. "You'd be a vegetable for the rest of your life." is fucking golden.

      Shit I meant to be keeping an eye out for puns after Joon talked up his prepared one liners, and then I so into following the fight that I missed BOTH of these. Thanks to both of you for pointing them out!

    It fits with Juniper, but at the same time, it shows that he's a bit farther on his way of the murderhobo/being corrupted by power. In one of the Discworld novels Vimes thought about how killing Because The Job Demands It, and not doing a funny one-liner, made it better, and I think this is somewhat applicable here, since Onion was still a human (even if a pretty horrific one), as real as everybody else\*. 

    \* even if that is "not very"
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Yeah he seems to be generally getting more reckless and aggressive in general. He seriously thought "kill the entire government" was a sensible plan. I wonder if passion magic, or his control over his spirit, is making a difference. Its possible cutting off his physical sense of pain is having other negative consequences (like maybe it uses the same "circuitry" as psychological negative reinforcement)
      ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        Reminder that his "cutting off his sense of pain" was just him grabbing a whole bundle of suspiciously active spirit threads and turning them all off. 

        Never mind shared circuitry, he might have done collateral damage to *anything* that happened to be acting up under torture. Fear? Humility? The icky feeling of sweaty skin? 

        One would think he'd have found the time to undo or at least neaten his hack job on the way back to civilization, but he did have a lot on his mind.
        ```

          Oh that's a really good observation

          Jesus he never reverted that? Seems reckless

      - u/burnerpower:
        ```
        Well when that government throws you in a prison with fake charges,  tortures you, tries to soulfuck you, and drugs you some hard feelings are to be expected. I think his recklessness is just a fairly normal emotional response to the recent trauma he has been through. He did let himself get talked down by Amaryllis after all. I really don't have any sympathy for Onion though I do agree that it's a sign of how inured to death Juniper has become.
        ```

        - u/Mountebank:
          ```
          Not to mention killing Solace as the opening move for the interrogation.
          ```

  - u/nohat:
    ```
    I really liked Onion, and kinda wished he had survived (if time ran out at a climatic moment say). We don't get many chances to meet really exceptional fighters or top level characters. Frankly Joon's utter disrespect was a bit annoying -- this guy got his skills the hard way. Onion struck me more as a hardass (and reformed bloodknight) than a complete snake like Hyacinth, and could plausibly be convinced to play nice.

    Now that Anyblade is all rusted can Joon claim the Everyblade? I mean who is going to contest him walking out with it?

    Also I really agree with Joon: Hyacinth has organized a repeated, insidious and very dangerous campaign to flat out kill them, sick dragons on them, and most recently (while at truce talks) kidnapping them, murdering Solace, and torturing Joon and Pallida. Letting people like that live is just bad policy.

    I am getting a bit annoyed by the power up mechanism where if Joon wants to do anything important he has to sacrifice points to amp something up to game breaking levels. It takes away from the progression fantasy for one thing. That one mechanic makes all his standard abilities kinda pointless.

    What on earth was Joon's plan with letting Yarrow and Zinnia go? He knows they can kill all of them with Shia Surprise, and were seriously considering using it already.

      Bethel ate the Anyblade. Juniper was using the probability blade.

        ```
        Oh yeah I forgot. I guess they were so similar I didn't really update my variable name.
        ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      > Now that Anyblade is all rusted can Joon claim the Everyblade? I mean who is going to contest him walking out with it?

      You can't just grab most entads. Whoever entrusted this one to Onion ~~(or whoever Onion's heir is)~~ probably isn't Joon's greatest fan.
      ```

      - u/chris-goodwin:
        ```
        The Everyblade was explicitly described as having belonged to Uther himself.  It's definitely owned by the family.
        ```

      - u/nohat:
        ```
        It seems like a coin flip to me. Could be open, could be elder wand rules, could be any Pendraig, could be Amaryllis endowable (as the closest heir). Onion is supported by Hyacinth's faction whose entads probably have good odds of being usurpable by Amaryllis. If not, then he can potentially force or bargain with someone to endow it.
        ```

    - u/WalterTFD:
      ```
      "What on earth was Joon's plan with letting Yarrow and Zinnia go?"

      I dunno that he had a 'plan' per se, he is just, you know, an ordinary person from earth.  Those of us who aren't, like, double war criminals don't typically kill helpless prisoners.

      If you want to stretch for a possible plan you can say that he knew Yarrow would come around in a while, due to the spirit work he'd done on him.  He could have intended something similar for Zinnia.  As far as the world and their own self image is concerned they were impressed by his nobility and magnanimity in victory.
      ```

      - u/nohat:
        ```
        He's definitely not a normal person from earth now. 

        If he's not willing to mess with their souls to control them he presumably wouldn't be willing to mess with their spirits to control them either.

        If he really wants a third path then he might be able to find some sort of indefinite stasis that he can store them in until he is too powerful for them to be a problem. At the very least its insane to unmindcontrol the very serious enemies who have been lovingly stroking the big red button that you can't take away from them while they are conscious and you are *right next to them*!
        ```

        - u/i6i:
          ```
          Or he could build some rapport by demonstrating overwhelming power and the willingness to let things go. Now that Onion is dead, his abilities well known amongst the court and Hyacinth on the ropes handing over a bunch of prisoners to say Rosemallow to either spirit away to another secret prison - a thoroughly justified comeuppance -  or turn into useful assets would be easy. 

          This sequence of events was also really predictable as was the possibility that Onion could be convinced to side with them because it turned out he really did have layers or whatever to make the entire Anglecyn plotline go away once it was unwelcome. Joon is gambling his ethics with the DM not scheming around political entities that are likely to be gone in a decade.
          ```

          - u/nohat:
            ```
            I think keeping them in stasis or controlled while waiting for things to improve does make a lot of sense. He was going to release them immediately entirely out of moral concerns, not practical ones. Tbf the taboo on soul magic is highly unlikely to go away just because they 'win' at Anglecynn politics. And none of that solves the nuclear button problem.
            ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      >What on earth was Joon's plan with letting Yarrow and Zinnia go? He knows they can kill all of them with Shia Surprise, and were seriously considering using it already.

      I don't thikn it was a concrete plan, but more of a self-safety check. My feeling for Joon's aversion is that if you can avoid consequences of soul raping someone by killing them after the fact, it may be harder to prevent yourself from using soul magic again. In that way self-imposing consequences to acts of great evil as a way to dis-incentivize any future repeats makes sense.
      ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      I think the best way for having onion survive (that was actually foreshadowed) would be to have him use illegal magic when he saw he was losing. The fight would end and join would go free but he would survive. Low risk Gambit.
      ```

    - u/eltegid:
      ```
      I took Joon's disrespect as an expression of his anger. He's either really angry at the whole kidnapping thing or something's broken inside him, as has been said already.

      I think it's the first one. After all, it's preeetty reasonable to be angry for a while.
      ```

    - u/AnimaLepton:
      ```
      >I am getting a bit annoyed by the power up mechanism where if Joon wants to do anything important he has to sacrifice points to amp something up to game breaking levels.

      Hard agree. I really like this story, I don't mind restrictions like 'no magic' coming into play, but it feels like the repercussions of sacrificing skills lives in the background at best. He has multiple abilities that he's able to dump in order to achieve these effects, let alone scraping souls for their abilities. Realistically the world is already scaled to his ability, with individual quests scaling up as needed, and the parts where he's thinking about how things could've gone differently are interesting. But when the only cost he pays is not tangible, mostly from explicitly chosen dump stats/skills that get trained offscreen, it doesn't really matter.

Onion struck me more as a hardass (and reformed bloodknight) than a complete snake like Hyacinth, and could plausibly be convinced to play nice.

      Onion murdered several people for his own ambition.  He called everyone in the chamber insects because they didn't have his power.  Onion was a powerful monster that needed to be put down, no more, no less.
      ```

      - u/nohat:
        ```
        I'm not going to make the layer pun for the 19th time, but I think you are only seeing his outer... stratum. From what we know he provoked people who attacked him first, then he killed them. We don't know the details of these people or encounters, and they were a long time ago. He apparently largely reformed after surviving the cthonic exclusion zone.

        Calling everyone else insects is a worrisome trait perhaps, but strikes me as in line with a warrior (who has survived the nigh impossible with guts and skill) dismissive of cringing, backstabbing politicians and panem et bloodsports observers with no personal skill. He is disgusted by them, yet forced to play their games. Now he finally met someone who can appreciate the power and art of this fight, and offers a snide remark on the bloodthirsty crowd safe in their seats. It makes for an interesting character trait, not a 'powerful monster that needed to be put down, no more, no less.'

        All that isn't to say that Joon was wrong to kill him. That was clearly morally allowable, and pragmatically necessary at that point.
        ```

  - u/alphanumericsprawl:
    ```
    I know, that fight was amazing. As a fencer (skill 8-10), I remember getting into a few short riposte loops (though that was partially down to the way fencing awards priority for simultaneous hits). It was great, intense fun that I could honestly see happening between superhuman masters.

    I wonder how good Onion would be in a real fight with unboosted Juniper. Would blood and bone magic give him the strength and speed to beat him? Does still magic beat bladebound, since it's' only pseudomagic? I assume that 'in the real world' metamages would trump even the best swordsmen, especially revision mages.
    ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      If Juniper has access to all his magics, and even a small unicorn bone, Onion wouldn't have stood a chance.
      ```

      - u/alphanumericsprawl:
        ```
        Joon's dodges transcended time and space. He had two degrees of reasonablness on his already obscene parries (at something like 10x his normal speed) and a super-instakill attack with a two-minute charge-up. 

        I know bones and blood are pretty good but how could he get the speed he needs? Presumably Onion has other entads. Passion, air and water aren't that useful. Stilling and unicorn magic for defence, vibration and gem magic for offence.

        It all comes down to whether he can still a super-inviolable attack or not because I don't think he has the stats to fight sword to sword. Even if he did, Onion would cut straight through with 2D sharpness.
        ```

        - u/Reply_or_Not:
          ```
          Still magic pretty much makes him invulnerable. Vibrational magic means he can kill from range and out of line us sight, much less all the other deadly magic he can use in line of sight (like gem magic).

          Add in a unicorn bone for what is effectively save scumming and it is hard to see how he could lose
          ```

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          Passion magic can give enhanced speed, or some ranged attacks that seem like they would be difficult to parry
          ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Onion would have to have some means of defending against vibration magic, because he doesn't have any normal ability to defend against it. It's not clear if Joon has the still magic to stop Onion's blade, but if he does then Onion would be solely reliant on entads to hit Joon.
        ```

      - u/GaffitV:
        ```
        We don't really know what Onion's usual entad compliment is either. I think it was mentioned that he had one entad ring on each finger? In his prime he may have been able to give unicorn-bone Juniper a run for his money.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      To be fair, outside the limited circumstances of the duel Onion would have been able to call on a literal army of the best mages in aerb to back him up. So it's unlikely you'd ever get the situation of a fully powered Juniper vs onion on his own
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I really liked the text messages myself.  I was laughing pretty hard at him trolling Onion.

  You may have noticed that this is posted as the RoyalRoad link rather than the Archive of Our Own link. This is mostly due to AO3 reclassifying the story as Not Rated due to a user report about an explicit scene in ch 53. AO3 didn't offer much guidance on what needed to be changed, and their policies are such that trying to fight it would basically just soak up time. I wouldn't care that much, but they put up one of those dumb age gates for anything that's either Not Rated, Mature, or higher, and the RoyalRoad mirror was already sitting there. Plus RoyalRoad allows the inclusion of links to [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales).

  Apologies for this oversized chunk, I got pretty sick this last month (bronchitis) and with my whole family sick that threw everything out of whack for a bit.

    On the AO3 front, I noticed, when I started reading the update there, that the story is in two collections, so I figure it's worth warning you: [whoever runs a collection on AO3 can, at will, hide stories in that collection from readers](https://kedreeva.tumblr.com/post/189911215708/shamelesslymkp-kedreeva-kedreeva-people), so you might want t be careful about that.

  On this episode of *Onionball Z*:

  Amaryllis is so deep into Earth culture that "Fucking Christ" has a genuine response from her when pissed off.

  Two people who spend literal hours thinking over the narrative implications of their decisions literally sit next to each other and say "This is definitely a farce of a marriage - conveniently we can supply true testimony of our many hours cuddling, taking long walks together, and that time I was in love with you as evidence of its validity."

  In the ultimate clash of Final Fantasy 3 classes, the Onion Knight takes on the Black Belt!

    ```
    >Amaryllis is so deep into Earth culture that "Fucking Christ" has a genuine response from her when pissed off.

    Not just earth culture in general, she's deep into religion and Christianity in particular! 

    Juniper constantly avoids interacting with the fact that both Mary and Fenn had bible studies and genuinely seemed to get something out of the religion he dislikes so much, so I can't wait to see that brought to the forefront at some point.

    *Especially* with this whole "haha we're married but I'm not deeply in love with you baka... unless?" thing thrown into the pile.

    Nothing about their relationship makes sense and I love it.

  (Just FYI, AW retconned Ring of the Broken World, so the scene scything through Harold's mooks now doesn't have to have the inconsistency with Joon being trapped under a net and by a revision mage despite his ability to teleport.)

  Such good chapters. The humor was amazing, I loved the character moments, and legitimately the best fight scene in years. Well worth the wait, and it's a huge batch as well.

  Kinda disappointed that they didn't get more info from Y&Z, but made up for by Joon rolling a nat 1 on his insight check on Pallida.

  Joon fucking with Onion is immensely funny.  "You’d be a vegetable for the rest of your life." "You're leeking." "That is a very rude way to speak to your beloved nephew who is alive." I was cracking up at these. And this is *after* he dropped the comedy skill.

  Onion using the flickerblade confirms that Amaryllis got it back after Li'o.

  Gotta say that I didn't expect a marriage in this batch. Luckily, Juniper Penndraig already has a flower name, so he doesn't stand out until he opens his mouth.

  > “Juniper knows everything,” said Amaryllis. This was pretty much true, with only one glaring exception that she could think of, and that one thing was interpersonal rather than being relevant in an information security context.

  Kind of feels silly to mention this after talking about them literally getting married, but Amaryllis is all but confirming her attraction to Joon.

  Such a great batch overall, lots of important things happening, a bunch of big reveals to the public, and I have no idea how it's going to end but the writing quality seems to consistently be improving.

      It wasn't used, which was part of the reason it was removed I'm sure.

      > Ring of the Broken World: Despite the weird title, it was really just a limited form of teleportation. Instead of having a set distance, it could teleport me such that I was still touching the place that I had originally been standing in, preserving my momentum. I could teleport up so that my feet were where my head had been, or I could teleport to the side so that my left hand was where my right hand had been. In other words, the maximum distance was pitifully short, but it was activated by thought, and could be used many times in rapid succession, which meant that it had combat utility.

      Notable for the fact that it trivialized getting out from under a net or fighting a revision mage.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Maybe it was now one of the ones Onion collected, or is one of Amaryllis Entads... Although I don't think it would always trivialize fights against revision mages, but maybe if you came at them sideways\^\^ That cleaver would have been useful, though.

    I was thinking that Grak warded against the blade, only completing the ward at the proper moment. He has the temporal plate and Amaryllis burning speed for him to help him react faster as well, and could use warder's sight to tell when the flickerblade's power was used.
    ```

    - u/munkeegutz:

      ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      this seems like more direct interference though.  Warded where?  an outsider applying a ward to the arena would probably be a rules violation.
      ```

      - u/Executioner404:
        ```
        The multiblade's meta-effect was extending outside of the arena, and Grak could probably sense it whenever it borrowed from their weapons. He just had to Ward around the flickerblade against the meta-Entad's magical effect to prevent Onion from accessing it.      
        Nothing against the rules, probably.

        **EDIT**: Oh right, Grak probably made the anti-Entad ward somewhere ASAP, then Amaryllis pushed the flickerblade into it the moment they needed to.
        ```

        - u/wren42:
          ```
          this one makes the most sense, yeah.  Create an anti-magic bubble right near them, and Amy shoves it in at the right time.
          ```

  - u/UlyssesB:
    ```
    Another possibility someone's mentioned is that the flickerblade simply isn't capable of materializing inside inviolable objects. So the "useless" grandmaster monk virtue saved him.
    ```

    - u/TitansTrail:
      ```
      Yeah, I think this is what it was. Onion could cut him, but the flickerblade thing isn't cutting. Void effects can damage inviolable objects, but this wasn't a *void* voiding effect, it was an entad voiding effect that probably teleports the matter to another plane instead of just removing it from existence.

      So as you can see, Aerbian magic is completely logical and consistent and not confusing at all.
      ```

      - u/WalterTFD:

        Yes, it is just as logical as Yarrow is alive.

  What a fight scene. Disappointed that Onion had to die, his backstory was super interesting and it really seemed like he had layers.

  I'm wondering how much of Juniper's and Simuryllis's uh, exploration, got communicated to Amaryllis afterwards.

    Characters like Onion really hammers in the existential dread Joon's companions are having. This guy is a noble, who survived exclusion zones alone, best swordsman of the empire, commander of the Host, and the entire reason of his existence is to be sliced by Joon to reveal his powers.

      I think he was a potential ally, had Joon tackled some quests differently. Similarly to soul guy whose backside had several hooks in it to give the GM different ways to introduce the character even if Joon and Party hadn't sought him out.

      Joon didn't follow the quest to join the military,  so he didn't get to have Onion as his SO and didn't get a chance to make a positive impression before h--whatserface decided to try and recruit Onion to her political game.

    Upthread, someone observed that when Joon "turned off" his pain reception to resist torture, he actually just grabbed a whole bundle of threads in his Spirit and disabled them. In theory, he could've turned off a lot more things than just pain, and that's why he's so lighthearted about going against the Court -- all the Onion jokes, going directly to murder to solve problems with Hyacinth, etc

    I agree that it's a pleasant change of pace. I wonder if it'll persist when some of the shoes start to drop -- like the reunion with Bethel, interacting with the horrors of excluded monsters or further World Lords, etc

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      idk. He doubles SPD and PHY with extra bonuses to dodge and parry, and Monkish Ascendant makes him inviolable, so as long as he wants to be attacking with magic it seems almost strictly better. In this particular fight it would have meant having an extra entad, and since the difference in attack power seemed less high than one might expect when he went unarmed even without Blade-Bound, that might have been enough.
      ```

      - u/burnerpower:
        ```
        Part of the reason it worked out for Juniper was that his change in tactics caught Onion off guard and didn't give him time to cycle for a counter sword. Even with that Juniper would have died if Amaryllis hadn't denied Onion her entad at the key moment. Maybe a different entad would have made up for it, but Juniper didn't actually know all the details going into the fight about how strong Onion was or all the virtues he would have. 

        I do agree that unarmored and unarmed would be the way to go if he has access to magic and the monkish virtues. Alas unless he's using the soul scaphism trick again later that probably won't come up.
        ```

        - u/Veedrac:
          ```
          If Juniper was unarmed bladebound he would have been attacking five times as fast as we saw him as a Monk, one degree less reasonably, and rolling twice the effective attributes. I don't think the balance you saw in that fight was a clear indication of the actual balance between these strats, especially as being inviolable opens up strategies he didn't use like simply flooding the whole arena with corrosive acid.

              FYI, barely needing to breathe is down to Bodily Stasis rather than inviolability; even thirty minutes shouldn't be a big deal, and he has twice the blood supply. Inviolability should work fine against irritants, since it stopped even the pseudomagical rust effect on his armour.

Further, your unarmed attacks may be considered specific weapons, even exotic ones, even when this would be completely unreasonable."

            Now it doesn't specifically say he can't copy entad effects. That is true, but then you have to answer the question of if he could do it, why didn't he? He never used this to copy an entad effect even though it would have made the fight a lot easier. Furthermore, if I saw this wording in a pen and paper rpg I would understand it to mean he can temporarily copy weapon keywords like in DnD.

    This is brilliant, but I fully expected him to turn his unarmed attacks into *specific* weapons - such as Onion's weapon, to make this entire "No u" battle even sillier...

    Or, if we really needed one last hint that we're nearing the Endgame, he'd just choose the strongest weapon he ever designed (Some reinterpretation of the Vorpal Blade?) with the assumption it made it to Aerb - and slice Onion's head / soul off by just gesturing in his direction.
    ```

    - u/wren42:

        ```
        That *would* be more balanced... but then why even mention the "specific, exotic, *completely* unreasonable" part if it doesn't impart any of that weapon's unique attributes or abilities?

        I honestly thought it was referring to Entad weapons in particular, but maybe I misunderstood.

  I had a conversation on this subreddit a while back about whether or not the "harem" or more accurately the multi-person romantic elements of WTC were a subversion or not, with me firmly on the 'not' side. The idea on the subversion side being that while it has romance elements it never really goes into romantic tropes per se, its meant to deconstruct them.

  Anyway Mary just had a clone herself made so that Joon and her could make out such that it "doesn't count", while they got political-married but it totally doesn't mean anything, baka! Give me any given year of harem anime and I swear I will find both of those plots somewhere on the seasonal chart!  


  Which is all praise btw, I find the romantic/personal elements of WTC to be some of the best parts of the story that really set it apart (prob said this before). Ratfics have a high tendency to dehumanize the characters via focus on the plot, and perhaps adopt an over-serious tone. The best characters always have the full spectrum of human problems to tackle, and sometimes they are tackled in patently ridiculous-while-also-serious ways.
  ```

  - u/Executioner404:
    ```
    A lot of the harem stuff is played straight (only for incredibly discomforting results instead of wish-fulfillment ones), but I still feel like there's an element of subversion here...

    * You have the "Fated Heroine" being the second choice, with every interaction between them underscored by an existential dread that they're following the plan of an eldritch god

    * The "young, innocent one" starts off as *dangerously, horrifyingly* innocent, and progresses to an opposite kind of terrifyingly hyperaware of every social interaction that makes the MC seem innocent in comparison

    * There's one that was both raped by his best friend and then raped the MC in turn - which holy fuck, I can't begin to unpack, is there even precedence to compare it to in other harems?

    * Grak is surprisingly the most Harem-like, with a one-sided attraction that the protagonist returns half-heartedly as a friend (but is complicated primarily by issues of non-binary gender. Not a subversion really, but fairly uncommon)

    * Raven is still not fully established, but there's an odd mix of "childhood friend I wronged and want to atone to" and "a way for me to get over the thing I sort of had for the ~30 year old man when I was 12 but not really" - classic Harem tropes!

    * Joon is implicitly suggested to fuck the Doe by an achievement. What the fuck. I'm hoping there's some "Spiritual Druidic Soulbonding" bullshit equivalent to that, but judging by the DM's sense of humor... probably not.

    And just looking at your example in particular: The clone feels a lot like a deliberate callback to the *previous time* Joon fell in love with an alternate, doomed version of Amaryllis. This might be the start of a strange pattern for them... I have thoughts about the marriage stuff, but suffice it to say, their relationship is a strange meta-clusterfuck.

    ...Then there's **Fenn.** The "Upbeat second stringer that almost never wins but makes the entire harem work by just being there" which won easily, then had their relationship get so thoroughly broken that a supersocial therapist couldn't find a conceivable fix for it, and then she immediately died.

    I don't know if "subversion" or "deconstruction" are really the words for it, but this harem sure is working on some 4D parallel universe logic!
    ```

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:
      ```
      This is good comment! I sadly wont give it the justice it deserves, as I had a full debate on this subject in the previous thread and I feel like its good practice not to re-litigate things (I emphatically do not want to become "the harem guy"!), I just found this update hilarious in that context. 

      All I will say is that I totally agree that the harem elements in WtC are weird and parallel-universe-y, and in particular they are super meta, all about trope & media awareness and how it impacts the relationships. I would just separate that from a subversion - they are a weird harem, also a very adult and plot focused harem (so it doesnt look like a slice of like anime ofc), but still very much a harem, with all of them having romantic potential with Joon and his back-and-forth on the romance topics a big part of his plot. 

      But hey, media vocabulary is vague for sure, I think everyone has conflicting definitions of words like "subversive" or even "meta". We all will find different words that fit what we see.

  The twist in the last chapter, of a player character having a 'phase', is great. I am a big fan of how the whole fight unfolded, and I enjoyed the plant matter puns, but this is a different kind of catharsis.

  So, forget the technicalities of using undisclosed magic in a trial by combat (because as you're about to read Juniper is in FAR worse trouble because he can PROVE he didn't use other magics). Forget the insanely impressive things Juniper has done which are arguably technically possible with the right entads, no, let's focus on the important part.

  Here is a list of literally impossible things that an audience of hundreds and at least a half dozen warders have witnessed Juniper do:  
  \* Juniper can instantly teleport at lightning speed to avoid an undodgeable blade. He can do this repeatedly. The witnessing Warders will confirm he did this without magic or entads.  
  \* Juniper can begin to dodge attacks before he should have any legitimate way of knowing an attack was coming.  
  \* Juniper can deflect a bladebound's sword edge with his bare hands when it has been shown to cut through literally anything. Again, without magic or entads as Warders confirm.  
  \* Juniper can strike people through armor with his fists without even needing to touch the armor. No magic, no entads.  
  \* Juniper can directly kill someones soul by punching them in the head, overpowering an entad that should be able to resurrect them. With no entads, or magic.  
  \* Juniper can levitate in the air and glow without magic or entads.  
  \* Juniper can regenerate lost limbs. Without Magic or Entads.

  This is not everything he can do, this is just the things he did during this fight for which there is no possible explanation other than "I follow different rules to regular mortals".

  He's is also likely the greatest multi-mage on Aerb (confirmed in front of the General Council) and just went blow for blow with the best bladebound there was and actually got the first lethal hit on them proving he was better than them at their own specialty.

  Juniper won't have to say he's Arthur reborn, everyone will already think it.

      There are a lot of people with a lot of influence that stand to lose that influence if Joon starts throwing his weight around. Quite of few of those people could be willing to risk a likely death for the unlikely reward of being able to hold onto their corrupt power. Especially if Joon makes it clear by his actions that he won't tolerate those kinds of people in his new order.  


      And it doesn't matter if Joon says he is not interested, people won't believe him.  


      In fact the worst issue might be people 'on his side' trying to prop him up as a new ruler and getting in the way of the quest. Joon is strong, but its too early for him to be safely famous. Now no one will underestimate him, when they come at him it will be 110% overkill nuke from orbit levels of force.
      ```

      - u/burnerpower:
        ```
        Sure. That's also how Uther's enemies treated him. I don't think it worked out for any of them. These are Uther's descendants. They should understand better than anyone that if Juniper is really Uther reborn its pointless to try and oppose him in any way.

        I do agree that it will make things more complicated, but Juniper has no particular plans for Anglecynn. All they want is for Hyacinth's faction to stop fucking with them. Maybe in the future they will do something to stir up the desperate corrupt opposition you are predicting, but I doubt it. Based on the Cypress timeline I think its quite likely that Amaryllis will easily handle Anglecynn politics. Hell the quest text all but confirmed that no one wants to screw with them anymore.

        - u/Slyvena:

          I'm also sure he'll be fine. But honestly being accused of using magic against the rules despite being worse in the short term would likely turn out to be less hassle in the long run.  


          They should know not to fuck with him... but they will anyway. The same way Uther's enemies kept trying even when he'd just finished slapping down the previous ten.

    Just to nitpick, Joon didn't deflect the sword edge with his hands, he specifically avoided the edge of the blade in that party.

    The audience also wouldn't know the punches can hit the soul, and I think the audience would find the three gems on the armor pretty self explanatory in terms of only being able to power 2 revives.

  * having the mirror room be a mirrored room, rather than a room full of mirrors, is a nice little twist, of the sort that AW is good at. Little details are part of why I like this series so much.

  * Grak's comment about Amy's family making her worse is very true. For all she frame's herself as dispassionately calculating she is a human, and these are the people who have in effect abused and manipulated her her whole life. Psychological realism yay.

  * Hyacinth being emotional is interesting. I almost wonder if it's genuine and the idea that everyone here is manipulative is all in Amy's head. But unlikely. It is still worth noting that Amy almost never considers genuine emotion as an explanation for people's actions.

  * Have we heard of the wiffle exclusion zone before? Or the lower cthonic? 

  * Onion is a fascinating character we've only had hints of previously. Could be a primary character in another story. Definitely has layers

  * My first thought with the contracts is that they don't say anything about what happens if the signatories die

  * Interesting to see in Hollly someone in the court who seems to actually care about the law

  > He was undoubtedly the most important though, above and beyond even Solace, though that would be impolite to say out loud

  * interesting that Amy ranks Solace second in importance after juniper. Wonder how much that's the pseudo child thing vs her being the last druid

  * releasing a rare and incredibly dangerous monster seems a level of escalation we hadn't seen before, particularly as they used non lethal means for the capture. Possibly hints that there's a third party who doesn't care about getting hyacinth killed in the process.

    > Aside from the natal souls, new people in the hells were a rarity, enough that if there were sufficient levels of unification, it might be possible for them to interrogate anyone who fell within certain criteria

    I hadn't realised that the rates of soul collection on death were so high that they meant new souls were rare. I had assumed it was at best 50/50,with the tight time window and the number of civilisations that werent integrated into the "international community". I suppose that the deaths we see are fairly unusual, as even in a quasi medieval society more people die of disease than violence. And forms of assisted suicide are probably a common way to make sure the soul is bottled. Does raise the question of how the runic spikes are widely distributed.


    > for some reason, filled with dire guinea pigs

    Wheels within wheels 

    >he’s got some kind of registration, which means that he can make some changes and then make some other changes to set them back later, 

    So it seems like the restrictions on soul magic are less strict than we thought, if such a glaring loophole exists. At least for royalty. Would think the known presence of soul mages would provoke some paranoia. But maybe they've been successful in convincing people that what he's authorised to do isn't "Soul Magic" but something different thst doesn't hit the tabboo.

    > It’s training,” she said. “You don’t try to resist the compulsion, you ignore it. You just follow the script 


    Interesting countermeasure. Basically training themselves to respond to interrogation in a very specific way to the point that its entirely reflexive. Seems like it would be vulnerable to other ways of disrupting someone's concentration, or just waiting long enough they eventually have to do something that interacts with their values. But perhaps the idea is to just delay giving out useful information long enough. As discussed in the flashback with Arthur talking about torture 

    The fact that these two have seemingly been trained for so long to resist interrogation implies there's people within the court who are arranging this sort of intensive training for the young royals. Since it seems like this would take literal years of practice. Which seems very different from the relatively low responsibility lifestyle most royals seem to lead.

      The soul collection rate doesn't need to be that crazy good for this to be true. Just running the numbers, if there's billions of people on Areb, an average life expectancy of 60 years, and only a 95% soul collection success rate -- which is probably a low bound -- and 5000 hells, that comes to just a couple souls per hell a day. Something that happened twice a day on earth would be a rarity if it happened near where you live.

          Assuming Onion can destroy anything in the first ~3000 hells with a bonded stick, while also gaining a regeneration ability, he has better odds than I thought.

          I've seen some people use Still mages as an example... can a level 100+ Bladebound even beat a mid-tier Still mage with reactive stilling? All it takes is for the devils to drop one good counter or trap on him like that, and he's done.

          Not to mention that Demons themselves are all implied to have insane combat stats and skills, so they won't all be fodder.

          If he actually gets a sword down there, I'm sure he'll survive for a while before the Infernals mobilize against him - but probably not up until the council starts abolishing the Hells.

It's incredible how you continue to write better and greater fight scenes and continually top yourself.

    Though there are still some mages that bladebound don't have any counters to. Still and vibration mages both would kill a bladebound regardless of their skill, though a bladebound might be able to overpower a still mage. Other mages might be able to kill someone of Onion's ability as well, though it's a little less sure.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      Its unclear whether Still magic can stop infinitely sharp blades. Vibration could win, but most of their best killing moves have setup time. A bladebound of Onion's level would just run up and chop their head off unless the circumstances are extremely setup in the Vibration mages favor.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Still mages don't seem to care about the sharpness of a blade, only the force behind it. So long as they can touch the blade, and have enough power to stop it, I think they would win, assuming entads aren't in play.

        Vibration mages can vibrate someone to death pretty quick when they're close, and a bladebound would need to have some form of protection against the pressure wave for them to not be killed almost immediately. Though you're right that it comes down to who can hit who first, as neither really has defense against the other.

        - u/burnerpower:
          ```
          I agree. That said, bladebound psuedomagic is weird and physics breaking so I wouldn't count it out. Total commitment as worded should work on a Still Mage but that might be a Juniper only thing. I'm really curious what Onion's exact stats were and what virtues he had access too.

      We're basically speculating on the contents of the rulebook here. IMO, an epic level bladebound shouldn't be trivially lost in a fight against a "just out of the atheneum" mage that's probably like Level 5 in DND terms -- even if it's a still or revision mage

      Both the capstone virtues for Dodge and Parry seem like they could work on offensive magic
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Onion doesn't have the Dodge capstone, and I really don't think two degrees of reasonableness is enough to parry your head being vibrated, or something being loud.

        Mainly though, I just don't think that the mages and other fighters are balanced in 1v1 battles against each other. An epic level vibration mage doesn't have any real defense against being shot, other than to break the gun or the person holding the gun before being shot. An air mage could suffocate a grandmaster still mage at range, despite being otherwise fairly weak. Void has been noted to bypass a ton of defences, and still and gold mages don't have any real defense against them. Revision mages don't have much innate offense, but could probably outlast a bunch of other mages, forcing a stalemate.

        Fireteams seem to exist partly because any single mage can't cover all their weaknesses.

It was only a day or so before the fight itself that Rosemallow even slightly believed that Joon has anything of the spark of Uther in him, and as we saw Onion turned out to very much live up to his name as the best fighter in the world. I don't think Rosemallow was behind it personally, I think she is on Mary's side, but the facts arent conclusive I would grant.

          maybe not on Mary's side, so much as wanting to use Mary as a valuable piece in her game.  But yes, I agree for the most part.  I suspect she had some small % reserved for Joon pulling through, after seeing Mary's confidence in his escape and adjusting her plans accordingly.  I wonder what those adjustments were?  Taking inventory of Mary's potentially available entads and helping Onion build his setup accordingly? ;)

  > Onion was the kind of man who there were always rumors about, which made it hard to separate fact from fiction. It was said that he’d parried a car once, using his blade to sweep it aside. During his time in the Golden Cete, he’d reportedly killed fifty men single handedly when his company’s position had been overrun. His blade was supposedly so pseudomagically sharp that it could slice clean through a person in full plate without so much as slowing down. 

  Can I just comment on how bullshit Onion's own life must have been, from his perspective?

  Like, at first the guy starts murdering people, and they send him to a deadly wasteland in what other countries consider a particularly barbaric form of execution. He survives that, starts murdering people again, then gets sent to a deadlier wasteland.

  And then, through the process of escaping *that*, he becomes so good at killing things that it's considered legally impossible to arrest him, and physically impossible to kill him.

  Like, seriously, look at the virtues Juniper lists, and consider that he probably has most of them.

  He can *parry cars with a sword*.

  He can parry bullets shot by a sniper from behind him *even if he has no awareness of the sniper*, and his sword is sheathed when the sniper pulls the trigger.

  This is a guy who has lived his full life with the power available to a late campaign player character, and who acts exactly the part. His analysis of Juniper was amazing.

  And then, despite his lifetime of training, despite the fact that he brings one of the most overpowered entads his country has to offer, he gets punched to death by an asshole in underwear.

  Too bad, I liked him.

  > “I’m afraid that’s not the offer,” said Hyacinth. “You agreed to my terms once, then went to Rosemallow and decided on renegotiating. I’m not going to let you leave here so that you can use this meeting as leverage.” There was an unspoken ‘again’. Amaryllis had used Hyacinth as leverage over Rosemallow.

  It seems a little strange that Amaryllis doesn't even consider checking in with Grak and Juniper, considering what she said earlier about them being stakeholder. That was a really easy trap to avoid.

  On the other hand, maybe it's the kind of mistake that's a lot easier to see in hindsight, since we already know what happened to Juniper.

  > “I’m with child,” said Hyacinth, placing a hand against her stomach. “My little boy will grow up not knowing his father.” She shook her head, and a real, actual tear slid down her face. Crying on command was, Amaryllis knew, difficult, though easier if you were drawing on actual emotions. Who knew whether the pregnancy was real. It was never a lie you could call someone on, and if there were no baby, then she could simply claim a miscarriage. “I know that what Larkspur did was wrong. I said as much to him. If you killed him in self-defense — all I want to know is what happened.”

  It's interesting that the thought that Hyacinth may be sincerely grieving doesn't even occur to Mary.

  On the one hand, given what we know about Hyacinth, her previous actions, the fact that she's very much in the process of screwing Mary over, and what we generally know about how deceptive Penndraig can get, it seems very likely that this was a bait on some level.

  On the other hand, Mary watches a woman cry about her dead husband and their unborn child, and the only thought that comes to her is "Okay, so what kind of game is this?"

  I can kind of see what she said about her family making her a worse person.

  > “No,” said Pallida. “That was the thing that pissed me off, and what’s pissing me off now. I was given orders that would require killing people, sometimes innocent, sometimes not, and then, when I killed people in order to do the thing I had been sent to do, I would get scolded, just enough so that Uther could put up this paper-thin pretense.”

  Oooh, nice. Don't think I didn't see that parallel with Welexi.

  Uther's "probably the final villain" meter just went up a few notches.

  > Amaryllis nodded. “We just went to get some answers from an expert. Things heated up considerably.”

  "Do you *ever* go anywhere without triggering a public firefight?"

  > “That’s classified,” said Raven.
  >
  > “Classified by what authority?” asked Phlox.
  >
  > “Uther Penndraig,” replied Raven. “And by classifying authorities that must themselves remain classified, for the good of Aerb.”

  This is completely dumb and I love it.

  "Fuck you. What I do is so classified that you don't even get to know why it's classified."

  > “Yes,” replied Amaryllis, almost as soon as the question was out of my mouth. “Per the Decency Acts, Juniper and I have been cohabiting for the past three months and qualify to waive the wait time. I need a witness to vouch.”
  >
  > “I — I vouch,” said Lisi from her place on the council.
  >
  > [...] Phlox called out, “Silence them.”
  >
  > I wasn’t good enough at vibration magic to out-compete both of the vibration mages at the same time, though I sure gave it my damnedest. Fortunately, Amaryllis was prepared, because she started rapidly signing in Gimb.

  The fact that any of this has any legal validity at all makes me wonder what kind of shenanigans the people who designed these laws got up to.

  > “So,” I said.
  >
  > Amaryllis looked at me. “Just so we’re clear, this is a purely mercenary arrangement.”

  **DON'T YOU DARE! The ship will not be denied!**

  > “Her as she was when she died?” asked Amaryllis. “If through some magic the Dungeon Master just plopped her right down between us?” Amaryllis waited a beat, as though willing that to happen through sheer comedic value alone. 

  Prime Omake material right there.

  > “I can help with that,” said Rosemallow, who had crept up on the room we were using, and was standing in the doorway, watching us all at the table. 

  Wait, when she did get here? They were discussing some pretty sensitive stuff, notably the game logic, why wasn't Juniper muting the conversation?

  > “These are terrible,” said Amaryllis. “Amarlikeness?”
  >
  > “Pot, kettle,” I replied. “Simuryllis?”
  >
  > “Oh, that’s very good,” said Amaryllis with a smile.

  I think the first Amaryllis should be "Bmaryllis", and the second one "Simuryllis", to keep up the running gag.

  > "Now, I won’t tell you things that the other me wouldn’t want me to: I’m on Primaryllis’ side, fully and completely. But she has explicitly had the thought that interpersonal issues could have a better chance of working out if I, the simulation, made the promise that I would keep confidentiality. Think about it like the library timeline. There, I was free to do what I wanted and experiment without fear of destroying the world or hurting the ones I loved. It’s a tool for conflict avoidance. It’s save scumming for hard conversations."

  Amaryllis is a *serious* munchkin.

  The idea of using clones for social save-scumming didn't even occur to me.

  > “Sure,” I said. “I think it’s … basically exactly what I wanted, or what I didn’t know I wanted. I really care about you, and it sometimes feels like we’ve been married for months already, since there’s a level of commitment we have that feels eternal. Like we’re platonic life partners? And this way I get bonded to you, and I have an excuse not to push it, because it’s just a platonic, fake thing, but you know that I care about you, and in public we just have this comfortable pretending. I think it’s hard, otherwise, to let people know that you have a platonic lifemate. They would get the wrong idea, one way or another.”

  Wait wait wait, this is all great character exploration and stuff, but I think we're missing the bigger question here.

  What the hell is the etymology of "Platonic" in Anglish?

  > “I used to imagine having sex with you a lot,” I said. “You were in my dreams. It was a distraction. Sometimes I would get angry with you for being so good-looking. It was like an assault on my senses, this unwelcome intrusion.”

  I know that everyone involved in this conversation is aware that this is irrational and Not Something You're Supposed to Think, but I still wish they'd acknowledge it a little more.

  > “I don’t know,” I replied. “It’s low stakes, no offense. Getting back on the horse, but it’s a small horse, and it’s going to disappear in less than a day, so if I fuck up, or can’t handle it, or it goes terribly, then I can just pretend that it didn’t happen, because the horse will be gone.”

  ... wow.

  Didn't put a lot of points in SOC lately, did you?

  > Amaryllis and Simuryllis had a private conversation early the next morning

  Who is this Amaryllis you speak off? Clearly the only people here were Simuryllis and Primaryllis.

  Also, we *are* assuming that at least half of that "private conversation" was them making out, right?

  > “I have a question,” I said. “Let’s say that I murder Onion, proving my innocence. What’s to stop me from committing another crime, declaring trial by combat, and then going up against the second greatest swordsman of all time, or whoever takes his place? Do I just kill a person for every crime I commit?”

  Wow, being in Anglecynn is *not* doing good things to Juniper's mental state.

  They need to go back to more dignified matters that he can address with the seriousness they deserve, like murdering Captain Blue-In-the-Bottle.

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    > Onion was so completely fucked. As I read through the virtue list, I was practically laughing. 

    Well, hello there, Juniper's hubris. You're showing up more and more often lately.

    Seriously, the first thing that occurred to me when reading that virtue list was "Oh, so that guy *did* cut a car in two with his sword". Juniper not noticing that Onion probably had most of the perks on that list seems really extremely overconfident of him.

    > “Assume that this is the most deadly serious fight of your life,” said Amaryllis.
    >
    > “When I kill him, can I put ‘World’s Best Swordsman’ on my business card?” I asked.

    I feel really sorry for Mary.

    > I ran forward to attack this work in progress, and was brought to my knees by a glow of green magic that shrieked in my skull. It didn’t stop until Onion was back together, gasping within his armor, whole once more, even the fingers that I’d cut off back on his hand.

    Oh wow, the boss fight armor even has a way to enforce cutscenes built-in. That's convenient.

    > The only difference was that one of the three green lights on his chest was burned out.

    If I were Onion, I would have added some decorative bit over the life-counter gems. That way, even if my opponent managed to kill me, they'd assume I was immortal and probably lose some morale and/or try something reckless instead of wearing me down.

    On the other hand, Onion really wasn't expecting Juniper to kill him even once, so that's an understandable mistake.

    > There was a gel made by an aquatic plant that firefighters would smear themselves with before running into a fire, and chlorine trifluoride set it on fire at the moment of first contact. It was impressive, seeing chlorine trifluoride burn through a piece of starmetal, which was supposed to stop dragonfire, but it really made me think that I was playing with something way beyond my paygrade

    Okay, so I looked for videos about chlorine trifluoride on Youtube, and holy shit this stuff is bad. It can kill you on contact even if you wash it away *and also amputate the affected limb*.

    Like, I'm a little mad at Juniper for trying it in an arena where hundreds of people are watching.

    > “What was that?” he asked me.

    Occupe-toi de tes oignons.

    > “Oh come on,” I said. “You’re going to hide, you miserable coward?” [...] “Are you seriously going to make me come in there?” I asked. 

    Wow. Juniper is really acting like a generic video game boss now. Getting mad at his opponent for using smart, prudent tactics? What an ass.

    > The level up had been witnessed by about a thousand people, and I was guessing that was going to complicate things.

    Oh yeah, that's what's going to complicate things.

      I don't think he realizes that's Uther's heir until the battle starts.

      Previous to that, there are hints, but there's been a lot of fakes before, so his estimated odds "This guy is the next Uther" have to be ridiculously low.

      Also, he still almost kills Juniper. If Amaryllis hadn't teleported out to disable her sword, Joon would be dead.
      ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        That's true but Uther is known for bullshit.

        If some multimage appears after already impossibly breaking out of my blacksites then I personally wouldn't take chances. 

        If it turns out they have some irreconcilable political goals then fine, but Onion seems like a practical guy who doesn't have a lot of political opinions he'd put above his life or his liberty.

        A guy like Onion would be useful in the new order.

        Plus in this fight the whole point is that the wards kill you if you break the rules so if Juniper ever thought he was going to lose he could kill Onion with magic.

        Perhaps that's why he had the armour, so fine the fight up until he kills you once or twice.

        Still doesn't rethink? Not even an attempt?

          Also, Zinnie said that Onion, Phlox and Hyacinth seem to think that Amarillys is setting up a Returned King gambit, so from their perspective it would make sense to make Juniper seem as Uther-like as possible, without him being "all that".

          ```
          >Plus in this fight the whole point is that the wards kill you if you break the rules so if Juniper ever thought he was going to lose he could kill Onion with magic.

          No, the wards stop you from using most magics.

          What the referee told Juniper was basically "If you manage to find a loophole and use magic anyway, we're executing you".

          Although, really, if he'd been desperate enough to break the rules anyway, he could have pulled additional entads out of Sable to kill Onion, and then bailed with another entad. The arena seemed kind of unprepared for that possibility.

          They could have warded the area against teleportation keys, but 1 that doesn't work against other random transport entads, 2 they clearly didn't since Mary managed to teleport out. Prior to the skin exclusion, they could have given Juniper a Fool's Choker, assuming the wards could be tuned to stop him from using skin magic without disabling the choker (and even then, that doesn't work if Juniper teleports to a place with a ward against skin magic).

          I think the assumption was that warders would check that the contestants only brought two entads, and that none of the entads were teleportation related, but that obviously doesn't work with Sable since it can be used to smuggle additional entads.

          Yeah, when you think about it, the opsec of this duel was kind of terrible. There wasn't much stopping either contestant from bailing if they thought they would lose, save for the fact that both of them completely expected to win and made no effort to prepare the other eventuality.

          >If some multimage appears after already impossibly breaking out of my blacksites then I personally wouldn't take chances.

          I dunno.

          This seems like when people complained about >!Superman losing the fight at the end!< of *The Metropolitan Man*. Like, yeah, okay, the character made some really poor decisions, but I can kind of buy that after a lifetime of being completely, utterly unconcerned about any kind of physical harm, he'd just get into the habit of assuming he's going to win any fight he gets in.

          (although, yeah, some kind of line where he goes "Oh shit, you might be Uther's successor after all; I might be fucked" would have been nice)

          I was more annoyed about the dragon lady explicitly recognizing that Joon was like Uther, explicitly saying that Uther kept slaughtering his enemies no matter how much they prepared for him, and she still thinks it's a good idea to blackmail him.

  > I would have laughed at the stupidity of trying to shoot a blade-bound, if I'd been in my right mind, but I would have eaten that laugh, because what came from the gun was a cannonball

  Repetition of entad effects (Bethel as Kuum Doona had eaten an entad that was a smallbore gun which shot cannonballs).

  For a moment I thought it was a hint that Bethel and Val were somehow in the crowd, but of course that would require that Onion's Everysword could mimic non-swords, or swords that had been absorbed into meta-entads.

    Also wanted to say: I was tense/thrilled the whole time reading all these new chapters, for constantly new reasons.

    Was anyone else expecting a dramatic Amaryllis#1-was-Amaryllis#2-all-along twist, or a subversion of that twist? I was sure it was going to happen (despite that not being at all an Amaryllis move) or Joon would bring up the possibility.

  When June was tempting Fate continuously just before the fight proper - man. He's the protagonist, so a part of me was sure he was going to come through the fight fine, but he could not have racked up the Overconfident-Idiot flags any faster or harder.

  Not sure how I feel about the romance. It's well written, no qualms there, and true to their characters. Still, the parts of WTC that get heavily focused on relationship dynamics are the low water mark, for me, and I sort of hope this doesn't foreshadow a shift towards that narrative paradigm.

        Kinda like how Buffy the vampire slayer or a lot of the CSI procedural shows work

    In the last batch, the party went to Anglecynn to resolve Amaryllis' issues with her family (her "cousin" Hyacinth sent the Dragonic Confedaracy at her and Miunun). While Amaryllis negotiated (in Chapter 185), Juniper, Pallida and Solace were captured by Allies of Hyacinth and brought to the Anglecynn black site, from which Juniper fought his way out. Edit: with the help of Solace.

    Edit2: There also was a chapter showing what Val and Bethel are up to, which seems to be talking, manning a sweets shop, and local gang-busting/-reassignment.

  superb. just excellent, thanks for writing as always.

  i remain hopeful that someday hardback volumes of this story will be on my bookshelf. any updates in that direction?

  [“Alright,” said Simuryllis, shrugging. “I don’t really understand it, except by analogy, and I think I’m going to have to accept that. It’s not really a question that needs to be solved, except to the extent that it makes you unhappy, which it seems like it does. So how can we solve it, if we need to?”

  “Soul and spirit modification would work,” I said. “I’m understandably reluctant to try that on either of us.”]

  So I feel like I understood everything else in the Joon/Simuryllis scene, but this question still trips me up. Could anyone explain to me what the problem is they're talking about here? I read over the scene multiple times and can't quite put my finger on it.

      Between Juniper and Amaryllis? Why would that be a problem? Didn't Juniper just say he had come to love her more in a platonic sense?

        He was performing a process commonly known as "lying to yourself pretty fucking hard", aka sour grapes.

        He's obviously still super attracted to Mary, has he realizes when they kiss.
        ```

        - u/onemerrylilac:
          ```
          But even if he was lying to himself, he still believed the lie at this point in the conversation because they hadn't kissed yet. So why would sexual incompatibility be a problem when he doesn't think he wants that? Or is this just a hypothetical to them? Sorry if I'm being dense but I'm still so confused.

            [“I didn’t think that you would be offended,” I said. “It’s just weird. And the sex thing, sad as it is, kind of ruins the romantic love thing for me, because I guess it feels like a rejection of intimacy, even if it’s just a matter of who you are. I know it’s not a rejection, or not meant as one, just an incompatibility.”]

            Its a reference to this. They are talking about potentially making their relationship romantic instead of platonic. Ideally they are identifying potential issues before they come up between Juniper and Primaryllis. There is also the fact that they are married now so they are trying to figure out where they stand with each other. If the conversation goes poorly they would likely keep things platonic. If things go well, they might move things toward the romantic.

  One important question from the update that I haven't seen discussed:  
  How does Onion's fountain of youth work? Is it the armor that was doing that?

  - u/RidesThe7:
    ```
    I think it was proposed (either here or in the story) that he might have gotten a soul mage to reduce his supposed age, and then been "healed" by bone magic or something else back to that age.  I guess that wouldn't register to a warder as any sort of current banned effect once completed.

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Could be (could *always* be) an entad. That he used before the fight but didn't need to bring with him. 

    One which is presumably only temporary and has all sorts of costs & restrictions, otherwise old age wouldn't be a thing for the Penndraig.

  Clarification on **Combo Virtue, Master Blade-Bound**: By "to a maximum of five times faster", you mean five times as fast, which would be a "**gained**" x4 multiplier (aka +400%) at skill 80, or six times as fast, which would be a gained x5 multiplier (+500%) at skill 100?

- u/CaptainMcSmash:
  ```
  I guess I'm the only one that didn't like the fight. 

  There's no tension or excitement in the fight, Joon is going to win because he has access to impossible powers. He just scoops some points from souls and adds them to his own, gets a bunch of op, broken ass perks and wins handily. It's all so undeserved and unsatisfying. A drawn out fight scene between him and someone that much weaker just feels so unnecessary.

  Joon's cocky attitude rubbed me the wrong way too. It felt like a boxer taunting his opponent in the ring because he'd brought a pistol.
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    I think the fight worked for me because Onion had just as many BS tricks up his sleeve.  And I really liked how Onion played so many cliches tropes straight and serious and still made them work.
    ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    This is surprising to me. For the first two layers, it didn't read to me at all that Onion was weaker and that Juniper was winning handily? Onion had the same broken perks regarding swordsmanship, better attributes, and a better sword. The flame thrower was a good trump card that made the second death exciting.

    Third part did maybe have the feel of things already being over - I did in fact miss that Joon only won because Amaryliss tped out at the right moment.

    For a while I legit thought he was going to die and we were gonna twist into the hells arc.
    ```

  - u/wren42:
    ```
    I found the fight pretty fun overall, both sides were fairly OP.

    My main gripe was a total lack of using Sable creatively.  Once Joon was backed into a corner, he shouldn't have just had another backup set of OP combat stats.  It would have been compelling if he were just pulling all the tricks out of the Glove, throwing bizarre shit at this oncoming deadly force while unarmed and dodging frantically.  The godlike "punch him to death" finish doesn't really allow for much tension or growth.

    Maybe the final win comes from Monkish Ascendant, which he thought would be useless - he fills the arena with acidic cloud/vapor, but his Inviolable body renders him immune while he holds his breath with Body Statis.
    ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      Eh, personally I liked that he wasn't experienced with using Sable and that the fight being so soon made it so that he didn't have time to train.
      ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    I loved his cocky attitude. Onion's a fucking prick who deserves zero respect. Getting smacked down by someone who is basically a cheating cocky amateur is the fate he deserved.
    ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    I think this is one of my few major gripes with this story overall: his min-maxing so often ends up feeling pointless because no matter what he does, when it's him fighting directly, he consistently makes it out on a sliver that amounts to a lucky dice roll, regardless of where the natural odds of the situation should lie. Correspondingly, this takes away from the times he does lose things, as it generally feels like merely a forced choice of the narrative.

    But in this case I was fine with it. This fight didn't need to have tension, because it's his violent stress relief from a stressful arc, and I would expect the hypocrisy is there fully intentionally. It is certainly at home with the wider narrative.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      Umm. We just had an arc where he was so broken that he slaughtered every enemy involved and thought "huh that was easy, what was the point of all that?" (Back right after Mome Rath)

      I personally thought the fight was tense. Even if you don't think there will be a hell arc, there are still a lot of potential consequences besides the protagonist dieing. We even got one at the end when he leveled up in front of a thousand people.
      ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        IMO that's the exception that proves the rule, especially as permanant invulnerability ended up being a random perk he got rather than one the team deduced through careful munchkinry.

        > Even if you don't think there will be a hell arc

        There are definitely stakes despite the extreme rubber-banding. The lack of tension I got from this fight resulted primarily from the whole parlay being obvious from pretty much the moment they started planning. There could be a hell arc, but it wasn't going to happen here.
        ```

        - u/burnerpower:
          ```
          That's fair. I don't want to quibble but I can think of a couple more examples of easy direct fights. Juniper vs Fallahter was a trivial fight once it actually started. His fight with the mooks tuung on top of the train was also easy. 

          Funnily enough I think Juniper shares your view on the munchkinry. He's said a few times himself he finds it annoying.
          ```

  - u/GuyWithLag:
    ```
    I think it's boring because there's a single end condition: one of the two combatants dies.

    Joon, well, cant die-diedue to meta-narrative.

    That leaves Onion. Which, while defeated, am not 100% convinced is absolutely dead-dead.
    ```

    - u/icesharkk:
      ```
      There's a good chance that last hit killed his soul. But I hope he is just in hell. I think I like onion the best out of all the villians so far and I think he'd make a terrifyingly awesome Ally.
      ```
