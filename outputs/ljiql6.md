    That Tallheart section was dope.  Just a >!silent terminator.!<

  Wtf did Dozer just do? Weird lil slime bro.

    He saw Rain's cliff and raised an even bigger cliff to hang from.

      He is cliff-bro.

      Personally I'm hoping things get *weird* rather than just a shortcut to reviving Dozer. Like he becomes a semi-sentient support system within Rain's soul.

  Ah, I get the title now. At first I thought it referred to Rain's wrists, but they definitely broke.

  Dozer is unbreakable because you can't break a slime!

  Glad Brovose is alive. For now.Though really, I'm more worried for the Ascension crew. Tallheart should have killed Brovose, before going after Anton. Maybe he just assumed that Rain, Ameliah and Brovose were all dead. Sloppy.   
  If mere sleeping makes Brovose strong, then being knocked unconscious he's more dangerous than ever.  
  Though he'll probably wake up, take Hegar's accolades, explain to the healers how to best deal with the Bleeders to fix Ameliah for some goodwill (and tell them that she started it), stare at them intimidatingly and run in the other direction from Tallheart.  
  That's what I would do and he seems sensible enough to act like me.

  Wonder if his Torpor advantage gets ruined if he drinks coffee.

  For all the concealed whining about this event months in advance I really don't see what was so bad about it. Something happened! We should be thankful.

    Meh, this was where I stopped my patreon subscription. It's not that this chapter is so bad, per se. Something did indeed happen. But when there's endless chapters building to action with ungodly amounts of planning and policy writing and general filler, and then the actual actions turns out to be a forced error based on a predictable yet unplanned-for event, it just loses my interest. I don't read for months to have this be the payout for listening to Rain's idiotic thoughts on establishing Democracy and organizing a company, 

    But whatever, if this is worth it you, then go for it.

  What is with all this negativity? Geeze.
  Cool chapter! I'm really curious about what's going to happen
  ```

- u/FallToTheGround:
  ```
  Lol Rain is such a bitch, fuck is it hard to keep reading and trying to empathize with a MC so “nice guy”ed that he risks his own life and those around him.
  ```

  - u/PriestofNight:
    ```
    I feel the entire fight was too far fetched. Why Ameliah got apeshit crazy when she didn't have a build for pvp? Why not delay the confrontation a couple of days? Some would say that she didn't know they were so powerfull and her silver rank should have been enough. But consider this: Rain ring give more stats than all the accolades of those 3 guys. Good equipment would be enough to bridge the "silver gap". And Ameliah didn't know what kind of equipment they had. She took a stupid risk and she is supposely an expirienced adventurer.
    Why they fight AWAY of a fucking fortified position?
    The answer is because the author needed to have Ameliah and Rain trashed. It is bad writing to a main plot development.
    ```

  - u/DavidGretzschel:
    ```
    Huh?

    I just figured he was concussed, mageburned and not thinking straight.Sure, that's pathetic but that's because being half-and-soon-to-be-full dead is not conducive to not being pathetic.  
    Good thing he didn't have mana for another frost nova. That would have killed Hegar, but also all of Ascension, since they were within 90 meters.
    ```

  - u/Weird_Melody:
    ```
    Yeah I don’t know what it is, but there was something so cringe about him getting his ass kicked over and over again, and continuing to struggle. It just seems like the story grows thin here, and its somehow some fantasy created by someone who was bullied a lot. I’m definitely projecting, but it just comes across as pathetic, this deep into the narrative, not heroic or noble. Especially the whole event is sort of the product of a fuckup.

      Very slight spoilers for future chapters, but I think you might want to see it:

      >!There is a reason for his pathetic struggling that makes some sense.!<

      A very slightly more spoilery continuation of the above point:

      >!During the fight, Rain pumped up Focus using his ring beyond the point of soulstrain.  This caused him to have extreme tunnel-vision during the fight with the goal of "defeat the enemy"  which led to him not being able to really think of anything more tactical than "just keep attacking even when I'm out of mana."  It isn't meant to be heroic or noble, it's Rain making a mistake.!<
      ```

  ```
  There are people who you're glad they die.

  >!2 down, and good riddance!<
  ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  This was actually an exciting chapter with real plot advancement. That especially nice to see since I gave up on Delve months ago and only read the last couple chapters on a whim after seeing them posted here. Glad I read this one, although it ends on a cruel cliffhanger.
