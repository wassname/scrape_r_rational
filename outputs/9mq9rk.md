## [D][BST] National Novel Writing Month

### Post:

November is [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/). Does anyone have any plans to do it this year? October has always been my "National Novel *Planning* Month" so that I'm ready to go for when November rolls around. (I'm in the middle of another project now, and won't have time to do it this year. I'll still be posting/stickying weekly threads for check-ins, discussion, et cetera.)

Here's my advice for anyone in the planning stages:

* Figure out your characters. If you're having trouble with this, just steal from somewhere and strip off the serial numbers. No one is ever going to call you on your main character acting just like Monica from *Friends* so long as you fudge the life details.
* Figuring out characters means asking questions. You don't actually know a character until you know what motivates them, what they fear, etc. For all your principle characters, imagine them in either some stressful situation or faced with a difficult choice, then imagine the resolution.
* Figure out your plot. Dan Harmon's [story circle method](http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit) is a more basic, more prescriptivist version of [Campbell's monomyth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth). It's very easy to structure plots around it.
* Figuring out your plot means trying your best to link the story beats with "therefore" or "but", not "and". Events which are disconnected from each other are *realistic* but don't tend to make for great writing (this bit of advice is one commonly given by [Matt Stone and Trey Parker](http://www.mtvu.com/video/?vid=689002)).
* Write a single sentence description of each chapter. Then write a single sentence description of each scene within the chapter. It's easier to write a novel (and write a novel *fast*) if you're spending less time stuck looking at the page wondering what happens next (though some of that is unavoidable).

As for making all this *rational*, that's just a matter of what direction you take the story and how hard you can hammer on your worldbuilding and plot, looking for ways that you're failing, then trying to shore them up. A good way to do that is talking to other people to get a different perspective. (Making it *rationalist* is an extra level of difficulty that I wouldn't attempt if I wanted to hit 50,000 words in a month.)

**tl:dr;** So is anyone doing NaNo this year? Any plans you need help with or plots that need a second set of eyes? Any questions of rationality that need to be addressed? [See the wiki page for past discussions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/nanowrimo)

    I find it's totally possible to be rational about my emotions. In many ways they're a sense; we call them _feel_ings and e_motions_ after all; both of which are words directly referencing your sense of touch. 

    just because something's objective (and ever-changing) doesn't mean you can't Science! it. Observe, hypothesize, experiment, repeat. Always be ready to be wrong about why you feel what you feel, just like you would with any theory. But, at the same time, don't doubt your feelings (on a sensory level) any more than you would your eyes. It's just also really hard for us to talk about emotions without the words themselves enforcing an explanation; pick an emotion and describe the _literal_ sensations _in your body_ that go with it. One is theory, one is observation.

    You've played through this joke [before](https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3nqi12/dbst_national_novel_writing_month/cvqj7vn/). Also, there's 22 days left to do the planning, you're *fine.*

      It’s wasnt supposed to be a joke. The fact that this still creeps up on me after these years is somewhat mortifying.

        I know, right? And then it has to be in November, of all months. Thanksgiving, final exams...I mean, really. It was such a pain when I was in school.

  I'm going to give it a shot this year, putting my serial on easy mode while I work on the novel.  This year I'm going to amazon self publish SOMETHING.

  Gotta say, every time I've tried this strategy, someone calls me out. Even when I'm only explaining my story idea. People are just way too perceptive. :P

  Overall, some great advice. :) I'm doing Nanowrimo again this year, as usual. Here's hoping I don't fudge my numbers again like the last few years. (Unless 2000 words of character development, deleted scenes and grocery lists counts as "novel writing.")

    It only works if you don't consume the same media as your audience.

    If I write a ratfic with a Miles Vorkosigan expy, everybody's gonna figure it out, because /r/rational readers and I share a common referent there.

    Meanwhile, if I write a ratfic with a [Do Bong-soon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Girl_Bong-soon) expy, then, while *someone else* might recognize what's going on, the average /r/rational reader probably won't. And since the genre of ratfic isn't likely to be read by anyone *other than* "the archetypal /r/rational reader", I can rest easy.

  I plan on picking back up a Worm/Stormlight Archive piece I had started but let die due to my depression. My goal for the month is to have 3 arcs done and the rest of it outlined. Nothing too ambitious.
  ```

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    Cool. Is the portal from the Worm side, or Stormlight? (And will everyone speak the same language?)
    ```

    - u/SkyTroupe:
      ```
      It takes place on Worm's Earth. It's more of a Cosmere crossover than a pure Worm/SA cross but that'd be getting into end game spoilers. I plan on it being a Trilogy story in total.

  Well, there's that Star Wars fic I wanted to do last year. Although I did promise to that one guy that I would edit 
  *TDWoD* for him, so I should probably get that done first, now that I have some free time. Mh.

    Do you mind filling in for me what the letters stand for?

  I'm both busy and at a low point in motivation right now, but I'll probably use the month to make sample chapters for the various stories I've got kicking around.

  Unfortunately, I suspect that even this flimsy non-commitment will amount to nothing. I still haven't finished a short story I started last year, though I'm getting there.

- u/None:

  I'd be interested. Hope I can motivate myself enough.

  I was hoping to use November to finally write my *Doctor Who* spinoff novel, but word on the street is that the publisher is dropping the series, so. I'll start my own spinoff series, goddammit! Of course, as November gets closer, I'm getting more and more afraid that I won't have enough time, but something good will come out of it, I'm certain.
  ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  Hmm.

  I have some ideas kicking around for a MoL-verse fanfic, but I don't feel like they're ready yet, and I want to do it justice. Plus, the main story isn't quite finished.

  I'll give it some more thought.

  I'm still working on the same story I was working on last November. How does anyone manage to finish writing a good novel in only a month!?
  ```

  - u/Gaboncio:
    ```
    The trick is that you don’t write a good novel in a month, just a novel; the rest of the year is for making it good.

      Pretty much this. I haven't participated in NaNoWriMo before, but I have a number of friends who have. (I'm also thinking about putting my hand to it this year now that I'm out of school and November should be relatively available) My understanding is that the single largest obstacle to most people being able to write a novel is getting words down on paper. A lot of people tend to be perfectionists and want their first draft to be amazing, so they start and restart and restart, or they just theory-craft forever. With NaNoWriMo, you're committing to getting 50,000 words down on paper without worrying about their quality. That gets you started, and in the end you have a draft that you improve on instead of being stuck in blank page paralysis.

    People starting new things tend to go overboard, get really enthusiastic, and make mistakes as a result of that. If you pick up hammers as a hobby, everything starts to look like a nail.

    So, for example, when you first learn about the backfire effect, you might see it in lots of different place, an ever-present specter on the sociocultural landscape or common in your friends and family ... when what you're actually doing is falling victim to the availability heuristic, attentional bias, and confirmation bias, and the thing you're seeking to explain has some better/deeper explanation that you're not even looking at because you don't know to and/or you're suffering from cognitive biases that you don't recognize.

      >So, for example, when you first learn about the backfire effect, you might see it in lots of different place, an ever-present specter on the sociocultural landscape or common in your friends and family

      You mean even when the backfire effect isn't actually present right?
      ```

        Right, or when it's only one cause among many.

      > If you pick up hammers as a hobby

      ...wouldn't everything start to look like a hammer-handle?

      (Given that "hammer-throw" is a real part of track-and-field, the heavier "sledgehammer-pick-up-and-throw" seemed like an intuitive kind of strongman-competition entry, similar to deadlifting cars; I was honestly surprised when I typed it into Google just now and it turned out to be something my mind made up just now.)

    When starting out something new, people tend to stick to one method that works for them. They can try a few techniques, but there's usually going to be one thing that they focus on (like "If I say this I can manipulate this person and gain what I want" or "According to the first law of physics...") The technique will appeal to their personality, or their situation will force them to learn and apply that particular thing. As they gain experience, they learn how to apply new techniques. People rarely learn something unless they want to (like pushing yourself to learn a musical instrument because you really like the sound of it) or because they have to (survival/peer pressure).

  heh, I wish. I have a paper deadline and a class project this november, which sucks because I really do want to spend some time writing >_>

  I've never "properly" done nanowrimo, but in past years I have attempted to use the ambient writing energy on the internet to motivate myself to work on my longer-term projects. I can't get anywhere near the rate needed to make 50k words in one month; in my best year, I managed something like 25k words. But since my usual rate is like 10k words / month, I was pretty pleased with it.

  Since I'm so busy this november, I'm pinning my hopes on december instead. Hopefully I'll get some quality writing time at my parent's house over christmas break.
