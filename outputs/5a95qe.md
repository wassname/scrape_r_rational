  All of a sudden, the ship's name makes more sense.

  >THERE WAS AN ETERNAL SEPTEMBER ONE TIME, BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

    What does he lie about? You mean having an extra solar eclipse later and pretending nothing happened? That's not quite a lie.

    What we do know is that the Comet King is much better than the Jene Besseret, after all, this was his fourth child and it took them generations to succeed. She seems mentally stable enough, but that eternal child thing may present a problem down the line. Eh, we should be fine, not even the top 10 likely to destroy the world.
    ```

  Is this the first mention of the Comet King having a son (or Sohu having a half-brother from her mother's side, I suppose)? I only remember female Cometspawn being talked about up to this point.
  ```

  - u/NotACauldronAgent:
    ```
    We knew she had three siblings, TKK had four children from that whole Royal Colorado interlude sequence, and we knew Sohu and Jane were female. I forget, which chapter was the Pentecost chapter? It might have something, but I don't remember.

    Edit: Turns out the third mentioned child is "Nathanda" according to Pickle over in the Unsong Comments. Can't tell if male or female name, though.
    ```

    - u/saitselkis:
      ```
      It was mentioned he had 4 children and 3 daughters...

      I've been positive that TCK's son is 'The Other King'. I first started thinking this when TCK was talking to Sohu about how to love all the world as his children, but to still love his own true children uniquely. Something about it.

      My theory, which I might elaborate, is that TKC lost his wife (alluded to when Aaron expresses that he wants to be TCK 2.0) to some sort of trickery of Thamiel. (Specifically an attack on the CometCompound during the seige of Hell while Daddy was away. Which explains the instant damage indicator on Sohu.) TOK goes full darkside, starts attacking fucking up daddy's plans and letting/knowingly sacrificing innocents because the ends are justified and a pronounced contempt for non-angelic humans. Daddy tries to intervene, and won't push the fight as hard as his incensed, grief addled son. The remaining commetspawn fight their brother to prevent his tarnishing their fathers' legacy and fight Thamiel to see it completed. 

      I'll make a full post about this with passage references and rationale tomorrow. It's late and this has been constructing itself for weeks. 

      Edit: this is turning into a re-read, "tomorrow" was a grossly optimistic estimate.

      ```
      Nathanda is called eldest daughter in the Passover chapter. Sniffnoy pointed out that the son was mentioned in Chapter 36.
      ```

- u/NotACauldronAgent:
  ```
  So, guys, remind me of this:

  When Sohu (IIRC) tells TKK about the Starfish Parable, he designed a spaceship missile system. However, what would that have affected anyway? How do tides work here, if the moon is a celestial sphere? 

  Also, metaphors from this chapter, my brain, ow.
  ```

- u/crivtox:
  ```
  so  then methaphors of methaphors are methaphors, and the name of "not a methaphor" is a meta-metaphor and this fact is a meta-meta-metaphor of   methaphors ?.
  my brain refuses to think more about this
