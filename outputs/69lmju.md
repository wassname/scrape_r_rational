## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  [\(._.\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/4xzmpe/wp_everyone_is_born_with_the_ability_to_skip/d6jsqc2/)

  You have the ability to “skip time”. During a “skipping period” you’re still experiencing everything yourself and with a fully conscious mind, but once you reach the pre-defined end point all that remains from the “autopilot” period is the dry knowledge. What doesn’t remain is all the other changes that would’ve also otherwise happened to your brain and mind.

  So, for instance, if you were to overwork yourself using this skipping technique you would not gradually become tired and depressed because of the lack of rest. And if you were to be tortured during a skipping, you would later have a normal recollection of everything that has happened to you during that period but you wouldn’t develop PTSD because of the torture experience. The integration of the knowledge from a skipped period could be dangerous, but only as much as would’ve been watching [a perfectly realistic first-person VR film,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j98QsMJXJEc) or just watching someone else’s memories. 

  1) How could this ability be used for maximal fun and profit if you were the only person who had it?

  2) [..] if everybody had it?

  3) In what ways would the society be different if everybody had it?

    First off, I'd try switching models (without changing effects), to see if anything becomes clearer:

     - You can make a certain stretch of emotions "temporary".  They are experienced fully as they are happening, but at the designated end-point, all temporary emotions are deleted, leaving only their external effects (for a certain definition of "external").
     - You can erase emotional experiences, but only by setting up the start/end points in advance.
     - You can pass control of yourself to a perfect copy for a stretch of time, and get a report back of what happened at the end, though it is lacking in emotional detail.

    Number 3 doesn't seem very useful to me, due to my philosophy on identity.  #2 is better, but the perspective it takes on time is a bit wonky and unintuitive.  #1 seems as useful as the "time skip" one IMO.

    So, with that in mind:

     - skip over work days (coming back for lunch, coffee, etc.) to avoid burnout, at the cost of having less connection to your coworkers and losing out on useful emotional warnings like frustration and jealousy.
     - Be an impartial judge by skipping once per minute, and making yourself immune to appeals to emotion.  This comes at the cost of being jaded, and also missing legitimate emotional arguments.

  I was thinking of Worm CYOAs and the way they had to balance the sudden, extreme leap in power levels late in the series.

  [This](http://imgur.com/a/ZmWe6) is the latest Worm CYOA. It's pretty polished well balanced ..for the street level. 

  My question is twofold: how efficiently (i.e. lowest points count, ignoring obvious things like PtV) can this be munchkined to take out Scion and how useful would your build be if you got to bring it to our vanilla Earth?
  ```

    Rule-lawyer answer: 

     - 7 pts: Ace (with the power of Ace(with the power of Ace(with the power of Ace(with the power...))))

    Other rule-lawyer answer:

     - 10pts: Replication
     - 10pts: Paramount

    Create a clone, and have it use Paramount to choose Ace, (with Power Fluctuation to boost you by 250%, and Copycat, to copy your clone).  This is the infinite Ace Recursion again, but with more powers.

    Without that specific hack:  Create two clones (in two weeks), have them use Paramount->Power Fluctuation to boost by 250% each.  Use Paramount (which can now choose a power up to 7 * 5 = 35 points worth) to choose Path To Victory for a bit, then follow its instructions.

    Real answer, assuming that they all synergize:

     - 1pt: Phantom Punches
     - 10pts: Combo
     - 2pts: Vampiric Regeneration

    Start punching Scion (at range), and keep punching him.  Get help from a mover when he runs away.  Moderately useful on Earth, but not much better than a gun, or possibly some artillery.

    My initial build isn't very efficient and is probably overkill, but it was fun to come up with. 

    Path:

    Conspirator: I'd prefer Rogue, to avoid any obligations, but the synergy with Iscariot is too good to pass up on.

    Power:

    Kingmaker: 10 points, but this allows me to earn a very lucrative income in two different ways. Firstly, I can detect potential parahumans. I'd probably offer this diagnosis at a reasonable price so that I can have a constant stream of people walking past me to detect if any have potential. It also seems like a good way to earn a positive reputation, and in the long run, having more capes seems like it should increase the odds of coming across a combination that can harm Scion. Interlude 13 gives a 1 in 8000 ratio for urban areas, so assuming I work 12-hour days, 6 days a week, and take 30 seconds to diagnose, I should find 1 potential parahuman every week, on average.

    This would probably have to be affiliated with the PRT, so they can immediately offer their pitch to the prospective parahumans. Depending on the range and visibility of the power, it would be nice to be able to hide myself, so my clients can't see if anyone is doing the diagnostic.

    Secondly, I can also offer a significantly more expensive power rental service, on the condition that the PRT is informed of the person and their chosen power (to avoid clients with villainous intent). I imagine rich people would be willing to pay a significant amount for up to 3x7 points worth of powers.


    Replication: 10 points, but this allows my effectiveness to grow with time. Assuming each clone has its own set of limits for Kingmaker, I can eventually impart vast numbers of powers.

    Followers:

    Iscariot: To start with, having an insider in the PRT will be a great boon in getting my diagnostics and rental business approved, as well as giving me advance warning of any inbound threats. However, it also allows me to massively accelerate my diagnosis services. Each day, I'll ask my clients to assemble in separate batches, each of which will be at the upper limit of how many people I can diagnose in a day. I visit a different one in each of Iscariot's timelines, and pass on the list of potentials to her, so that even the ones I don't visit still get a diagnosis. This is the key feature of the build - depending on the logistics, there should be a very high upper limit on the number of people I can diagnose in a day, and my parahuman diagnostic rate should increase by at least an order of magnitude once this system gets established. 


    Taylor Herbert: I wanted to avoid taking her, but it just works far too well. Besides, I'm quite happy being a sidekick. I'm no tactician, and I'd be awful in a fight. However, Taylor plus Iscariot's simulations seems like a pretty powerful combination, and it opens up the best gift option. 

    Shard:

    The outsider: 2 points, but that seems like a small price to avoid subconscious influence, start with a higher level and higher ceiling, and lack the limitations of the thinker. 


    Perks: Buying time gives me another 3 months of cape identification, and lets me give Taylor a head start on her development too. Carefree lets me ignore most of the setting and focus on replicating, earning a fortune discovering new parahumans and renting powers, and training. These cost 3 points in total.


    Flaws: Identity Revealed, Kidnapping, and We Know all seem certain to come up for this concept, so they make sense to take. Wanted (ABB, E88, and the Merchants) can largely be mitigated by simply relocating elsewhere, I'll be travelling a lot anyway. Lastly, psychic nosebleed shouldn't cause me too much of a problem, as my abilities are largely passive, and I won't be the one doing the fighting when I push my powers to their limits. This gives me the additional 15 points to spend that I need.


    Gifts: The Key. I'm assuming this doesn't include followers. Taylor's life is going to be even more miserable, with flaws of Identity revealed, Kidnapping, Bad reputation, Wanted (ABB, E88, and the Merchants), and Trouble magnet, for 16 points. Eh, she can probably handle it. In exchange, she gets Kingmaker, Replication, the outsider shard, and Manson Effect Bypass. One Taylor is powerful enough, but a growing number, able to impart 3x7 points of powers to themselves thanks to the bypass, each of which would also have no Manson effect either? That seems a little more powerful than the original. 

    To wrap up, I start on the day of Taylor's locker incident. Each week, I and Taylor will both replicate ourselves. The clones are sent out across the planet to identify latent parahumans at a rate of approximately 1 per week per clone, multiplied by 10 to account for Iscariot's simulations. Taylor prime will focus on training, with plenty of opportunities for life-or-death struggles thanks to her flaws. By the end of the 130-week period between Taylor's trigger event and the canon apocalypse, we should have identified about ((130 x 131)/2) x 2 x 10 = 170000 latent parahumans. Additionally, I'll have up to 130 x 3 x 7 x 5 = 13650 points of powers imparted to the 130 x 5 = 650 most skilled unpowered people I can find. 
    There will be 130 copies of Taylor, each of which will have a flexible array of 3 powers of up to 7 points each, all of which can bypass the Manson effect.
    ```
