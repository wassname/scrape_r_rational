## Super smash bros with rational man with a shotgun as the final boss?

### Post:

Wouldn't it be awesome! I would totally play that. Incidentally there is a fan card game version of super smash bros. maybe it could be used to set up a tournament where everyone tries to beat rational man with a shotgun.

  ```
  ...Rational man with shotgun isn't really typed for cage matches.  He works best with preparation and research.  Unless we are assuming he's prepared the level for a proper (read grossly unfair & cheating ;>) terrain advantage, then he might be at a significant disadvantage.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Rational Man with a Shotgun establishes in advance that this is just a game, played for enjoyment and for show, that all weapons are nonlethal, the only way to suffer a defeat is a ringout or time... And he congratulates whoever wins because he is a good sport and guaranteed to survive without harm.

  Then he wears a giant glove-shaped power armor he designed while everyone else was fighting.
  ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  How much control does rational man with a shotgun have? If you're just sticking him in a match with everyone else, rationality doesn't have much benefit. And shotguns aren't great against enemies that can only be killed by throwing them off of the stage. If he builds the stage beforehand, he can just build it to have a place for him and not his opponent, and his opponent will immediately fall to his doom.
