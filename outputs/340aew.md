  Not very rational in my opinion, but there's a lot of transhumanist themes which should appeal to the people on this subreddit.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    > It seems like a series of thinly related vignettes in only vaguely related settings, with reused characters and sparsely explored backstories and plots.

    That's how it started out, but it's gradually moving towards longer story arcs. There's two of them so far: *Hob* starts [here](http://dresdencodak.com/2007/02/08/pom/) and lasts for 27 pages, and *Dark Science* starts [here](http://dresdencodak.com/2010/06/03/dark-science-01/) and is still ongoing. *Hob* and *Dark Science* are thematically very different, but they share a canon. The vignettes don't.

    I'd never really thought about Kim as a fetish object. Her high intelligence, robotic skills, and tendency to philosophise, I can see that much should appeal to us nerds. It's the heroic mad scientist archetype, the same that HJPEV and Agatha Heterodyne are pulled from. Definitely nerd-appeal. But I assume you mean "fetish" in a non-sexual way, unless socially awkward amputees are considered attractive these days.

    I don't want to sleep with her, I want to *be* her.

    Edit: Okay, okay, point made. I can see it now, there's a lot of fanservice around Kim, I just got overly defensive of a comic that I really like. Thank you all for correcting me.

    Second edit: Regarding continuity, it seems I was wrong. [The author explains that all the strips "actually happened"](http://dresdencodak.tumblr.com/post/4031311313/is-there-any-in-story-chronological-order-to), but don't overthink it - Hob and Dark Science are self-contained stories, and neither requires any prior knowledge to fully appreciate.

      Socially awkward is nerd catnip, if done in the right way. A girl that no one understands, who gets into social trouble because she's really enthusiastic about her areas of interest? There's a reason that the term "adorkable" was coined. A *properly* awkward girl is approachable, tugs at the instinct towards protection, and gets points for defying stupid social norms. It's an endearing quality in a character. (In real life, socially awkward comes with a lot of downsides.)

      Also, "amputee" in this context means "has wicked cool robot limbs", which is a definite plus in my book.

      Edit: I don't think there's anything wrong with making a character that pushes a lot of people's buttons like that, for the record.

      it may be a bit overtalked, but i want to take a stab at the general "fetishized" point, because i thought it was always a mild weakness of Dresden Codak; though these days i dont think it happens very much, so perhaps its a past problem. There is nothing wrong with characters being sexy, having sex lives, or even striking sexual poses; but to be non "fetishy" that should come from the character's internal motivation. i think the linked "dating" strips are actually poor examples, because there Kim is actively thinking about romance, so would act in something approaching a romantic way. if in those strips she were to strike seductive poses, that would be fine, cause she *wants* to be.

      However, the Hob storyline also has strips like these:
      http://dresdencodak.com/2007/11/04/the-impasse/
      http://dresdencodak.com/2007/06/30/in-the-company-of-science/

      Where we have random butt shots, and a logic defying semi nude welding/mechanic outfit. im pretty sure that Kim, the character, has no intention of being sexy at all, yet the "audience view" is presenting in such a way as to draw attention to her sexiness. So we are meant to think about her in a sexual/romantic manner in scenes where the focus should be on the words/plot/whatever. So its less about being a "cute nerdy girl" then the way the "camera" focuses on her cuteness/sexiness at awkward times, when the character herself is very much not trying to be that way.

      Shall I assume that you haven't heard of the wonderful visual novel [Katawa Shoujo](http://www.katawa-shoujo.com/about.php)? It's actually a pretty good game to play.

    > Like a lot of the art, but the main female character is tripping along the border of being a nerd fetish object in several different ways and particulars, which is a little ehhh. Not that I don't like that sometimes, but it seems borderline gratuitous for a story-based comic

    To be fair, in *Hob* Kim [nearly went off the deep end](http://dresdencodak.com/2007/12/17/no-side/) and let Hob kill off the human race because she like its replacement better.

      Destroying all humanity wouldn't exactly make her *less* attractive. And there are a few different ways to read that.

      That's [woobie style](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWoobie) though, which is _total_ nerd fetish. Actually I think that's probably the main difference between her and, say, Agatha.

Not that I don't like that sometimes, but it seems borderline gratuitous for a story-based comic, and combined with flimsy plot makes it seem exploitative without being brave enough to really own that.

    I've been trying to sum up my thoughts on the matter for a while, but now I don't have to because you've done it better then I could.

    <rant>

    It's kind of weird how he does that and occasionaly spouts the feminist party line, but I suppose that it makes sense when comic geeks are getting upset about Thor being female. Just wish he wouldn't conflate defending strong female characters with censoring comments critical of your ideology and all the other "ends justify the means" tactics that modern feminism seems to have made a part of their identity.

    Given that the author regularly blogs about empowering women in stories, I can't see that I agree with your interpretation. Perhaps you're making the mistake of automatically assigning female characters seen in any state of undress to being 'a nerd fetish object'.

      No, I think that's weak evidence the other way, given the context of the comic.
