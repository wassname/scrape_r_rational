  >88. Would you consider working for the Machine Intelligence Research Institute?

  >89. Do you think you're trustworthy enough not to let an AI out of the box?

  OH HEY LOOK /u/Transfuturist, I FOUND THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE *OBVIOUS TRAPS*.

    How is the first one a trap? xD
    ```

    - u/None:

      Well, you'll start getting emails asking about how you are with moving to Berkeley.

      But mostly it's a trap in combination with the second one.  The only way to win is working for them when you believe you *could* be tricked.  Saying you're untrickable is the trap.

      :-p

        Right now, I am 100000% alright with moving to Berkeley.

        And yeah, the second one, *obviously.* It's kind of funny how obvious it is. Almost as if it were a distraction for several less obvious traps...

  For those of you with LW accounts, [visit this thread after taking the survey](http://lesswrong.com/lw/nfk/lesswrong_2016_survey/d722) for a karma shower. Post here as well.

  Although not really my cup of tea, I found the survey interesting. I learned something when I was asked to answer this question:

  ##With which of these meta-ethical views do you MOST identify?

  **Non-cognitivism:** Moral statements don't express propositions and can neither be true nor false. "Murder is wrong" means something like "Boo murder!".

  **Error theory:** Moral statements have a truth-value, but attempt to describe features of the world that don't exist. "Murder is wrong" and "Murder is right" are both false statements because moral rightness and wrongness aren't features that exist.

  **Subjectivism:** Some moral statements are true, but not universally, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by non-universal opinions or prescriptions, and there is no non-attitudinal determinant of rightness and wrongness. "Murder is wrong" means something like "My culture has judged murder to be wrong" or "I've judged murder to be wrong".

  **Substantive realism:** Some moral statements are true, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by mind-independent moral properties. "Murder is wrong" means that murder has an objective mind-independent property of wrongness that we discover by empirical investigation, intuition, or some other method.

  **Constructivism:** Some moral statements are true, and the truth of a moral statement is determined by whether an agent would accept it if they were undergoing a process of rational deliberation. "Murder is wrong" can mean something like "Societal agreement to the rule 'do not murder' is instrumentally rational".

  I guess I've never really thought in depth about meta-ethical views. I had an opportunity to think about how I thought today.

  Omigod that was long.

  - u/literal-hitler:
    ```
    It is a rather gross amount of questions.
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      Hm. Maybe I'm just pathologically suited to answering long sequences of questions.
      ```
