## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread, which is being posted manually because Automod is apparently asleep on the job. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I highly recommend the film [Little Women](http://imdb.com/title/tt3281548/). 

  I thought it not only a great coming of age story, but also a really poignant portrayal of four intelligent and rational young women and their differing approaches to romance/courting, which they undertake within the paradigm that was true for most of history until very recently: that marriage signified the final death knell for whatever ambition or potential a woman might have had. 

  This film struck me surprisingly hard, emotionally. I find myself thinking about it often these past few weeks. Truly a great film that can be appreciated on multiple levels(my teenage sister loved the romance and the hunks, for example). Also, the multi level meta-textual ending was very clever!

    Gotta say, seeing Little Women of all things recommends on r/rational is a little surreal.

      Off the wall recs that don't seem to fit here are my favorites, so I try to return the favor. 

      I've tried a lot of strange new things by trusting the taste of people on here, and regardless of whether I like it or not, leaving my comfort zone is by itself valuable to me.

  Id love to find something as depressing as worm, it just hit all the marks. superpowers yet, theyre really people, so much depth given to even side characters that were lucky to have a chapter or two. The clashes between both sides is also pretty neat.
  ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    This probably goes without saying, but have you read Wildbow's other stories yet? If anything, Worm is the most happy and optimistic of the three finished stories.

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I feel like an ass saying this, but if it's a depressing, realistic story you're looking for, Pyrebound is pretty good.

    The setting and characters are pretty novel (if not always likeable), and the writing itself is top-notch. The prose, the pace, the character moments are all well done. It truly feels like something written by a professional author.
    ```

      Wow, thanks!  No need to feel like an ass--I use the word "grim" instead of depressing, but yeah, PB is grim.
      ```

      - u/roboto358:

        Now that sounds promising, grim can mean death, or it could mean mind fuckery for the characters. Im looking forward to this one, thanks guys!

    'Practical Guide to Evil' scratches a few of the same itches - instead of capes you have Named, there's still the hero/villain divide, and (without too many spoilers) there are some enemies or problems where Named need to work across the good vs evil divide. It's also fairly dark and depressing at times. That said, Worm is better-written on the whole, and has more side characters that are slightly better fleshed out. I'd call PGtE 'Worm, but shorter and more tightly plotted, plus it's fantasy instead modern'.
    ```

    - u/paradoxinclination:
      ```
      I'll absolutely second APGtE, but it's actually longer than Worm is at this point, even completely ignoring what there is of book 6 so far (1.84 million words to Worm's 1.7).

  Time to recommend [Lord of the Mysteries](https://www.webnovel.com/book/11022733006234505/Lord-of-the-Mysteries) again. My favourite rationalist novel, involving a quick-thinking protagonist in Lovecraftian fantasy Europe (also inspired by SCP Foundation, Pirates of the Caribbean, One Piece, and video games like Bloodborne & Darkest Dungeon) and a Chinese author that loves setting up 1000+ chapters old foreshadowing. Rereading the novel has been a great pleasure and the writer's seemingly innocent words early on sends chills down my spine after "knowing" what they were hinting at.

  My favourite joke by the writer is how a detective character took the alias of the most famous fictional detective while solving all his cases via magical divination, then bullshitting a convincing explanation working backwards logically when asked how the hell he managed to get to the truth. I believed /u/EliezerYudkowsky had written about how Sherlock's deductions can't be reproduced by the readers in real life at all, and this seemed like a nod to that observation from the other side of the world.

  Be warned that this is translated into English from the Chinese original though, and thus the prose suffers a bit from rather awkward word choices by the translator and some cultural differences (such as weird names for characters).

  Chapters >!after the paywall can be found [here](https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html) and on other sites.!<

    > Be warned that this is translated into English from the Chinese original though, and thus the prose suffers a bit from rather awkward word choices by the translator and some cultural differences 

    This is somewhat of an understatement, based on the early chapters I've tried reading.
    ```

    - u/Rice_22:
      ```
      It's true that if you're not used to reading non-native English works, this may be a large hurdle to overcome. I've devoured so many Japanese, Korean, Chinese webnovels that I've become inundated.

      I hope you bear with it because the plot and everything makes it all worthwhile, in my opinion. Skip some of the fine details regarding the hermetic rituals if you must.
      ```

      - u/megazver:
        ```
        I do read Chinese webnovels and I am fairly forgiving of translation awkwardness and sloppy web serial prose, but the prose in those early chapters I've read in combination with how slow the beginning was, put me off reading any further.
        ```

        - u/Amonwilde:
          ```
          Not the original recommender. I think if you read past the part where he becomes a Nighthawk or whatever they're called you'll enjoy it more. The beginning is pretty odd, he just talks about cooking dinner over and over again, and it's significantly better later.
          ```

          - u/megazver:
            ```
            Thanks. I might give it a go again eventually, when I'm done with my huge TBR pile.
            ```

        - u/Rice_22:
          ```
          That's too bad.
          ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Why is this anyway? I've read plenty of books translated into German without issue. Is there a lack of Chinese-English translators of any talent?
      ```

      - u/megazver:
        ```
        There is a much wider gulf between Chinese and English than there is between English and German and web novels are translated for peanuts by fans.
        ```

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          Oh, those are all webnovels and fan translations. Sorry then. Because that makes sense. I once saw a German fan translation of a Harry Potter book before the official translation got released. It was a funny thing.
          ```

            ```
            > I once saw a German fan translation of a Harry Potter book

            You're not talking about [Coldmirror's Harry Potter und ein Stein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_K5nqr-2gc), are you?
            ```

            - u/Bowbreaker:
              ```
              No. I meant a bunch if Germans actually buying the English book fresh off the printing press, each volunteering to translate a couple of chapters and getting it done as fast as possible so that Germans who can't smoothly read English can enjoy the book without waiting for the official translation.
              ```

      - u/Rice_22:
        ```
        It's a lot harder to properly translate Chinese -> English since they don't share common ancestry, and there's a lot of historical and cultural context involved (imagine trying to explain foreign idioms and internet memes). My observation is that Japanese/Korean -> English is even harder, though.
        ```

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          Good translations are close to rewrites in any language. The German-translated books I read had jokes, puns, idioms, and even songs and poems all in German, despite originally being English or Italian.

          Look, for that matter, how anime is translated into English. Is it an accurate translation? Lol no. Is it enjoyable and telling the same plot. Yes, imo.
          ```

          - u/Rice_22:
            ```
            Oh, I think “good” translation is always a balance between accuracy and accessibility, and the correct balance is highly subjective for both reader and translator.

            I personally prefer the translation to carry as much of the original author’s meaning as possible while still flow smoothly in the translated language, to be considered “good”. The translator’s presence should be as subtle as possible. I am against rewrites with foreign cultural references replaced by native ones. I don’t expect nor want translated works to be the same as if a native English writer wrote it, as part of the appeal (to me) is the exotic differences in writing style and cultural views that can be gleamed through the words.
            ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    My opinion as of chapter 130, which should be noted is fairly early on:

    Category-wise, I would not call this rationalist, and it feels more rat-adj than rational. Although the protagonist feels rational enough, the world doesn't feel like it has any real optimization pressure, and non-MC characters feel a bit ditzy. Klein's power set is generally busted in a way that is bafflingly underutilized, and the whole >!‘Divination Isn't All-Powerful’!< thing feels like exactly the opposite of what a reasonable person should be taking away from the events of the story.

    Entertainment-wise, it's good. It's better translated than most other Chinese web novels, and it's well-paced as long as you don't take that to mean fast-paced. The worldbuilding is engaging, the main character is methodical in a good way, and the story is progressing well. It's not a tense story, or one I've felt the need to rush through, but rather one that is just consistently filling.
    ```

    - u/Rice_22:
      ```
      I’ve made an error. I used the word rationalist when I meant rational. Sorry about that.

      Yes, there are a lot of the adjacent tropes as defined in the sidebar in this novel, and I find the villains and protagonists act in an *extremely logical and reasonable manner*.

      I only got fully onboard this novel once I finished volume 1, myself.

  Current list of updating webfictions that I follow on RoyalRoad.

  Any of the ones listed here scores at least a 4/5 stars for me, usually trending higher.  None of them would I describe as "rational", or even "rationalist" (barring a couple exceptions), but I enjoy them.  Especially when compared to the sheer overwhelming quantity of...lower quality fictions on these sites.

  I can provide further descriptions and discussion of the individual fics if requested.

  *Most Relevant Tags (acc to me)*: LitRPG, Isekai, Fantasy, Psuedo-Rational, Slice-of-Life, Math

  *Author's Description*: What would you do if you woke up alone in a forest in nothing but your pajamas?

  This is a story about a man trying to answer that question as he navigates a world of monsters, magic, adventure, and numbers going up. It isn't all fun and games, though. Survival is tough when you are alone, and the dangers of this world are not to be underestimated.

  This is a world governed by a system of stats, skills, and dialog boxes. It is vital to know how the system works if you want any chance of having a life of meaning. Too bad someone forgot to include the instruction manual.

  *Most Relevant Tags (acc to me)*: Xianxia, LitRPG, System, Sci-Fi, Cultivation

  *Author's Description*: As Zac was alone in the middle of the forest the world changed. The whole planet was introduced to the so-called multi-verse by an unfeeling System or God. A universe where all races and civilzations fought for power and dominion. 

  Seemingly forgotten by the System, Zac found himself stuck in the wilderness surrounded by deadly beasts. Alone, lost and without answers, he must find the means to survive and get stronger in this new cut-throat reality.

  *Most Relevant Tags (acc to me)*: LitRPG, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Dark Hero (hero has questionable morals, but not Anti-Hero), Harem(?), Sexual Content

  *Author's Description*: On the world of Marconen, your first Break determines the trajectory of your life. Calvin chose magic. Without proper schooling or a mentor, the boy is dragged by the whims of fate across the face of the planet, blending together different schools of magic and powerful abilities to create something new.

  But there's a deeper secret behind his success. Why was he born an exile from his country? Why is his System so strange, and why does it keep talking to him?

  And as the march of time continues, something evil grows in power across the ocean.

  *Note: The author includes a 'Harem' tag, which I guess is kinda accurate? But the harem aspect of the story has decreased significantly as time has gone on, and I have not found that it is present enough to bother me.  If, y'know, I was bothered by harem fics. No comment.  This also applies to the level of sexual content, which was never a lot to begin with.*

  *Note: Murderhobo style "rationalism" can be sorta seen if you squint and look at it funny. Ends up being humorous, to me.*

  *Author's Description*: Dungeon: A place full of monsters, traps, treasure, and death. Those are the Great Dungeons, with unplumbed depths below the roots of the mountains.

  That's not for me.

  Dungeon: A place of rape, torture, and death, to control and corral enemies and slaves. These are the Red Cores, from which the mage-kings draw their power.

  That's also not for me.

  I don't like monsters. I don't want adventurers. I want to stay well away from enemies and slaves.

  Fortunately, there are alternatives...

  *Note: While the sexual content is relevant to the story, each chapter with such is clearly labelled before hand, and skippable. It happens to be well written, I think, but the more important fact is that sexual contact happens, rather that the content of said interaction.*

Ancient cities, abandoned starships, temples and fortified bunkers all contain artefacts and devices far in advance of what humans have been able to produce. Technology that feels more akin to magic, so powerful it can allow a single person to dominate a star system. But these relics of another time have been left well-defended and behind bewildering and impenetrable security measures. 

    There are those who are compatible with the alien technology, who can augment themselves to face the evermore extreme protocols in the depths of the alien ruins, and by doing so attain greater power. And there are those who just want to sell what they find to the highest bidder.

    The rewards are high, but you have to be prepared to go further and risk more to discover the greatest secrets of a civilization that vanished long before the first human walked upright. Secrets that could irrevocably change humanity's future, or end it.

      >The Perks of Immortality

      I'm the author of this story, thanks for linking to it. I'm continually surprised at how often it gets shared on this subreddit. I certainly didn't set out to write a rationalist fiction. I'm not complaining. I like rationalist fiction and was aware of it before I started writing the story. Maybe I can't help but write something that has at least some rationalist appeal. But there are many ways in which my story breaks from other rationalist fiction norms:

      1. The MC is by no means brilliant. He isn't dumb either. But he isn't going to make huge leaps in logic or outsmart his enemies.
      2. The MC is a man with a hammer. The hammer in his case is fighting and killing. He is aware that not all problems are nails, but hes only got a hammer so what's he gonna do?
      3. I explicitly avoid the MC trying to munchkin the hell out of his powers. Not because they aren't munckinable, but because his personality just isn't the type to obsess over every little advantage.

      Perhaps the one rationalist thing I have going for the story is that I can easily avoid deus ex machina. The rules of the story allow him to get killed and come back. Unlike most stories that have to break their rules to save the MC, I'd have to break my rules to kill the MC.
      ```

      - u/Amagineer:
        ```
        FWIW, Perks is definitely not rationalist. It is, however, reasonably rational. The world is self consistent. The protagonist is, even if flawed, thoughtful and learns from his mistakes. And large portions of the plot are about his experimentation, learning, and future planning.
        ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    I think Delve qualifies as both rational and rationalist. The setting makes sense and is justified in-world, and the characters are solving real problems using actual intelligence. Most particularly, Rain is Level 3 Intelligent. I think the worst that one can say about the story from this angle is that they don't agree with the details of the worldbuilding or the thinking Rain does, not that it isn't there.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      It's a decent story that I enjoy even though it's lacking any semblance of plot or protagonist agency. 

      My main critique of the story is that  the magic system feels so blatantly built so the MC will appear special. I just don't understand why any system would advance skills/spells depending purely on the amount on the amount of Mana that is spent on them. Really? Not any of a hundred better indicators of progression and familiarity, but simply the resource that it takes to use it? (And which the MC specializes in)

      That's like getting better at math for every pencil you wear down to a nub, or getting stronger muscles the more calories you eat. No, it just feels like the author designed the magic class he wanted, and then worked backwards from there. It's hard to call something like that rational. 

      And I'm well aware that the protagonist is in no way op, bla bla bla. My point stands.
      ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        You could make the same argument about getting XP for killing monsters or completing quests, rather than actually improving your underlying skills. That's just how litrpg tends to work. I do agree that it's cherry-picked for Rain's build.

        > And I'm well aware that the protagonist is in no way op, bla bla bla.

        Rain's build is busted AF.
        ```

        - u/GlueBoy:
          ```
          > same argument about getting XP 

          It would be a dumb argument though. XP is perfect at what it was designed to do, which is to encourage a player to kill enemies/win battles/finish quests by quantizing success and showing iterative progress towards greater power. 

          What would gaining power by spending mana encourage any halfway intelligent person to do, do you think? Does it look anything like the world of Delve to you? Because to me it does not, not in the slightest. Not combined with the fact that:

          * all the relevant skills are tier 0 or 1
          * low tier skill trees can be unlocked by anyone of any other "class" by simply spending a negligible amount of XP
          * XP requirements apparently increase on a gentle linear slope- Rain was able to max level and max skill in a month or so while homeless and destitute. It takes other classes many years to do the same, supposedly. 
          * mage classes can be very, very strong and their main downside is a slow and weak initial power curve. What if they could level up many times faster? 


          and so on and so on.

            I don't get why this matters. Taking a few years to level is hardly onerous. Inconvenient, sure, but hardly worth chosing a bad build to avoid. The key currency in Delve is the level cap, not XP.

            The relevant skills can't be trivially unlocked by simply paying XP for low-tier skills, because Channel Mastery is hidden and most of the rest of the relevant stuff (Prismatic Intent, Aura IFF and Aura Compression) is tier 2 or up. For traditional builds XP is a scarcer resource, which means those won't be discovered by many people.

            People don't pick Rain's build because it's not that good before level 26 (and it's terrible if you aren't support for a good team), which most people won't reach, and because figuring out how broken it gets at level 26 requires having explored the tech tree.

              You're thinking small. Theres a reason that it's very, very hard to get arbitrarily powerful in any given setting. Most who try it die because it's **dangerous** or fail because it's **immensely difficult**. Think 1 in 10 million, or even higher. 

              In Delve you can reach demi-godlike power by simply shooting spells into the air! Besides being present when a blue dies very seldomly (Rain got 18 levels for sneezing on a high level blue) you don't have to get more skilled, achieve any insights, fight reams of progressively harder enemies, or even risk your life slightly. You just have to **spend a lot of Mana**. So if you go a mage class like the dke guy and you hire(or enslave) someone that boosts mana regen then suddenly world domination is 50% easier?

               Does a world where no one recognizes this shortcut to power despite the barrier to knowledge being so low(see last comment) seem rational?

                You can't - you need to kill Blues that are (and this is the important part) *higher level than you are*. Consistently. Rain probably can't even do that right now. 

                > Besides being present when a blue dies very seldomly (Rain got 18 levels for sneezing on a high level blue)

                This is the part that people who complain about Delve's system don't seem to get - Blue monsters are incredibly rare. Tamed dungeons can only produce level ~5 Blues at best. 

                The level 18 Blue that showed up just after Rain teleported in was the only Blue in the area; after all, the flare of mana from the teleport attracted monsters, and it's the only one that showed up. Without the flare of mana, the party wouldn't have encountered the creature at all.

                ```
                No, the world doesn't work like this.

                Teams killing blues max out at fairly small numbers, and blues are rare, which puts a hard limit on how many high rankers there are. At *any* rank, reaching the level cap is acheivable with non-exceptional effort. All a high mana recovery gives you is the opportunity to get to that stage younger, which is practically worthless compared to having a good build. How many people actually have the need to gain 18 levels in a couple of months?

                  If everyone gets the benefit, I would think the obvious solution is to form up a 10,000 person army to go stab a high level blue.

                    There’s a max to party size; around 8-9 in a dungeon I believe. Any more and the dungeon doesn’t let in the last person. 

                    Similar limits probably exist for blues.

          > Rain's build is busted AF.

          Everyone is busted AF, because everyone has ridiculous synergies (243 firebolts, or was it 729?  2187?).  Rain would lose in a 1v1 match against a level 18 enemy, and lose *horribly* against a lvl 26 enemy.  Heck, just look at his theorycrafting for the Passive build.

          (EDIT: Look at the Umbral Charger fight to see how he did as early in level 18 vs. a Level 10 monster)

          Of course, that might change once he ranks up and can start getting more out of Aura Synergy paired with Aura Compression.  Scaling the effect of all of your skills with (max ranks)^2 is pretty good, and what he has is significantly better.
          ```

          - u/Veedrac:
            ```
            At level 18 Rain's build is pretty much pure support. He loses 1v1s because he has almost no attack and almost no defense.

            At level 26 he gets Prismatic Intent, and with all his skills hitting level 15, he becomes completely busted. My ‘PrismInt f26’ build, which has Rain permanantly using Focus in combat (Detection is used to navigate), has

            * 200k armour against all elements,
            * complete shutdown of magic use by anyone else in a 275m radius,
            * permanant Detection with 525m radius,
            * 11x movement speed,
            * all of the above permanantly active with enough mana spare to recover from empty in 22 seconds,
            * and when he wants to do damage he deals out >500k burst, mixed element, in a 62.5m radius.

            Prec f29 is even more busted, when Precision starts letting him run around at 1500x speed.

        I don't think there's anything wrong with the System favoring the MC build, there's a bit of anthromorphic principle at play. 

        What I do mind is the fact that the world haven't adapted to this. If the protagonist build is OP(which there is some debate about) then I need a reason for why it isn't popular and if it isn't OP I need a reason to why the rest of the cast keep being positively surprised about it.

        It would really help if you supported what you said with reasoning.

          Delve the book is rational enough. But I call rationalist as trying to teach or exalt rationalism. Delve just doesn't do that. And that isn't a flaw. All it has is a relatively realistic world built around occasionally smart use of a predefined magic system.

            Right, I agree that it's not trying to teach capital-R Rationalism. I was going more by the sidebar categorization,

  I'm in the mood for a new story that tackles internet forum/chatroom dynamics, like The Northern Caves or 17776. Unfortunately, that's incredibly rare. Any recommendations?

  I will also use this post to second last week's(?) recommendation of [Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl/chapter/442507/chapter-1), a slightly outside-the-numbers litRPG. I'd hardly call it rational, but it's reasonably smart, funny, and the writer sounds like he's having the time of his life writing it.

    I only really have 2. 

    Worm has PHO, Parahumans Online, chapters where people in-universe respond to events of the story, though I think there are only two such chapters in the entire thing. So it might not be what you're looking for. 

    The other is a one shot called "You Know You Have a Permanent Piece of My Medium-Sized American Heart" by tricatular on Archive on our own. A sort of continuation to the film "The Martian" where Nasa puts out an edited version Mark Watney's logs to the internet and seeing the internet react to the events of the film with memes, tumblr posts, and article titles.

      Wildbow does a good job representing online interactions in his stories.

      Pact had a climactic chapter that primarily took place in an IRC channel - it's one of my favorites. Also, the sequel to Worm, called Ward, began with a series of nine 'teaser' chapters each following a different (and at the time mysterious) character through forum and IRC interactions.

    If you're a Homestuck fan, there's [Prequel - or - Making a cat cry: The Adventure](https://www.prequeladventure.com/2011/03/prequel-begin/).

    The story itself is unrelated (it's about a Khajit struggling with depression, prior to the events of *TES: Oblivion*), but the, ah, format is very clearly inspired by Homestuck. It's hard to describe, but really easy to grok.

    Warning: the story is pretty depressing at first. My advice is, try to stick to it past the second blackout; it's the lowest point of the story, and things get better from there. Like, I'm actually serious. Most of the time sticking to a story that's getting you down is a bad idea, but in this case it's *actually* worth it, and it feels amazing to see the progress Katia makes.

    Also there are Homestuck-style minigames towards the later arcs and they're all amazing. Special mention to the Greater Impmaster Murderboss.

    Also, there are side-stories, which are pretty cool on their own.

    ---

    [Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/) has some nice chatroom chapters.

    Warning: the story is currently on hiatus, and the author has personal problems and prior history which... eh, I'd say there's a 50% chance the story ever gets completed. Even incomplete, it's worth reading.

      Prequel is not really what I'm looking for. I'm not asking for interactive stories or text adventures (assume I already read [all the good ones](https://mspfa.com/?s=132&p=1)), but ones where forum or chatroom dynamics are a huge part of the story. 

      I suggest you look at the Blakin character in the Chili chatroom chapters and consider I may already know of it. Grateful for the attempt though. I guess maybe I should write a story myself if I want more of this type of thing.

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    Have you read the webcomic Homestuck? Because it does the internet forum / chatroom dynamics very blatantly, and basically the Northern Caves was written from a perspective informed by the author's experience with Homestuck, and two of 17776's characters bear a marked resemblance to homestuck characters. Homestuck has incredibly good parts and also incredibly flawed parts, with tons of amazing strengths and also total glaring weaknesses. If the strengths happen to line up with your taste and you either don't mind or can look past the weaknesses, it can be a great experience - but if the opposite happens, it'll be a pile of garbage for you. If you really liked TNC & 17776, I think that's at least a weak sign you'd like Homestuck too.

    Edit: I've just noticed your flair references a Homestuck fanfic, so I am pretty sure you've at the very least tried Homestuck; Leaving the rec up for other people, if they are also interested in this sort of thing.
