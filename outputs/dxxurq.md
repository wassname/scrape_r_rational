I'm pretty sure it was posted here. The main character is slowly losing his morality, so he precommits to following a very thorough flowchart in place of  morals.

  Pretty sure it's [*Flowcharts*](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3x58rz/biweekly_challenge_dungeons_dragons/cy1od3m/) by u/Rhamni, a submission to one of the Biweekly Challenge Threads.

    That sounds about right. In DnD casting evil spells slowly makes you evil, so the guy realized he could raise an enormous army, but also that he couldn't stop himself going evil if he did.

    That was a fun read. I'd love to see more of it, but if it was just a challenge thread that's probably all there is. :(

  It may have been an omake in Marked for Death. I don't remember which chapter it was.

  Maybe With This Ring?  Paul worries about the psychologically abrasive elements of the Orange Light of Avarice, and commits to daily meditations on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs to keep himself grounded and within the general human Overton window.

    Sounds like a similar concept, but probably not what OP is looking for. Paul never sets up a flowchart for his actions; at most he meditates and repeats each level of the hierarchy. He also doesn't seem too worried about losing his morality, but rather his sanity (at least so far from what I've read; just started it last week and the fic is fantastic so far).
