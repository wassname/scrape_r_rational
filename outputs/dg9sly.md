      The titles of interlude sets tend to follow a theme. In this case, they've been lines from *[The Many Deaths of Traitorous](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/villainous-interlude-crescendo/)*:

      > **[Rise, rise](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/10/04/interlude-rise-rise/)** | **[all ye villains](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/10/07/interlude-all-ye-villains/)**    
      > You rogues and madmen    
      > Proudly claim the stage,    
      > Of this wondrous age

      > We are not kind or just    
      > Deserving of any victory    
      > We are a thing of dust    
      > Promised only misery    

      > **[So smile, Tyrants](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/10/09/interlude-so-smile-tyrants/)**,    
      > **[And \[so\] let us be](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/10/11/interlude-and-so-let-us-be/)** wicked”
      ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      The interlude chapter titles have been lyrics from a song about traitorous:

      >    “Then let us be wicked,

      >    Let us be reddest ruin

      >    Rent, broken, crooked

      >    Black hearted and cruel

      >    .

      >    Then let us be doom,

      >    To both friend and foe

      >    Fly banner of gloom

      >    We lowest of the low

      >    .

      >    Rise, rise all ye villains

      >    You rogues and madmen

      >    Proudly claim the stage,

      >    Of this wondrous age

      >    .

      >    We are not kind or just

      >    Deserving of any victory

      >    We are a thing of dust

      >    Promised only misery

      >    .

      >    So smile, Tyrants,

      >    And let us be wicked”

      >    – Final monologue of “The Many Deaths of Traitorous”, a play on the reign of the Dread Emperor Traitorous

  ```
  > \[Cat\] had half a dozen other cats to skin, about then, and a limited amount of additional hands in Hakram and Vivienne.

  That's harsh, for such disarming banter. In fact I'll go out on a limb and call it heavy-handed.

  - u/JanusTheDoorman:
    ```
    At this point Indrani is just beating a dead hand.
    ```

- u/boomfarmer:
  ```
  I wasn't expecting the Tyrant to want to duel the White Night himself.
