## Audiobook Recommendations

### Post:

So, having just realized that I have been subscribed to Audible for 3 months without buying anything, I have three credits available for free books.

I figured I'd come here and see if anyone has any recommendations they think would fit well with someone who enjoys rational fiction.

I'll start off:

**[Thrawn](https://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Thrawn-Star-Wars-Audiobook/B01MTYYPKY?ipRedirectOverride=true&overrideBaseCountry=true&pf_rd_p=d0c9c8d2-0cd0-4598-b781-67810111c538&pf_rd_r=CXMJ6WACHCSS5ZRQPTPV&), by Timothy Zahn.**

**16h 56m**

This is an amazing book with an amazing reading. Marc Thompson has a different voice for every character, the story is as gripping and epic as any Zahn Thrawn novel, and for the first time we see the origin story of Thrawn, who is his own Magnificent Bastard self from the moment he comes onscreen to the last second of his appearance. The ethics of the Chiss are in play in all of Thrawn's moves, and they are almost fully consequentialist. The B-Plot is actually a really intriguing rags to riches story, where we watch a character develop over years.

Highly highly recommended. This is the book that got me to subscribe to Audible in the first place.

  I'm listening to The Temporal Void, the sequel to The Dreaming Void by Peter F Hamilton. It's a crazy rollercoaster of a novel packed to the brim with sizzling gypsies...I mean it's a pangalactic space opera with some odd but compelling fantasy elements and some memorable ideas, prose, and characters. Be prepared to concentrate a bit while listening.

  A few of nonfiction suggestions: Better Angels of our Nature, Sapiens, and Homo Deus. Good histories scratch the same world building itch that good sci fi does for me. Very fecund soil to inspire rationalist authors as well.

    Hah, I actually have dead tree versions of Sapiens and Homo Deus, reading through the former now. Also great choices.

  I quite liked the audiobook of Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke. The reader, Simon Prebble, does *very* well with voices and accents. The book starts slowly for a few chapters, but gets faster as it goes and comes to a really solid ending by the end of it all. 

  It's not really rational fiction in any particular way, but is very good fantasy fiction anyways. There is some setup/payoff stuff, but by and large magic is presented as mysterious and is not fully explained to the reader. The characters *mostly* don't act irrationally enough to bother me or anything. The writing is somewhat affected - it's done in the style of writers like Jane Austen, and it is set roughly two centuries ago.

  The Martian *Engineering, problem solving and just a good time.*

  The Feynman Lectures or most Feynman autobiographies.  *The Feynman lectures appear to be the original audio, nuff said.*

  The Quantum Thief *some interesting futurology*
  ```
