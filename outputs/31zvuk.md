## [BST/WIP] [RT] Rational ways to deal with subconscious/unconscious reality-warping powers?

### Post:

Note: This is an ongoing project so I'll probably be posting here again asking for advice at various writing stages.

Anyway. I'm writing a story that involves unconscious reality-warping powers. So far I'm envisioning a low-fantasy modern world setting with very, very few characters having this ability, let along being able to use it properly. 

Mechanically, control over changes effected varies inversely with how much area you can change and how drastically you can change it. Though some characters with the ability achieve a middle ground, there are two irreversible states: on the very low-control end of the scale, you manipulate reality such that all your observations confirm your subconscious beliefs. On the high-control end you can grant yourself eternal youth and have complete conscious control over your own biology, but cannot affect anything else (anything produced by your body through use of your power vanishes after travelling some small distance away from it -- a millimeter, say). 

Obviously there are benefits and drawbacks to being at either end. Notably, with low control, you cannot learn new things -- and you're at the mercy of the impulses and instincts of your monkey-brain. At the high end, you can manipulate your brain-matter, but don't necessarily know which specific changes will achieve which results, largely eliminating the ability to experiment. 

First, **does anyone know whether there is any fiction that has similar abilities as a plot device?** There's a concept called *unmada* in the roleplaying game [Genius: The Transgression](https://sites.google.com/site/moochava/genius) that is similar, but unfortunately it being from a roleplaying game means I don't get to see how it plays out in characterization or narrative. 

Speaking of narrative: **how the heck would I write the perspective of a rational character approaching the low-control end of the scale?** Would they even be able to act "rationally" if they can't make viable observations? How would they interact with other characters, and what would count as holding the Idiot Ball?

Third, in order to really make this a rational story, **what science should I brush up on?** Obviously I'm going to need to stress test the premise further -- which physics/cognitive science questions should I keep in mind? 

Thanks for any help/advice. I'll probably get a blog and start posting chapters when I have a viable first draft. 

EDIT: A possible example of a low-control character analogue would be Haruhi Suzumiya.

  The anime series "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya" is an example. Haruhi has the power to reshape reality to fit her expectations and wishes, but doesn't realize it. It centers around a group of characters trying to prevent her from completely destroying or reshaping reality. 

  [Spoilers](#s " All except the fairly levelheaded main character have supernatural powers as a result of Haruhi's changes to the world.") 

  EDIT: See DCarrier's comment below if you're interested in an Eliezer Yudkowsky fanfiction of Haruhi Suzumiya! Fair warning, you really shouldn't read it if you haven't watched the anime first.

    And for the rationalist perspective, there's Eliezer's fanfic, [Trust in God, or, The Riddle of Kyon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5588986/1/Trust-in-God-or-The-Riddle-of-Kyon). And I'll take this opportunity to advertize my (mostly complete) [visual novel adaptation](http://dcarrier.deviantart.com/art/Trust-in-God-or-The-Riddle-of-Kyon-499378337).

      Just so you know, it's an extremely popular anime, and the light novel series it's based on is apparently even more popular in Japan. This is what people will immediately think of when hearing about a story like this, so it would probably be a good idea to become familiar with the plot so you can make sure you aren't retreading any ground.

  "you manipulate reality such that all your observations confirm your subconscious beliefs."

  I... hrm.  Headache trying to wrap my thoughts around this, and how it would impact state of mind.

  There are so many ways that this could go horribly bad, or extremely well.  Does the ability develop when very young, or would there be an opportunity to establish a fairly solid personality before onset?
  ```

    Even those with the latent ability can't activate it without training in mental discipline. They learn how to control it through esoteric meditation practices (like those that allow control of your body temperature), and through lucid dreaming. Both practices rely on keeping your mind and body separate from your surroundings -- erecting a barrier of sorts between them. Knocking down this barrier is dangerous without the tools to rebuild it if necessary. Practicing outside of the safety of your own mind/body too early can, worst case, lead to a downward spiral that ultimately prevents you from ever having any level of control. 

    So,  option two. What specifically do you mean by horribly bad or extremely well?
    ```

    - u/Farmerbob1:

      Well, on the bad side, being a hypochondriac.
      On the good side, being an optimist.

      You could go to some really, really wrong places with regards to sex and interpersonal relationships.
      ```

      - u/CauldronCape:

        ... Huh. You know, I never considered that the reality-warping would be anything other than a bad thing for everyone else. One of the major antagonists I'm planning is a guy with low-control and a Jim Jones-esque island cult. It's exactly as wrong as it sounds. 

        An optimist would probably be less bad, but I'd see it as being creepy more than anything else. Probably a false-utopia rather than a real one. 

        I was going to get around the question of an optimist meeting a cynic by only giving low-control types power over a certain specific area. I wonder if the headache of finding a reasonable answer would be worth it.
        ```

          With the existence of a prior life, something to base your new reality on, you could probably avoid disturbing people too much if your earlier life wasn't too traumatic.

          It would still require a level of self control that one commonly sees in fictional characters with overwhelming mental powers, like Marvel's Professor Xavier.  Not how he was portrayed in the movies, which has been remarkably weak, but from the comics, where when he took the gloves off, he became extraordinarily dangerous.

          Then there's Franklin Richards on the childish sane side, and Proteus on the young adult insane side in Marvel.  DC probably has their reality-warpers too.

          EDIT  In fact, I think Franklin Richards is probably almost exactly what you describe.

  From a theoretical perspective, this is one of those times when "acting rationally" requires a different approach.

  Normally we assume that the mind is a black box, that it only matters what decision you make and not what thought process led you to that decision. Now, this isn't 100% true, for example a poker player might give away his thought process by his expression, or an athlete might be more motivated by his trainer's disapproval to complete a painful exercise. But in general, it's a pretty good approximation to say that your thoughts don't affect reality until you convert them into deliberate actions.

  But, if your subconscious beliefs directly impact reality, then it might be to your advantage to *deliberately* hold false beliefs. To not think about certain things, refuse to acquire particular pieces of information, because they might be dangerous to yourself or the world. Example:

  >On the high-control end you can grant yourself eternal youth and have complete conscious control over your own biology

  I'm sure someone in this subreddit is going to point out the potential for increasing your own brainpower and becoming a superintelligence. But you wouldn't even *try* that if you didn't realise it was a possibility. Ideally, you'd deliberately not learn about superhuman AIs because you risk creating an evil AI just by knowing about them... but how could you possibly know that knowledge presented a risk before you learned it?

  It's been pointed out on this subreddit that the protagonists of *Gurren Lagann*, while not exactly rationalist, are generally acting optimally considering they live in a world where believing in yourself and doing incredibly awesome things *is the power source that fuels their gear*. Same basic principle: we normally encourage thinking logically and being aware of your own biases, but in some settings that's the wrong approach.

  In conclusion, a lot of what we call "rational thinking" doesn't apply here, a lot of the traits we associate with rational characters would be terribly dangerous with this power, so there's some assumptions to be rethought.

    Interesting analysis, I'll keep these points in mind.

    However: you wouldn't risk creating an evil AI just by knowing about them because on the high-control end you're only affecting your surroundings consciously, not subconsciously. 

    Edit: I like your interpretation of how low-control characters make decisions, but which pieces of information do you think would be most damaging? Would your view of an ideal low-control character immediately cease learning about the world because anything that actually happened would prevent the character from instating something better?
    And how do you think villainous, selfish, or megalomaniac characters would control their own learning?
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      That's just one example. If you believe aliens exist, then depending on how your subconscious thinks interstellar civilisation should work, they could be completely harmless or they could destroy the Sun on a whim. And thinking and learning about aliens would cause them to move around on that spectrum. Which is bad, because the more they move around, the better the chance they'll eventually hit the "extinction event" marker. So once you've created aliens, you should avoid learning about them as much as possible.

      Same for angels, gods, vampires, werewolves, zombies, robots, superheroes, and winning the lottery.

  The Marauder concept from Mage: The Ascension is kind of like this. There's a quest on Sufficient Velocity by Panopticon where the Marauder is a conspiracy theorist. A hardcore conspiracy theorist, who thinks her life is the plot of an action movie. At one point, she rides in on a motorcycle and leaps off of it; it *accelerates in mid-air* and does an action-movie explosion on impact with the baddies.

  Anyway, I would imagine that, if this is a phenomenon that can be trained by prior experience, you could raise a child from birth to have very specific experiences - like, whenever they made a certain hand gesture, a computer would identify the target, and a sniper rifle would shoot it. Once their power activated, they wouldn't need the rifle anymore. What about virtual reality? Raise a child in a virtual reality, and the rules of that place would follow them into the real world.
