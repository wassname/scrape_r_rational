  I thought the bit about "conditionally obscured" laws was brilliant. Its a great little titbit of world building that sent my imagination running and stuff like that is part of what makes reading fun.

    I had to think about this one for a while to come up with something that seemed to make sense while respecting canon.  Of course, the canon Ministry is awful enough that they might well have just had entirely secret laws, that are only revealed to you if you break one, or if someone decides you genuinely need to know (because they're loaning a time machine to a thirteen-year-old, for instance).

    Thanks!

    I've been finding it helpful for me to post the chapter links myself, that way I get comments in my inbox and email-forwarded.  I'm only doing it in /r/rational for the moment, though I try to keep an eye on threads that pop up elsewhere.

  * Official Typo/Britpick Thread, if you are so inclined, helps if they're all in one place

  Finally working my way through this one and while this is many chapter off Tonks introducing herself as (my interpretation) as Mary Sue Bottomwate I.E. Mary Sue Diahriah was a flat **what** that topped my best laugh this month with McGonigal's "Expiditiously"
