## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  [Palus Somni](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25475/palus-somni). I'd highly recommend it to anyone who like horror/psychologial stories. It's more of a slow-burn psychological thriller than the usual fantasy/scifi that I'm into, but it's well written with solid characters. Monthly updates unfortunately, but the chapters are solid.

  A group of nun are essentially stuck in a convent. They haven't had contact with the outside world in quite some time. Something terrible has happened to the outside world, and it's coming for them now. They're all normal people, no special abilities, and they're just trying to keep their world going one day at a time.


  Here's an excerpt (not a spoiler) from the beginning of the story that I really liked and shows off what kind of story it is.

  > [A handwritten note that hangs on the refectory door, yellowed with age. The delicate, neat lettering is still legible.]
  > 
  > Beware the walking beasts, my children, for all shall be lost if you are to antagonise them.
  > 
  > Do not ignore this letter, and make sure all are aware of these rules for I cannot guarantee the safety of anyone who does not follow them. Harriet - I am trusting you to make sure that this news reaches the Nocturnes.
  > 
  > These are rules that all acolytes must follow, for the safety of everyone in our community, and of our very souls.
  > 
  > 1. Cover all light sources at night, nary a single candle for your work.
  > 2. Keep away from the windows. They have eyes.
  > 3. Do not rely on the shutters being closed, act as though any small movement can be seen.
  > 4. Do not make any loud noises. Or any quiet noises that cannot be helped.
  > 5. If they see you, stand still and stay silent.
  > 6. If they see you, pretend to slumber. They do not harm the sleeping.
  > 7. If they see you, do not run.
  > 8. If you run, you will perish.
  > 
  > Follow these instructions, and we shall be safe.
  > 
  > Do not fret without me my dears, I will return soon once I have gathered the needed help.

  > Yours with God,

    Is the payoff worth the foreshadowing? This is cool, but I'm wary of mystery boxes than may or may not ever contain a satisfying answer.

      I couldn't tell you. It's an ongoing series and the main story just started last week.

      I think it's worth reading in large part because it's well-written and interesting. I don't doubt it will come to a satisfying conclusion, though like I said it's ongoing so I can't  be 100% sure of that.

- u/lsparrish:
  ```
  [The Dao of Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic/) is a good series with a lot of deconstruction and munchkinry as the 1000 year old protagonist (originally from earth) is transplanted from a wuxia style cultivation planet to a magic planet with dungeon cores and anime tropes, as the result of a botched ascension. Both worlds are broken/mismanaged in very different ways, which makes for good contrast.

  >!Nitpick/spoiler: At one point, he comes to the conclusion that he needs to put up a Dyson Sphere to contain the qi pollution of the local sun, as otherwise the surrounding universe will be filled with gigantic asteroid golems and such. I thought this was brilliant worldbuilding, however it is followed by what I consider a major oversight in that the MC decides he needs super strong materials similar to Ringworld scrith to accomplish this task. There is no real reason he would need that, because the [Dyson Sphere](https://www.aleph.se/Nada/dysonFAQ.html) in this case needs only to be a power collector, not a contiguous structure or habitat-world. It should be possible to achieve his goal by setting up a large enough swarm of orbiting satellites and statites. More exotic shell type designs could probably be achieved too, by qi based (or magnetic) momentum transfers that allow orbiting satellites to act as support rings.!<

- u/Frommerman:

  I have discovered that what I really like in good fiction is situational humor. Mostly, I am highly amused by setups which allow characters to say absurd, seemingly nonsensical things entirely seriously. UNSONG and The Erogamer do this incredibly well, and the early chapters of HPMOR did it too. UNSONG in particular was fantastic because of the sheer length and complexity of the setups, and also for "There is a kraken: Everything."

  Dumb things said for smart reasons, brick jokes, absurdity taken seriously, I want it all. What other things should I be reading?

  Are there any good stories where the hero is highly charismatic and confident? Most stories always portray the hero as an underdog or even a wimp (e.g. Boku No Hero's Deku) or an introvert with no friends (e.g. Sherlock). I understand that it's to more easily show growth of the character once he stops being so, but it's usually the villain who is made more interesting, slick and confident. Are there any works you'd recommend that avoid these tropes?
  ```

  - u/paradoxinclination:

    A Practical Guide to Evil, the Lies of Locke Lamora, the Dresden Files, and Twig (by Wildbow), all have charismatic and clever protagonists. I'd recommend any of them.

    - u/foveros:
      ```
      Hey, since you mentioned it: I read the first two Locke lamora books recently, and I wanted to ask if I was alone in finding them a bit... formulaic. It's as if every character was following a script and I knew how plot points would end the moment they we're introduced.

    Seconding Twig especially. Sylvester has a healthy amount of ego, and he lives up to it - for the most part. He does acknowledge he's shit at actual fighting, and usually has his friends do that for him, except for those plans that require him to get hurt, which he frequently employs.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      I have dropped twig twice. I really enjoy being in Syl's head but basically all of the plot to arc 6 are self-contained episodes that didn't really move the plot further and  could have been skipped without missing much. Does this change?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It does, I think around arc 5 is when you're introduced to the overaching story. The villains from the earlier arcs sometimes come back later, as well.

        The main plot of Twig is always the Lambs growing up, but there *is* a central conflict, >!their struggle to become independent from the Academies and the Monarchy!<, and that only *really* gets going around arc ten, in the way Worm's central conflict is only revealed somewhere around Arc 12(?).

    He who fights with monsters on Royal Road has a very social and confident hero. I wouldn't say he's highly charismatic, though that's mostly because he likes jerking people's chain. He gets people in a way most heroes usually don't.

  I'm looking for stories with realistic portrayal of skill acquisition (in contrast to the infamous "[training montage](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HardWorkMontage)"). Hopefully, focusing on motivation/[determination](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Tsuyoku_naritai) and overcoming setbacks.

  The difficulty should lie in the training, and the path towards improvement known. The first part of [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning) fits perfectly, but then the focus shifts considerably. The best example I've found so far is [Hikaru no Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go). [Protector of the Small](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protector_of_the_Small) is also quite good.

  Also tangentially related are stories taking place in a learning environment: the first few books of [Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter), [HPMOR](http://www.hpmor.com/) minus the battles, and [Anathem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem) >!(minus the ending)!<. There was a post asking for academy-centred stories and I've tried [Super Powereds](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17879100-super-powereds?from_search=true&qid=8LNZlfqkqx&rank=1) based on a rec there; but it's not quite what I'm looking for.

    The [Prince of Nothing](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40519-the-prince-of-nothing) series by R. Scott Bakker is a fantasy series in which a major plot element is a sequestered society of hypertrained monks. It's a pretty fascinating series.

    Dune also has some concept crossover here, as in computers and computer science being more or less banned.

    The monasteries arent quite as structured and productive as the ones in Anathem, but I'd recommend checking out "A Canticle for Leibowitz". 

    It's a slightly older novel about the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust and rebuilding of society. I guess (kind of obvious) warning that it's a bit dark and the style of its prose might not be for everyone.

    I really enjoyed this aspect of Anathem as well!

    It has a MoL vibe to it because it’s a a 3rd-wave [cargo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult)-imitation of MoL’s core idea. From Mother of Learning to a Russian pulp fiction writer appropriating the idea, to a royalroad translation of said Russian pulp fiction. MoL was initiated [in 10/2011](https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bo4myr/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/eng4mh6/?context=3), while this series was mass-produced at a rate of five volumes in the span of [11.12.2018](https://litnet.com/ru/book/poslednyaya-petlya-b108097) – [19.11.2019]( https://litnet.com/ru/book/poslednyaya-petlya-5-nasledie-auri-b169298).

    CONs:

    * simplistic prose
    * characters’ dialogues, reactions, and decisions don’t make sense. For the sake of railroading into the badly designed predetermined plotline, everything else unnaturally warps out of its way to accommodate.
     * often the narrator will acknowledge that the developments in the current scene / plot arc don’t make sense, will explain them away with a low-effort perfunctory handwave, and move on as if that was enough to fix the glaring writing problems at hand. One commonly used excuse is to blame the unnatural reactions and developments on "alien psychology", whereas in almost every other aspect these "aliens" behave like regular (badly written) humans in cheap costumes;
     * similar to other badly written stories with amnesiac protagonists, almost all characters behave like walking exposition drops instead of real people.
    * prot’s pseudo-Machiavellian thought process and reasoning
     * "at least I now knew that he had really seen us, and that he wasn’t lying to me for the sake of a goal yet unknown to me" — he’s suddenly displaying an unreasonable degree of suspicion about his former teacher without any justification. Also meets him after his bout of amnesia for the express purpose of getting some information about his missing year, but then badly tries to play guessing / mind games with the man for no reason;
     * "A conversation with such a renowned person could’ve even been pleasant if it wasn’t for my rapidly decreasing energy. But, damn it, this game of sophisticated small talk was starting to fascinate me!" — things like this were the default inner monologue of the protagonist from another book series by the same author.
    * prot making baseless judgements about people he interacts with
     * just because of seeing his boss exhaused after a work day and without his "usual mask", he somehow decides that his boss must be a "decent person";
     * then he comes up with an entire paragraph’s worth of opinions and deductions about a female coworker out of nowhere;
     * “For some reason, I was sure that the hologram wouldn’t lie.”
    * the world is a bad juxtaposition of multiple settings (scifi, urban fantasy, DND, LitRPG, time-loop) with no regard to how much sense the outcome setting makes
     * nonsensical setting elements. Example: workplaces for energy donors look like the target audience’s regular cubical workplace, which wouldn’t have been an efficient design for the aliens to implement. 
     * Arbitrary countdowns for his magical powers. • At one point he gets a bracelet that allows him to start tracking his mana recovery countdown, and the very first measurement shows 59m58s. • "My recovery time was reduced to ten minutes and then it stopped decreasing."
    * Hollywood security
     * "I .. opened my browser, and began to .. search [for] information about the central planet of the Velly Empire, the Earth governor, and time travel technology" — the invaders have all kinds of advanced technology, but for some reason fail to monitor the internet search history of the subjugated species for suspicious activity and highly sensitive keywords;
     * they also fail to monitor the energy levels and rates of development for members of the native population to scan for potential rising threats;
     * later on he also makes an "anonymous" phone call to the authorities from his own phone. That’s when he already has reasons to suspect that he’s being investigated, and he’s already aware that there are other, empire-loyal, loopers inside the  timeline.
    * unnatural / unjustified decisions and reactions by protagonist
     * deciding to feed a battery without safety limiter after just being forcefully drained by a couple of mana pirates;
     * he happens to visit a military recruitment office and impulsively decides to try enlisting on the spot;
     * deciding to go and have a drink with a member of royalty of the usurping forces who just minutes ago was unfairly dragging his reputation through the mud. Not only that, but the royalty member himself somehow ends up agreeing to spend half a night drinking with a random nobody;
     * "I reached the club in half an hour. I couldn’t help myself on my way to there and I had to imitate Dumbledore once, turning off all the lights in one of the streets. .. my wonderful abilities made me feel as if they were provoking me to get into trouble. Fortunately, today, I got away with it."
     * "My gaze slid toward the deserted alley. Damn, every time I went to a similar place, I was abducted by battery hunters. However, lightning couldn’t strike in the same place three times. I would run there, check everything, and leave. .. Oh, no! It can’t be! .. blocking my way to freedom, stood two familiar guys .. God damn it, not now!" — ... ;
    * unnatural / unjustified decisions and reactions by others:
     * some princess or whatnot of the invading empire:

    >“It was nice to meet you,” I said. “It’d be nice to meet you in person.”

    >“A request for a personal audience with Princess Ammi has been received.” The hologram that was speaking in an ordinary voice earlier now sounded a little mechanical.

    >Damn! I was just trying to be polite, why do these aliens take everything too literally?!

    >“Each imperial subject can ask to see the princess, but not everyone can figure out how to do this .. I cannot deny the meeting to the one who has guessed to call me, but I can punish if the reason does not meet the requirements.”

    For an empire that spans across multiple solar systems, just statistical chances alone (if nothing else) would make such a rule ridiculously stupid. The dialogue itself also feels really forced. 

    ---

    Anyways, if you know Russian and are trying to decide whether or not to read this story, try *Мир Карика* instead. It’s by the same author, and it does have many problems discussed here (so just drop it if you see you’re disliking it), but at least it features more consistent world-building, has some interesting ideas, is less rushed, and has higher average quality.

  So, I just saw a comment being deleted for asking this question but hey, I'm legit curious and not trying to stir the pot.

  Does anyone have any good anti-nazi fiction? I've been playing my way through Wolfenstein: The New Order and have been absolutely loving it. I think part of it is in most violent video games there's always a part of you going 'this is actually awful, and I would never do this in real life'. In Wolfenstein there's none of that moral greyness.

  I'd love to read some fiction along the same lines. Decent grammar is a must, spelling slightly less so. I prefer longer works that I can fully immerse myself in; multi-million word epics are always welcome.
  ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    You are probably going to have to be content with, like, Star Wars stuff and similar?  

    Like...'the bad guys are an evil empire that wants to exterminate minorities' is super double popular.  Lots and lots of YA stories have these kind of deals, and 'they won and now we have to do a rebellion' (wolfenstein style) is also really popular.

    But it is very rarely Actual Nazis.  You will almost always be dealing with analogs.  I don't think this is out of any weird authorial sympathy for 1940's villains, but just because if your setting is space or the past or the future past or an alternate world or whatever, really anything but WW2, it is just less work to put in your own analogs.

    Soo...I think you can definitely find stories about rebellions against evil empires, but I think the nazi comparison will always be by analogy, rather than stories about punching Literal Space Hitler.

    While I wrote the above I tried to think of a few of our sub's favorite ratfics, and actually we have something of a parsity of rebellion works right now.  I think it is because ratfic antags tend to be more, hrrm... all encompassing, yeah?  Like, the Nazis are fundamentally an 'in-context' problem.  Nazi world looks a lot like ours, with different flags and slightly fewer people.  Without going into spoilers a world where the antags from Ward, Practical Guide To Evil or Worth The Candle win are much more transformed.

    If you want a story where the heroes use their brains and cleverness to repeatedly make a mockery of the nazis, but which is by no means rational in the slightest, then the 60s sitcom Hogan's Heroes is still really funny.

    It's trite enough that I can't even find a tvtropes page for it. Lots of things that play with the idea of Nazis, but very little that's just like nazi-killing revenge fantasy stuff. I'm not sure how much you can actually explore the theme of "Nazis are bad" with out juxtaposing it against some other theme.

    What would good "anti-nazi" fiction look like?

      Probably a mixture of alternate history and spy v spy type shenanigans. A fantasy version of the Turing/Enigma race could be cool as well.

        Ah, well how about "the man in the high castle"? "Dire:time"?

    You should definitely watch Jacob Geller's video on the game if you haven't already. It's incredible https://youtu.be/DQQdnve5fQk

    If you mean alternative history, I enjoyed reading [Making History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41014989-making-history) by Stephen Fry a few years ago. It's based on the "A time traveler tries to kill baby Hitler" trope, except the guy made everything worse because as it turns out getting rid of Hitler doesn't get rid of anti-semitism or do anything to stop the rise of nationalism.

    Is it the strong moral black and white element or the Hugo boss aesthetic you are interested in?


    Right now you go to the right news sites and you are getting nonfiction on the subject which could be more or less the vibe you are going for.

      It's a mixture of both. Black/white morals are fun in todays day and age because moral greyness is played out in practically every story, but it is just so much *more* satisfying to punch nazis.

    Try [Have Spacesuit, Will Travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_Space_Suit%E2%80%94Will_Travel) by Heinlein. Might take awhile for them to show up.
