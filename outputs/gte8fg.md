Summary: There are trainers, and than there are great trainers. This is how I became the very best of them.

Other Info: Influenced from Lamora's Game of Champions,  50CaliberChaos's The Sun Soul, and Vile Slander's The Saga of Kings, amongst many other fics.

Chapter 9 where Red has a bit of a breather after barely surviving his encounter with the scyther. 

Stay safe everyone!
