    Heh, yeah. You should do a few of these -- you've clearly got the snark for it.

    In fairness, it probably WAS possible. Based on the episode I just did, where setting off an explosion next to a huge pile of naquadah was going to make an even bigger explosion...well, the feeling I get is that naquadah is unstable and goes boom if too much energy is applied. Quite possibly, turning that thing into a bomb was as simple as duct-taping a grenade to it and pulling the pin.

  I'm quite enjoying this little series you're doing, eaglejarl. Seems the Stargate series had quite a few issues with the TV production regarding common sense and logical courses of action. How do you decide which episode to write a parody of?

    Oh, also: for the most part, this show is damn smart. The acting is excellent, the plots are interesting and fresh, there are arcs but they are deftly handled so newcomers aren't totally lost, and it's pretty rational. Keep in mind that you're only seeing the ones that are worth parodying, and note how far apart the numbers are. There were a bunch in the first couple seasons that I didn't get around to doing, but after early season three the parody-able episodes are getting thin on the ground.
