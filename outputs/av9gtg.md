  I really appreciated the part where Cat recognizes her bond with Indrani as something deeper and more precious than the bonds she's had of romantic love or sex. In fiction, it's not often that a platonic relationship (or in this case, a platonic aspect *of* a relationship) is treated as equally important as romantic ones, much as less as *more* important.
  ```

  ```
  >“Or is it just that you alone of all the world were born under a victorious star,” Indrani said, distance closing between us. “Fate’s got plans for you, eh? Catherine Foundling can bleed, can scar and lose limbs, but she can never fucking die.”

  Peach it sister

  Of course cat doesn't actually address any of archer's valid concerns. "Everyone dies eventually, therefore I am perfectly justified to be as much of a careless idiot as I want"

  Can we have a chapter of Archer just repeatedly punching her, I think she deserves it.

    ```
    What other "better" actions could Catherine have taken in these situations? Tyrant and Hierarch were new entities, and considering that Tyrant had at least acted friendly towards her, she had to take that calculated risk to find out what the Tyrant was after, and gain extremely valuable information (+Black's whereabouts) in the process, and she learned a little more about how the hierarch's power works thanks to the encounter. And as she herself said, if she didn't immediately rush to Sarcella, the third army would've been wiped.

    > “If I was always careful,” I said. “If I was all prudence and planning, hiding behind my people and leaving every battle to be fought pass me by – if I did all those things, Indrani, would we even be having this conversation?”
    ```

      Did you notice that Cat didn't mention her preparations to deal with the Saint? This conversation was a neat chance to see her censor herself to try to navigate which stories to activate. A good contrast with how Warlock spoke to his family just before the end.
      ```

      - u/cyberdsaiyan:
        ```
        in story, yeah but we do know that she has a story-based artifact (the sword) that she's been slowly feeding night to, a sword that'll be unsheathed for killing one particular foe.

        That's the awesome part, we know this only because we're seeing her headspace as the canvas of the story. In-story, nothing has been mentioned and the mechanics of how she's going to do this aren't clear either, so we have something to look forward to.
        ```

          ```
          A couple of people have mentioned feeling uncomfortable looking at the staff, so it's not totally unnoticed.
          ```
