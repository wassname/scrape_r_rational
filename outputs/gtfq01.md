## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  There is an Oracle that can answer yes-or-no questions. Answers are guaranteed to be correct. If the answer is subjective, then the Oracle says whatever you would say, given all relevant information. You would not receive any information beyond yes or no.

  You can ask 10 questions. What do you ask?
  ```

  - u/Dezoufinous:
    ```
    "Will you reply 'no' to this question?"
    ```

    - u/Trowaway2738:
      ```
      If the question cannot be truthfully answered, then you will receive a random answer. The same is for nonsensical questions.
      ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      Since one cannot truthfully answer this question with either yes or no, it is not a yes-or-no question and the Oracle ignores it.
      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        Aha! Ask questions that you expect to be not yes-or-no and you can verify many of those expectations without losing one of the ten questions, then learn something surprising about one where you're wrong.
        ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        "If your answer to this question were yes, would I immediately become omnipotent?"
        ```

        - u/Trowaway2738:
          ```
          No.

    1. Oracle, does there exist a question X which I could pose to you which would result in those aspects of my CEV which could be fulfilled within a simulation being fulfilled within a simulation generated as part of the process of determining the answer to question X?

    2. (If 1 is yes:) What is the answer to the hypothetical question X described in my previous question?
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      Simpler: What is the answer to the question I should ask?
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Sorry, I donâ€™t get this. You get a yes to both, what have you gained?
      ```

      - u/grekhaus:
        ```
        The knowledge that somewhere in the Oracle's inner workings, there is a simulation which contains everything that I would want to be present within a simulation, including the ideal number of simulated versions of myself to enjoy those things.
        ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      The answer to question 1 is always no. A perfect oracle necessarily runs on hypercomputation which isn't possible in our universe, also known as magic. A magic oracle proabably doesn't come to its answers by simulating reality, but by just knowing the answer. There could be something outside reality with all the answers, but you just get ten of them.
      ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    The default best form of question seems to be "Should I direct everyone to pursue this line of research?". 10 bits  increase the chances of successful AI alignment quite a bit.
    ```

    - u/meangreenking:
      ```
      This assumes that people know/believe you have a perfect oracle or that you have a significant amount of power/influence already.

      If neither of those are the case then while you know the answer it doesn't really matter.
      ```

  Now: **Neutrino**

  You have the ability to shift into a form entirely made out of neutrinos.

  You can control how weakly or strongly your neutrino body interacts with the ambient world. With a minimum level of effort, your neutrino body interacts with the world enough to allow you to push off against hard surfaces. However, this level of interaction means that you become somewhat visible, much like a neutrino in a neutrino detector emits a flash of light. Except you're not a single neutrino: you're on the order of 7^27 neutrinos (by some estimates, that's how many atoms are in the human body).

  When you perform these sorts of interactions, you lose the interacting neutrinos. These lost neutrinos are deducted from your power's pool. When you run out of neutrinos in the pool, you revert to the non-neutrino form. Converting to the neutrino form takes one body-atom-count of neutrinos.

  The number of neutrinos in your pool is 10 times the number of atoms in your body. The pool replenishes at the rate that naturally-occurring neutrinos intersect your body. While you choose to absorb neutrinos, you cast a neutrino shadow in all directions.
  ```

  - u/kraryal:
    ```
    Wouldn't you instantly start sinking into the ground if not always using the minimum level of effort? Neutrinos seem to have mass so you'd be affected by gravity. (And if they didn't, you'd shortly fly off the earth as you continued in a straight line and it curved away from you.)
    ```

- u/BoxSparrow:
  ```
  Whenever someone says something negative about you, you are able to hear it regardless of distance, volume or language. How would you exploit this?
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Become an inspector, in a small enough domain that your targets will know you as a person rather than a faceless bureaucracy. Some people will talk negatively about you in the context of trying to hide their illegal activities from you. 

    (Might also work for a spy as long as their cover job is sufficiently inspector-like. That seems harder to set up and less likely to pay off; but a success could be much more valuable.)

    Become the face of an organisation or product. You will have a finger on the pulse of public opinion / customer satisfaction and advance warning of enemies / competitors. Drawback: you will never get a single moment of quiet.

    Broadcast your name as a strong radio signal. Find out if there are any alien listeners in our light cone.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Assuming that I'm not promptly deafened by people saying negative things about categories that include me (such as the ever-popular "all other drivers are idiots"), and assuming that I can sleep through it should it happen at night, then there are a number of things I can do.

    - I know what are the negative things that are *most often* said about me; I can try to fix those shortcomings.
    - I have a one-way, untraceable means of communication that requires no equipment on the other person's end, merely that the message be phrased in a way derogratory to myself. I can probably exploit this somehow...
    ```

    - u/ramjet_oddity:
      ```
      If you are a spy, you can use this for communications from Base. Or a better thing to do is to be the Communications guy at Base, and spies can contact you by insulting you. Requires that you have a low profile though, and act nothing like James Bond.
      ```

  - u/vokoko:
    ```
    That already exists, it's called 'social media'. It's not great.
    ```
