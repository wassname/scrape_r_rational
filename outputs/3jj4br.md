  OK, this is more of a teaser than anything, but it's a fun little read. I will also point out that I have promoted Seth Dickinson's short work several times on this forum, cuz he's an incredible Rationalist author, and I absolutely cannot wait to get my hands on this book.

  Ha.

  Actually, fun fact, I have a sibling named after a protagonist from that series.

    Hmmm, let me guess.

    Your sibling's name is...
