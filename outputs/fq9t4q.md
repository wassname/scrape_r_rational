  Note: this is a four chapter batch, so there are three other chapters aside from the one linked above. Also, [you can read this on RoyalRoad as well,](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle/chapter/473773/cooldown) if that's your preference. Next set of chapters might be on the slower side: shelter-in-place order means that preschool is shut down, which means that I have about fifteen hours less per week that I can devote to writing.

    Sorry about that. I should have followed your preference of posting all 4 of the chapter titles in the post title.

      Doesn't really matter to me, I just have a format that I follow. I do have a preference for RoyalRoad, for reasons outlined in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fc4uyj/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_185191/fj8jo1a/?context=3). But it doesn't matter that much. (I'd also probably have marked this as the end of Book VIII, as I know some people only catch up when there's a defined stopping point.)

  Not an Aerb idiom btw. I think AW made a similar joke like this before, though I forget where

  Cooldown:
  The conversation with Raven was very interesting. I don't think Juniper was in the wrong with his bloodthirstiness. I do like how Raven approached the conversation though. (Mostly. There is something to be said about her disrespecting his wishes for downtime, but I can understand why she wouldn't want it to fester.) Even if I don't think he did anything particularly wrong, it was worth talking about. I'm actually getting a little worried about Raven. I had wondered why she never put in the time to master a magic besides library magic, but to hear that she had and it had just been stripped from her is rough. I know loyalty is a bad metric and that she is an ell, but its also a little concerning how low her loyalty still is. I do think Juniper is making a genuine effort to connect with her, but most of the time it's just been a little off. That's the vibe I get.

  I have less to say about Grak and Amaryllis. Juniper and Amaryllis continue to get along really well. It's interesting to see how they are meeting each other halfway. Juniper is putting more effort into being a better person and she is putting in the effort to be more empathetic and understanding. Good stuff. Grak is becoming scarily powerful. I'm not even sure how you'd counter him if you had too. (Short of something that's explicitly bs like Shia or a dragon.) A little worrying to see him question Juniper's sincerity these days. Its unfortunate that loyalty is always there in the background poisoning the well. In Grak's defense they almost certainly would have never become friends without it.

  Coda I:
  Well. What a way to bait us before leading in to the upcoming horror. Honestly, I don't feel bad for Hyacinth. She brought every bad thing that happened to her on herself. Maybe there was an alternate path that would have prevented all of this, but I find it hard to believe. If she actually cared about Larkspur, then that path was ruined by him trying to actively hunt down and murder Amaryllis through brazenly illegal methods. Even worse they had abandoned Anglecynn with no plans to come back. Hyacinth actively dragged Amaryllis to Anglecynn then has the fucking gall to act like what happened is somehow their fault? Yarrow and Zinnia committed the greatest taboo on Aerb in an act of unprovoked aggression. Hells, Amaryllis tried to work out a deal with her. If Onion runs black sites like the one Juniper was put it is clear that he is just as guilty as the rest of them. I'd buy that he cares about his family, but it doesn't give him a pass for being so immoral. No. She gets some small amount of pity for the baby and that is it. If she hadn't been so brazenly self centered maybe she could have pulled her head out of her ass long enough to realize she is the architect of her own doom. (Not a knock on the writing, just my reasons why her guilt trip didn't work on me.)

  And then Shia LaBeouf out of nowhere, but not actually because his existence was very cleverly reminded to the reader in the previous scene. Juniper handled him very well, its just a shame about the dragon who was also carefully foreshadowed. What a great way to end the chapter. The dread was palpable.

  Coda II: I gotta say, the mental image of Shia with his arm buried in a gold dragon's eye was not one I expected to have today. Watching everyone pull out the big guns to fight him and seeing him just shrug it off was excellent. This story has a gift for engaging action scenes and its truly incredible how varied they can be. I'm surprised that the GM hasn't smacked down Juniper for unicorn bones yet. I know it is a limited resource, but its bailed him out of a lot of fights at this point. I'm expecting them to run out of bones, try and kill a unicorn for more then get it excluded. Either that or more opponents like Shia who have some ability to counter it. 

  Family: Damn. I liked Pallida. Rough for her to be gone so suddenly. (Of course she's not actually gone, but for the purposes of the time scales the story works with she is.) Not terribly emotional about Gemma for similar reasons that Juniper laid out. I think I covered my opinion on Hyacinth relatively well earlier. Good on them for killing Rosemallow. I'm worried about Amaryllis's emotional state, but Rosemallow always seemed like a dangerous ally. In retrospect meeting with her at all was a huge mistake from a loss of life perspective. From a personal power perspective I think this is probably one of the best possible outcomes for the group. Amaryllis's new virtue is bonkers. It is the perfect bonus for her and to some extent seems to be the DM accommodating the group's general distaste for politicking. I look forward to seeing where the story goes from here, and I wonder what tricks Blue in the Bottle has up his sleeve. (Assuming they still do that quest.) Probably some truly degenerate necromantic effects beyond even what we've already heard about him for it to be exclusion worthy.

    > The conversation with Raven was very interesting

    It has a lot of parallels to [the conversation we see between Juniper and Tiffany in flashback](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26687037) where she's talking about him taking Arthur's death as an excuse to be self destructive and lash out. 

    > “I worry that you,” she stopped and bit her lip, “I worry there’s a part of you that’s sinking into it. It’s … well, my uncle, he has a CCW license, and the way he talks about maybe having to use it one day it’s like you know that he’s just high on this fantasy of getting to shoot someone to death.”
    > 
    > “You think I wanted Arthur to,” die, but I couldn’t get the word out. The words were coming out monotone anyway, devoid of the anger that I should have been putting behind them.
    > 
    > “No,” said Tiff. “No, no no no, it’s, the thing I’m trying to say is that it’s like you’re waiting to show people how much you’re hurt. And I get that. I want to scream at them too, to ask how they can just keep carrying on when he’s,” dead, she couldn’t say it either, “gone. And I know that I was this, interloper, I wasn’t his best friend, I know it’s harder for you.” She was quiet for a while as she blinked back a fresh round of tears. “I’m worried that you’re hurting, and there’s something alluring about the pain, because it’s a righteous, meaningful pain. I,” another sigh and a deep, steadying breath, “don’t want you to keep going down this dark path.”
    > 

    But in that case he dismissed her as not understanding, but with Raven he's more open to it, which shows a degree of character development. 

    Good to see the companions noticing/calling him out on his behaviour. Interesting none made the connection to him manipulating his Spirit to remove pain that was discussed in the thread for the last set of chapters. Actually, did he ever tell them he did that?

  ```
  Hyacinth is the kind of antagonist I hate the most. One who gets self-righteously outraged that you dared defend yourself against them.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    My read would be that she considered the first stages of their conflict to be part of the standard "game" that the nobles play. Which has implicit rules on how much it is okay to escalate. 


    But Onion escalated it by kidnapping Juniper et al, (which she either wasn't part of planning, and Onion did it because he's a sociopath who considers "the game" beneath him. Or she considers it acceptable to use violence agaisnt a nobles minions, not them directly). 

    After that, from her perspective, June and Amy escalated by moving from a legal battle to a trial by combat that killed Onion with a figleaf of legality. Then they poisoned her and Phlox to cement their power. (Again escalation outside the accepted bounds) So she responded with the only weapon she had that matched that level
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I disagree.  I think Hyacinth is fairly representative of reactionaries throughout History, because she doesn't generalize ethics.  I think the defining line for her character was,  "we never would have done what we did if we'd known what you were."  The only thing that her side ever respected was power.  They'd have tried to kidnap, mindfuck, and kill without remorse.  Power is something that is used against the less powerful, and it's better to destroy everyone than give it up.  The other side is evil because they're the the other side, and thus anything is acceptable to destroy them.

      Her side was already grossly violating the rules well before the group went back to Anglecynn.  Onion already was using trial by combat against other people before she was even born.  Larkspur was making deals with Doris Finch, which the text seems to imply she knew about.  Her side sent paramilitary agents after Amaryllis, and she never shows having the slightest second thoughts after she found out about this.
      ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      I think she was earnest from the beginning that killing lackspur was an emotional blow. It's possible amy is projecting her own lack of emotions and attachment and hyacinth was never manipulative. From her perspective they were fugitives that killed her husband and poisoned her unborn child
      ```

    - u/nohat:
      ```
      I mean she tried to assassinate Mary multiple times, and was clearly in on the kidnapping attempt. Frankly its surprising more people don't retaliate with the Cannibal.
      ```

      - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
        ```
        How many of those assassination attempts can be cleanly laid on Hyacinth? Given that Rosemallow clearly only views her relationships instrumentally, and Mary's death could've been an effective bludgeon or scapegoat for all kinds of things.
        ```

        - u/wren42:
          ```
          Agreed. I had a suspicion early on that rosemallow was manipulating the whole conflict to bring Mary back in the fold.  Hyacinth might have had very little agency in the end
          ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    I would still have liked to know what her actual value metrics looked like. How much of her excuses were genuine to herself and how much was just selfish power grabbing that she either lied to herself about, or just to everyone else.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Similarly I wish we'd seen Rosemallow's values when Juniper was using soul magic on her. Its still unclear whether she actually cared about Amy and believed her reasoning that it was for the greater good. (Though I imagine narratively that was deliberate on the part of the author)
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    She was also drugged up by Rosemallow and potentially just a catspaw.

    Notably Rosemallow had the ability to poison her family members at will and a cloning entad.

    I would guess the "real" story is Onion vs. Rosemallow, the classic direct leadership w/ swordman vs political realist manipulator.  Juniper and Company just took the Rosemallow route to the end and then killed her.
    ```

    - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
      ```
      Yeah - if we have any more Anglecynn, I hope we get some more details about Rosemallow. She heavily influenced Mary, who has been our central POV into the political machinations of the Lost King's Court.

      Was Mary raised by the worst spider to perceive the world as a spider? The text repeatedly implies that Mary is over-cynical, seeing everything as a calculated act of manipulation. How many moments of "is this just an act?", and then reflexive self-doubt "why am I thinking it's just an act?", have we had?

      Hyacinth claims that Onion and Larkspur had straightforward, authentic relationships.  There's very little "playing the game" in personal interactions that gets revealed in the Anglecynn chapters. She's growing warmer to Joon, and I wonder if that's going to extend to her remaining cousins, too.
      ```

  - u/aeschenkarnos:
    ```
    She is an obvious narcissist, which seems to run in the Penndraig family.
    ```

- u/sibswagl:
  ```
  Man, I feel for Amy here. I think she ultimately made all the right plays against Hyacinth, but you can *feel* the optimal path just out of view. At what point was this course irreversible? Could they have avoided killing Larkspur? Larkspur was after them from the start, this wasn't just a case of murderhoboing, but it still feels bad.

  And then the one-two punch of Rosemallow. Just oof.
  ```

  - u/Jarwain:
    ```
    I feel like a big issue is that she doesn't take the emotions of other Penndraig's seriously, likely because of how she was raised and her interactions with Rosemallow.

    She never took Hyacinth's emotions seriously, and believed that she was acting. She was skeptical about the pregnancy and was ultimately biased against sincerity from Hyacinth.

    Of course, Rosemallow's background machinations were the other half of the issue, and not one easily discovered
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I don't think it's just with other penndraigs, not taking into account people's emotions is a recurring issue. See with Esuan (tuung mother) being upset about the loss of culture even after the discussion, trust problems with Fallateher, and even her early actions with Juniper. On a party level it's an issue that Joon always defers to her about people stuff when him or another party member might be better
      ```

    - u/newgan:
      ```
      Even until the very end she was not taking Hyacinth seriously.  I felt really bad for Hyacinth in this batch, the way she was explaining it Mary and Juniper really seemed like the villians
      ```

      - u/MadMozgus:
        ```
        I didn't take Hyacinth seriously either. The bitch was hostile to them from the start. It's hard to feel sympathy for the idiot that keeps poking a sleeping bear and then feels affronted when she ends up getting mauled.

            Just going by the facts I can't think of any Penndraig who didn't deserve what they suffered through when they became a target of the Council of Arches. Keeping in mind that the number of those were only 7 (I'm not counting Shia's many victims).
            ```

            - u/i6i:
              ```
              Going by which facts? We don't actually know anything about these peoples real motives and circumstances which is very much by design. It'd be entirely unsurprising that Amarilys getting pulled back into Anglysh politics was a play by Rosemallow for which Hyacinth served as a useful patsy and that from their perspective Onion's faction was always facing steep odds fighting both against world ending threats and a corrupt aristocracy on the verge of staging a coup. 

              That was kinda the point of these characters that they're what Juniper and his merry band of co-conspirators look like form the outside.

        ```
        I don't. She and hers repeatedly sought out the conflict, she doesn't get to paint herself as a martyr no matter how much she loved her little cabal.

        Yes, Mary didn't take her grief seriously and it turned out to be real. Her grief was also something she used to distract Mary while her forces abducted and tortured Mary's allies.

        So she can't really complain about having what little humanity she has ignored - she was weaponizing it.
        ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        It was Hyacinth that made Amaryllis come back in the first place, which makes any justification about how Amy is trying to grab power and must be stopped ring hollow. Hyacinth wanted her stuff, escalated without stopping, and got surprised when her victm's power proved boundless. It was her machinations that put the Kingdom up as collateral, and now she lost.
        ```

        - u/AntiChri5:
          ```
          Not just her stuff, but to *force her into sterilization*. Literally mutilating someone for your own political gain. And people think they should have gone full shonen and devoted all of their time and energy to making nice with this kind of enemy?
          ```

  - u/nohat:
    ```
    The optimal path against Hyacinth was assassinating her long ago. She had gone after them so many times with absolutely no provocation on their part, sicked dragons on them, ambushed a peace negotiation, plotted to have them kidnapped, tortured, soul screwed. There was no possible basis to work with her, and leaving her alive was leaving a dagger at their back -- a Surprise dagger as it turned out (a capability they knew she had). After fighting so long to keep Hyacinth alive for no real benefit, and massive downsides, Amaryllis suddenly kills Rosemallow despite it being much more practical for Rosemallow to stay alive and help them. I'm really not sure what that's supposed to mean about Amaryllis's character growth. Did she learn her lesson from Hyacinth? Does she just love her mom a lot more than she lets on to herself?
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      Rosemallow was inherently untrustworthy. Her background machinations helped escalate the conflict far beyond what the party was comfortable with and is the reason Hyacinth went off the deep end. Killing her was the smartest play considering Rosemallow murdered Amaryllis's mother who was her ally at the time.

      That said I do agree that they should have assassinated Hyacinth. For all the moralizing certain members of the party did about Juniper's bloodthirstiness, it turned out one strategic murder would have saved a lot more lives. Though to be fair thats only easy to see in hindsight. I think considering the knowledge they had they made the best decisions they could.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        I mean they really couldn't have seen the Shia Surprise coming. Evil and murderous political enemies only rarely end up strapping on a suicide vest when things don't go their way.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          Especially since they had critical information missing.

          From their perspective, Onion agreed to a trial by combat, and died after trying to kill them. He knew the risks when he went in; Hyacinth would have known that, and wouldn't have killed herself over it (even if she hated Mary and Joon for the rest of her life).

          What pushed her over the edge was her unborn child being killed. She told them about it, but Mary and Joon didn't take it seriously because *they're not the ones who did it*, and it just didn't occur to them that someone else could have poisoned Hyacinth until it was too late.

          From their perspective, they played completely fair, and they won. From Hyacinth's perspective, they killed her unborn child out of sheer pettiness after killing everyone else she cared about.
          ```

        - u/t3tsubo:
          ```
          If they took her emotions seriously and at face value, they could have realized that grieving enemies with nothing to lose often do put on suicide vests.

          - u/Empiricist_or_not:
            ```
            It seems Hyacinth was following her faction course: it's the next logical escalation step after a chain of kidnapping & soulfucking facilitated by deploying an indescriminate death effect, deploying the greatest swords-mas in the world and him getting destroyed, and the relative decapitation of the faction and its future leadership (the most direct line candidate being aborted cements Mary's line's power).

            I do think Mary was making a good play recommending counseling and i don't see much better rotes, assassinating Hyacinth was more pragmatic, but there are enough slippery slopes already in play.

          Except Zinnia did the exact same thing just a few days ago with that death-duplicating creature that she released. June was punished in that instance for hesitating to resort to violence immediately, and then they were punished again with Hyacinth. By the rule of three, Rosemallow presented the exact same situation but this time the lesson was learned and the GM rewarded them for it. They learned whatever lesson the GM wanted them to learn, but I wouldn't be surprised if the GM then stabs them in the back during the next adventure for doing the exact same thing.

            They absolutely did not learn any intended lesson because there was no intended lesson. The GM is permissive and plays ball, meets expectations. He gives them a reward because they fulfilled the companion quest, even if not in a way he would've intended or even enjoyed.

        Oh, I agree about killing Rosemallow, but they could have probably left her in position, learned her secrets, and tied up Anglecynne in a bow, their supposed goal. That was never an reasonable option with Hyacinth. Rosemallow is a schemer, but she's never actually acted against the party (not counting Mary's mother). She also has really good reason to be careful, and history of being cautious. As for Hyacinth, I've been advocating her for murderhoboing for a while -- it was clear that going in to negotiate with her was never going to work out.

          > Rosemallow is a schemer, but she's never actually acted against the party (not counting Mary's mother). She also has really good reason to be careful, and history of being cautious. 

          Her reaction to being told "Give up power, or we kill you" was to answer "Not going to do it, you need me too much".

          I'm reminded of that Twig quote that goes "when you have an institution that's designed to breed cutthroats, every now and then you end up with someone who just can't stop cutting".

          The pattern with the Penndraigs so far has been that they just can't stop themselves from backstabbing people, even when it's really damn clear it's going to get them killed.

          Yarrow's reaction to being told by someone he knew had killed a kaiju (sitting next to one of Uther's knights) that they would kill him if he used his entad was to go "Meh, you don't go anywhere in life by listening to threats" and use the entad anyway.

          I'm pretty sure if they'd let Rosemallow go, she would have been exactly the same. She would have kept pulling shortsighted, sociopathic grabs for power, no many matter how many times she got caught, no matter how much Joon threatened her, because in her mind *consequences are something that happens to other people*.

            I think you are correct about Anglecynne, but I don't think Rosemallow is short sighted. She is very long sighted. She is the opposite of Hyacinth because she only backstabs with careful consideration of the long term consequences, whereas Hyacinth does it over and over, trying to salvage the failure of the last betrayal with an even higher stakes betrayal. Fully giving up the reigns would be giving up the game, something that Rosemallow apparently believes would lead to disaster. She believes that rationally Amaryllis knows she is worth way more alive than dead. Knows that she can prove her (medium term) good intentions / behavior to this uber soul mage, and figures that Amaryllis is negotiating. Amaryllis says "the offer on the table is..." Rosemallow refuses, and makes a counter offer. Amaryllis responds by killing her. I think Rosemallow didn't take Amaryllis's emotions regarding her mother into account, because Amaryllis should be very logical and optimal like Rosemallow is, like Rosemallow trained her to be. So I suspect Rosemallow would have been the perfect ally, while very carefully building a lot of contingencies to betray them, that might or might not have ever been triggered.

              Amaryllis was logical and optimal, its why she killed Rosemallow once Rosemallow declared herself "too important to be killed or removed from power".

              Rosemallow killed her way to the top and manipulated a whole lot of Anglecynn from behind the scenes, either Amarylllis kills her or she surrenders Anglecynn to the woman who killed her mom and raised her as a optimizing machine.

      Rosemallow was the one who deserved the suspicion and attention, she was effectively Amaryllis's mother (by killing her mom) and raised her to be an effective tool in politics.

      Having reached a point where Rosemallow says pretty clearly "yeah I'm staging the 2nd Reformation and you're the tool for the job!" along with "oh yeah I killed your mother, our political rivals and also spent immense effort to arranging everything" you kinda have to stab the mastermind before they do mastermind things.

      Amaryllis got clowned on when Rosemallow said to her face "lol im not retiring you dumbass, i'm your mother (cuz i killed her) and you need me!" and then Amaryllis killed her.  Either they kill Rosemallow or surrender the kingdom to Rosemallow the entrenched operative who thinks she's too valuable to kill.

          I really don't think there was any other option.

          The word "sociopath" gets used a lot in these kinds of story, but I think it's accurate here. Rosemallow was convinced she would never get caught, that she would never face consequences for her actions.

          She kept thinking that *even after she got caught* and Mary told her to her face "Accept our terms or we kill you".

          Juniper had the right idea. If it had looked like she was cooperating (and it didn't), that'd just have meant she was preparing another backstab.

      I'm fairly certain this is the complete opposite of the real path the narrative hints at. I'm fairly certain the "optimal path" for all of Amaryllis quest required both her and Joon to be very different than how they are. The whole quest line seems built on the idea of long term investment in the characters within it, which Joon and Amaryllis are completely incapable of at this point.

      ```
      After soul-searching and clearly finding out she murdered Mary's mother my guess is Rosemallow would never trust them not to eventually kill her after she's served her practical purpose and thus she would immediately start planning against them. It seems terribly unwise to have such a powerful opponent and let them prepare against yourself while fooling yourself that she has practical purpose.

      Hyacinth didn't seem to be such a big threat in comparison and they couldn't have possibly known it would escalate in this manor so it makes sense not to outright kill her.
      ```

      - u/nohat:
        ```
        I mean Hyacinth might not seem like a threat because she's failed so far, but when someone repeatedly tries to kill you, backstabs you during negotiations, and is generally utterly untrustable, you know its going to end poorly. They totally could have anticipated the Cannibal. They knew he was narratively likely to show up eventually, and they knew she had that capability (and the lost kings court is generally the primary risk factor for Shia Surprises). Sure they wouldn't expect her to sacrifice herself, but it was definitely a possibility, and it was a given that she would escalate, likely using some unknown and terrifying capability (like that snake bomb monster dropped on them in ambush that no one but Raven even knew existed, and could have killed them with no warning or defense).
        ```

  - u/Reply_or_Not:

    > At what point was this course irreversible?

    My guess is that it was the interaction where Hyacinth was begging June and Amy to say why they killed her husband.

    Remember how June asked Amy why she played that interaction so cold and Amy only tried to “figure out her angle” never once imagining that her grief was real and that Hyacinth had no alternative motives
    ```

    - u/nohat:
      ```
      Remember she refused to admit to going after them, despite their offer of a quid-pro-quo in the supposedly private room. She was also using her supposed grief to lure them into ambush both times. So even if her grief was genuine she was using it to backstab them.
      ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      Did this happen? The only scene I can recall is in the mirror room chapter when Hyacinth demands that Amaryllis confess to murdering Larkspur and Juniper wasn't there. Obviously even if Hyacinth had no ulterior motives confessing would be lunacy. Especially since Hyacinth was arguing in bad faith and her people were attacking Juniper as she had this conversation. She even rushed a deal so that Amaryllis couldn't figure out what she had done before making it. I'm pretty sure they were already past the point of no return with Hyacinth the moment she sicked the dragons on them.

    >At what point was this course irreversible?

    I'm not sure irreversible is the right term, but it's pretty clear that Hyacinth was truly grieving over Larkspur's death and wanted the simple truth about his death from Amyarillis in the Mirror Room ( Chapter 185). After A. refuses to acknowledge her part in it, H. leaves to sic Yarrow and Zinnia on Joon, Raven, and Pallida in the Prince's Room (Chapter 180).

    Additionally, if Amyarillis and Joon had spoken earnestly after the trial (Chapter 193), somewhere private as she asked, perhaps Hyacinth wouldn't have unleashed ACSLB.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      I think you got your timeline wrong. Hyacinth sicked Zinnia and Yarrow on the group before ever stepping foot in the Mirror Room. When she left she found out that it had gone disastrously wrong which is why she rushed back in the room to make a hasty deal. It's also why she desperately argued to prevent Amaryllis leaving the room to find out what she had done. The whole "deal" fiasco was done in bad faith by her the entire time.

      Also she was blatantly trying to lure them to a killzone where she would summon the Cannibal. Her emotions may have been genuine but she was trying to use them to manipulate Juniper and Amaryllis.
      ```

      - u/westward101:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure my timeline is correct. The text isn't chronological, it splits for a few chapters to show different perspectives. Plus things didn't go disastrously wrong for H, they went (almost) as planned. 

        While it works emotionally, there in Chapter 185:

        " If Raven was here, now, walking into the Hotel Delzora, then when had the enemy action in the Prince’s Room happened? It must have been during the meeting, but when? The obvious answer was that it had happened when Hyacinth had stepped out, or been precipitated by something she’d said to someone on the outside, but that meant that she’d made a contract in a hurry because they had been trying to kill Juniper in the other room"

        Hyancinth's emotional state after the trial is similar to that in the Mirror Room. More bitter obviously, but I think there was still a chance at that point of straight dealing with her and avoiding the nuclear cannibal.
        ```

        - u/burnerpower:
          ```
          I'm pretty sure framing a full scale magical fight in Uther's castle with a skent being released and Yarrow catatonic as things going almost right is a bit generous. I do admit that the quoted passage is some evidence for your interpretation. That said this was just a guess from Amaryllis after the fact and the timeline is never 100% confirmed. In the dumbest entad chapter the party waits five sentences before Yarrow/Zinnia show up. In the Mirror Room chapter: "Hyacinth arrived in the Mirror Room after not too much time had passed, late, but only fashionably so." This to me indicates Yarrow/Zinnia were already in the room with Juniper's group before Hyacinth ever entered the Mirror Room. To my mind Hyacinth never really cared about making a deal and the whole thing was just a pretense to soulfuck the party and turn them on Amaryllis while she was away from them. She just wanted a confession so she could feel better about all the aggression she was about to unleash on Amaryllis.
          ```

          - u/tarkalak:
            ```
            Yarrow had that earplug the whole time, and Zinna confirmed (after being soulfucked) that they were not supposed to attack them if the meeting went well. So Hyacinth went out of the room to order the attack.
            ```

            - u/burnerpower:
              ```
              Ah. Forgot about Zinnia confirming the timeline. Sending a message via earpiece does explain how that could work. I will concede that I was wrong and that at this point there was still a chance for a better outcome with Hyacinth. I do still think that using the meeting to set up such a possibility does still constitute an element of bad faith dealing.

      Umm... He actively brought five helicoptors and a small army to hunt them down. You think he had some other objective besides killing the party?

    And darned if my thought did not turn out to be correct. Look how many lives would have been saved (probably).

    But then the plot would have been short-circuited and there would be a lot less hand-wringing.
    ```

  - u/AnimaLepton:
    ```
    Larkspur is explicitly mentioned early on by the people trying to kill Amaryllis in the Risen Lands, but they don't meet Larkspur until Chapter 38, immediately after going to Cranberry Bay. It's possible that a different path of action early on could have avoided him, or other quests could've come first, which could've changed the nature of the conflict. In Chapter 37, to address the Rat Rot and Soul Magic concern, they were also considering heading to Quills and Blood or Caledwich- Larkspur could've still tracked them down due to Doris Finch/the elf reserve, but maybe Caledwich would've meant standing for trial rather than getting into a firefight. Somethings would've gotten worse, others would've gotten better.

    Furthermore, that's just for meeting him. There are a good dozen chapters between when they meet him and when they kill him, including the chapter where they come up with exclusion zones and potential quests. Because Juniper keeps pushing it off, I'm always curious as to what quests/storylines would've been in play if they'd done 'They Say You Can’t Go Home Again' or 'Straddling Worlds' early since they were seemingly earlygame quests. Assuming rat rot and boneitis are constants, once Amaryllis' rat rot was cleared, there were a lot of chain of events that could've led to picking up soul magic. 43 is when they get a bunch of quests, including Kuum Doona. 57 is the start of the next major quest after Larkspur, breaking Fallatehr out, but breaking him out early would've changed things, let alone being able to come to a temporary agreement with him.

    For the point of no return, I think handling the final conversation better (with empathy) would've helped, and even summoning the Cannibal someplace secluded might've actually been better for Joon and Mary. It's the little things that add up. More realistically, it was probably when Rosemallow killed Hyacinth's unborn child.

  [A while back](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dnp2ne/rt_worth_the_candle_ch_172176/f5zhygw/), I thought Mary had taken to the bible because of endings and beginnings, alphas and omegas, but really biblical themes pervade the entire overarching narrative: creation, the problem of evil and allowance of suffering, the apocalypse, finding faith in an imperfect world, redemption, the promises of the one true God, and [possibly spoilery theory] >!a sacrifice of the son of "God", who also *is* God!<. Where Mary's gone faithful (which is quite rational with theistic proof), Joon's taking the Übermensch approach.

  Joon continues his streak of either stomping his foes or getting stumped.

  Stupid anagram: Maritally His Ms

  'di era' means you, right?

  - u/Executioner404:
    ```
    I don't know how planned an anagram like that was, but we really should've seen all these religious undertones coming back when she became the Virgin Mary.

    It would not surprise me in the slightest if Joon kept his one leg, at least for a while. He seemed very confident that Solace would fix them up "better than before" - just like she did for Grak, but Druidism doesn't always work on proven certainties.

    Not to mention that she *already* fixed the missing bones in his leg just a short while ago, and both she and the Locus are going through shit.

I'm going to have to go re-read the Causal Angel again but the parallels and contrasts, to a character there, who I think, grew up knowing their own purpose and that it was determined by their society instead of by an overgod they haven't met, might be interesting.

      Never heard of Causal Angel before, is it good? IIRC *Paradise Lost* and lots of biblical exegeses also dealt with the dilemma of free will given an omniscient overgod.

  I'm just sitting around and wondering how much Rosemallow influenced the story.

  We had Amaryllis get Zone'd in a rushed trial for nonserious crimes, at which point everyone sent to deal with her dies and she starts popping up all over the place.

  The reason WHY she got Zone'd is probably the same reason Larkspur was trying to kill her; Rosemallow.  As she was raised as Uther's direct descendant by Rosemallow with hilarious inherited power, wealth and directed education she was intended to be an extremely useful tool to change Anglecynn.

  With limited information (and poor memory) we have the Phlox/Onion faction doing these things to oppose Rosemallow.  Joining the Host, talking to Larkspur, Hyacinth or Onion would've potentially led to different routes.

  Then Juniper and company blunder into Anglecynn, cozy up with Rosemallow kill Onion and accidentally drop a dragon on the seat of government.  Valencia, if applied, would've been able to diplomance.  Instead Amaryllis went and found out her mom sucked.

  TLDR;  Rosemallow won because she killed Amaryllis's mom, she lost because she raised Amaryllis.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    > The reason WHY she got Zone'd is probably the same reason Larkspur was trying to kill her; 

    From the perspective of someone else (like larkspur) there's no reason to think that Amaryllis is anything but totally loyal to Rosemallow (her substitute mother who trained her to be a political player). Sure she didn't stop her getting dropped into the exclusion zone, but she then almost immediately escaped, coincidentally picking up a bunch of powerful artifacts and allies in the process. If you don't know what Juniper is it seems like an obvious setup

    So everything where she is trying to get away from Anglecynn can be read as the Rosemallow faction building up an independent powerbase outside the control of the normal Anglecynn political system. Which is a scary thing.

  Also Amaryllis totally modified herself to have more emotions. She's... different, now. In a way I both like narratively and in the prose. Warmer.

    Yeah, going with the Aerb as therapy theory, my guess about the next step is how he deals with being in a position of power over others (while earlier arcs were him dealing with equals). 

    So far (with the guards and onion) he seems to have relished the power somewhat sadistically. Now that he has all the power of Anglecynn at his back, on top of his ridiculously powerful combination of magics, he has to start making decisions where he has all the power about how he'll treat people now.

      There was some talk in the last thread that he might be under the influence of cutting a bunch of spirit threads during the torture to stop the pain, which might have made him a bit more murderess than he might otherwise have been these chapters. Although it might just be natural progression as well. The adversaries this time around were pretty ruthless. In hinsight, it would probably have resulted in a better outcome for the most people to have cut the head of Hyacinth at a much earlier time.

  The Hells, I did not see that coming, awesome chapters and it seems like I'll have to start another reread.

  I also think the age old question of "who's stronger: The Cannibal or Fel Seed?" became a bit clearer, while I really thought for a few seconds Joon might actually die and we'd see a hell arc the Cannibal is a bit weaker than I expected him to be, he can't fly and can be stilled by magic and while you can't kill a meme as we've learned with Finch, he can be stopped and kept in place even without the paper bag. So I think Fel Seed could just bury him in the magic he(/it?) has acquired over the years rendering Shia immovable and basically a prisoner.
  ```

  - u/nohat:
    ```
    I think the thing is he becomes immune to anything you do to stop him. So it will work, for just long enough to have hope, then stop working to crush that hope. Even unicorn bones time loop stopped working on him. Maybe the antimeme bones would have too, but we hopefully won't find out. So I think Fel Seed's power would prove useless against the Actual Cannibal (unless he is Uther and knows the trick). I guess maybe Shia would keep eating Fel Seed's limbs, but never killing him because he can grow them back instantly. Except of course the DM would totally keep the players from cheesing the final boss, because Joon is that kind of DM.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:

      > Even unicorn bones time loop stopped working on him.

      It got weaker. I wouldn't say it stopped. Though if Juniper kept doing it I wouldn't be surprised if at some point he begins the next loop with the injuries he got in the last and the Cannibal is still where he was when the loop ended.
      ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    > he can't fly

    I wouldn't rely on that. He had plenty of people to kill below him, and he doesn't generally focus on targets. I suspect if Juniper simply tried to fly away, at some point the Cannibal would jump at him from below, or fall on him from above. Or just attack Joon after he lands.

    But the bag does make him a lot weaker. I wasn't aware of this weakness.
    ```

  - u/adgnatum:
    ```
    I did greatly raise the probability that Juniper was about to die and thereby start a Hells arc.

  Quite the conclusion to the book!

  Juniper has been seriously injured on plenty of occasions and promptly restored by his leveling ability.

  That said, aspects of the interaction between the soul and level ups have already been presented to us ("Boneitis" quest). And for symmetrical limbs he can copy from the other side. I wonder how that plays into his prosthetic. His soul will be the template used upon his next level. If the prosthetic is that great, maybe his soul shouldn't have the leg either.

  As for the injury >!to Amaryllis!<, that was unprecedented. At a few points in the chapter Juniper did something deserving experience, but never enough to level. That doesn't apply to anyone else. A more enduring consequence.

  Next: clones. As described, the clones wouldn't be able to use entad prosthetics. That might also be a constraint on the nature of the restoration/replacement, an argument for healing rather than any alternatives. Otherwise the clones couldn't make as many public appearances. On the other hand, the fact that clones can think and plan and write is hugely valuable in its own right in a rational(ist) story. Think of all the science.

      In both cases it's left to be discovered afterward. (A kindness.) And of course losing a hand in a crazy fight above a bottomless pit isn't the same as this... orderly maiming.

      Plus, it was replaced by the resident druid (much later, three months with regard to his own timeline, in chapter 104), an approach best not used the same way twice.
      ```

- u/Se7enworlds:
  ```
  So here's a question I'd like to know the answer to. Did they manage to bottle Hyacinth?

  Giving the information that she has to the Hells seems like it might instigate some problems down the line.

  Given the situation it seems possible that at least one member of the Court wasn't caught in time either way, so I suppose knowledge of an Uther candidate is going to filter through to them and they definitely have the nuance to put two and two together with their own problems. It may turn out to be the best thing that Valencia went off with Bethal if they find themselves being observed.

      ```
      I asked this elsewhere in the thread, but Gemma died.  Gemma knows about Valencia.  Did Gemma get bottled?  If not, well . . . cue up the hell crusade.  Also Juniper has leveled up, so Valencia has more tendrils.  Can she wipe out Demons yet?  In modern doctor who fashion, is it okay to exterminate the evil race?

  Often with an antagonist there is the question of what motivates them. Why are they opposed to the hero of the story, why do they do what they do? Sometimes the audience's ability to discern said motivations is of lesser or greater importance to an author, and will be made correspondingly more or less explicit to the reader through the narrative. 

  There is a common refrain, not just in writing but in social psychology, that "no one thinks of themselves as the villain in their own story," and many authors will take great care to abide by that axiom. Even if they never spell it out for the reader, they themselves will usually have a good handle on why their characters do the things they do.

  So with that, let's talk about dearly departed (or is she?) Rosemallow. Firstly, I don't believe any rule of writing is ironclad (particularly not the one I've just articulated, which I don't believe to be true, anyway). My favourite novel of all time is *Blood Meridian,* and Cormac McCarthy doesn't even give a damn about punctuation therein. With that context, I'm noting that what I type here is not a criticism, as such, but rather an observation.

  Rosemallow appears to be utterly inhuman. She seems concerned only with power qua power. Her motivations are not only opaque to the reader but perhaps to herself. Maybe she no longer has actual motivations beyond the accumulation of influence, the security of her position, and the ability to hinder or harm her enemies. Mary put it better than I could, in 195, anyway:  

  >“You talk about that like it matters,” replied Amaryllis. “As though there were any policy you wouldn’t budge on, any tenet of faith that represented a line that could not be crossed. As though you even had a coherent memeplex.”

  Her entire life is bent to political machination, such that she comes across more machine than not. Reading her admitting to her crimes, and reading June seeing her murder an osentensible friend in Amy's mother for barely more reason than that the opportunity arose . . . was disconcerting. And fascinating. However, her lack of humanity, in a word, did simply make her less interesting than Hyacinth's more personal vendetta, at least to me.

  I think, all said, I will be sad to see the back of the human cast of antagonists in Anglecynn and their maneuvering. Although that may be an almost ironic label to give Rosemallow and her ilk. I've found that throughout WTC all the most gripping conflicts have been those where June and fellows have been pit against other people in tense, dramatic stand-offs moreso than when he's up against some Tarrasque-esque force of nature.

  Particularly Everett and co., Fireteam Blackheart, that fight against Raven, Fallatehr, or the recent string of all of Mary's relatives. Less so Mome Rath or the Cannibal, who, speaking of, did live up to the hype. He's been a narrative sword of Damocles since his introduction and he delivered in terms of raw power. 

  Anyway, I've now rambled on in a couple directions for far too long. Book 8 definitely delivered in terms of hyped climax from everything after Yarrow and Zinnia came on stage.
  ```

  - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
    ```
    In terms of the cannibal, I was a little let down that the solution was revealed in a sort heavy handed manner exactly as he showed up. As far as I know this had zero foreshadowing. 

    But that is a relatively minor gripe.  i really like how the story implies the Dungeon Master lost control of the story, just as real dungeon masters do. The power up to Grak feels planned and story relevant. The power up to amaryllis feels a lot like the Dungeon Master apologizing to his PCs for letting his storylines get all garbaged up. Like he told his players "sorry this gaming session was an unrewarding shit show, here's a massively powerful buff to get rid of all this accumulated nonsense I've saddled you guys with in the story."

    To me, the DM gets fleshed out as a character without even being on screen except for two chapters. Amazing writing

In general, I have been half-thinking that Shia LaBeouf would not show up at all just because any method of defeating him would almost seem cheaply earned. There's also the issue that in a world that runs (for June anyway) as rather Harder fantasy (in terms of crunchy-ness) he's a very Soft monster, if you catch my drift, in that he simply operates 'by horror movie rules' and is basically unstoppable. 

      As to the DM, he's probably one of my favourite characters, but I imagine those chapters are a bitch to write. He gives me a sort of vaguely *The Seventh Seal* vibe.

        Yeah, I was really curious as to why Juniper didn't seem to mention that Shia is killed by the main character of the song, and detail the specific ways in which it happens. Even if it wasn't relevant to the actual Tabletop version of him, it could be nice false foreshadowing and led to Juniper trying and failing to Kidney Stab + Axe Beheading before switching to Paper Bag.

            Zinna (after getting soulfucked) said that their job was to put them to sleep and check them with soul magic on the spot, she didn't say that they were to soulfuck them. Just looking at ones soul isn't a crime.

    Maybe Rosemallow's a victim of Goodhart's law (that name, ha) as Mary fears for herself. But it felt less about her character and more about the choice of whether you could countenance evil if it served a utilitarian purpose. Also a bit of 'villains whose evil couldn't be undone'. Spiders don't usually get happy endings though.

    I know some people hate it, but I love the conflicts with paranoia and uncertainty. I'd wish for greyer villains and more questions of 'does the punishment fit the crime?' Probably not very cathartic in Aerb...

      They do have some wicked punishments though, I imagine.

      From a purely utilitarian standpoint, if it serves the purpose of maximizing utility then it is not evil. However, as far as I know just about no one seriously holds a purely utilitarian standpoint, and with good reason. The idea that one person's political power can be synonymous with utility also seems deeply, delusionally flawed. But I wonder if Rosemallow would even rationalize things to herself that way, by the end, or whether she didn't bother in her own head. As you said, she seemed in certain ways more device than person as a character. 

      For me, I love the scenes with standoffish, treacherous tension: the Fireteam Blackheart sequence, Everett's group, and Zinia and Yarrow. It's like conflict foreplay.

Via soulfucking, presumably. Can't blame Amy for deciding to just off her.

          - u/nytelios:

            Well, that's the choice - she didn't need to address her weaknesses at that point because she knew it was pointless. It's a weighing of the scale whether her competence, fingers in the pie, political vision and macro objectives are worth having a known conniving backstabber in the hotseat (Mary makes the case herself). 

            Narratively leaving her alive is just asking for it. But it's unfortunate that narrative heavily informs these decisions and things are aligned against them such that murder always seems like the simplest option (which then often turns out justified as the most pragmatic option). In a world sans DM fuckery, compromise is an endless bottle of bitter pills to swallow.

    I get what you're saying. It's both kind of disappointing, and kind of realistic and interesting, that the simplest answer turns out to be true: Rosemallow is just a narcissistic murderer.

    I think in the end, her methodology *is* her motivation.

    Like Juniper says, her motivation is whatever it needs to be to appeal to her current disposable minions. She's just so dedicated to a vision of politics where ideology is what you use to move other people around, that she can't understand the concept of having an ideology herself.

    That's why she could never work with Mary. That's why she couldn't understand her life was on the line at the end.

        Yeah. It traces back to Amaryllis feeling like she is being left behind by Joon and the gang back in the Time-Chamber pregnancy arc. 

        Right now Raven can give Joon similar protocols and opsecs that she developed owing to her experience with the Endless Library and Uther and being really old, Grak is becoming OP and is close to being the best in the world in what he does, Bethel is OP, Valencia is better at social stuff than her, and the Locus/Solace provide what anything is missing in between them. 

        Add to that what Amaryllis got for her virtue doesn't really help her in contribute something new to the party. It helps the narrative stay away from blah, blah, blah, politics and planning but those are her strong suit. She feels set aside. Its probably why she wasn't as excited as Joon expected her to be.

    Depends what you mean by romantic. They have a strong platonic partnership that has them relying on and trusting eachother implicitly without really remarking on it.

    Its somewhat worrying, in the same way as the spirit modification. Its unclear what exactly the entad is doing when they transfer sleep, but there's important psychological purposes to sleep that aren't satisfied if they are just removing the physical effects of tiredness. 

    Effectively they are very cavalierly fucking about with major function of their brains and just trusting that the magic/game mechanics that deal with it will sort things out for them.

         It becomes effectively trivial to stay awake indefinitely when you have the entad and willing helpers (or money to acquire them). That doesn't seem like the kind of easy way of getting a massive benefit  that makes sense in game balance or narrative terms

          Sometimes entads are pure upside. It happens. Dodging sleep isn't really that big a deal for the group without the Still Magic synergy anyway. Also Aerb doesn't have the same physics. Considering various magic that we've seen you very much can get something for nothing.

      If you use Spirit as well you can make soulfucking permanent, as I vaguely recall. Might only be "possible in principle" rather than "actually doable', though.

    Wouldn't be surprised if some infernals are also soul mages and capable of unfucking souls.

  I wonder if /u/mattzm reads this story or is at least aware of the ACSLB reference.

  It's a neat little game, but I'd never heard of it until it first got mentioned here.

    ```
    I have not read this story and it might take me a while to get through 196 chapters. I'll let you know!

  I like the book so much even though it makes me reflect on myself a bit too much. It feels like too much people can relate to Juniper to such extent for self-insert. Whatever.

  Love is >!whacking his head with a waraxe for the better future of Aerb!<.

  Love is >!helping her hide the crime by mutilating her aunt's corpse and leave it with victims of an Actual Cannibal!<.

  Strangest romance ever but I love every bit of it. Still ship Juniper with everyone and everything especially Bethel. 'Cause I could and I will.

  I've seen at least 4 comments that the paper bag came out of left field and not one about it being a schloss(german castle).  Could the Platonics maybe helpful for once?
  ```

  - u/Executioner404:
    ```
    I don't think that schloss can apply to anything Earth / Juniper D&D group related, and the paper bag is definitely that.

    Anyone who Googled the ACSLB rule-page (I did only because I honestly didn't believe it existed, it sounded like such a ridiculous premise for a campaign that I was sure Joon made it up) saw this coming as soon as Joon said he "had a potential solution", a long time ago. 

    Can't seem to find the chapter though, it was a throwaway comment so I can understand why people think the solution was too meta and came out of nowhere.

      Chapter 128:  


      “Ah,” I said. “Just warning you. It’s not quite instant death, but it’s close.”  *I have a plan, and it might even work, but --*

        And then there's this exchange, from chapter 130:

        “I am,” I said. “I mean, I just don’t think … for my purposes, I don’t need to actually kill him, just incapacitate him for a bit, and I don’t think that I can just stick a bag over his head.”

        “A bag?” asked Pinno.

        “Long story,” I said.
        ```

          I got to look out for that next re-listen.
          ```

      - u/Executioner404:
        ```
        That's the one! Thanks.
        ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      On that front it is a good surprise and reward for doing the research/knowing the game.  I was thinking the comedy buff like the party was.

  For some reason I'm suddenly reminded of that time Amy sat on top of Jun and beat the everliving shit outta him with her bare hands. 
  Huh. 
  Anyone remember which chapter that was?

  Wow, what an ending to the book.

  I'm worried about possible blowback from killing the dragon. Seems like the Draconic Confederacy won't take that easily and it might affect the Bluebeard quest.

  Two big new companion abilities. We didn't see much of Grak's, but we already got a sneak-peak of Amaryllis's with Simaryllis.

  Speaking of Grak, it felt like ages since we had had a scene with him. It was nice to finally have a conversation between him and Juniper.

    The dragon didn't die, he was told to leave because The Cannibal would kill him and everyone there if he burnt the paper bag

      From the dragon’s point of view, Juniper saved his life, and also demonstrated the ability to kill an enemy whom the dragon could not.

  I did a little googling regarding the rules of ACSLB after reading these chapters, but haven't run into a rule forbidding paper bags.  Is that something that only exists in the story version here that the gang played on earth?
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    It's right there in the original rules that's linked to in the chapter.
