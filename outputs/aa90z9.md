  Loving it so far! One small request... don't apologize for taking "too long" between chapters! Take your time and release when you're ready :)

    Yeah I just want to make sure I evenly space out the chapters enough. I was aiming for one per month. Glad to see you're enjoying it!

  This looks interesting! Do you have the whole story planned out?

    Thanks. I have the story somewhat planned out, but it's going to be really long so i got to make sure everything is consistent. The middle of the story of course is the greatest danger of lagging so I have to be careful there.

        Thanks. I won't give up on this story. It's been buzzing in my head throughout the year. Plus if you stick around long enough I think you especially might enjoy it.

  It looks pretty promising. The only nitpick I have is how he assumed that they use same dating as we use now. For all he knew it could have been x years after the birth of Vladimir Putin.
