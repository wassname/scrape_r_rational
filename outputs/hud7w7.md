  Argus does a great job leasing up to boss fight conflicts in this story. The world building is good. Some of the downtime section drag on but not nearly as bad as downtime sections in something like delve or wandering inn

  Hax galore. Is a grape an item? A tooth pick? A mushroom? A plastic bead?

  They should probably buy the building soon.
