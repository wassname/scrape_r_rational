## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  This is a "power" cribbed from a popular fantasy series. I won't say what series or what character as that's a heavy spoiler, but the power itself won't spoil anything. Please refrain from identifying the series in comments, you can PM me if you want confirmation on a guess :)

  Every morning you wake up with a different INT score. These tend to cluster around your normal--it looks like a standard distribution from some statistical meddling you did on a good day--but there are occasional (extremely rare) outliers that leave you catatonic and drooling or, on the other end, piercing the veil of the universe with your insight. There is no pattern, save that you're just as likely to wake up with -4 INT as +4. 

  For purposes of discussion we'll say "genius" comes at +2 sigma, meaning 2.1% of days you're at Einstein-level cognition (and 2.1% you're a giggling child). 

  The character with this affliction has munchkined it pretty thoroughly, so I'm curious to see what this sub would do. First priority is probably setting your life up so that waking up with 50 IQ wouldn't collapse your whole deal.

    I'll assume it changes at midnight. Set up your sleep schedule so that you wake up at midnight, so on a rare good day you get 24 hours and can use stimulants and nootropics to borrow an extra boost from the following days. Depending on how trusting you are, find someone who loves you to get you through the bad days, or reveal your powers to also get large amounts of assistance on a good day.

    The answer to many munchkinry questions involves AI, but this question is ~tailor-made for it. Beyond-human intellect is going to be most useful in producing insights for the alignment problem. Go to MIRI or something, convince them you're right, and watch them apply their creativity to motivating you to get tutored in their work on above-average days so you can play oracle once a year.

    "Travel the world visiting mathematicians to solve their problems" is what Erdös (edit: not Gödel!) did on merely human intellect, so your best day should give you a good shot and hope not to be abducted by some government.

    It's probably wise to look at your brain for how this is happening, though.

      Long term, large size problems seem inappropriate for this ability. Einstein took a long time to design his theories, and if we only get his genius 2% of the time then I don't expect our character's short bursts are going to contribute much. The average of your ability is back at your starting intelligence, so your net contribution isn't going to be much more than without the ability. Unless high intelligence massively scales up your contribution, but even so the increase will be limited. eg. if the scaling is x\^2, then your contribution is about double what you would have without the power.
      ```

    Step 1 is to build restraints for yourself. Every day before you go to sleep, lock yourself in a room with food and water and no sharp objects, and make it so that the only way to unlock the room would be to solve some complex puzzle. You can achieve this with AI or just getting a friend on the other side of the door to unlock it only if you solve a mathematical problem. This way you can't kill yourself on days when you are a total idiot. Depending on how stupid you can become, you may need to tie yourself down to the bed and get an IV drip.

    &#x200B;

    Step 2 is experimenting with your ability. How are you getting a different IQ every morning? What if you don't sleep at night? Does your IQ still change? Can you force rapid changes of IQ by taking naps? What if you travel to a different timezone, or keep moving around the earth ahead of the morning so your IQ never changes?

    &#x200B;

    If your IQ changes every 24 hours regardless of what you do, you can stay up all night and prepare tranquilizers to be injected into you right after the IQ change if you don't solve some puzzle (again either AI or friends would do). That way on days where your IQ is low you just spend time asleep, on days when you have average IQ you just catch up on sleep or waking hours, and on days where you are a freaking genius you chug down lots of coffee to stay awake.
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      You're on the right track with the puzzle, but I think you're overestimating how much damage a dumb person can do. Someone with 40 IQ isn't going to slit their wrists just because they can't do directional derivitives. Keep yourself away from heavy machinery for sure, but I think locking yourself in a room with some cartoons should work just fine.

      Groundhog Day rules, your IQ changes at 6am of whichever time zone you've spent the most time in throughout your life, every day, no matter what.
      ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      If this is about the story I think it is then it's worth noting that this character also has his empathy/kindness change inversely proportional to his intelligence.

      So on his days with super genius intelligence he's cold, impatient and needlessly harsh to people that aren't as intelligent as he is. He still has the same goals, but he becomes a bit of a straw utilitarianist about it.
      ```

        Yeah, I can't believe the biggest downside was left out of the description here.

    This power sounds really interesting to read about. Do you mind telling me in a reply with spoiler tags or in a PM what book series it is in?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I'm pretty sure that it's >!The Stormlight Archives!<.

      Note: this is the kind of spoiler tag that protects the name of the work, so only uncover it if you don't care about that particular element of an unknown work being spoiled for you.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:

        Thanks! I've had that series on my to-read list for a while now. This moves it up a few notches closer to the top.
        ```

  Another children's book to munchkin: In this book, a boy discovers that the tooth fairy is his homeroom teacher, and in return she offers to grant him one wish that must be tooth-related. She offers "a new toothbrush" and "never get cavities again" as possible wishes, and the boy ends up wishing for all his teeth to fall out in hopes of getting extra money to buy a new bike. In the end, while that happens, his teacher puts his teeth back and just gives him the bike because she feels sorry for him.

  So, assuming you encounter this situation, what would you wish for? Assume that any actual alterations to teeth can only be done to your own teeth. Does your answer change if we assume that in this case you still have your baby teeth?
  ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    I mean, "make my teeth perfect forever" would save me a *lot* of hassle.

    That said, wishing for a mouth full of Californium (~$24 million/gram) would let you buy the best dentures out there and a hell of a lot more besides.

    But never having to worry about oral hygiene again, including into old age... it would be tempting.

    (Unless I can wish for, like, the next decade's stock prices or a grand unifying theory of physics to be inscribed on my teeth in microscopic font? How much tooth-related power does this fairy have?

      >That said, wishing for a mouth full of Californium (~$24 million/gram) would let you buy the best dentures out there and a hell of a lot more besides.

      You'd definitely need dentures, given that Californium is highly radioactive and unstable.  

      Hell, if you knew exactly when the change was going to happen and had a friend standing by with a sledgehammer and pliers ready for immediate extraction, I'm still not sure if you would survive.
      ```

    - u/Gray_Gryphon:
      ```
      Honestly despite all the ideas people are coming up with I still have a fondness for just going "yeah let me never get cavities again."
      ```

  - u/xachariah:
    ```
    "Never get cavities again" is an interesting wish, because it's doing some sort of sustained violation of physics.  Any sustained violation of physics is infinitely more valuable for your ability to study than any material wealth can be worth, even if you could earn $100m+ with pure diamond teeth or something.

    I would ask for some sort of exotic tooth related effect and dedicate my life to understanding the physics behind it and getting rich/saving humanity with it.  
    Inviolate teeth.  Vorpal teeth.  Laplace's Teeth.  Conceptual Teeth.

    Even if I can never unlock the secrets, worst case scenario I end up with teeth that can chew through a battleship and have a career as a dental related youtuber.
    ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    I'd ask her what limits the wishes she can grant to ones related to teeth, and what she thinks of the limitation. Her own choice? A conservative tooth fairy council smarter than her? Runic bindings that she'd rather be rid of? In the latter case, "make a tooth the vessel of a benevolent god" becomes an option.
    ```

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    Go for some regenerative powers - if you phrase it right you don't have to worry about cavities or dying of old age so you can get people to study you for ways to help people live longer, and if you ever loose teeth you shouldn't, you can get *more* wishes.
    ```

    - u/Gray_Gryphon:
      ```
      For the record, this wish is a one-off offer in return for not revealing the tooth fairy's identity. So losing extra teeth won't get you extra wishes.
      ```
