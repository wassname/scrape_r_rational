  I am getting tired of Eugene taking advantage of the good boy.

    Thank you! The character was irking me for several chapters, and now the dog fight...ugh. I'm torn between hating him and respecting a well written scumbag.
    ```

  - u/teedreeds:
    ```
    What's worse for me is the other grown up adults not explaining how he's being taken advantage of.

    And not explaining stats Ã©tiquette and warning him how serious it is.

  Before you say it:  I've already thought of all the 'dog fighting' jokes. :P

  The funny part (to me) is that I did not have this event in mind when I thought up >!Modify Flavor!<.  It was supposed to be something of a joke, intended only to show that >!there are things in the Skillweb that are useless!< but apparently everything can be useful given careful application.

  I read all the chapters and I liked it a lot, thanks for writing!
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Thank you.  Glad you liked it.
    ```

  The city has got to have an institution that facilitates the sale of unlocks. One that offers assurances against murder attempts, right? Because this fighting circle is not going to pay out much more, the spectators cant be that stupid. 

  Of course, selliing unlocks likely is also limited - The number of people who want mystic acceleration and can afford a fair rate cant be that high, either
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Yup.  There's an entire street where people sell unlocks and information about the Skillweb.  I haven't gotten there yet, but it's been in the plan since I conceived of Hellsport.
    ```

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      Alter taste might actually be the biggest money maker imaginable. Spirit regens one/day, right? The number of people willing to pay a weeks worth of spirit for the utility might well equal the entire damn city.
      ```
