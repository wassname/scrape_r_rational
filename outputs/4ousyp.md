  It's not a sci-fi novel without some inexplicable BDSM.

  Edit: I think narration is seriously harming the "rational-ness" of the story here. Our hero's decision to take the bottle has only thinnest justification separating it from an idiot ball, which is supposed to be the worst sort of trope. I know wisdom is his lowest stat, but this is really, really pushing it.

    I believe in a comment to a previous chapter the author indicated that it [isn't intended to be a rational/ist story](http://unsongbook.com/chapter-24-why-dost-thou-come-to-angels-eyes/#comment-7395).   ("It constantly astounds me how many people expect a story where the number eight gets taken down for repairs to be rational.")

      I just want the story to linger at least a little bit on such an important decision, instead of rushing forward to the next equally tiny plot point

  I like that things are happening to progress the storyline with Aaron.

  Jesus christ what is going on. He didn't even take the bottle with him^(x), Vegas is the opposite direction of where he wants to go, and if she's going to get another one anyway, what the hell is the point? At least he's rising to the "childish" expectations … I really hope he comes up with a better reason for what he just did.

  I know it's probably just because this chapter's short, but I'm a huge Scott fan and this makes me want to jump off the Unsong ship so to speak

  ^(x)disregard this I suck cocks, nonlinear storytelling is my greatest foe

    No, he took it with him, part II is a flashback to when they walked in the room at the end of chapter 24. I actually think the story finally has some action, and I really miss interludes like the 'Hole in the Bucket'.

      oh fuck that's unnecessarily nonlinear. my bad

    No, he does take the bottle with him. Read the last two sentences of part I.

  The purple Beanie Baby dragon is probably* "[Dwynwen](http://www.tycollector.com/beanies/dwynwen-46156.htm)", which is the [Welsh patron saint of lovers and sick animals.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwynwen)

  * It could also be [Legend](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/452189618805943118/).

  Is it just me or are the chapters getting shorter? I NEED MORE UNSONG.

    If they are, we can predict when it will end.

    EDIT: If we just go linear, the series should end after about 84 or 85 chapters, not including interludes. Taking a look at the [moving average](http://i.imgur.com/Q7lQy0q.png) is really interesting to me, though. Basically you see two humps. Note that Book I ends after the sixteenth chapter.

    In this story, we are all of us on whale watch. Alexander is in California, famous for its whales, and the Monterey Bay Whale Watch is located at, you guessed it, ***84*** Fishermans Wharf. Monterey is named for Saint Louis IX of France, whose tomb the sage Jules Verne wrote of in his commentary, *To the Sun/Off on a Comet!*, in which a comet grazes the earth and carries away said tomb with it, along with a few individuals. Clearly, the Comet King is Saint Louis, who shall return—as comets do—to carry his chosen to heaven—Shamayim—Shamuyim.

    HOWEVER, the kabbalistic significance of a length of 85 should not be understated. It is the length in feet of the whale which sunk the *Essex*, a source of inspiration for *Moby Dick*.

    None of this is a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence.
