## Have you guys seen the cover art for the official Korean translation of "Worth the Candle"? It features Amaryllis, Juniper, and Fenn, and the translated title is "This World I Made".

  Jesus, this is real? I had no idea it was getting an official Korean translation. Impressive. Although I pity the translator for some of the language/culture conversations they'll have to localize.

    ```
    I _really_ want to know how they translated >!"you're leeking"!< from chapter 191. I mean, that's the climax to the whole arc; the entire fight was just a buildup to that.

      They might have to change Onion's name and rework the whole pun structure just to make something that flows naturally in Korean.

      Guarantee it’s going to be about Kimchi

    It's unfortunate that the name has been changed to something more generic

  Google translates’ of the Korean comments have been a source of much amusement to the discord community.

  Here’s a translation of a comment comparing Mary and Fenn shipping stocks

    Where can I find the comment section? Do I have to make an account for the app?

    Looking at the Korean website, I couldn't find anything crediting the original author. Just YAGI, the translator.

    Also, it seems like it is charging money for all chapters from 28 onwards.

    /u/alexanderwales are you aware of this?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      It's authorized, yes. I get a check every quarter for my share of whatever it earns, but otherwise don't pay attention to it whatsoever, mostly because I don't speak Korean and it has virtually no impact on the original (aside from the fact that English-speaking fans seem to find its existence funny/curious). I consider it a pretty sweet deal, because it generates passive income for me at virtually no cost.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        Can I ask how much it earns for you and the percentage of royalties you have, if it's not too personal? I'm curious how much money something like this can make for the original author.
        ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        Oh. Then everything's okay. I just saw your name nowhere on the website and got worried.
        ```

  - u/Dragfie:
    ```
    Juniper looks like such a fuck-boy XD
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      And Fenn's face is weirdly derpy.
      ```

  Oh geez! That cover art makes it look like the book is going to be another trashy wish-fulfillment harem packed light novel. I'd love to be able to read the ridiculous comments that people are writing about their reactions when they see it's completely different.

  But I really hope they got AlexanderWale's permission for this. Because charging money to read each chapter when the original is posted for free? Not cool.

  EDIT: Oh good, he gave permission for this. I thought it might have been plagiarized-translations, because I'm so used to scummy behavior of translation sites. Specifically Qidan.
  ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    Kind of weird to call out Qidan here, given they're a major driver of the move *away* from the behaviour you're objecting to, translation without permission or compensation of the original author.

    Not that the controversy around Qidan isn't at least somewhat justified, as they did screw over fan translators (at least some of which were probably legal at the time) but just that it doesn't really fit the argument you made.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I actually didn't realize that they work to ensure compensation of the original authors. I just knew they screwed over the fan translators, and thought they were also screwing over the original authors as well. Hence me drawing a parallel here since I thought the same thing was happening to AlexanderWales as well.
      ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        I have seen some complaints about translator contracts (eg. translator relinquishes rights on content to Qidan, non-disparagement, etc.), but the complaints along those lines never held much water to me, as that all seems about what one would expect for contract work. It's a shame nuance gets lost so easily on the internet.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          It's not just their extremely predatory contracts which strips any right over an author's work, it's also that they have no oversight when it comes to whether or not a work belongs to the person submitting it. You can plagiarize a story and submit it to Qidan as if it's yours, and Qidan will do absolutely nothing to enforce copy-right despite evidence to the contrary.

          It may be confusing since I'm saying author/translator as if they're the same. Part of the reason is because they treat the two essentially identically.

          I'm just going to end it here, because looking up the details on what Qidan's actions is making me very angry and I'm done with feeling like that today.

            > It's not just their extremely predatory contracts which strips any right over an author's work

            Don't they now also have the option of a royalty share contract, where that isn't the case? I'm going by https://acts.webnovel.com/2018/62185143/index.html, which lists both options.

            The DCMA being ignored sounds awful, though, I wasn't aware of that.
            ```

            - u/Redditor76394:
              ```
              Qidian has straight up stolen legal translations and proceeded to paywall them on the Qidian website, then DCMA'd the translators for their own work. There are good reasons why Qidian is widely disliked.
              ```

  ```
  This really feels full circle... the Gamer, a Korean webtoon, was/is a major milestone in the development of the LitRPG genre and established a lot of the trope that WtC subverts, deconstructs, and reconstructs.  I am pretty sure lots of RPG-mechanics settings (in which game mechanics are literally part of the world m) predate it but I think the Gamer is one of the first works in which the RPG mechanics was a unique ability of the main character.
  ```

- u/Amonwilde:
  ```
  "This World I Made" is kind of a cool name. Considering that the English title is highly idiomatic.
  ```

  - u/cabforpitt:
    ```
    It's also a fairly obscure reference even in English
    ```

- u/MaddoScientisto:
  ```
  The art is amazing
  ```

- u/JulianWyvern:
  ```
  I have not, and please never show it to me again. I can't imagine how Webtoons have such nice art and then cover arts for novels come out like this
  ```

- u/kkkenny913:
  ```
  Ngl this looks cool.. imagine their shock, when they realize about Fenn later..
  ```

- u/wren42:

  damn, that's awesome!
