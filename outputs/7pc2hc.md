  People aren't allowed to *think* during a timeskip, silly.

  Alternative explanation: thirteen years ago, the ghost *couldn't* pick up the remote, and the ability was a recent development with no indication.

  If the ghost can move through walls (pretty common ghost ability) then maybe the ability to phase through objects is controlled by thoughts or expectations.

    I like this theory.

  The "fictional character bias", which is what causes people who are not real to not act like real people.

  Which bias led you to assume that all cognitive errors can be placed under the umbrella of some bias or other?

    Who knows? I probably have a lot of biases and I'm too biased to find out which one. I got [called out](https://raddle.me/f/AskRaddle/18908/comment/24228) just a week ago for the strawman fallacy. ^^^help ^^^me

      I don't like to think in terms of biases. That's reducing epistemology to a bag of tricks. Generalized [epistemic learned helplessness](https://squid314.livejournal.com/350090.html) is much more coherent.

  Am not sure it's useful to explain gags in fictional comedic panels via cognitive biases.

  I would say the problem of "locating the hypothesis". The idea just never ocurred to him. It's the same as romans eating from lead pans without anyone ever questioning the health hazards. Doctors not washing hands before the discovery of microorganisms, etc...

    Lead poisoning was apparently pretty well known in ancient rome. It's one of these hindsight things were we try to ascribe one belief to all past people like how people in the past all thought the world was flat and hated women, ancient roman leaders were aware of lead poisoning but it wasn't a huge problem back then. Lead was known to be dangerous and thus people preferred clay pipes, the really dangerous stuff was apparently lead acetate which was produced by boiling grape juice in lead pots and was used to sweeten wine. What people often neglect to mention is that rome was large both in time and space and you'll find times and places in which lead poisoning was a problem and times and spaces in which it was not.
