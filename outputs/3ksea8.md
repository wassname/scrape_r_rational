  The story seems interesting so far with all of the strange events that have happened to the protagonist so far, but I just wish that there were links to the preceding and the next chapter instead of having to click on the side bar links.

    That's a really good suggestion, thanks!

    If I can figure out how to implement it I'll definitely do it.

    EDIT: Previous and next buttons are implemented! They can be found at the bottom of each post, underneath the comments section.
