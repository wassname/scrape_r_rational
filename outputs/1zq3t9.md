  He writes as if the cold equations themselves, and the series of events that lead to a situation that cold equations are needed are the same thing. Since the series of events that lead to the situation is bad, he says cold equations are bad too. That's an unfair attack on cold equations. 

  >‘‘The Cold Equations’’ is moral hazard in action. It is a story designed to excuse the ship’s operators...

  Nonsense. Cold equations just tell you what to do when the mistakes have been made in order to avoid further mistakes. Ship's operators should still be punished for negligence. 

  Secondly, it's not only mistakes that lead to situations where cold equations are needed. What can an insurance company do other than using cold equations? Steal money from mafia bosses so they can pay for everyone? No, sometimes we have to use cold equations even when we've done everything right.

    He's speaking as an author. Everything within a story happens at an author's discretion, and so he's attacking authors who seem to get off on writing situations which force "good" characters to do terrible things. See Ender's Game, which is entirely [a set-up to make sure Ender can commit genocide and still be innocent of doing so](http://www4.ncsu.edu/~tenshi/Killer_000.htm). Cory argues this creates in the readership an attitude more likely to excuse such actions in the real world. (The "moral hazard" part of the article) I think the effects of Atlas Shrugged show that he's got a heck of a point.
    (For a great portrayal of "necessary" mass murder that doesn't leave you rooting for the mass-murderer, [I recommend Chasm City](http://www.deathisbadblog.com/the-narrative-is-the-argument/) )

  This really knocked it out of the park. Saving the link so I can read it again once I've mentally digested it a bit.

  The goal of moral studies should not be "what to do in lifeboats" but rather "how not to end up in lifeboats to begin with."
