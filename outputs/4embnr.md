  Also a question: Is crossposting it here from over at SSC a good idea?

  Ahah! 'i' is thinner! Although that might just be the whitespace in the font box. Though if we're only counting blackwidth in the box then ' ' has 0 width. Wait, when we say "English Language" Are we using a Formal Language definition of english? Ah screw it, im'a dibs these while I still can.
