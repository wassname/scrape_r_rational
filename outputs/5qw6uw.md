  It's a sweet little read, and although the tone is borrowed from the short story, it's very clearly based on the movie because Things Don't Work That Way in the story. It has all the problems of the movie, and adds more  (e.g. now Louise can remember futures that *never happened*; if reverse causality is cheap in the movie, this is *absurd*!)

    Same thoughts over here but, dang it, this story makes me happy anyway.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      I agree it's a happy little story but it's a less rational story based on a less rational movie about a rational story, so it was a bit of a bait and switch to see it posted here!

      (Not that I'm complaining, anything Ted Chiang adjacent makes me extremely happy)

  It's a fix fic, a well-done fix fic, and it did bring tears to my eyes and a lump in my throat, but it still doesn't work. "Arrival" is a *one-track-timeline* setting. There is no such thing as choice, under its rules.

      Can you explain further? I did not have that impression.

          Thank you for writing this up. I didn't read the original story, but was highly frustrated by the ending of Arrival despite enjoying it for the most part. Walking out of the theater at the end was reminiscent of walking out of Interstellar.

          I'd also like to give my thanks for writing this up. It perfectly describes how the story feels, in detail, and how that was not "respected" by the movie, and how this short story takes it further off the rails, so to speak.
          ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        She is able to "remember" the general's phone number from the future, which is explicitly stated not to be possible in the story. The story further emphasizes this by having Hannah die in an accident, so could theoretically be prevented, and yet Louise chooses not to (because it's not really a choice she is able to make).
        ```

    "Story Of Your Life" is a one-track-timeline setting, yes, but there's nothing in "Arrival" to contradict the fic.
    ```

  - u/FeepingCreature:
    ```
    What we're reading is not reality, what we're reading is the proof of contradiction. A misshapen future; a circle that won't close.
    ```

- u/scruiser:
  ```
  I disagree with the complaints.  In the original story, from the perspective of the main character, it seemed like a single timeline, and thus predestination and such exists.  But did we ever see the main character test and push these limits?  In the movie, there wasn't really time to show such, and thus we never saw for sure what the limits are.  I haven't read the short story yet, but I don't think she pushed her limits in the story either.  Thus, I find this fix-fic acceptably rational.
  ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    In the short story, it's made very explicit that she *cannot* push her limits any more than I can jump into the air and fly, ignoring gravity. The entire point is that learning the future means you are *doomed to fulfill it*. I would heartily recommend the story. It's short enough to read inside an hour and easily available on the internet.

    That said I do recommend buying the collection ("Story of your life and others") as Chiang writes amazing, rational science fiction. There's a story in that collection about the consequences of a world where angels visiting is a regular occurrance. The ending is extremely emotionally impactful.

      I love all of his short stories,  but Hell Is the Absence of God is just the killer.

        So amazingly good. The story notes at the end of the book really crystallized it for me!
        ```

- u/Dragonheart91:
  ```
  I'm not sure I understand what made the change happen? The movie seemed to make it clear that humans have no free will or power of choice.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    In this fix-fic universe, Heptapod grants the power to very vividly imagine possible futures, instead of a window into the one true and unalterable future.
    ```

    - u/Dragonheart91:
      ```
      That sounds like it kinda ruins the whole schtick.
      ```

      - u/CeruleanTresses:
        ```
        The movie already ruined it, really. Since a major plot point involves Louise *using* her knowledge of the future to influence the present, it can't be true (in the movie universe) that humans have no free will. The movie also framed Louise's decision to have her doomed child as an actual choice she made, rather than as her helplessly enacting the events she already remembers. I don't think there's anything about the movie that would rule out what happens in the fic.
        ```

        - u/scruiser:
          ```
          I think ruined is a strong term... the movie made it ambiguous how much free will humans have.  Changed the overall message, yes, ruined... I really liked the movie.
          ```
