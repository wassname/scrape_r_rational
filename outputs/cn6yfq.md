## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  hi yall, i'm writing a crossover fanfic between [wildbow's worm](https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Worm_Wiki) and the ['long earth' series by pratchett and baxter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Earth). i'm posting here to harness the collective intelligence of this subreddit for two things:

  * **brainstorming:** what are the short and medium term economic, political, and social consequences of parallel universes (the vast majority uninhabited, but some inhabited, but separated by long distances) being accessible by ordinary people, and how can different rational agents (corporate and government) adapt to this new landscape? who are the winners and losers? (i've been exhaustively thinking through this for the past month and i'll list the most important things i've thought of just to get the ball rolling). 

  * 'long earth' canon is really, really vague in some areas (i will discuss these below). **my scientific and technical knowledge is limited and i'm not sure how to fill in the gaps in a way that's both specific and narratively satisfying.**

  **the background:**

  * in the long earth, 'steppers' are lightweight held-held boxes that can be assembled from components you can find in any electronic hobbyist store. they require a potato or a tuber as a power source.

  * they move the user in one of two directions (east and west) into a parallel universe. nearby universes are identical except modern humans (and their close relatives) never evolved.

  * special constraints: **1.** in order to use a stepper, you need to have been involved in the final stage of the assembly of a stepper (any stepper, not necessarily the one you're using. it's basically just twisting some wires around, nothing too hard). **2.** you cannot move iron (iron compounds like haemoglobin can be moved, but not alloys, etc. - *this is an area of vagueness*) between worlds. **3.** their use causes very intense, debilitating nausea that lasts for about five minutes - multiple uses in succession make it much worse (there is an effective rate-limit on their use). **4.** clothes and things you carry are moved across, but not just anything you happen to be in contact with, but you can step two people across sometimes - *this is another area of vagueness*. **5** you can't step into a solid object - air is okay, i don't know if water is.

  * about one in a thousand people can step without a stepper (natural steppers). they don't experience any nausea and can step at a rate of around once every 3 seconds. conversely, for about one in ten people, stepping is lethal (phobics).

  in worm's canon, we're made aware of two earths: earth bet (the main setting) and earth aleph. 

  * earth aleph is nearly identical to our world. earth bet isn't, because it diverged from ours around 1982, and the butterfly effect has created several big differences (for instance, in earth bet, china is the 'chinese imperial union' and is ruled by an emperor. different administrations, different borders, and so on.) 

  * aleph is generally preferable to bet (it's richer, has less parahumans/supervillains, and doesn't have cataclysmic terror-monsters - have a look through worm's wiki if you're interested in the specifics). 

  * if you're born before 1982, there will be a copy of you.

  * earth aleph is located in the 'centre' of the multiverse, earth bet is located on east 27. as a general rule, it takes 4.5 minutes for a natural stepper to go from A to B, and maybe a good part of a day for a normal person. the schematics for building steppers became public in 2016, the current year is 2020. 

  * there are other inhabited universes further away, but the closest is east 1013 and kinda impractical to visit. it's very weird and probably implausible and diverged in the late 1930s. if anyone is interested in it, i'll sketch it out in another comment and history nerds can help me either steelman it or tear it to shreds (i don't mind).

  what are the...

  * economic implications

  * political implications

  * religious implications

  * social implications

  * legal implications

  * technological implications

  general or specific, of having two similar parallel worlds within reach of one another?


  ***

  **so, here's what i've thought of**. i might be completely off the mark, so you may not want to read it to avoid polluting your own thinking. i would recommend thinking things through beforehand and then reading what i've written.

  **implications i've thought about**

  * obvious stuff, but stuff that still opens up a lot of questions.

  1. **safe areas are no longer safe.** you can step east, walk a while, step west, and end up in fort knox, or the white house. therefore: movement of valuables underground for protection, increased security costs for protecting adjacent worlds, location secrecy has a higher priority. in the short term, crime, terrorism, and prison breakouts jump. it's harder to keep people in prison once they're in there, and harder to arrest people.

  2. **land and mineral prices collapse.** farmers tend to their fields in universes adjacent to them. there's some depopulation, but the only people who move to live in an uninhabited universe permanently are generally people who are okay with not using any technology with iron in it forming the first wave. i.e are you okay with being a hunter-gatherer? the second wave would be in the process of unfolding right now, as basic infrastructure gets set up in uninhabited universes & they become more desirable (especially in population-dense areas in third-world nations). there's probably a long-term decrease in inter-ethnic and inter-religious conflict, following a short-term burst.

  3. **muddled property & criminal law, difficulty collecting taxes, bureaucratic headbutting, and competing organisational jurisdictions hobble governments and other administrative entities.** supply-chains for the very general and widespread electronic components used to build steppers are probably too global for national governments to prevent people from building steppers entirely. 

  * preventing movement of people and goods becomes very difficult to enforce in practice - so that has implications for border controls, drug trafficking, and so on. my thought are that the dynamic would be something like: governments and corporations would initially nearly bankrupt themselves trying to dramatically scale up and gain a first-mover advantage, and then over time would begin to delegate and decentralise to local organisations & operations - mafia-type groups who enforce property lines and collect taxes, roving white supremacist groups who patrol borders, etc.. interdimensional regulatory agencies would emerge but bet-aleph cooperation would still be in its nascent stages after five years - there would likely be police cooperation and information-sharing, i think.

  stuff that isn't immediately obvious:

  * i've assumed that some corporate lawyers found loopholes in aleph and bet's merger laws, and that there is nothing stopping 'identical' corporations operating in bet & aleph (say, general motors) from merging. **so, there's an initial glut of intellectual property since bet and aleph won't have invented exactly the same things, and a burst of innovation from technological synergies.** i imagine the winners would be tertiary-sector / infotech companies that can effectively leverage operational synergies whose business models are based around intangible goods, or in general benefit more from economies of scale. heavy industry, and fixed capital-heavy 'immobile' industry loses out (i think). 

  * there's probably going to be some currency fuckery happening as well. if my gut sense is right, there'll probably be a trend of convergence over time as more people find areas for arbitrage and the market self-corrects.

  maybe this is too open-ended but there are creative people here who have very deep and domain-specific knowledge, what do you think would happen?

  for the vague areas i talked about, what do you think would work in a narrative sense?

  ***

  *the following isn't strictly necessary to read*

  this is really, really general question, so i'll narrow the search-space to things that would shape the narrative if it helps (i don't mind if it's relevant or not, though): in the fic, the main character (taylor hebert) lives on earth bet, in brockton bay (a hollowed-out, high-crime, post-industrial city in the north-west united states - at least, it was before the invention of steppers, i don't know how the city would change in response). 

  she works at a convenience store owned by her aunt that mainly now services people who step regularly. she gains a 'tinker' power focused on body self-modification using the creation of advanced interdimensional technology from mundane components (not the main focus here, i think i'll do a future thread), one invention she makes allows her to step at a supranormal rate - up to twenty times a second.

   she moonlights at a 'grey logistics' company (think black market amazon, transporting anonymous goods and data from A to B with several people dropping off and picking up packages to prevent any one person from knowing the sender & receiver) owned by a supervillain, accord. 

  eventually she falls on the wrong side of the law, has her arm twisted, and agrees to set off on an eastward voyage by airship (sponsored by both aleph and bet) with other parahumans. there are a multiplicity of interests behind the mission broadly is: symbolic force-projection, making diplomatic contact with inhabited worlds, cataloguing worlds and gathering knowledge before anyone else can, and finding trading opportunities.

    One in a thousand are natural steppers? That's much higher than the impression I remember having, I'd have said one in a million maybe. 

    (Also, for those who haven't read the books: there's a natural continuum of stepping ability. There are borderline-natural steppers who can jump with a broken stepper box, borderline-phobic people who get sicker than normal and it's really unpleasant but not life-threatening, etc. Natural steppers don't get nausea and so can travel unusually fast. They can still use stepper boxes, and may not realise they don't need it.)

    Although maybe you're changing those details.

    When is Step Day in this setting, i.e. what is the point of divergence from Worm? What's the status of Professor Haywire (the dude who built a portal between Aleph and Bet in canon), Doormaker, Cauldron?

    Have you read Ward? Because there's a lot of stuff regarding non-Aleph and Bet Earths in Ward and the way parahuman powers interact with them.

    Implications:

    * Dragon should be a natural stepper, obviously. But what about other capes? You could argue that stepping sickness is more of a psychic thing and so not all Brutes are immune to it, or the opposite. 
     * Either way, Alexandria should be able to step pretty fast, if not an actual natural stepper. Aegis is another strong candidate for a near-natural (he can live without his head per WOG by shunting processing to his spleen or whatever, and feels no pain), and on the villainous side Crawler seems likely to have adapted.

    * For sanity's sake I would assume >!shards have a countermeasure to prevent simulated human minds inside them from actually stepping and taking them along for the journey. Otherwise a lot of Thinker powers become impossible.!<


    * Weld will look very different if he has to purge himself of iron to step, and is probably physically weaker. Lung can't step while his power is active (steel scales.) Oni Lee probably can't either, which has interesting implications for the ABB - are they screwed over by being unable to claim/defend stepwise territory, or do they expand on Bet as other gangs split their attention between worlds? 

    * The Simurgh can definitely make some super Endbringer stepper box. But when will she? My guess: hang out and wait for Bet to colonize other worlds *hard* as they think they're safer, then attack Brockton Bay and copy Taylor's tech (if there aren't any other step-related tinkers, IDK if you want Taylor to feel like the center of the universe.) 

    * Unless Step Day was, like, yesterday, at least some of the Wards should have triggered in a post-Step world and may, like Taylor, have different powers or something. (IDK how hard you want to play this since in a truly single-point-of-divergence fic Taylor should probably have a variation of her canon powers.) They're also probably more familiar and comfortable with the new tech. 

    * Statistically at least one hero and several villains in BB should be phobic even ignoring powers.

    * Legally & culturally, people need to own the land a minimum of one step to either side of their land, in order to restrict access. OTOH this cannot meaningfully extend to infinity even if there weren't other inhabited Earths. Back on the first hand, if you try to use Wild West first come first served rules too close to home people will try to grab huge tracts of well-situated land. I think a cut-off point in the single digits is most likely.

    * Contrary to the Long Earth series, I think "up" and "down" make better and more intuitive names for the 4D directions. In particular, you can easily make signposts with arrows pointing to and down, and maps that draw each earth one above the other (we have practice mapping levels in buildings), and number them +2, +1, 0, -1, -2 ... Aleph is probably Earth 0 for the same political reasons they got to be Earth A.

    * Speaking of politics, Aleph is officially scared shitless and correctly so. War can and will break out the minute a single belligerent country/gang stabilises long enough to notice all those fancy buildings, manufactured goods, and people chilling on Aleph with no superhero muscle to defend them. I think there's a serious chance that both versions of a lot of countries unify to avoid this, which will be a massive legal headache.

      I love the idea!

      I'm going to try to talk socioeconomic stuff, but this post is not about that: it's about a potato powered journey to the center of the Entities.

      It's an extreme deviation from the angle you've mentioned, but I'm interested in how parallel earths that serve purposes for the Entities (as the homeworlds for the bodies of shards [I envision them as delicate continental organic machines with moving parts that follow around the linked parahumans] or their power wells [probably slowly disintegrating earths], for example) might be reachable for steppers.

      Access to key worlds could allow them to hack into powers, for example, but they're more likely to have no idea what they're doing and unknowinly cause random effects. Powers are unlikely to work in these earths. The Taboo might also make them forget all about those worlds on exit and leave them believing they haven't stepped quite as much (except for fuel, clocks...).

      Also: if the Entities are capable of stepping, there's no way they haven't found the way over their entire existence. Even if any alien species they've encountered has found the way to do it, the Entities might be ready for it. In canon, they seem to have taken steps to quarantine dimensions: some earths surrounding key earths might be hostile to trespassers.

      Quick thoughts:

      Endbringers aren't nearly as much of an issue anymore, specially if they can't step. If they can't, there's likely to be a migration from bet, where there will still be a lot of property damage from Endbringers.

      Aleph will suffer parahuman crime before getting a chance to counter it effectively: it will have to depend too much on 'heros' from another earth. This and the absent of a real threat from the Endbringers will likely make Aleph's opinions of capes really bad.

      Parahuman combat tactics will have to adapt to 9/10 people (capes included) being movers and strangers. Capture attempts will need forces on at least the contiguous earths. To even know how a battle is going, people are going to need to step a few times. Collateral deaths will be likely to go down.

      That's all for now

  I'm working on fleshing out a world where a small portion of people can generate electricity from their fingertips by sacrificing memories. Currently, I'm stuck at what level of technology they would have access to.

  The magic is rare enough that not every family household would have access to it, but the government does do their best to employ as many mages as they can to keep them from turning to easy crime and to maintain a hold on the magic. So presumably there has been some technological developments beyond medieval times.

  Any thoughts?
  ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    How much electricity (broad question because broad relevance!)? Basically, you haven't told us what the limits to the magic are.
     - How is the amount correlated with the magnitude of memories lost (and how is that measured)? 
     - How much can be generated per day?

    What other magics exist? You're positing family households and governments, which can statistically arguably relate to the tech level too.
    ```

    - u/onemerrylilac:
      ```
      I should have explained more, my bad.

      The magic operates on the basis of: the more important a memory is to you, the more electricity you can generate by sacrificing it.

      On one end of the spectrum, a very important memory (i.e. your mother's face, your wife's name, a formative experience with your father) would be enough to kill someone.

      On the other end, a very insignificant memory (i.e. the taste of a food you didn't like, the name of someone you just met) is only enough to make a small spark that will die out almost immediately.

      It takes a long time to be physically exhausted by this magic, so unless you were constantly using the high end blasts, you could keep it up for hours.

      For real world number, I'm going to do a terrible estimation and say a very important memory is worth 240 volts (enough to charge a house) and an insignificant memory would be .5 volts.

      Feel free to question me on those numbers, and apologies if this doesn't help all that much, I'll do my best to answer any questions that might help clear things up.
      ```

      - u/I_Probably_Think:
        ```
        Er, volts are a measure of electric potential but not of energy (How much current can you deliver?). You can be shocked by a small Tesla coil at many kilovolts and be more or less fine, because the amount of current is very low and therefore the amount of energy imparted to you is small.

        I'd usually take "effects are measured by how much energy output they have", which would be easiest to understand as, for instance, kilowatt-hours like on your utility meter (or use plain ol' joules). An 80W incandescent light bulb uses 80 joules of energy per second.

        The wattage is also relevant -- it's how quickly you could deliver the energy.
        ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        Let's say that someone decides to only burn their current memories as they form, so that from the moment the spell casting starts to when it ends, no new memories are retained; can this be done? If so, how powerful can it be? Can I just spend an 8 hour workday doing nothing but generating electricity and punch out with my most recent memory being punching in and have meaningful amounts of electricity in the 8 hours?

        Is there a delay on the forgetting aspects?

        Can I consult experts on an important matter, and be able to verify somehow that they actually used their magic to forget the memories specifically related to the secrets we discussed to ensure confidentiality?

        Can the magic be reversed by absorbing electricity to regain lost memories?

        Can the forgetting be forcibly induced to the point that everything is forgotten? How serious is forgetting everything? Death, complete dementia, or something else?

        I think the forgetting things is more important than the ability to generate electricity and there will be aspects of the world that focuses on this while treating the generated electricity as almost incidental.
        ```

  - u/meterion:
    ```
    Putting together all your responses, you really need to elaborate on how much *energy* is actually being produced for people to get an idea for how much it can be used.

    Think of things in terms of power, joules, which we can reach by using watts, the rate of power used. The wattage used by an average LED bulb is around 6 watts, or in other words, it needs 6 joules every second to power it. From there, just consult an [appliance power chart](https://www.wholesalesolar.com/solar-information/how-to-save-energy/power-table) for the appropriate scale.

    The only other major consideration is whether a mage can moderate the release of this electricity, or if they can only discharge it all at once. If it's the latter, it puts a lot more limitations on how much tech development can happen due to it, since big bursts of electricity are not easy to work with compared to a steady flow.
    ```

  - u/TacticalTable:
    ```
    My only thought on this, is that it doesn't seem exceptionally powerful. It depends on how much actual electricity is generated, but from the sound of it, the voltage/memory would likely be too low to uplift a society (at least to the point where they could go to more sustainable resources like coal and oil).

    Storywise, I could definitely see a story starting with a character who had forgotten/'sacrificed' everything
    ```
