  I loved this intrelude. This was perhaps the best written Hiashi that I have read in some time.

  Huh. The chapter title seems like a reference to A Practical Guide to Evil:

  > “Above the gates of Stygia there is a statue of a magister,” he finally spoke. “He is a tall, proud man this magister. On his shoulders are two cranes, named Redress and Retribution. They are the patron spirits of the city, said to speak in the dreams of those deemed worthy.”

  Also, typo:
  > he could not say that the blamed the boy.

  the blamed -> he blamed
  ```

    Huh. Well, I haven't read A Practical Guide to Evil, but that is totally the kind of reference I would make if I had :o

    It's especially spooky considering that Hiashi is also a proud man and is seated between two statues in this scene <\_<

    >the blamed -> he blamed

    Whoops, fixed now. Cheers!

  Man, I've read so much fanfiction... I would totally appreciate a quick synopsis of the story and relationships thus far.

    ```
    Oh, that's a good idea. I totally should have done that for the first new update. I'll write one up in the Author's notes for next chapter, I think.

      Ditto on this request, after LUD and dreaming Sunshine and heck even Rising Waves I can barely keep track on who said what and where. I guess I will have to reread this
