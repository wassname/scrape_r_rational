## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  So recently my counselor recommended I get tested for ADHD. Now up until that point my understanding of ADHD was pretty limited and I only knew the "common knowledge" of it. Upon doing more research on ADHD I was surprised because it was a lot different then I imagined it to be. I had this idea that it mostly just made it harder to pay attention, and made you really hyper. But really these are just some of the most visible symptoms of a larger problem, that being the part of your brain that self regulates develops slower than normal, which impairs various executive functions.

  Executive functions affected by ADHD include:
  1. Self-awareness
  2. Inhibition
  3. Non-Verbal Working Memory
  4. Verbal Working Memory
  5. Emotional Self-Regulation
  6. Self-motivation
  7. Planning and Problem Solving

  This hurts your ability to focus on long term goals, and means people with ADHD have a hard time focusing on things that don't have immediate consequences. I started to see patterns of this in my own life and how I often put things off to the last minute and only worked my best when I was regularly held accountable. I regularly started and switched projects, I have more than one story I started writing for fun that never went anywhere. So I am curious if medication and potentially different strategies would make me a lot more productive. I was already going through life developing strategies for coping with my own attention/motivation issues, but if it is ADHD then having a better understanding could potentially make it easier to develop these strategies in the future.

  I highly recommend any person who is currently in college if they are having issues to take advantage of free counseling services if your college provides it. You are already paying for it in your tuition so you might as well take advantage. If I do have ADHD I probably would have never found out if I didn't go.

  Earlier this week FB reminded me of [a poster](https://i.imgur.com/4KPIxKw.jpg) I made for a homework assignment in an ecology class in college half a decade ago. My partner and I were busy that semester and dallied in making it until the night before it was due, when we worked on it and a few other projects until the wee hours of the morning, set it to print @ 4' x 6', and went out for pancakes -- which in turn made us late to the faux-conference we were meant to present this at. But the "poster session" went smoothly, our spiel accompanied by the GoT opening theme playing softly in the background. 

  Anyway, since this is the last season of the show (and it's unclear if the direwolves will return, perhaps due to nutritional stress ;]), I thought I might share. Sorry about the poor quality, the original file is who knows where, so this is the facebook version.

  Some people tried to rob me, and I was pretty sure I knew who it was. I looked at the list of people who would have had the knowledge to try, and it was pretty small. I told the guy's girlfriend and gave her a copy of the security footage, and she confronted him about it. About a week later someone tried to break into my apartment again, this time they're not covering their face at all and they're using a different vehicle. That time I got a pretty good look at one of their faces, and while he had the correct build as the guy I thought it was, it clearly wasn't him. I'm not convinced it was the same person both times.

  I'm having some trouble with a few points.

   * How much probability mass should I assign to unknown unknowns? Just some guy overheard in a bar that I might have something worth stealing? Things like that.

   * How do I reason about things when enemy action might be trying to hide the truth? I'm not convinced the guy who covered his face and the other guy are the same person.

  Regardless there's enough suspicion that I don't want any of them involved in my life, but it's presented some more concrete epistemological problems.

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Some stuff comes immediately to mind:

    * Most important! Change the screws on your lock. The screws that you can see in your lockset door strike plate are often just half an inch long and can be broken off by one kick to the door in the right spot. Replacing the screws with ones that are 3 to 4 inches long make it much harder to break in. This [article](https://www.familyhandyman.com/home-security/how-to-reinforce-doors-entry-door-and-lock-reinforcements/) goes much more indepth, but if you don't want to or can't do everything on it, step 4 on drilling in deeper holes and changing the screws is very simple to do.
    * How well known is all of this to neighbors? Maybe one heard about important things about you have and spotted an opportunity?
    * Maybe you should talk to your neighbors just to see if they saw or know anything useful?
    * How well are things going with the guy and his girlfriend? If their relationship has deteriorated, then that's a sign that he might have decided to get some revenge. If they had made up before the second attempt, then I would say that he'd be less likely to try anything out of a desire for revenge. Not to say that he couldn't have done it anyway in both cases, but if they made up, the odds should drop since he has more to lose.
    * Do you know this guy well enough to say that he has a vindictive personality, sociopathic, or narcissistic one? Does he have a history of anything? If he does, then it's a warning sign for you and the girlfriend.
    * Ask about attempted or successful thefts in your area. If the stranger has tried to steal from you both times instead of being someone else to make the guy you know look innocent, then the stranger will have attempted to steal from other people and not just you. If he was just to help the other guy escape from suspicion, then no reported crimes should be suspicious. To find this out, you could ask the police about crimes in the area. This is where Bayes Rule would be helpful on how much the probabilities should shift, but I don't know how to apply it to this situation.
    ```

    - u/traverseda:
      ```
      That's a good list, I appreciate it.

      > important! Change the screws on your lock.

      The strike plate is pretty solid, and the first time they tried to use a pick gun, I've also taken some other precautions.

      >How well known is all of this to neighbors?

      The cops questioned them briefly, but it's a pretty quite place.

      >How well are things going with the guy and his girlfriend?

      I couldn't say, I'm not really interested in talking to either of them.

      >Do you know this guy well enough to say that he has a vindictive personality

      Well, his name came up a lot in the anonymous-led witch hunt for a high profile rape case, and there's some information I have that they didn't that makes me suspicious. He was pretty pissed at me when I told his girlfriend about that. Other then that I don't see any big warning signs aside from the standard young-drunk-instagram fuckboy thing he's got going on, which implies a certain level of narcissism. Doesn't have any pictures that don't include himself or expensive cars/watches. I personally think he's an asshole. Aside from the high-profile rape case I'm not seeing any particular history.

      >Ask about attempted or successful thefts in your area.

      There was one in a building near mine, I managed to get in touch with the guy. I'm of the opinion that they probably weren't related, the MO is pretty different. We don't have anything in common, no common contacts, but we were both specifically targeted.

      >I put myself in their shoes. I have to ask: is "Convincing a guy who looks like me to attempt to steal from the same place" really a good way to remove suspicion?

      Probably, the guy came up to my door at 11:45pm on a sunday with his face plainly visible and knocked loudly. I don't know if he was planning on forcing me to open my safe at gunpoint or just trying to be seen. I said "I don't know this person, give me a second". Sometime between me saying that and me putting on pants he ran off, and I chased him down to his car. Why do you think the thieves would loudly knock in the middle of the night, and then run off when I don't answer the door quickly enough? They also jammed a fire escape so they could open it from the outside, something I discovered pretty quickly.

      The guy I thought it was had a very solid alibi for that time, he was with his girlfriend, but the other guy was the same in both incidents.

      The other guy was on the lobby camera for more than a half hour waiting for someone to let him in, which is also very strange considering their previous MO.

      >How many times has someone tried to break in, since you've gotten the camera? 

      It's a secure building, not my camera but on belonging to the apartment. They used a lock pick gun the first time. Only the two times, they seemed pretty scared the second time.

      >What information are you supposing they have to convince them to break in?

      Well I wouldn't want to get into that on the internet. I haven't kept any valuables in the apartment in months, but I can definitely see why I'd have been a tempting target. Also I let his girlfriend know he was involved (to what extent I don't know) in a high profile rape case/internet-witch-hunt. He was pretty pissed off about that, but eventually calmed down.
      ```

  - u/Tenoke:
    ```
    Ok, so you have your prior for:

    1. Guy tries to cover up robbery by getting someone else to show their face: pretty low

    2. Guy (or same group) tries to rob same place again: low-ish

    3. Someone unrelated tries to rob the same place again: very low in that time frame

    Then you get evidence - 'guy shows up trying to rob my place again'
    This increases the posterior for all 1. 2. and 3. but since 2. and 3 are significantly more likely a priori (for me) it will still be the leading hypothesis (with 1. having way higher chance to be true than before of course but still lower than 2.)

    Throwing out some numbers based on my vague feelings for the priors - I'd put something around 20% on it being a cover-up by the same guy and at least 75% on it being the same guy/group as before.

    Don't pay attention to the numbers but this would be the way I'd start thinking about it.
    ```

  - u/doremitard:
    ```
    The fact that you effectively told the guy via his girlfriend means it’s absolutely possible that he tipped off someone about how to rob you to try to cover his tracks.

  So for the last several months, I've been woken up by my neighbor's opening their door in the morning between 4-6AM / turning on their truck due to their driveway being maybe 10 feet from my bedroom window (duplex). I've spoken to them about it, used white noise machines and a fan, and occasionally used earplugs (which are decent but don't seem to be good to use on a regular basis), but the issue hasn't gotten any better. I think the wall insulation is just very poor and I can't turn up the white noise to block the sound sufficiently without my ears hurting when I wake up.

  I feel like I'm missing something obvious and slight sleep deprivation is driving me crazy; any advice appreciated. Anyone had to deal with something similar?
  ```

  - u/Abpraestigio:
    ```
    Well, the most obvious and effective approach I can think of would be to sleep in a different room, though I have no idea how feasible that is in your case.

    &#x200B;

    Alternatively you could just go to bed earlier, so that you're already awake or don't lose as much sleep when your neighbor wakes you up.

    &#x200B;

    The next most obvious would be to move your bed so that your head is at the point furthest away from the window when you're lying in it.

    &#x200B;

    Next step would be to block off the window with something that absorbs or at least muffles sound, be it blankets, pillows or foam. In my (limited) experience it's the windows that are the weak-points when it comes to noise. Try it for a night or two to see whether it helps, and if it does you can rig something up so that you can still use the window during the day.

    &#x200B;

    If that still doesn't help you could get some hearing protection ear-muffs. The cheapest ones cost less than 20 bucks on Amazon, so you're not out all that much to find out whether you can sleep with them on.

    &#x200B;

    That's about it for obvious ideas on my part, not counting spending loads of money to sound-proof your flat.
    ```

    - u/FriendlyAnnatar:
      ```
      Blocking the window with foam and trying to sleep earlier both seem worth trying (the others won't work for my case, but were also reasonable). Much appreciated!
      ```

  - u/Nickless314:
    ```
    I had a somewhat similar problem for about half a year, renting an apartment which turned out to be near a temporary construction site.

    My local-optima solution was to put on earplugs immediately when the workers woke me up (\~5 AM). I think this is relevant to your case because after some time (several months), getting back to sleep became almost immediate (or at least felt that way), whereas initially I might suffer trying to get back to sleep for \~45 mins.

    I also tried the nuclear approach of sleeping the entire night every night with earplugs, which is not great, but if needs be, maybe try Mack's Slim Fit Earplugs.

    ```

  - u/theibbster:
    ```
    I've used some but never did any kind of tests or blinding on myself so can only comment on my subjective experience. If you check out gwern's stuff though you'll find some cool self testing you can do, he's often done self blinding and there are other self blinding methodologies that have I've seen recently (e.g. from the Imperial miceodosing study)

    I regularly take Vitamin d, B12 and creatine and feel like they positively affect my energy levels and mood. I eat a plant based diet so the B12 and creatine probably have a more pronounced effect on me than someone who eats meat and dairy.

    I sometimes have l-theanine with coffee which for me very noticeably reduces the feelings of overstimulation or jitteriness I sometimes feel (I don't drink coffee everyday so my tolerance to caffeine isn't too high).

    I've used melatonin at a dose of 0.3mg, it felt like it helped me sleep better, more regularly and feel more rested in the morning. 

    I've microdosed. I like how I feel when I do but I don't feel like it makes me more productive. I tend to take somewhere between 5-20 micrograms depending on the effect I'm going for and energy levels.

    I've tried modafinil during the day, felt like it did make me more productive and focused.  Like coffee but more. I rarely take it though. When I do, around 37-75mg of armodafinil (which is around 1/4-1/2 of the tablet).

    I sometimes take zinc, and use magnesium oil. Can't say I've noticed an effect but I just take them because I might not be getting enough from diet.

    B6 sometimes gives me more vivid dreams but might be leaving nootropic territory.

  THIS IS A COMMENT ABOUT THE NEW AVENGERS MOVIE. DO NOT CLICK UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR DO NOT MIND BEING SPOILED.

  >!Although I realize that blockbuster movies are not really known for continuity, in general Marvel movies have been pretty good about keeping their stories free of glaring plot holes. Which made it extremely disappointing to see the film that ended an era filled with such a large one. There may be more, but the one that is preventing me from properly enjoying the movie is the fact that despite them saying/following through with "Do not mess with the past timeline, it will screw up the future" to the point of giving back the infinity stones, they still majorly messed with the timeline. Gamora is no longer in the past, which means that she can't possibly be there for Guardians of the Galaxy and after. Same with the fact that Thanos and his army had been "snapped", meaning there can't be an Infinity War. Nebula had been killed, which means she should no longer exist. Unless somebody else can explain, please do!<
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    >!The film treats the past as an alternate reality. That solves all the problems you're talking about. Gamora died, then one came into the prime reality from an alternate reality past. Same for Thanos and Nebula, they're alternate reality versions. The one wrinkle in this is Captain America, though it's possible that he came back off-screen, rather than just taking the slow path.!<

        >!I don't think all the alternate realities could have merged together, since Alternate!Thanos came to the main reality and died there. Perhaps alternate realities are only created when a contradiction cannot be avoided or smoothed over by quantum effects. In that case, acts that don't cause contradictions just merge together into one self-consistent timeline. So the New York timeline got split off because Loki disappeared, and another timeline got created because Thanos and Gamora disappeared from it, but the 1950s timeline could have stayed consistent with the main timeline after Captain America returned the stone there; then he just stayed and kept a low profile until the right time.!<

      ```
      >!Ah right, I was just confused because they weren't too clear on what type of time travel this universe subscribed to in the beginning, imo.

    How about Breakneck Ridge?

    It's an awesome hike with incredible views, but be warned it's not for the faint of heart. You are essentially doing a lot of climbing up hence it's a very exhausting hike. I mean you don't need to know how to rock climb or anything, but there's a lot of bluffs. So only do this if you are decently athletic and like scrabbling up over rocks.

    It's about an hour and half to drive from Manhattan to the hike.

    Here's some decent articles to help: [one](https://hikethehudsonvalley.com/hikes/breakneck-ridge/), [two](http://www.nycdayhiking.com/hikes/breaksugar.htm)

    If you do a google search, you'll hear that it's closing down or something similar. It's not. It just was closed temporarily to repair a fallen boulder on the trail and isn't shutting down for the year.

    For fanfiction, I recommend Ao3 all the way.

    AO3 is better, but fanfiction.net has a larger audience, has been my experience. If you want it up for accessibility reasons, AO3 is the way to go. If you want as many people as possible to see/read your stuff, put it on both. If you make a website for yourself, it will be much more work for not much more reward than just putting it on AO3, and you won't have much traffic most likely.
