## [RT] [HSF] The Nitrogen Fix, by Hal Clement

### Post:

I would like to recommend this, since it doesn't seem to've already been. At the least, it's a book I really enjoy.

Brief synopsis: On a world where oxygen is much more rare in the atmosphere, how must humans change and adapt? 

Reasons that it is [RT]:
 - three factions with distinct goals, none of whom are 'evil', but who sometimes come into conflict with each other due to their goals;
 - characters who consider their actions;
 - consistent-seeming science (which I think is backed up by real chemistry), although in some cases it does feel like a parameter is being 'squeezed' into a narrow range to make the plot work;
 - viewpoint characters whose minds work quite differently from the reader's.
Some of the characters do non-useful things because of psychological limitations (example: 'cannot lie'); I don't feel this means it's not [RT].

I'm only halfway through, but it's good enough so far that I wanted to share.
