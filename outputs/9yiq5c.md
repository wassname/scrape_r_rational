  This is the last time I'll post a weekly update of this story here. From now on, I'll try to space it out a bit more to once every 2 or 3 at least.

  I'm starting to feel like this might be out of place anyway - while I'm definitely shooting for what's defined as rationalist fiction here, I think this might be a little too esoteric for people's tastes. The readership here seem to be more oriented around around higher-brow progression stuff than straight mysteries. (That or the story is just a bit weak. It's hard for me to tell, lol.)

  Either way, I'd still appreciate any feedback.

    You should keep at it! Whenever a beginning serial writer needs motivation, I bring up [this image](https://i.imgur.com/thRv4ks.jpg) of worm's readership progression. He only got 13 readers in the first month! Imagine if he gave up then.
