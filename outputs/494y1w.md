## Help finding audio book. The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate by Ted Chiang

### Post:

edit: Seems to be back up. Maybe a network issue. If you haven't listened or read the story, I would highly recommend it.

I hope this is the right place, but I was hoping someone could help me find a fantastic reading of a book by Ted Chiang. 

The story was originally on [this site](http://www.uvulaaudio.com/merchant.html). It had a wonderful speaker and really brought the story to live, but it seems in the last few days the link doesn't work.

If anyone has a copy or alternative link, it would be greatly appreciated. I'm currently scouring the internet to find an alternative. It would be a shame to lose this audiobook.
