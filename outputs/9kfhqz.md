    Ah, I hope not. I really feel like there is an arch to this story, or, I guess, there is a known climax/conclusion. Worm wasn't answering a question in the same way OtOoS is. And I would hate for that to be gunked up by percentiles.

      I think all the protags should have plot armor (or just plot Death Ward), but not their pokemon, and not side characters. I'd love to see the Zapdos fight run like the Levi fight with pokemon as parahumans.

  I love the reversal of Surge's place in the setting- instead of being the only remaining relic of any sort of concern for war, he's a visionary- who knows that something worse is coming, and is preparing for it.
  ```

  - u/empocariam:
    ```
    It's really kinda sad if you think about it, he is still at war in his mind, perhaps justifiable, but even so it's a tragic state for a person to perpetually be.
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Surge is like the doomsday prepper who gets to gloat to all his friends when the bombs start falling. Like a much-less-creepy Howard from 10 Cloverfield Lane.

  Has it been explained yet why the storm birds attack cities, when other legendaries don't? Is Arceus or Lugia mad at humanity or something? If not, I can't wait for that reveal!

  Do humans in this world even know that the other legendaries exist? They reference Arceus, but as a religious figure. Has anybody ever seen Kyogre or Groundon? 

  Also, what are humans in this world? There doesn't seem to be any other normal animals in this world, just pokemon. Are these humans just a really weak normal type, that traded almost all of their ability to use moves for increased intelligence, or is humanity a whole separate branch on the tree of life? Some humans are psychic, and some are dark, so they don't seem entirely unrelated to pokemon.
  ```

  - u/ManyCookies:
    ```
    The stormbirds don't specifically attack cities, they seasonally fly around and sometimes happen to intersect cities (iirc Blue mentions a winter where Articuno just hung around some uninhabited island).

    >Has anybody ever seen Kyogre or Groundon?

    Giovanni seemed to take their existence for granted in the last chapter, he only questioned how strong they were.

      Based on game lore I would say they exist but have been inactive for a while.

    Your last question is the central mystery of the whole work, so I don't suspect it will be answered until it is addressed in the story.

        Yeah, but that was one of the pokemon he was going to use, anyway, right? It sounded like he had a line-up for the mastery challenge, then for the membership challenge he just used the one pokemon.
        ```

        - u/nipplelightpride:
          ```
          It kind of sounded like Surge was purposefully greatly reducing the difficulty of the fight, since he wanted to recruit Blue.

      More difficult than a third badge challenge for mastery at least (you can't expect all gym members to be eight badge level trainers). I'm guessing gym leaders have a lot of leeway in how challenging they make the membership challenges.

  For about a paragraph after Surge declined the gym challenge, I thought Blue would eventually end up getting a PITY BADGE from his city defense. 

  I'm surprised Membership is an easier challenge than Mastery. I guess I headcanon'd that formal Membership was reserved for higher up positions who might need to challenge/teach veteran trainers, lest the gym leader spend all their time in Membership battles against whatever random Lass wants to hang around.
  ```

  - u/sir_pirriplin:
    ```
    I think the idea is that Membership is the standard path, where you work for the gym while they train you and then you challenge for Mastery when you learned everything they can teach. Challenging for Mastery right away is the fast path for ambitious trainers.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Nice idea, if u/daystareld agrees. If so, though, then membership should probably be listed first; see chapter 23, which clearly states "Mastery, Membership, or Leadership" and "Each is more difficult than the last."
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Woops, you're right. Changing it now!
        ```

    - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
      ```
      Except that anyone can take the lessons in the gym, member or not. There may be premium lessons for members only, but members are expected to fulfil real and potentially dangerous duties in the gym, city, and local area. Not to mention that the Leader themself is challenged.
      ```

      - u/sir_pirriplin:
        ```
        Maybe randos are tutored by gym members and the gym members are tutored by the leader. Then once a trainer learns all they can from the gym members, naturally they'll want to learn from the leader, so they challenge for membership to show they are ready.
        ```

        - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
          ```
          Maybe. But gym leaders are also known to hand out TMs to trainers who win their mastery badges.
          ```

  - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
    ```
    I think it was mostly just a formality. Let the little shit prove that he is at least minimally competent, then put him to work solving an otherwise intractable problem to save you the work with the expectation that he'll go on his way upon success (or failure), potentially as an asset to the gym.

  Huh, I was not expecting new york vs. native americans. Makes you wonder just what's going on in the pokemon world that people have all these unconnected patches of civilization, but don't seem to expand between them.
  ```

  - u/Ulmaxes:
    ```
    It could also simply be a matter of culture. Expansion has certainly been a favored past time of our world's nations, but not all of them. And given the the vast, destructive power of Pokemon, establishing large stable empires before pokeballs would be extremely difficult.
    ```

    - u/Lipat97:
      ```
      Is it implied that pokemon can only be domesticated through pokeballs? I was under the impression that many, if not all, were tamable and that pokeballs only magnified the process. In that case, war wouldn't be on the scale we see here but a guy who makes friends with a charmander when he was a kid is going to be able to take over a couple of villages at least later on. 

      It does seem like suuuper large scale societies aren't really a thing. Unova, Kanto, Johto etc don't really seem very big. Unova's map might just be based off of New York, maybe it's actually a bigger region, but even then I doubt it's bigger than New York State.
      ```

      - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
        ```
        Riding a dragon to war is not in the same league as having your soldiers each wearing a literal army of monsters on a grenade belt.
        ```

        - u/Lipat97:
          ```
          A sword isn't on the same level as a gun, but people still did a loooot of damage before guns were around. It isn't entirely about the power of your own weapon, it's about the power of your weapon relative to the power of their weapons. Riding a dragon into battle is insane in a world without pokeballs, especially since it's probably a pretty rare thing to have that strong of a pokemon before pokeballs. Having an army of monsters makes you an average citizen in this story, having a charizard in a world where people are still in the feudal age makes you strong enough to almost start an empire on your own.
          ```

          - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
            ```
            That's the impression I get from the story, that warlords ravaged the world, or protected a small piece of it.

            Though I get the distinct impression that the average citizen is not a trainer armed with six+ pseudo-legendaries. Trainers clearly receive a lot of state support to do what they do (for starters, the manufacture of Pokeballs must surely be subsidised to keep them affordable), and I doubt that would work if everyone was in on it. Laura seems more like an average citizen, who had no Pokemon in adulthood at all until she purchased a Tangela that had already received basic training.
            ```

            - u/Lipat97:
              ```
              Holy shit that's even more insane to think that Pokemon might only be a middle class+ thing. Can you imagine how much worse class divisions would be if the wealthy legit had fire breathing dragons ready to ride around? Most fully evolved Pokemon are stronger than most Marvel superheros/villains. Thank god they have this renegade shit going on because class warfare would be insane in this universe. But then again maybe it's just some horse-riding kind of thing, the Renegade laws make it hard to use it for legit oppression but indirectly its probably a lot harder to survive in that world without pokemon of your own considering how much of a threat wild pokemon are. I mean I think we've had quite a few tier 3 events in this story already and I don't think it's been a full year yet. 

              But I am still curious about how the smaller city states are explained. I think it'd take a bit more convincing to say that the presence of Pokemon is enough of a reason for humans to have only gotten so far with their expanding their regions. It seems like it took them around 3 days for the two journeys between Cerulean and Brock's city and Pallet Town. That puts the region maybe at the size of Ireland? And it's not implied that the other regions are that much bigger, otherwise that would be mentioned more. We know they've at least tried to take shit over in the past, so it's not like they're peaceful than normal human.

                I don't know how big it is in the games or in OoS, but Kanto is based, in name and coastline, on the KantÅ region of Japan, which is the one with Tokyo in it. It's about the size of Belgium.
                ```

                - u/Lipat97:
                  ```
                  Yeah I was somewhat aware of that, but I heard some imply that it might be a Kanto scaled up, Unova a scaled up NYC, etc so I was just going off what's in the story.
                  ```

                    We will have to ask u/DaystarEld so that he makes the schoolboy error of publicly committing to a specific size regardless of story needs so that we can pick over travel times for every inconsistency. 

                    That way it can be a huge scandal when Red and Leaf are cornered by Shadow Pokemon while abroad and send an emergency message from Shiver Camp to Victory Road via Murkrow, resulting Lance successfully flying his Dragonites to the rescue by the following morning.

                    And tragically loses his fan-favourite Aerodactyl to a well-aimed *Icicle Spear* attack, but that reaction will be lost to the supersonic Murkrow controversy.

      They are on opposite ends of the continent, and if that holds true for the Pokemon world we are potentially looking at a continent's worth of wilds being upset. It may be that Inuvik is losing a way of life in those wilds, but it's more likely that Unovan development is displacing the wildlife and increasing the threat to Inuvika cities from the likes of Volcarona, Haxorus, and Darmanitan.

      If activities in Hoenn resulted in an increased threat to Kanto from Dragonite and Gyarados, you can bet that Kanto would take action.

    Yeah I wondered about that. I think it is the author's perogative to do some world building while we wait for GameFreak to catch up, but I think it's a little muddy here. The Inuit and Sioux are not exactly New York adjacent. I wonder if a play on the Iroquois confederation might feel more appropriate geographically.

- u/Lipat97:
  ```
  Fantastic chapter, had a lot of great world building to it. The part about Blue and Surge and the Zapdos was really well done, I wanna see more about how Surge prepared for war and whether he can do anything about Blue, but by far the best part was the beginning with the war. Seeing how war is in this 'verse is really interesting. Its also interesting to see you make up a new region. So this chapter gave a lot more insight (and a lot more questions!) about the larger scale geopolitics of this world. You've gone beyond explaining pokemon genetically and gotten to how military tactics would evolve around pokemon. At the very least, talking about whether these people are expansionist might hint towards whether humans are naturally that way or if we are that way culturally or if they simply wouldn't be naturally that way in a world with pokemon. This also kinda plays into the whole vegan thing because we probably wouldn't have evolved to eat as much meat if we weren't the Apex predator in every continent. Are all the regions in this universe small? I can't see Unova as being bigger than New York State. Do they all have a pokemon league? Is this world mostly wilderness with small pockets of strong human civilizations? Or is the entire world populated (like ours) but everything is small nation states, comparable to Europe or how the US would look if every state was it's own country. Its presumed that the power of pokemon would make large countries difficult to maintain, especially before pokeballs, but it's also implied that pokemon were still tamable before pokeballs, so war would and territorial expansion would still have existed. And Surge mentioned how entire regions used to get wiped out, so its not like regions are a new thing. But in the real world the expansion of a nation is limited by transportation, which these guys have in spades. So are wild pokemon really more of a boon to expansionist states than a lack of transportation? Again, it is possible that culturally they wouldn't be more peaceful because they wouldn't have been predators like humans in our universe were, but it probably is worth exploring. 

  And then how does war interact with pokemon? Being able to teleport away is huge, it makes kamikazes super viable, especially when kamikaze planes can have voltorbs in them. The fact that a hyper beam can probably bust through anything makes big tanks and big aircraft carriers not very strong. Or if those things are able to withstand anything BUT a hyper beam then hyper beam will become very important. And pokemon who can defend against those high power attacks would be super strong, being able to put a protective bubble around one of those helicopters would have been a W. And what about bullets? I presume a machine gun would rip through any of the bird pokemon, and we have confirmation that guns are a thing in the show (episode where Ash mistook a camera for a gun). Are pokemon that are resistant to metal type attacks also resistant to bullets? If so, by how much? Do bullets just bounce of Charizard or is it more like his skin is a bullet proof vest? The way that bullets, missiles, and explosions interact with the typing stuff could have huge implications on what's strong in battle. 

  Also I totally see you setting up for Blue to start to side with Giovanni. Giving Blue a way to kill the birds might be too big for him to pass up, and he already kinda idolizes the dude anyway. Maybe he won't go complete turn coat but I can see you're gonna do some interesting things with that.

  Eelectross brought a smile to my face, it's definitely one of my favourite electric types, alongside Jolteon. I've used Giga Drain Eelectross on Smogon to great effect. It feels great when an unsuspecting opponent counters with a ground type only to find their attacks completely ineffective and being beaten about the head with life steal.

  I would have countered Surge by having Rhyhorn lead with Smack Down and quickly followed up with an Earthquake.
