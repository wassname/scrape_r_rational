## Neat things from Brandon Sanderson books?

### Post:

In this village I've read mentions of highly imaginative concepts from this man's books, like genie-ish metal armbands you can store your weight in. But when I tried entering his books I found them hellishly dully written, and couldn't. 

So what are some of the cool ideas they entomb?

  Which ones did you try?  I personally have found his work to be engrossing and refreshingly original.  I don't know that one or two sentence summaries would do justice to the stories he's crafted . . . and despite this being /r/rational it sort of misses the point entirely.

  Aside from what I personally consider to be his exceptional writing, he has managed to move away from being just another crypto-Tolkein with a human/elf/dwarf cast in a fantasy-europe.  I have historically hardly read any fantasy precisely because of the same old tropes.  Sanderson makes me want to read more.  

  He also manages to bridge the fantasy/sci-fi divide nicely by having elements of both in his writing.

    I dipped Well of Ascension, read some Way of Kings and a stroke into Warbreaker, then a random page of Hero of Ages because that was also on the shelf. Clearly not a fair trial of most of them as stories or as speculative fiction, but the bland prose warded me off.

    The setting sounds cool but I don't want to mine the book for them. If you have the gem, I'd love to see a photo.

      WEll well of Ascension is the second book of a series. Try Mistborn: The Final Empire. IT's the first book in the trilogy.

      The "bland prose" is an aspect I really enjoy about his books. The prose tends to go for clarity rather than flowery descriptions and it helps me maintain a clear mental image when reading. It reminds me a bit of the prose in Worm. 

      If you're looking for better prose with a similar ideas about magic, check out " the Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss. I mentioned it on my other comment on this but his prose is well and some of the same approach to magic and world building that appeal to the rationalist in me are there.

        You're right - I think Sanderson's keeping his prose less flowery is a deliberate choice, though mileage will vary. He tends to work on one or two phrases that build the mental picture. In mistborn, it's Kredik Shaw's spires and "Ash fell from the sky."

        On the plus side, Mistborn is the only good Medieval Fantasy story I've found that tells a *complete* story in under 600 pages. It's "A New Hope", not "Fellowship of the Ring".

        I think he got better at this in the Stormlight Archive. He manages to slip in descriptions through events and through character observations, as opposed to thickening the prose:
        >Wit: Perhaps a story for a child. I will tell you one, to get you in the mood. A bunny rabbit and a chick went frolicking in the grass together on a sunny day. 

        >Kaladin: A chick...baby chicken? And a what? 

        >Wit: Ah, forgot myself for a moment. Sorry. Let me make it more appropriate for you. A piece of wet slime and a disgusting crab thing with seventeen legs slunk across the rocks together on an insufferably rainy day. Is that better? 

        >Kaladin: I suppose.

  The writing quality has some variance to it. *The Stormlight Archive* has much better writing than something like, say, *Mistborn*. If you just want spoilers for the cool stuff, [check the wiki](http://coppermind.net/wiki/Coppermind:Welcome), which details some of the magic systems.

  The *Mistborn* books are notable for being one of the few fantasy books that actually show technological progress over the course of the series, which in itself is pretty cool.

    ```
    The only fantasy series I can think of with technological progress are Discworld and ATLA/LOK and in the later, it mostly happened between series.

  You should check out his lectures on the three rules of magic. It shows how the magic systems he makes are quasi-reductionist. It's not strictly rationalist(rule zero is awesomeness trumps everything), but the ideas he has about how much a reader understands the magic is proportional what magic can solve plot wise reminds me of rationalist fic. 

  The stormlight archives have some cool scenes of people trying to understand magic through scientific means, and while it's not hugely detailed, there's a feeling that people aren't just "magic works mysteriously because magic, k?" the world building is detailed and takes care to stay internally consistent. You won't see many "well, why don't they just fly on eagles to mount doom and drop the ring in" inconsistencies.

  His prose can be a little bland because its so straightforward, but I like the straightforward clarity it lends to his action sequences when stuff gets complicated. 

  As a secondary recommendation of stuff I'd consider semi-rational fantasy if you didn't care for Sanderson, you should check out "The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss. The sympathetic(like affects like) magic in that series uses a kind of conservation law in it, but the prose is really fantastic.

  Hey, though I'm a big fan of Sanderson and am naturally saddened that you don't enjoy the books, I understand that opinions will always vary. To answer the question and try to make an info-dump:

  * One book has magic made by drawing symbols, then you find *why* they're drawn like they are, and it's plot relevant, and even deducible before the characters figure it out.
  * The Rithmatist also has a magic system based on drawing magic circles in chalk. It's simple and explained thoroughly enough that you know all the rules and could draw them yourself, and make intelligent decisions like "I would put another line there, which would sacrifice flexibility but improve defense" or "I'd leave that bit out because, though it's useful, it'd take too long to draw and this needs to be fast."
  * Warbreaker: animating objects, used intelligently. In particular, animating parts of your clothing.
  * Technically a spoiler, but I'd want to know it anyways if I were a new fan: [](#s "Most of his novels take place on different planets in the larger universe, there is some yet-minor crossover, and mysteries to solve by piecing info together across novels. Magic from one planet might be able to transport you to another.")
  * A guy who's probably a genius - he's more-or-less perfectly average, but he hallucinates lots of different experts in different fields, as imaginary friends. He insists they get seats in the car, hotel rooms, etc.
  * All the tricks in Mistborn you've probably read. [Book one spoiler:](#s "Includes predicting the future without superpowers, by observing the actions of opponents who can.")
  * Alcatraz vs the Evil Librarians has a group of people who have really dumb-sounding superpowers who use them to insane effect. The ability to "get water on the floor while doing dishes" ended a drought. Grandpa uses his talent to arrive late to things in order to arrive late to bullets.

  This question could easily be answered by reading Wikipedia or the fan wikis. Then you don't even have to talk to people who liked things you disdain, so you won't risk an argument over the merits of Sanderson's writing.
