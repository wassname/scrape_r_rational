anyway in this episode character build happens and how more differing oppinions can help your cause (provided they come in form of philosophical robot who is specifically aiming to change a volatile mind status of his companion/student/swordswisher?

  I find it interesting that we have effective confirmation that the entire story is told via a first-person omnipotent narrator when the hand is healed.

  I'd got my hopes up but I'd already read it :(.

  My biggest fear for this story is that as new lore is released it will become more and more AU, to the point where they just take place in similar universes. Think The Games We Play for RWBY, which doesn't take into account season 3 let alone season 4, so all the origin stuff just feels more jarring. 

  Other than that I'm really liking it.

    Yea, I find that happens frequently with fanfiction about something new. I got into Naruto fanfic back before part 1 had even ended. So we didn't know fucking anything about anything really. Background lore went in so many different ways. 

    Kazama Arashi was the defacto name for Naruto's dad. The Kyuubi was often characterized as a girl. The sharingan was a product of demons (often times the Kyuubi itself was responsible)

    Good times...good times...

      Orochimaru being the main villain, or Madara, Tobi theories, Flying Thunder God theories, yeah, know what you're talking about.

        I remember I once read a fic where FTG was just a cloak with seals on it that let you... fly.

        Flying Thunder God, indeed.

          My favorite was it was a way to karawami with a photon, thus, a flash of light. I don't think physics was quite their strongest suit.
