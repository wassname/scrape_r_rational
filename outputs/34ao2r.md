## [WIP][HSF][TH] FAQ on LoadBear's Instrument of Precommitment

### Post:

My shoulder's doing better, so I'm getting back into 'write /something/ every day' by experimenting with a potential story-like object at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nRSRWbAqtC48rPv5NG6kzggL3HXSJ1O93jFn3fgu0Rs/edit . It's extremely bare-bones so far, since I'm making up the worldbuilding as I go, and I just started writing an hour ago.

I welcome all questions that I can add to it, either here or there.

  You could combine it with your other story about Bunny where this is a FAQ provided by one of the human-turned-AIs she runs across. The question is how far she could even trust this FAQ to tell her anything useful about this new, unknown AI?

    It's an interesting idea, but at the moment, I'd like to stretch my imagination a bit with a separate setting - one in which civilization hasn't had an apocalyptic crash.

      Hum, if you ever wanted to work in something that has a bit more handwavium again It would actually fit in a setting I'm tentatively looking for collaborators for.

      For me it's mostly out of a desire to really dig into a fantastical fantasy (something like rational alice and wonderland) setting instead of just more tolkeinesque gobbos.

  Quick poll!

  People who've said out loud something along the lines of "I consent to have my mindstate instantiated in other environments under the following conditions", raise your hands.

  _hand_

    What is this 'out loud' you speak of, and what purpose does it serve? :)

    (I'm currently working out what conditions I /would/ say something like that to, but second-order effects can be tricky...)
    ```

    - u/FeepingCreature:
      ```
      Well, I'm assuming just _thinking_ it would not be considered actual consent. Thought is involuntary. Saying it out loud implies a conscious choice.

      Also I assume decoding air vibrations is easier than decoding neural patterns.
      ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      Well, memorizing a terms and conditions of your own emulation is kind of a cool gimmick. And who knows, maybe the standard ethics for reviving licenseless mindstates in the future will be to check for terms of use in the mindstate itself.
      ```

- u/None:

  Interesting.

  I guess my viewpoint on mindstate proliferation has always been colored by the idea of 4chan getting their hands on me. The incentive to torture is sometimes solely the torture itself, and it doesn't matter that you wouldn't get cooperation out of it. By engaging in a proliferation scheme, you're dooming some percentage of your selves to extremely unpleasurable existences. I suppose it still makes sense if you think that the percentage of selves that don't get tortured is going to be high, or if you think that a life of being tortured and abused is better than not existing even if you have alternate instantiations out there.

  Am I allowed to roll back LoadBear to a previous version? Is this considered the same as killing him? Does it require his consent in order to be within the Terms?
