  Ah, I recommended this a few months back in the Monday recommendation thread. I was a few days late on the posting but good to see others also spreading the word.

  And the first half, the rational portion, is completed. A rarity in the world of fanfiction.

  I'm gonna go against the grain here, I didn't enjoy it very much. Very very slow paced and constantly descending into melodrama. The one good part is that it really manages to give a satisfying explanation to the Gaster deal in the original game, so it's not a complete waste, but I really don't recommend this to anyone who doesn't care about that.

    I enjoyed it a lot, I think Gaster's character arc was well realized (if somewhat cliche in some ways), but I agree it doesn't seem like it would work very well if you're not familiar with the source material.

  How worth reading is it if I dont know almost anything about the game?

    Having just now read the first of the 4 stories... Not so much. It's kinda a weird world, and it doesn't do a greattt job explaining it.

    From my reading so far, it seems to rely a lot on knowing the story of Undertale. Which isn't a bad thing, but it might not be what you're looking for. I WOULD highly recommend Undertale though, it's very good.
