  Villains do horrible things like rip out people's souls with their foul sorcery, heroes do great things like get psychotic ladies to carve the souls out of people.

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    Rip out a soul and wear it as a cloak? Evil. Rip out a soul and wear it as a pendant "for safekeeping"? Good. See? It's easy! It's ostentatiousness that's evil, not ripping out souls.

      I thought the one crawling away holding her guts was Hye...that's why Black said she'll outlive Saint.
      ```

- u/grayishknight:
  ```
  So Bard is offering Black the chance to climb the tower which I half want him to pursue and at the same time fear for him if he does.

  I don't know if by mistake Black means his past refusal of the title of Dread Emperor or Bard trying to pit him against Malicia but either way I am nervous and excited for Book 5 Black.
  ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    It seemed pretty clear to me that he wasn't implying he had made a mistake. Plus it really does seem like it would be a narrative mistake to give Black a shred of power when everything he's built is tumbling down.
    ```

  - u/NZPIEFACE:
    ```
    I personally think that he's going to get the role of a hero/antihero.

    The "What do you think what is right?" and "How far are you willing to go?" makes me think of what he thought heroes were, a necessary evil.  
    Actually, that's kinda what Tariq thinks of heroes are too... unnecessary suffering and all that.

    Anyways, it'd be hilarious if he turned into a hero.

    The weird thing is, Malicia would probably be a better chancellor than Emperor.  She focuses too much on political reality, and lacks long-term vision.  In a way, I think the best possible outcome for team evil would be Catherine as Empress Victorious, Malicia as Chancellor, and Black as Black Knight or General.  (Which, why the fuck is Adjutant a \[name - edit\], but General is not?)
    ```

    - u/Banarok:
      ```
      it probably is, just not for the Cultures that Cathrine hang around in since usually Heroes/villans double as generals maybe? and therefor have not gotten enough momentum.
      ```

    - u/OmniscientQ:
      ```
      Unfortunately, the very reasons for Alaya making a good Chancellor are also the ones that woukd ensure that she inevitably betrayed and supplanted her Tyrant. Because she focuses on political realities, she would become increasingly frustrated with the limitations imposed by Amadeus or Catherine or whoever else was on the throne. We already saw this conflict play out at Second Liesse. Amadeus and Alaya disagreed and came into conflict. If she had been Chancellor, that would have been exactly the moment she decided to betray the Tyrant of Praes.

      Also, I think we (the fans) need to be more consistent in our use of the terms "Name" and "Role". Adjutant is a Name, but he fulfills the Role of "Right-Hand Man". Captain and Scribe are Names, and they each fill that same role. "Plucky Comedic Relief" is a role that might be filled by, for example, the Bumbling Conjurer. I believe ErraticErrata has been pretty consistent with those terms in-story.

    "Complex"
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop on that one.

      I get that Cat is supposed to caught the supervillain flu (also known as "Bad Cold"), but how exactly did she get Hakram, Vivienne *and* Akua to vet her stupid plan?
      ```

      - u/NZPIEFACE:
        ```
        Akua probably just went along with it for the fucks of it.  
        Thief probably doesn't know any better when it comes to fights.  
        Hakram? He probably thought it was a good idea cause Cat said it was. ~~Even if he secretly thought it was the dumbest shit ever.~~
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          ... yeah, I'm not convinced.
          ```

      - u/LordSwedish:
        ```
        Because nobody knows how to fight a seer when massively outnumbered and outgunned. Throw a bunch of random shit around and let Cat go on a rampage seems as good a plan as any.
        ```

- u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
  ```
  Somehow I don't think Black is a claimant to Chancellor or Dread Emperor. What Role is he currently filling? He no longer fits into the groove of black knight. He is behind enemy lines after throwing off most of his allegiances to the tower. I'm betting on something along the lines of Rogue.
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    He’s the villain we need not the villain we deserve, a watchful guardian, a silent protector, a Dark Knight
    ```

  - u/cyberdsaiyan:
    ```
    A... Rogue Knight?

    *Activates God's Strength*
    ```

    - u/M3mentoMori:
      ```
      *incoherent yelling*
      ```

    - u/Rice_22:
      ```
      What would be Sven's aspects? Seize'd his giant blade, Shatter'd the helm from his backstory and of course his famous Cleave?
      ```

      - u/cyberdsaiyan:
        ```
        Those would be pretty cool, but the issue is whether he fits into a hero or villain role. He's portrayed as a sort of grey character, but I think he fits the brooding antihero role quite well.
        ```

        - u/Rice_22:
          ```
          Probably something like the Lone Swordsman, yeah. He's more rebellious and anti-authority, though.
          ```

  - u/dragonblaz9:
    ```
    Maybe a white knight? It would be a massive surprise, totally against his character, but could also be the most practical move. How better to counter the knight championed by justice than to become a claimant? Don’t think this is it, but I wouldn’t be totally surprised by it either. Personally still leaning closer to the idea that Bard meant the Dread Emperor’s seat.
    ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      His absolute contempt for heroes might get in the way. Also, I’m fairly sure Above are happy with Hanno “I’ll kill whoever you want me to” so they’ll probably tip the scales.
      ```

  - u/OmniscientQ:
    ```
    His Role, currently, seems to be some blend of Person-Shaped MacGuffin, and Not-So-Helpless Damsel. Maybe a bit of The Mole worked in. He's gonna be setting things up so that when the Big Damn "Heroes" show up to liberate him, they'll find that he already has a plan in place, picked his own cuffs, escape route planned, and some critical secret gleaned from his time as a captive that will prove to be they key to bringing down the Heroes.

    At least, that's the Role. But Amadeus has a tendency not to play his assigned Role the way it was intended...
    ```

  - u/JesradSeraph:
    ```
    Bard wants Amadeus to Claim the name of Chancellor, apparently ? I hope he claims Heir or Squire instead. The narrative specifics are unclear but either should align him back with Catherine, who’s already stated she intends to rescue him.

    The *mistake* alluded to must be that dhe’s letting him know Cat is alive and well. Bard did not say « She is dead » which would have been the optimal way to present it in context, but instead « she got killed again », and there is a heap of implications there Maddy could not miss.
    ```

- u/rumblestiltsken:
  ```
  My word, the burn. Black and the heroes was delicious, but the Saint of Swords in particular. I'm assuming that she wasn't on guard duty again because they had to pull her off his nearly dead corpse.

  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if she had killed him, and pilgrim had to resurrect him.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  So is Book 4 done? Ive been waiting to binge the whole thing.
  ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    Yes, go for it.
    ```

    - u/LimeDog:
      ```
      Same here. This is gonna be good.

  Book V will begin on January the 14th.

  It kinda seems like the Bard is running scared.  Her actions of increasing desperation remind me of a dictator that is facing grassroots protests and unfulfillable demands from the elite.  Yes she has some control over stories, but stories change over time, and eventually old narrative systems become untenable.
  ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    Well when the Hierarch declares that she is anathema to existence it tends to leave a mark!
    ```

    - u/Schuano:
      ```
      I want the Black/Heirarch/Grey Pilgrim Team up vs. the Bard.
      ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      I've been mostly skipping the hierarch sections -- he irritates me, has no agency, and so far has not seemed terribly relevant to the plot. Apparently I missed something. Would you mind giving me a quick recap on who he is and what he's done?
      ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        So he was the diplomat representing Bellepheron in the Free Cities. Tyrant twisted a story around well enough to get him a Name, Hierarch, and elected him the leader of the Free Cities in a time of war.

        Hierarch, being from a ridiculous democratic society, hates that he has a Name and is effectively a dictator, so he doesn't do much and Tyrant kind of rules in his stead a lot.

        Bard pops up at the end of book 3 and talks to Hierarch saying she was the one who created the Name in the first place by accident. This gets Hierarch into a rare fit of pique (he gets them on occasion as he can pretty much see everything going on and he has a fair set of ethics to work off of, twisted as they are by Bellepheron).

        Hierarch basically indicts Bard with a host of charges and sentences her to death. This decleration is so powerful she pops out of existence (like she does when she dies) and we don't see her again til much later.

        I think he's got a ridiculously powerful name and a ridiculously powerful belief system and he's slowly developing into a counterpart to Cat in that he's pretty fucking pissed at the Gods Above and Below. He recently decided to pursue justice against the Choir of Judgement, so that will leave a mark on the Heavens.

        I think he and Cat are going to be powerful pieces in getting the Accords signed and operational.

        Also, I think he's hilarious. Just perfectly pissed off at his situation and the various laws he cites show a democracy run amok.
        ```

- u/fortycakes:
  ```
  So Cat and Black are both going to be claimants for the same title? This should be interesting.

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    Yup. 100%
    ```

- u/Schuano:
  ```
  This epilogue makes it abundantly clear that Black is the better character with the better story.    


  That has been what is kind of disappointing about Book 5 and Book 4.  We were waiting for Catherine to get more like Black.  Use the power of institutions instead of her name, become story and plot savvy, instead she has become more reliant on her magical powers and just trying to BS her way through the story.
