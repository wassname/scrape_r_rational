Marked for Death is a story set in a re-engineering of the Naruto-verse, where thread participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of exile ninja who helping each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.

The first chapter is [here,](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/). To see only the important posts, you can hit 'Reader Mode' button, or got to the story-only thread (without all the amazing fan-fanfiction) [here.](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/4993131/) Thereâ€™s also a [guide to voting](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/posts/6283682/) put together by forum participant Twofold. Drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja.

The story updates every Thursday (u/Velorien of [Lighting Up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark)) and Sunday (u/eaglejarl of [Team Anko](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko), [2 Year Emperor](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/) and [Induction](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/Induction/chapter_001.html)).

  I love how these omakes greatly deepen the worldbuilding. I had completely forgotten about Hana, and now I'm rooting for her to come back!

  Good work /u/OliWhail and congrats to everyone on the Marked for Death team. One year!

    Oy! Mine is canon, not an omake! :P (Velorien and Tesseract's omake are awesome too, ofc)
