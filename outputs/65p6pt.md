  Great to see an update!

  The real plan was a surprise to me and now I'm eager to find out how you resolve it. Keep up the good work.

  Just discovered this and read it in two days. More please. I think you're really good at provoking an emotional reaction, conveying things to the reader in between what's actually being said. I also like the analysis of the techniques and hope it produces some novel uses of simple techniques. That was always Naruto's true genius in combat, improvising

  Hi all. Long delay since the last chapter - Mae Culpa. I'll blame the shortage of interesting and exciting reviews here on reddit for my lack of inspiration :-p

  It's a more explicitly rational chapter this time around, which I know some of you have been asking for, so I hope you guys like it. I totally forgot to mention this last time, but the story is intended to be a solvable mystery in the same way as HPMOR, so it should have been possible to figure out Zabuza and Haku's real plan. Did you see it coming, or was it a huge surprise? Was the reveal satisfying? Let me know in the comments!
