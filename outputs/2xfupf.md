  So it's a Fiona chapter. Gotta say she has rather rotten luck, losing all her identification documents like that. I can emphasize somewhat, finding it impossible to obtain post packages due to not-having-a-driver's-license.

  Wonder what's happened to all the rest of her colleagues? Hope they're not dead...

    Not really a big deal. A new copy of your (or anyone elses) birth certificate costs a tenner. You're not required to carry your drivers license with you and have three weeks to produce it at a police station if needed.
