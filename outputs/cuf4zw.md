## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

    Can anyone explain to me what happened with Reeves' popularity?

    Last I remember, everyone was shitting all over him for being a terrible actor. It seems like now he's well-loved. Did he just hire a really good PR company or what?
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      He was in a few big movies that weren't that well-received - *47 Ronin* and *Man of Tai Chi* comes to mind. As he's the lead actor, he got called a terrible actor (most visible = easiest target).

      Then John Wick came out that audiences loved, and it also came out that the guy donates a ton to charity, stories about how [nice he is](https://kluv.radio.com/blogs/miles-morning/did-you-know-octavia-spencer-was-famous-keanu-reeves-came-her-rescue-when-she) became more well-known, he was cast as a character in the *very* highly anticipated *Cyberpunk 2077* game (which is where the "You're breathless" comes from). 

      He also had a very, *very* [hard life](https://people.com/archive/too-much-sorrow-vol-55-no-16/) - his bio dad left his family when he was 4, and mom had a strong of divorces, hi sister was diagnosed with leukemia, his best friend OD'ed, daughter was stillborn, his (then ex-) GF was in a fatal car accident. So there's a ton of sympathy for him from that.

      So basically a guy with a very hard personal life became super popular around the same time that it was revealed he's just really very nice to everyone around him, and everything kind of just took off from there.

      Fun fact: In 47 Ronin, people complained that have a white guy playing the main character, who was half white/Japanese, was whitewashing. Keanu Reeves himself is half-white/Asian.

        Thanks for the detailed response! I don't really follow pop culture much; I was just surprised to see how much goodwill he was garnering considering how much it was *in vogue* to make fun of him, last I heard the guy mentioned. But, like your timeline might indicate, this was probably in the early 2000's.

      Apparently hes doing charity and being very very nice to people who ask him for selfies. He was already popular and then the "you are breathtaking" meme emerged. https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/youre-breathtaking

        If we're tracing the popularity of Keanu in memes, Sad Keanu came first:

        https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sad-keanu

        And generally it would lead people to ask what superstar action star Keanu Reeves has to be sad about, and someone else would reply back with some of his life story, and other people would talk about what a great guy he was.
        ```

      I've always felt that while he is a pretty bad dialog actor his facial expressions communicate a great deal. He's perfect for strong but silent types.

  Anyone ever tried Princess Tutu? Despite it's girly name, it's a really cool anime about a character from a fairy tale fighting against fate. And the idea of an evil narrator that plays god with the lives of the characters is really neat.

  The character development is on point, the music is all classical ballet pieces and the story has some twists that make it clever.

  Also it has a cool fanfic called [This Pendent Heart](https://sites.google.com/site/thispendentheart/).

      Oh will check that out then! Thanks a lot for the info!

      And yeah it's focus on emotions is also interesting, because they are also an important element of the human condition and a rational being should take them into account when taking decisions.

  OPM has updated a bunch since I read it last. *Damn* -- it's been great. The descent into the Monster Association headquarters, and the escalation/revelation of hero and monster abilities has been super fun to read. 

  Also the titular OPM, always love his scenes. Poor demon dog.

        dont forget the webcomic, the plot for that goes much further than where the manga is right now.

          Can you please link the translated webcomic?

            check the sidebars. 

            https://mangadex.org/manga/9123/one-punch-man-web-comic-original

            there are multiple translations of the chapters. webcomic is a much lower visual qaulity overall.

  I'm creating a middle-eastern based culture for my web-series, how detailed should I get?
  ```

    I'm a big fan of casting a wide net and not drilling down too hard unless you're going to do it in the text. Here's my checklist of things to think about, if not things to have long, complex answers for:

    **Geography checklist**

     * Land masses
     * Rock/metal distribution
     * Watersheds
     * Seasons
     * Prevailing winds
     * Biomes
     * Arability

    **Cultural Predicates Checklist**

     * Non-renewable resources
     * Renewable resources
     * Crops and domesticated animals
     * Natural disasters
     * Diseases
     * Technology

    **Cultural Checklist**

     * Food
     * Dress
     * Recreation
     * Architecture
     * Religion
     * Race
     * Gender Roles
     * Traditions/Holidays
     * Trade
     * Beliefs

    **National Checklist**

     * Cities
     * Heirarchy
     * Role of law
     * How law is made
     * How law is enforced
     * How power is obtained
     * How power is transferred
     * Division of power
     * Military
     * Economy

    The things that make a culture "middle-east" are probably some combination of the local foods, local clothes, local customs, beliefs about the world, how the locals look, and a bunch of other things. At least some of those are going to be predicated on the climate and the available materials. Of note, you're going to get a lot of different answers depending on what tech level you pick and what's available to your culture. [To grab a random article](http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.arch.20120201.01.html):

    > In Northern Areas alongside the Caspian Sea (Northern Iran), abundance of water and fertile soil for farming has caused villages to have a scattered pattern. Moreover, area of residential plots is relatively high and residential environments are surrounded with citrus fruits. Native people of these areas used to make a living by farming, gardening, working on rice fields, and fishing. Not long ago, houses were made of wood and then thatched with clay and straw. Ceilings were covered with Sufal (made of baked clay), canes or stems of rice plant. Dense forests on the margins of the Caspian Sea and mountains provide the wood needed for making houses. Ceilings, pillars and in some cases, walls and the foundations of houses were made out of wood. Where the land moisture is high, the house floor is built above the ground level.

    Or

    > Central Iran is an arid salt desert with a harsh nature and an average annual precipitation of less than 200 mm. Living in these areas is only possible around or near Qanats (aqueducts) and springs. Aqueducts are sustainable subterranean systems for drawing the underground water resources to the surface which is the result of a genuine Iranian irrigation innovation that slowly draws the underground water to the surface and has supplied water for thousands of years. Shortage of water in this region has made aqueducts an invaluable element such that not a drop of water is wasted. Whenever the amount of water is not adequate, it is first directed into a pool and then drawn into the farms. The size of the villages and their population in this region are determined by the amount of water available.

    > Clay and sun-dried clay are the basic materials for housing in desert areas in Iran. Houses were built very close to each other in a dense context. Applying clay which is resistant to heat made living through hot summers possible. Houses are introvert and with the courtyard placed in the center (central courtyard pattern) to protect the house from the harsh nature and hot winds as well as provide the dwellers with an appropriate open space. Rooms are separate units and open to the courtyard. In complete harmony with seasonal changes and in order to provide dwellers with comfort inside the house, some movements are necessary for the family members from the sunny parts of the house (suitable for the winter) to the parts back to the sun and shaded parts (suitable for the summer). The family members move upstairs, downstairs, and to the north or to the south Eyvans (porches) of the house.

    I'm not suggesting that you go into this much detail, but these are two very different pictures of what (for example) architecture might be like in different regions of what is now Iran, which comes from different weather, occupations, and available materials.
