## [D] Sunday Writing Skills Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow /r/rational fans...

* Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)?

* How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

* Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

* Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

* Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

  Just to keep the posters here aware, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5yy64k/meta_what_to_do_about_the_weekly_threads/) asking people what should be done about the Sunday thread.

  I want to "yadda yadda" over a few conversations in my story because I don't want to have to bore *myself* by writing smalltalk and bore *the reader* by making them read it. 

  My husband was doing a beta read and he reckons that I should "maybe just write what they actually said"

  Here's an example of the passage he flagged:

  > "What is Columbus like?" William broke the silence, placing his drink back on the table. Red shrugged, taking another sip of his.

  > "It's nice. Not as large or grand as Rome, of course."

  > "What has brought you here?"

  > Red hesitated; he didn't have a good explanation at hand for his presence. William seemed to notice, and gave him a kind smile.

  > "No need to answer. We all have secrets."

  > Red nodded. "Thank you, sir."

  > And so, the conversation continued for a short while longer; when it came to talk business, William asked for a price and accepted Red's figure immediately. That was a surprise, as Redâ€™s coworkers had told him to expect to haggle a little. When Red finished his drink, he got straight to work; William excused himself, to visit with friends. 

  Like, I want to give the impression that these people are getting to know each other - but does anyone actually want to read the boring minutiae that comes when you first get to know a partner? I wouldn't want to read it!

    I'd personally cut out "And so, the conversation continued for a short while longer." Everything that follows it is a description of the conversation continuing, it's self-evident. That's not even the main thing, the main thing is that you're calling attention to what you're doing; if you just do it, peoples' eyes will just gloss right over it and they won't notice what you've done.

    There is nothing wrong with skipping over bits here and there, but you shouldn't do it every time. I might be too far in the other direction, since my characters talk quite a lot, but there definitely needs to be *some* complete conversations, especially when characters first get to know each other (If they are both important characters, at least).
    ```

      Thanks for that! 

      I used to have quite a lot more conversations skipped, but I fleshed a lot of them out. I am glad I'm not going insane thinking that such things are acceptable.

  I'm outlining my first serious piece of fiction, and I'm not at all sure how to go about sharing it with people. Can I just post a chapter here? I don't really see a lot of posts from lesser-known stories. Is it okay to solicit feedback?
