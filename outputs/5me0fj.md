## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I come bearing news of bright and shiny projects! 

  First off, some time ago I ran a Kickstarter campaign for a book called *Strange Nations*, a collection of cultures that can be dragged and dropped into any setting. With a few exceptions, each culture has 4-8 pages of material, ideas for adapting it to other kinds of settings than the default (e.g. fantasy to space opera, or contemporary horror to fantasy), and best of all it's absolutely positively free. 

  Pay what you want or don't pay anything at all, it's free for you to download, share, remix, transform, and build upon so long as you extend the same privilege to others, because it's been released into the Creative Commons. [Check it out!](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/200950/Strange-Nations-A-Worldbuilding-Resource). 

  This isn't all, though. Right now I'm running a Kickstarter campaign for a similar project that goes far more in-depth on individual alien species (40-50 pages rather than 4-8). In addition to being much meatier than *Strange Nations*, this project is designed to fit in with reasonably hard science fiction settings and each write-up not only includes major cultures (and notable subcultures, exceptions, etc.) but also the context of the species: its evolutionary history and other fauna and flora native to the planet. Like *Strange Nations*, it'll be free for anyone to use, and the purpose of the Kickstarter campaign is to outfit it with illustrations. 

  Does that sound interesting to you? Do you want to see lovely concept art and read more about the species due to appear in volume one? [Check out Species Shock here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/825176040/species-shock?ref=aymbtx), take a look at the backer rewards, and boost the signal. 

  One last thing: I've started up a Patreon campaign to try to fund other projects like these. I'm committed to releasing as much creative material as possible into the Creative Commons (you may have noticed that HSTW is in the CC too!), and by getting funded on Patreon I can not only afford to spend more of my time on these books but also cover the costs of smaller projects that might not warrant Kickstarter campaigns in themselves but would nevertheless break my budget if I added them together. I have five booklets written already, from a book on comparative mythology to a comparison of "horse nomad" cultures from the Great Plains and the Eurasian Steppe. 

  If you enjoy *Strange Nations*, *Heroes Save the World*, or anything else that I've written, then [supporting me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks) will ensure that I can keep producing at my current rate and help me to produce even more. 

  Thanks to /u/PeridexisErrant for giving me permission to post this.

  I just read [Why Batman Canâ€™t Kill People, Part 1](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=27382) & [Part 2](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=27397).

  This touches on some things I've noticed about rationalist fiction vs other fiction. We're generally actually going for a specific effect that requires bending the world in ways that don't necessarily make all that much sense from an outside perspective.

  The ratfic world isn't more *realistic* than other fantasy literature, necessarily, but tends to be more fantastical in ways that make science/rationality a useful trait for the hero personally in achieving their personal goals, much as other genres bend their worlds to make other character traits (like Batman's urge to personally punch villains in the face instead of sending money to good causes) more useful.
  ```

    Agreed.

    Also I think all that wish fulfillment is ineffectively trying to mask a certain inner emptiness of the rationalist mindset. Who would want be the cambist when they could be Lord Iron? That makes me wonder if, instead of creating wish fulfillment for the mindset as it currently is, rationalist writers should get busy making up a new and exciting mindset for the demographic. After all, Hollywood invented the cool mafioso image out of whole cloth, and real mafiosi adopted it.

    Eliezer's Harry was a small step in that direction, I wish others would join in. You don't even need a fantastical setting. Finding the mindset is the hard part, and then you can just write about everyday stuff.

      Interesting points. Actually the direct comparison of Mafia to Rational genre might be useful. I wonder how much Hollywood Mafia stylistic stuff would translate directly to the rational genre if you lifted it there. (Fedoras! Uh... maybe?)

      It occurs to me that one reason Mafia gets away with a lot of stuff in literature without losing audience sympathy is due to being family oriented (since family tends to be inherently sympathetic due to our evolutionary roots -- it's common to be willing to kill for family in at least some contexts). A "crime family" is still a *family*, despite the tension between family values and criminality, and that tension can be exploited to make a story interesting to a broad audience rather than just being about gawking at the horrors of criminality.

      So as a parallel: What does a "rational family" look like? What kind of universe lends/bends itself towards commentary about familial bonds while also rewarding scientific nerdiness / munchkinry / transhumanistic ascension?

      In the real world I think many rationalists experience alienation from their birth family due to adoption of memes like atheism and utilitarianism that conflict somewhat with the theistic/tribal mentality that favors large family sizes. The alienation factor itself has drama potential, but might need to be coupled with reconciliation if you want to appeal to a wider audience.

      You can see some elements of rationalist familial alienation at play in HPJEV's conspicuous alienation from his birth parents (and sometimes condescending attitude towards his adoptive parents) and Taylor Hebert's constant lying to / hiding from her dad. They tend to form bonds with the intelligent people they "work" with (Hermione, Lisa) which the story spends more time on, with parents being more a matter of backstory.

      Zorian's relationship to Kirielle is the best example I can think of off the top of my head of a positive family relationship in ratfic, and even there it's despite significant family alienation (he doesn't get along with his parents, resents his older brother, and considers Kirielle mostly to be an annoyance at the beginning).

  I hope you can follow my logic here because I certainly can't. My friends are all fans of Dragon Ball Z so they've been nagging me to watch Abridged. However, I have never seen DBZ so I wanted to watch the show first even though I don't usually like shonen. I ended up enjoying the first three episodes of Kai, but I decided I wanted the backstory on all these characters so I started watching the original Dragon Ball show and later switched to the manga so I could get through the early story arcs faster. 

  I am now reading dozens of chapters of a manga, so I can watch dozens of episodes of a anime, so I can watch dozens more episodes of another anime, so I'll find an abridged series funnier. I cannot think of a worse example of mission creep I have ever experienced in my life, especially with such little incentive to do so or reason to think I'll get a significant return on my time investment.

  I actually think this might wind up being a net-negative for me since after enduring this franchise I'm not going to have an excuse to avoid jumping into others. I previously refused to continue watching Adventure Time because I didn't like the early episodes, but now I'm specifically choosing to inflict a series on myself when it's just been okay so far. Is this what Dragon Ball does to you?

  To be clear, I'm still enjoying myself and don't have anything more important on my plate right now. I'm just really surprised with myself for doing this when no one asked me to. I don't regret the decision I've made, but it's pretty damn weird that I made it and haven't regretted it so far.

    Hilarious. If you read the manga, why on earth (or Namek) would you then watch the multiple-levels of derived animated series?
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I'm rationalizing it as the more over-the-top fights are worth watching in animation. Hopefully by the time I get there I will like the characters enough that I can tolerate the annoyingly slow pace. However, I'm going to watch Kai since it cuts out all the filler so it shouldn't be so bad...right?

          Tell me about it. It takes me one hour to read something adapted into 5 hours of animation, which ruins the pacing and comedic timing. I barely got through watching the Emperor Pilof Saga despite skipping some episodes I was told weren't important.

          I like this term, but I'm not sure it applies since I invented the problem myself. Everyone told me that I'd still enjoy Abridged without having seen DBZ, but I thought I'd enjoy it more.

    Posting rants about a specific story / community not being rational (cf the Doctor Strange thread, the SV thread with the guys who hated us). You can't do it too often though, or the mods will probably catch on and ask you to stop.

    Also it's mostly against the spirit of this sub and it's kind of dark side-ish, but I guess that's par for the course in a shitpost.

    EDIT: Wow, this post is weirdly popular. My inner Skinner's rat likes it!

    I haven't discovered any non-useful ways of karma-farming here.  The simplest (but not necessarily easiest) way is to find a moderately rational, moderately consistent fanfic and post every chapter as it comes out.  That's only good for a dozen or so karma per post, but anything more than that requires real effort.

  I just finished an inorganic chemistry class, and I'm thinking of making a simple video game containing magic that forces chemical/nuclear reactions (nuclear reactions produce no heat, because magic) based off of rates of reaction.  

  I have two questions based on that: where can I find basic information on all of the elements, in computer readable format,  and are there general rules available that govern how chemistry happens between atoms, without needing to make 10000 special cases for every combination?
  ```

  - u/Gaboncio:
    ```
    > Are there general rules available that govern how chemistry happens between atoms, without needing to make 10000 special cases for every combination?

    Yes! We call it quantum-mechanics; you can solve Schodinger's equation and find out everything you need to know. For nuclear reactions, you can run experiments and use empirical relations to approximate the functional forms of the interaction potentials for the strong and weak forces. Alternatively, if you prefer theoretical work, you can take a crack at [Yang-Mills theory](http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/yang%E2%80%93mills-and-mass-gap) and try to win one of the Millenium Prizes. 

    But actually being frank and helpful, not really. If you want lots of tables of atomic and molecular data, [NIST](http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/), the National Institute of Standards and Technology, has a lot of them, but I'm not sure if they include reaction rates for these things. In practice, using a lookup table is actually the fastest and most reliable way to do this stuff, even for academic chemists. Deriving reaction rates from first principles is a useful exercise for a physical chem or quantum chem class, but it's much too time consuming to do it directly in any kind of context.

    Honestly, I'm a little baffled at what you want to accomplish with this game. You don't need to force chemical reactions, they already happen. Even if we take the premise for granted, I feel like a "simple video game" would not benefit at all from an addition of actual chemical reaction rates in its "magic system". Maybe you can elaborate a bit about what you have in mind?
    ```

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      The unique selling point of the game would be that all spells are crafted from relatively simple roots: fusing atoms, fissioning them, and forced chemical reactions (all of which have no byproducts like heat, radiation, or neutrons).  

      "[Flare](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/flare.htm)" isn't an elementary spell, it is a combination of three basic effects: [Fusion of Nitrogen molecule -> Silicon, Fission of Silicon to 1x Helium + 1x Magnesium, and a spark to activate it].  "[Fireball](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/fireball.htm)" can be done multiple ways, including [Fusion of Oxygen molecule -> Sulfur, Fission of Sulfur to 16x Hydrogen atoms, and a spark to activate it] (which has the side effect of producing a large gust of wind as extra gas appears) or [Fusion of Nitrogen molecule -> Silicon, Fission of Silicon to 1x Helium + 2x Carbon, and a spark to activate it] (which is gas-volume-neutral).  Alternatively, you could break existing CO2 and H2O up chemically into individual atoms, and just let them combust naturally.  "[Cloudkill](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/cloudkill.htm)" is as simple as water vapor -> neon -> hydrogen + fluorine.  

      My problem is figuring out what the gasses (or powdered solids, in the case of carbon) do after they are created.
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        See I'm not sure you realize how absurdly powerful a magic system with just those capabilities is. In addition the idea that you would use the magic to recreate spells from D&D is also kind of absurd, but I'll assume you weren't seriously saying those would be among the most effective uses of the power.               

        See the thing is that if you're going to use a nuclear based magic system, then radiation will need to be considered. For instance somebody could take lead and fuse it with a hydrogen and a helium to get astatine which is _extremely_ radioactive. In fact if they created a sizeable chunk of astatine then you have a nuke.              
        Quite a lot of elements are extremely unstable and creating them with this power would be making a nuke. So obviously the question becomes can you use this magic from a distance? Because if so it destabilizes everything in your setting, and if not then you still have to worry about insane mages wiping out entire cities if they don't care about dying.

        Also it goes without saying that depending on a rarity of magic rare elements would either not be that rare, or be much less so. This effect would be much more pronounced when it comes to elements that are naturally extremely rare, where creating a few hundred pounds of the stuff would increase the amount in existence several fold. 

        Also unless there's a separate magic system for healing, then you have way more problems than just the threat of initial casualties from atomic blasts.
        ```

      - u/Escapement:
        ```
        Some of the idea of making atoms via fusing/fissioning/forced chemical reaction sounds a bit like [Spacechem](http://www.zachtronics.com/spacechem/), but more based on whatever the magic is you want with the outputs and less on 2D puzzle solving. Spacechem is not really based on science at all though, except for the chemistry 'theme' - it uses chemistry more as an aesthetic and to draw background from, rather than as a central point.

        Spacechem is itself a really awesome puzzle game that gets extremely difficult and complicated. I strongly recommend the game.
        ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    I don't have a link on me for the database, but it definitely exists. 

    The field you're looking for is called "computational chemistry", and I'd strongly recommend starting by modifying some open-source scientific simulation software. 

    Note that for big (accurate) simulations, you need a supercomputer - benchmarks like "10^6 atoms for 100 nanoseconds *only* took 38 hours (on 16 CPU cores)" are common. I mean, don't start with one that does quantum solving - stochastic is plenty for a game.

  Writing that vampire yaoi novel. Trying to keep it rational. It's surprisingly hard. Vampires have all their own little rules and whatnot, and the vampire's lover would certainly figure some of the more obvious/culturally entrenched ones out pretty quickly. So I had to do a scene early on where the human finds out that the vampire needs to be invited into dwellings.

  Here's the scene: http://pastebin.com/RswZ7Dg6 - this has been a very... vulnerable experience for me, to do this writing, so if you're feeling kind enough to give me your thoughts, while I'd love criticism on the general rationality and plot elements, I haven't edited it thoroughly enough to be comfortable with people editing it for style, flow, grammar, and so on.

  It was challenging to figure out how to make the above scene go down from a Rational 
  perspective. The vampire is obviously 1500 years old and doesn't actually think of the human as human the same way we do, so he's going to want to trust him with as few weaknesses as possible, and exaggerate his strengths, and doesn't have any more moral problems with lying to a human than you would with lying to your cat. The human, on the other hand, is both entranced by this attractive, charismatic, powerful creature and kind of scared of him on some level because he does eat blood and whatnot. But the vampire absolutely cannot enter the house without an invitation, and in part plans to use the human's presence to keep other vampires away from him, so the human's going to need to know about this. So I'm wondering now does this scene have the vampire giving up the information too easily, or, conversely, not easily enough (should he just say "by the way you'll need to invite me in and then we can get right back to the kissing" since he rationally knows the human will figure it out pretty quickly).

  Anyway, my writing/editing progress, as always: https://www.beeminder.com/mad/janowrimo

    Nah, "rational fiction" is useful from both a prescriptive and descriptive point of view, even if it doesn't encapsulate the entirety of the genre.

    To me that's a different thing. "Hard" scifi or "hard" fantasy runs on rules, but it's not necessarily about thinky stuff, which is what I consider to be one of the hallmarks of rational fiction. Unless "hardened" is being used in a different way, in which case I think there's too much room for confusion with existing genre definitions.
