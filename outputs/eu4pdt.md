  big fan of this, glad to see another chapter :)

  I'm incapable of reading this fic without the characters in my head sounding like the voice actors from SAO Abridged because I forget what the canon characters sound like, but I guess that's fine.

    You know, thinking about it SAO abridged is more rational than the original. If only for the 'Ghost' arc.

    Only in comparison to the original, but still that and giving the characters actual character makes it the default voices in my head as well.... Huh, I wonder if theirs fanfiction of SAO abridged characters..

  For those who haven't read this fic before, it's a rational take on Sword Art Online. It is extremely well written, with a beautifully built and coherent AU. Strongly recommended. It's updated consistently but very slowly.

  &#x200B;

  >AU reboot of the entire SAO storyline, beginning from the premise that Kayaba Akihiko was obsessed with magic and Norse Mythology rather than  swords and pure melee. As a result, he created the Death Game of Alfheim  Online rather than the floating castle of Aincradâ€”a world in which  player-killing is not a crime, and the nine player races are in  competition with each other to reach the top of the World Tree.  Multi-POV epic following the stories of multiple canon characters  throughout the game.
