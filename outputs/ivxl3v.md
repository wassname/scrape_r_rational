  ```
  They're scattered throughout the main story, marked with red title text. Every now and then there are whole arcs of Renegade, but it's still found in the main story.
  ```

  ```
  Are you asking for an index of all of them? Currently there isn't one, but they're clearly marked in the main index, "(supplementary, Renegade option)".
