## Please help me find a story

### Post:

I am not exactly sure if the story is rational fic, but in my memory it's linked with the subreddit. If not, than I am terribly sorry.

I remember only the very beginning. It was original story, set kind of inside a video game world. Protagonist's MLI, a woman, gets suspicious, that everything that happened so far was extremely lucky and helped the hero grow. The protagonist spills the beans about being an avatar, and game world not being real.

I haven't read more of it, marked it to read later, and by some cosmic mishap it disappeared from my notes and bookmarks.

I'll be happy for any pointers, since I can't even recall the title.

      You should read [this edition](http://web.archive.org/web/20041031044203/http://www.transhumanism.org/index.php/th/more/341/) as well; it has a nice afterword that's not present in the copy on Yudkowsky's website.
