## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I'm, uh, two months late on this, but [The Last Orellan](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46901/the-last-orellen) is back!

  It's a high-fantasyish story that got a lot of buzz just over a year ago when it first was coming out, and was mentioned a few times in these threads, which was how I found it. After publishing very regularly and *very* quickly for a little while it just went dark suddenly and went on hiatus. It's running again, which I found out purely by accident when I misclicked in my bookmarks!

  It's a pretty great read. I remember the first portion had a kind of early-earthsea-esque vibe to it, highly recommend.

  -----

  And while I'm here, does anyone have any good web serial fantasy to recommend? Just solid classic stuff, no litrpgs or dungeon cores or whatever.

    [To The Far Shore](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50836/to-the-far-shore) is a great post-apocalyptic 'Oregon Trail' story. I finally picked it up after seeing a few people talking about it in previous weekly threads, and it's absolutely worth it.

    I'm going to go for something a little weirder and shill lintamande's [At the End of All Things](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3451040/chapters/7569143).

    > Tolkien once envisioned Middle-earth coming to an end in an apocalyptic final battle. Set in 2017 in Copenhagen and in Dallas and in Fargo, North Dakota, this is a story about Sauron, petroleum engineering, Morgoth, the surveillance state, the House of Fëanor, geopolitics, and Arda's final reckoning.

    The modern world is not prepared for the characters and metaphysics of the Silmarillion. This makes for one of the most deliciously *right* works of fanfiction I've ever read. It's dramatic and clever and funny and extrapolates from the rich but vague original. Something that brought me into the politics and struggles of these characters faced with scenarios completely new and yet oh so right.

    It is also tragically unfinished.
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      lintamande's [For the Taking](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9809486) is also pretty great.

      > "I've summoned a demon for sex," she said, on the second date and the fourth martini. "It's safe as long as you don't let them talk."

      (And for people who are into glowfic, lintamande has written [an enormous amount of glowfic](https://glowfic.com/users/34), often [with variations of the Fëanorians as main characters](https://glowfic.com/templates/155). They play a small part in Yudkowsky's Planecrash too.)
      ```

      - u/netstack_:
        ```
        Excellent, but a few steps removed from *Natural 20*.

        Searching for continuations or conclusions to *At the End of All Things* was how I found glowfic. Specifically, a Miles Vorkosigan/Silmarillion crossover. As appealing as it was, the format demanded a certain sort of...commitment? that I didn't quite match, and I didn't end up getting into the larger cosmology.

        Was it you who tried to provide a crash course into glowfic, perhaps with some connection to *Mad Investor Chaos*? I might be misremembering, because search has not helped me find that explanation.
        ```

        - u/Roxolan:
          ```
          I wrote a brief [description of what I like about glowfic](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bxvocf/d_friday_open_thread/eqac711/) some years ago, before *Mad Investor Chaos* was a thing.
          ```

      - u/ivory12:
        ```
        For the Taking was interesting. In the comments, the author notes that there is a canonical answer to whether >!demons are actually taking souls or not!< in the work its derivative of. 

        So I looked up the glowfic index for 'Daevinity' setting where it says >!demons cannot interact with the human soul specially, and they find it a funny rumour to perpetuate!<. Aw. I was hoping for the other answer.
        ```

        - u/Roxolan:

    I really enjoyed HPNat20 as well, and one of the parts that stuck out was the magical culture clash, where two different magic systems interact and try to understand each other. I haven't been able to find many like it, but if that's something that you enjoyed here are a few recs (nome particularly rational, but fun nonetheless)


    [Making Magick](https://fanfiction.net/s/7667766/1/Making-Magick) (*57k, dead*) is a FoZ / Magicka crossover that is way, way better than that premise has any right to be. Not quite crack, but an overall humorous story.


    [Psi Effect](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psi-effect-me-xcom-thread-2-rise-of-the-party-boat.307972/) (*450k+, dead*) is a Mass Effect / XCOM crossover. This time it's sci-fi tech instead of magic that's being compared, but same general idea. The story is somewhat physically hard to read, being spread across two threads, ome without threadmarks, but quite fun.


    [Doors to the Unknown](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/doors-to-the-unknown-worm-d-d-fusion-crossover.1001110/) (*510k, Ongoing*) is a Worm / D&D crossover. Parahumans trapped in Eberron, D&D characters trapped on Bet, lots of fun stuff.

    [The Dragon-Kings Temple](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6211903/chapters/14231311) (*196k, Complete*) is an *excellent* Avatar The Last Airbender / SG1 crossover. Post-canon Zuko and Toph find themselves stranded on another world, and the Stargate cast tries to figure out how these damned kids are doing definitely-not-magic.

          ```

  - u/TheAnt88:

    I have two.

    Brewer King on Royal Road that is currently on a hiatus but the author started writing again. A man's wife and kid are killed in an accident and he goes to the woods to kill himself but ends up in a new world filled with horrifying eldritch monsters that are slowly spreading/becoming more numerous as the apocalypse is drawing close, every kingdom/culture has terrible leaders and they are in the middle of a nasty civil war that is breaking up a formally powerful empire, and everyone is racist, bitter, and afraid of the monsters. Excellent world building, monster design, and the world is dark and dangerous without the fact everyone doesn't trust a funny looking foreigner. 

    To the Far Shore on Royal Road - Pretty much post apocalyptic Oregon trail. A weak and soft member of a Clan that focuses on using and controlling radiation is attacked by rivals and in revenge, their matriarch kills the area by flooding it with radiation. Wiping out his clan and pissing off everyone. His new goal is to get as far away as possible and try to live his own life. He is weak and soft only by his Clan's standards, everyone else sees him as a demon worshiping magic user that is taught to kill people and he has an odd mindset and belief system that makes for a unique and interesting narrator. This world is many times post apocalyptic, his clan was hated and he is hunted by its many former enemies, and there are dangers everywhere.

    *Bastion*, by Phil Tucker.

    One book currently out (It's very long though), one more coming in April.

    It's about a world where a large group of people reincarnate as adults with amnesia after dying, usually within days or weeks. They're stuck trying to invade hell, and closed off from the Earth they came from and are trying to protect.

    The main character was originally one of them, but was branded a criminal hundreds of years ago. When a criminal reincarnates, their magic-badass powers are stolen and they are thrown away to die in a lightless cave system with little food and no exit.

    The main character obviously does manage to escape pretty quickly, but he's still unbelievably fucked at every turn. It's a very rare story where the main character is intelligent, creative, persistent and patient, and *still* loses most of the time because the world is just unbelievably stacked against them. From lack of cultivation resources to self righteous 'good guys' treating him like a murderer to getting screwed over by people with vendettas he can't even remember, the MC is forced to make a *lot* of choices that are bad in the long run but if he doesn't make them right now there won't even *be* a long term.

    The Scholomance Series by Naomi Novik has this. It takes place in a magical school built to protect young wizards from monsters called Maleficaria.

  Hi guys! Just wondering if you had any recs for fics with truly inventive worlds? Something that made you go “How the hell did they come up with that?” Web serials or fiction on RoyalRoad would be nice, but I’m not picky. Something obscure would also be good. Thank you in advance!

  Edit: Also while I still remember: if you could recommend anything with genetic engineering and strange organisms that would also be appreciated. Like Twig or Oryx and Crake.

    I'm a worldbuilding ~~nerd~~ enthusiast and pretty much every Alexander Wales is a treat for me in that regard. *[Worth the Candle](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle)* is great and everyone here knows it, but I feel like people are sleeping on his latest story,  [Thresholder](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/60396/thresholder). It's a great deconstruction/pastiche of the portal fantasy(Isekai) genre, about a guy who travels through portals into strange new worlds and has to figure the place out and build a power base before he's confronted by a fated antagonist. The last 2 chapters are especially great in regards to worldbuilding.

    Greg Egan has some really creative worlds. They’re published novels though. Permutation City has two distinct VR worlds, The Book of All Skies features many similar “skies” connected by gates, and Scale has 8 different scales of humans, each half as big and living twice as fast as the last.
    ```

    - u/STRONKInTheRealWay:
      ```
      I’ve heard such great things about Egan! Glad to see he’s still writing. Maybe I just don’t have the brain for hard sf, but his stuff always seemed somewhat inaccessible to me. I guess I need a firm grasp of regular physics before I can comprehend an entire field of fictional physics!
      ```

      - u/plutonicHumanoid:
        ```
        The Book of All Skies definitely had passages that I ended up skimming because it was comparing gravity to electrostatics and I didn’t really get it after repeated attempts, but it didn’t meaningfully lower my enjoyment besides taking me out of the story for a minute, so I still recommend it!

        Permutation City was easier to understand (for me, which might be because it’s in part about computers) and I haven’t gotten to the mathy part of Scale yet.

    [Thundamoo's](https://www.royalroad.com/profile/78901) stuff is great.

    Vigor Mortis features a world composed of various floating island circling above a giant eldritch monster named The Mistwatcher that is seen as a God by many. Nightfall happens when another island floats over and blocks out the light. Rainfall happens when another island floats over and water overflows from it. Hiverock invasions happen when the island of genocidal bug people floats overhead and airdrops legions of expendable suicidal soldiers.

    Bioshifter has the Earth side of the plot, and then the "isekai" side of the plot occurs on a giant world tree floating through the air, currently in the middle of multiple different apocalyptic events that spell the inevitable doom of the tree and all that live on it, but are still taking a very long time to kill everything due to the sheer size of the tree. Also, some spoilers but >!all the apocalypses are stated, by the religious cult dedicated to killing them and heavily implied as well by the literal Goddess in charge, to have been caused by previous isekai victims.!<
    ```

    - u/ProfessorPhi:

    [Ar'Kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) has some truly fantastic world building. It isn't until around chapter 100 that the main character goes on a world tour style vacation, but even before then there is a ton of very complex D&D-inspired lore.

    While Ar'Kendrithyst is a LitRPG (which can understandably be a deal breaker for some readers), it's clear from early on that the setting wasn't always this way. The System is an artificial measure put in place by the survivors of a dead universe, attempting to prevent a tragedy on the Universal Apocalypse scale from ever happening again. And the different cultures of the world interact with the System quite differently. Some groups forego the existence of magic altogether, others claim to do this and their dependency on magic is an unspoken cultural shame.

    Some groups cannot afford to ignore the gift of readily available power and exist in close proximity to the group suspected of causing the previous End of All Things. More than anything, the story does a fantastic job of making you realize how much was lost, how many people died, and that the status quo the characters live in is a historically recent development in the scheme of things.

    There are a myriad of (living and extinct) species and cultures that branch off from those species. The primary setting for much of the story serves as a cultural melting pot of sorts, but the author does well in letting the reader know how much of an exception this is to the norm.

    Once Erick leaves on his Worldly Path you really see the scope of Veird, though.

    My favorite of the places Erick visits is
    >!an underground society of immortal Wrought, metal individuals who typically physically resemble other species but have more or less total control of their form. As immortals, they tend to be highly skilled or deadly in one fashion or another, though they also tend to live ordinary lives despite their capacities for violence. In their bunker cities, you see all sorts of attitudes towards the world at large, but more than any of the other stances, you see how those in power view the other species as dangerous children.!<

    >!The toll repeated loss has taken on these people is felt very differently by different individual Wrought. Some fully reject their society and choose to live above ground, amongst mortals. Some pull in close and live in communities that re-enact days, weeks, months, or years. These communities perfect their self-imposed groundhog loops and interacting with it is seen as a deep social faux pas. Others monitor the world and only interact with obscenely powerful individuals once it becomes clear that the individual could stumble their way into being a threat.!<

    Genuinely, I think Ar'Kendrithyst does a wonderful job of integrating hard and soft magics as well as new and old fantasy tropes. It's available for free on Royal Road, which is bonkers to me. It isn't a high bar, but I do mean it when I say that the writing and setting put some published works to shame.

    Orion's Arm is a long running collaborative sci-fi encyclopedia (similar to SCP Foundation but older and with a strict canon) that has hundreds of really weird worlds across a consistent, millenia spanning regions of space. Oceans the size of solar systems, a planet of disembodied minds simulated by plants whistling in the wind, entire galaxies rearranged into spaceships, and all of those contain just 0.000001% of the universe's population, as most live in even stranger virtual worlds in the minds of black hole eating AI gods.

    In this setting, there are aliens, but most are tens of thousands of lightyears away, and only a handful have made brief direct contact. However, humans have built many new robotic and bioengineered species, which in turn made their own robots and bioengineered species, so human space is practically teeming with "aliens" from a modern person's perspective. These AI, simulated people, robots, and bioengineered new species that can eventually trace their lineage back to Earth are collectively known as Terragen, to differentiate themselves from true aliens.

    I always recommend [Virtuous Sons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia) as one of the best things on RoyalRoad (unfortunately I just realised it's missing the middle chapters to Kindle Unlimited). It's incredibly creative in that it takes Cultivation to Greek/Roman times and it works better than the cultivation stuff that inspired it. 

    So much so that it acts more like a soft magic system, but with cultural beliefs. The Greeks cultivate through philosophy while the romans cultivate through service in the army. 

    It is frankly an inspired work with a lot of creativity in weaving gods, myths and general greek/roman history into the fabric of the story. It's got strong emotional core, characters act quite independently and there's a lot of memorable dialogue.

The author has done a particularly good job of hinting at larger issues without leaving me feeling like they are intentionally delaying the protagonist finding things out.

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension) is great for the first couple books: When they say that the new world runs on different physics, they *mean* that it runs on different physics.  For example, elements don't exist, and you breathe in *Lavi* (a form of energy) into your lungs and process it to fuel yourself.  This becomes relevant fairly early on, when you discover that >!breathing liquid is just as good as breathing gas because they both contain Lavi.!<  Similarly-important discoveries that shed light on the new physics take place throughout the first few books.

    Unfortunately, it was taken off of the open web.  If that's not an issue for you, I'd recommend reading up to the end of the Trial arc, then stopping.  I felt the quality dropped a bit near the end but was still worthwhile.  After that arc, it changed a lot and I only lasted a short while out of momentum.

      Second the recommendation, the world building is great, it has gods as actual characters which I always like, and much of it focuses on making contracts with gods and looking for traps and loopholes, which will definitely appeal to people here (though I would prefer more "deals with devil" type contracts, lots of the gods are helpful at this point).

      I liked the ideas of the high end threats (the 13 rule-breaker gods), lots of them feel like SCPs

    > anything with genetic engineering and strange organisms 

    [Necroepilogos](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59967/necroepilogos) is the new story of Hungry, author of [Katalepsis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28023/katalepsis). The world of Necroepilogos is post-post-post... apocalyptic; there have been multiple distinct events that wiped out most life on the planet. The main cast consists of girls whose souls (including memories) were ripped from the aether (or perhaps entirely made up by post-singularity AIs? Hard to tell) and reincarnated into bodies made of nanomachines. The world is entirely uninhabitable to unaugmented organisms; the wilderness is lethal to even the nano-made people. Mountain-sized artificial constructs called Worms create a sort of "hot spot" which is liveable for the reincarnated "zombies", but due to the scarcity of resources those zones are a constant slaughterfest of all versus all. Every so often, those Worms will move from one reincarnation site to another, leaving everyone to scramble to keep up.

    The scenery description is horribly vivid and gross, full of rusting hulks and dripping fouled meat. The main cast are all very well characterized, you can usually tell who's speaking just from word choices. Definitely recommend this one almost as highly as Katalepsis, which is itself in my top 5 currently updating stories.

    One of my favorites is the Chinese webnovel Lord of Mysteries. It’s set in a Victorian era steampunk world, with heavy influences from SCP, mysticism, and lovecraftian horror. The world is extremely detailed and in depth. It does suffer from being a translated novel, if you’re a person put off by translations.

    The sequel novel, Circle of Inevitability, just started about a week ago as well.

- u/OutOfNiceUsernames:

  Looking for settings in which magicians / superpowereds / etc don't have access to just one major power (or several mid-range powers, or 1 major + bunch of support powers), but instead to a much higher number of really small powers that they try to match into a good enough synergy to function as a major power. Bonus points if the acquisition of those tiny powers has a significant element of randomness to them. E.g. you can't trade away what you've already gotten with someone else. 

  Some examples of more or less good matches to this request: 

  * *[Wiki Warrior](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1178p4c/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/j9apcqo/)* 
  * the first 25%-50% of *[Reverend Insanity](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReverendInsanity)*
  ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
    ```
    Here's also a mini-review of Wiki Warrior itself: 

    PROs

    * interesting premise with high potential
     * characters with access to grab-bag powers have to built a good synergy from such tiny parts
     * the setting gets incrementally, but permanently changed by each summoning that results in a reality warping effect. This aspect of the story was pretty great when it worked, because usually writers either shy away from such changes (because they're hard to "simulate") or default to canon stations entirely.
    * at times, good character interactions and worldbuilding

    CONs

    * The story feels really raw at places — though I think it should be expected from a pioneer of a potential (sub)genre. (at least I think it's a pioneer, since I don't remember any other stories with similar premise)
    * most of the canon characters have nerfed INT, in my opinion. This is especially the case for prot herself. She's so much worse compared to her canon self in terms of efficiently utilising her power, that I think it would've been better if Taylor wasn't the protag at all. E.g. someone like Greg Veder would've been much more suitable for the displayed decisions and actions.
    * haphazard pacing — for the later parts of the Echidna arc, as well as when the narrative's limelight gets refocused on the original Taylor afterwards. There was often a feeling that there were entire chapters missing between two consecutive ones. And at one point there literally was a shoutout to a cross-fic that, I assume, should be chronologically inserted between two chapters.
     * said cross-fic itself felt rather boring to me for a few reasons: 1) the story felt too mary-sueish; the story's power was too controllable to not break the whole premise of the story 3) it felt like the story was being used for soapboxing by the writer, and the narrative itself was biased in writer's / prot's favour.
    * way too many powerful "pulls" were being either hobbled (e.g. Surtr's lack of efficiency during battle scenes) or cancelled / "popped" away outright (e.g. when prot tries to learn healing magic).

  Just remembered about this, but for those interested, the sequel to Lord of Mysteries just started about a week ago. It’s called Circle of Inevitability, and follows a man from the Intis Republic(France). Updates twice each weekday and once per day during the weekend, at least for the raws.

    The start was pretty strong, but I felt that it decreased in quality from then on. The primary pain point, to me, was that it felt like the main character lost most of the personality she had at the start. I'm up to chapter 31, and >!it feels like she's just become a stereotypical vampire sympathetic-villianess who has some basic rules she follows but doesn't have any more morals than that. She also doesn't really seem to be aiming for anything beyond power? The main character also seems to just give up resisting or even thinking around her vampiric instincts that are less obvious than 'rip kill tear' (though she's started giving into that one a lot more too).!<.  
    So far, the 'arcs' have also mostly felt.. episodic with little overarching plot within the episode and only minimal connection between mini-arcs. They go somewhere, do a few things, talk to some people, do another thing, and then go to the next episode. Kinda slice-of-life ish, but with running around killing things.

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      That's a fair complaint, though the personality changes are at least somewhat intentional. Later on in the story, the importance of Vassals is repeatedly stressed, which is when a mortal essentially makes a magical pact with the vampire of their own free will. Vassals tend to bleed over some of their personality to the vampire, and keep them acting more human/humane, as without a Vassal's influence they tend to become heartless monsters who lean a bit too hard into their vampiric habits.

    Do Devourers have any disadvantage or are they just the best lineage?
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Devourer is just the best lineage. I don't remember specifically but I think the Devourer is the original vampire or something like that. 

      The main downsides are that almost nobody survives becoming a spawn of the Devourer, and the Devourer provides zero-to-negative support for any spawn that do survive. The first downside doesn't really matter given the protagonist anthropic principle, and the second one is basically, you know, the whole story.

      Devourers _do_ have much stronger instincts than other vampires, but whether that's a downside or not is questionable.

        > I don't remember specifically but I think the Devourer is the original vampire or something like that

        It's the *oldest*, but in that world every progenitor completely independently created their condition with sorcery. I felt it was important to specify, because "original vampire" implies that later lineages descended from them, but this is not the case, as it wouldn't be inaccurate to describe every progenitor as the "original vampire"
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          It's been a while but I don't think it was completly independent - if they were publishing an academic paper on how to become a vampire progenitor, the Devourer would at least be heavily cited if not listed as a fourth or fifth author.
          ```

          - u/lillarty:
            ```
            That's fair, yeah. I more wanted to differentiate it from Vampire the Masquerade, where all the clans can be traced back to their legendary progenitor, Caine (or more specifically, the people he personally turned). Caine and Nirari are both the first vampire in their settings, but A Journey of Black and Red does not have all vampires descended from Nirari.
            ```

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      Around 99% of Devourers go completely feral upon being turned, and those who don't typically go insane shortly afterwards. Devourers are objectively the most powerful bloodline, and there were also only three of them that ever managed to retain their sanity. So, there's a *political* downside for the protagonist due to being a highly dangerous creature with a tendency towards madness, but I don't feel like it's a spoiler to say that the protagonist managed to avoid going mad before the story started.

      Does the prose ever get better? I got to chapter 15 or 20 or sth but it was just a constant struggle, not just grammar but also failing to keep a mood/vibe consistent, jarring dialogue, etc

        The first part was definitely rough, but I'm not sure when it gets better. But I think it was well before chapter 20. So if you got that far and still don't like it, it might not be worth continuing. If you've hit the part where he joins the Yi-Tish army and still don't like it I wouldn't keep going.

    [Zero Requiem](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/zero-requiem-lelouch-in-asoiaf.745138/). Lelouch Lamperouge is born to a family of Crownlander nobility. He navigates the political climate of the Blackfyre rebellions with all the skill--and magnificent bastardry--of his home series. The plotting and maneuvering is a lot of fun, and the character interactions work well. Also abandoned...but in a very good spot, thematically. I have no trouble considering it a full story with an epilogue rather than unfinished.

    You may have already seen [A Sword Without a Hilt](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-sword-without-a-hilt-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-d-d-3-5-crossover.27579/). At least for me it was regularly showing up in the "similar threads" section at the bottom of SV. It's a D&D crossover where the magic and setting are leaking back into Westeros. This includes Viserys awakening to his draconic heritage and gaining the Sorcerer class. That alone would change the course of canon...and then the author takes it much further. Monsters and magic items alongside politics and kingdom-building. Humans aren't the only schemers anymore. Other characters, canon or otherwise, gain access to D&D sources of power.

    Now, this is a Quest format story, which isn't for everyone. But it does appear to be actually finished, and I thought the author did an amazing job of weaving the players' decisions and build choices into a quality plot. Seriously, translating between the mechanical weirdness of D&D 3.5 and the gritty fantasy of ASoIaF can't have been easy.

    Also, there's over 5M words of it. Somehow. I will admit that I didn't read the whole thing! But I still enjoyed the concept and the execution, so it gets my tentative recommendation.

    [The Wheel Unbroken](https://archiveofourown.org/works/19003756/chapters/45128014), a timeloop story set in the GOT continuity, ending and all. As terrible as that might sound, the author takes that awful shitshow of an ending and makes it into the sinister plot of a shadowy mastermind. It's pretty neat. 


    The one issue I have with it is part(life 6) which was too much a departure, imo. The rest is very solid, and seemingly getting better as the writer improves.

    Usually it takes a few years for that to happen, unfortunately - you'll probably be waiting for a while. Cyberpunk 2077 came out in 2020, and it's only last year that good fanfics inspired by it started coming out IMO

    Personally, I don't think we'll get much--the whole HP fandom space isn't exactly *dead* but it has gotten somewhat stale mostly due to...

    - JKR directly and deliberately pissing off the fandom through adversarial behavior 

    - New material is rather uninspired and uninspiring (Cursed Child, Fantastic Beasts series, etc)

    - Heavyweight authors and superfans aging out and losing interest 

    Kinda feels a bit like Star Wars at this point. Sure, some people are still hammering away at fan projects (and the occasional gem shows up) and people still dress up as clone troopers at nerdy conventions, but the IP has been cash-squeezed for so long now and efforts to breathe back life into it have been too "corporate" to truly be successful.

    I feel like the HP franchise and the whole "Wizarding World" is in a similar place. JKR, contrary to most authors, actually got worse at writing over time and it's pretty safe to say that she's no longer capable of writing a new blockbuster (both from a brand, skill, and mental stability perspective). 

    The game could've been this "fresh breath" in the franchise, but I feel like...

    - it came out too late. They should've started making it concurrently with the last HP movie and released it a couple years after that

    - it isn't good at attracting new players. Key selling point is nostalgia, but few people unfamiliar with the franchise are gonna drop $70 on it

    - has an uninspired main story and generally boring characters

    - similar to my second point, it's expensive. A lot of the cyberpunk stories have been fueled by the show, which is "free" for many people and the actual game has gotten quite cheap too

    I think that if you ignore the reviews bashing the game for JKR's views and you ignore the reviews praising the game for nostalgic immersion, you end up with a well-executed paint-by-numbers open world RPG that has a forgettable story and that'll have little impact on the future of the franchise and fandom

      >well-executed paint-by-numbers open world RPG

      Except it's not actually an RPG. There is no meaningful player choice in the storyline, no build diversity, and the gear system is so pointless as to be almost purely cosmetic.

      Despite being marketed as an RPG, it's really an Assassin's Creed style, open world action-adventure game.
