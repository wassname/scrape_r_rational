  I'll write up a more in-depth analysis tomorrow morning, but I wanted to make sure I fulfilled my promise to complete OoM on Tau Day.

  I've made a few key changes to some prior chapters, but if you prefer not to reread the whole thing, you can start from the most recent chapter, [The Tragedy of Light](http://www.2pih.com/uncategorized/writing-orders-of-magnitude-chapter-27-the-tragedy-of-light/)

  I tried to resolve all of the dangling threads, but if there are aspects of the world you are curious about, I'll gladly answer any questions you might have.

    Good stuff as always. Congrats on the project mate.

  So this is a fanfiction... of a fanfiction... of a fanfiction? Is it any good?

    From someone who has recently finished reading the whole thing: it's the shit. It's frickin' amazing. If you haven't read HPMOR or SD, there are a lot of references you won't get, so I'm not sure how much enjoyment you'll get from reading this fic but I'll just say it's incredibly well-written and compelling with all the cleverness of HPMOR and all the inventive world-building of SD.

      SD?

        Siginificant Digits, a sequel to HPMOR. 

        If you haven't read it, none of this will make any sense. :)

    Don't forget the sequel- Orders of Magnitude 2: The Search for More Upvotes

    Polite but strong disagreement with the other comments in response to you (just to provide a balancing perspective/show that it is not unanimous).
    ```

    - u/NanashiSaito:
      ```
      Just wanted to clarify, which part of the comments are you disagreeing with? The part about liking it? Or the part about HPMOR/SD being a prerequisite?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        The former.  I respect the quantity of effort and words that went into both SD and OoM, but I enjoyed SD a significant amount less than HPMOR and there was a similar drop in quality between SD and this, for me.

        That's not meant to be harsh or hatery; I just wanted to register a polite dissenting opinion to avoid echo chambers.
        ```

          I haven't gotten around to OoM, though I will say that I prefer SD to HPMOR, for all that HPMOR was the more transformative experience. Spoilers for HPMOR below.

          I mean, don't get me wrong, HPMOR was neat and dramatically raised the bar for what I consume in fiction in a lot of ways, but its premise is at war with itself. It wants to be pedagogical via Harry but isn't rigorous about citing sources and sometimes even does so incorrectly (or has incorrect scientific info to start with), and sometimes is incorrect *on purpose* to be more realistic about the characters and so does neither quite right.

          It tries to have the characters act realistically and intelligently in their own interests, but has the explanation for the society's estrangement from muggle science and the ability for muggle knowledge and scientific technique to be hugely important simply be that the society is mostly stupid.

          It wants to make the thought processes of the characters solid enough to be genuinely emulate-able, but most often displays those processes as Harry going on a lecture about rationality to say why the person he's speaking to is wrong, and when this happens he is never interrupted and the other speaker never tries to Ad Hominem Tu Quoque with it on the spot or later on - even though those are the number one things you're going to be hit with if you try that in real life. Harry's rhetorical victories, however correct he may be in a situation, were ultimately as removed from the real world as any Sherlock Holmes chain inference, and that takes a huge chunk of the demonstrations of Harry's thought processes with it.

          The story wanted to be about the origin of Hermione, and to demonstrate how knowing just enough to be dangerous can backfire... but also wanted to be a mystery and so withheld almost all thematic elements which would actually illustrate that origin story or that thematic arc in order to preserve the mystery, resulting in something that LOOKS like it'll be a scientific exploration of magic fic but which never really delivers on that promise.

          This is to say nothing of the pacing and interspersing problems - the narrative tunnelvisioned quite a bit, resulting in stuff like the war games getting sole focus for several chapters and then ceasing to exist for a long while, with almost nothing else happening. Basic techniques about parallel narrative, and choosing what and when to show about the world which could have helped mitigate stuff from above went nearly untouched.

          HPMOR was a trailblazer and did a lot of extraordinary things, but it was a deeply, *deeply* flawed work which tried to be too many things at once and suffered for it. SD's strength, in my mind, was that it narrowed its thematic focus as a story, planned out how it was going to achieve that, and stuck to it. It had the trappings of mystery and intelligent characters and continued the story using a much firmer literary foundation than HPMOR ever had. By giving up some of the things HPMOR tried to be, and by employing parallel narrative more liberally, it did what remained better.

          Far be it from me to tell anyone else not to enjoy what they enjoy, though. There's no reason not to get the most out of our entertainment, after all.

            Ehr. Largely disagree, though some of your points land. Lmk if you want my rants on how SD is awful, but I won't repost them here; it feels off-topic.
            ```

        - u/NanashiSaito:
          ```
          Gotcha. I think that's a fair point to bring up. If you didn't enjoy the direction that SD took HPMOR in, you'll almost definitely not enjoy OoM. It continues in the direction that SD pointed, and abandons much of what drew people to HPMOR. 

          There's very little of the HPMOR charm, action, or intrigue. It doesn't attempt to teach any lessons and there's no clear protagonist, it's really only a rationalist fic in a very meta, global sense and there's very little transparency or solvable mysteries within the context of the individual storylines.
          ```

          ```
          I'm in the middle of SD now and I feel the same way. My friend told me it was of comparable quality and that is what made me start reading. While I am very much enjoying SD, it lacks whatever quality MoR had that caused me to obsess over it.

          I may change my mind as I keep reading, but I have to say, MoR had me hooked immediately and kept me hooked continuously.
          ```

- u/PM_me_couchsurfing:
  ```
  That's awesome!! Due to my commitment to only consume completed fiction, I've been looking forward to starting this for months. 

  Phone and computer got mugged recently, but there isn't a mobi/ebook version out there, is there? (Or should I wait a week for bug fixes?)
  ```

  - u/NanashiSaito:
    ```
    I'll put one together shortly. I just realized somehow Wordpress ate one of the paragraphs in the last chapter, which is unfortunate, so I'll be adding that back in.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Wow, congrats on finishing this!
