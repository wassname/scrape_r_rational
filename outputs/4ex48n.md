## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I had a question I wanted to ask here, but I can't remember it.  So instead, what sort of mnemonic or recall techniques have people found to be effective?
  ```

  - u/captainNematode:
    ```
    I like to write things down (usually in keywordy streams of consciousness) on post-it notes or emails/messages to myself and check them when I'm in a better position to do something about them. Like I'll be biking around and have a BRILLIANT thought on how to implement some algorithm or code in a more efficient way, but I sure as hell won't remember it (or even remember that I needed to remember something) when I've access to a computer in however many hours, so I'll pull over and text it to myself. Then, when I get home or when I'm working the next day I'll look at all the messages I sent to myself and jog my memories. If I'm at home already but want to jot some quick thoughts down, I'll use Windows' Sticky Notes app or scribble on one of my whiteboards (esp. useful if it requires weird symbols or diagrams).

    There's probably a more sophisticated way of doing this with dedicated memo/note taking software, but my thoughts aren't so elaborate as to require such dedicated storage and just using my phone's facebook messenger is more convenient for easy access from any and all computers. Since my thoughts also aren't so important to dedicate effort committing them to longer term memory, I find this better than trying to construct memory palaces or whatever, too.

    I've assigned a person-action-object visual image to each number from 0-9. In practice, I mostly use this to easily fix the page number of whatever book I'm reading in my mind. Sometimes for memorizing phone numbers.

    Ex. I was on page 219 of Brandon Sanderson's Bands of Mourning yesterday (my favorite Mistborn book now, seriously, so great) - 2 is Luigi, planking, with a green fireball. 9 is Rick, belching, with his flask. 1 is Buggs Bunny, chewing, with a carrot. So the page number appears in my mind as a mental image of Luigi, chewing, holding a flask. Easily pictured, easily recalled.

    There's an easier way of doing this for page numbers that just matches each digit to a letter, such that most combinations create memorable one-syllable sounds. But that's became it's meant specifically for remembering page-numbers, and isn't really applicable to anything more than 3 digits long.

    My method is adapted from the system for memorizing the order of a deck of cards, which I got from the fantastic book Moonwalking With Einstein (all about memory and memory techniques - highy recommended).

    Edit: corrected page number

    You can play this mod without being spoiled, so if you've for example played Thaumcraft by the Thaumonomicon only, http://psi.vazkii.us/.

    You assemble tiles onto a 2D grid of 5x5-9x9 squares, which stand for "position of the caster" or "add these two vectors" or "raycast this position and this vector to the next solid block", or "this value", or "add this vector, maximized in its length at this constant, to the velocity of this entity", or "lightning strikes at this position", where pronouns always refer to values produced by one of your choice of the four adjacent tiles. Materials used in the construction of your wand limit grid size, complexity ('number of tiles that aren't constants or "this value"') and potency (sum of constants used in tiles that have direct effect on the world, weighted by tile type - manacost also works like this, but uses a different weighting). The tutorial unlocks tiles and raises your mana pool+regen up to a cap at the end of the tutorial.

    Spells reach up to 32 blocks from their point of origin, which you can choose in the crafting of the spell to be you, where a projectile hits something, where a gravity'd thrown "grenade" is after a few seconds, where within 32 blocks you had placed a "detonator charge", or where within a few blocks you place a spell circle. Spell circles repeat a spell 20 times across a few seconds (and theres a tile that counts the current iteration) (15x mana cost). You don't regen unless you haven't cast for a few seconds, except that spells you made to be channelling allow regen after a few seconds of channelling ("repeatedly casting") (iteration tile works here too).

    One tile does "pause spell execution for this constant time" (and another lets you "treat this number smaller than this constant as constant"), and the only conditional does "stop spell execution iff this number is 0" - have fun with the lazy evaluation order of tiles.

      I always take pictures when I get hurt. Not only is it just good record-keeping, but it can help for diagnosis once you've got it covered, assuming that it's not serious enough to go to the hospital. (This picture was taken between soaks in cool water and after I'd taken painkillers.)

    I had that happen to me too when I was younger. Mine was the quarter the size of yours, was from a hot pan instead of grease, and much closer to my finger tips. This is only from my personal experience, and not a medical opinion, but it should make something like a blister and then into a hard scab before disappearing without a scar. It helped to cover it with guaze and to keep an ice pack or something cold on a few times throughout the day.

  what is the average salary for an engineer graduate on his/her first job in your area? I majored in bio engineering and when they ask me how much I want i draw blanks.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    There are actually specific responses you should try to give if you can, or try to get an offer from them first. In general, part of what they're hoping for is that there's a like, inverse bid-ask spread, where your dream salary is lower than what they're willing to offer. So for example:

    * The most you'd ask for is $65,000 since you're not aware of your value.

    * The company is willing to pay you up to $80,000

    So, in this case if the company asks you what you'd want, you say "$65k/yr", they pay you, and you leave $15k on the table. However, if you are canny, do research, and ask "$90k/yr", they say "the best we can do is $80k" and you don't leave cash on the table. Or, if they make an offer first, they offer you say $75k/yr and you leave less cash on the table if you accept it. You can also still counter-offer.

    Either outcome (hearing their offer first, or being informed and making a big ask) is better than making a small ask and leaving cash on the table.

    You won't ever be given more than you ask, so ask high. It's tough to ask so high that it negatively impacts you. I use glassdoor to find out salaries. In my area, the SF Bay Area, an entry-level electrical engineer or software engineer should be making at least $60k/year. Depending on your field and level of knowledge (and the company) this can be higher.
    ```

  - u/Farmerbob1:
    ```
    Wherever you get the number from, you need to learn how to get them to make you an offer first.  The first person to make an offer is generally considered to be at a disadvantage.  A truly good negotiator will still probably get the better deal.  If you feel like you are being lowballed, ask for a set raise after 90 or 180 days if you are meeting their needs well enough to remain employed.  If they agree, get it in writing.  Also, you absolutely MUST learn what types of questions you should be asking.  There is a science to interviewing, and if you learn it, it can make a huge difference in your pay and benefits.
    ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    It depends on the state, I believe. The average salary is higher in large, metropolitan places like New York, Atlanta, etc. than it would be in other places. I'm not an engineer, but I was a mechanical engineering student for three years at Georgia Tech. We were told that we'd be expected to have starting salaries in the $50k area, although for the life of me, I can't remember if that's before or after taxes. This was in Atlanta, Georgia.

    That being said, just google your question. There are tons of sites and whatnot that have done that research for you :)

    I expect there's actual websites that do this, but there's probably a few rate your landlord Facebook groups for that city that it might be worth checking? 

    Oh, and the university you're doing your PhD with should be able to give you advice too, maybe even a list of approved landlords? They should know where to look for more info, at least.

  I'd like to talk a bit about the presidential election and specifically about Donald Trump. Even more specifically, I'm going to make a series of predictions and see if you guys agree or disagree.

  Scary Prediction #1 - Trump will only get even worse with his insults and trash talk. He wants attention and doesn't care if it's positive or negative. I'll even go far as to say that he wants riots and people staging protests against him for maximum attention which is related to Scott's [Toxoplasma of Rage](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/). I'm actually scared and worried that he'll end up causing people to be hurt or killed because of this. And he'll even make use of the poor person's injuries/death to 'justify' his actions.

  Obvious Prediction #2 - He'll win the nomination for the Republican party. He's so far in the lead that I doubt anyone else will catch up, although Cruz has my support.

  Unusual Prediction #3 - Sanders will win the Democratic nomination. This is because people will see Sanders as Trump's counterpart and the guy to beat him. Yes the Democratic Party wants to vote Hillary who is currently leading, but Sanders is anti-establishment and an underdog. He'll win through the popular vote. If Trump wasn't running, Sanders would not have such a strong position.

  Shocking Prediction #4 - Afterwards Trump'll change absolutely everything about himself. He'll say that he didn't mean his words as harshly as people thought. He'll be accepting of immigrants, higher wages, gay marriage, marijuana, etc, etc, major Democratic issues, and everything else he's been dumping on. He's only been as publicly extreme right as he is now to lock in the Republican vote. No Republicans are not terrible people who support racism, but if you are a supremacist, I can be very confident you voted Republican in the last election. Or just good old fashioned xenophobia towards foreigners.

  Either way, Trump will paint himself as a Democrat and most likely even pick a Democrat as his running mate. He'll switch to the left side so fast that you will get whiplash. Yes people will fight and scream how he is a turncoat and a liar (as if we didn't know this already!). But memories fade and people will be fooled. He will become someone who you agree with and you will think, aw he's not such a bad guy (I even expect this to happen to myself and I'm the guy writing this!).

  Hopeful Prediction #5 - This will not work and Sanders will become the next president. No, I cannot provide any accurate reasons/evidence for why I believe this. I'm betting on this prediction coming true with 60% likelihood and it's more wishful thinking and hope for this to be true when the betting percentage should be closer to 50% (between him and Trump, not between all of the candidates right now). But it's important for the next prediction.

  Surprising (not really) Prediction #6 - If Sanders becomes the next president, Trump will claim this was his plan all along. Why? Because he **knows** prediction #3 as well. And he will want to get something back after losing which is to deny his losses and claim that everything that happened was all part of his master plan to...make politics engaging, say that he always supported Sanders, and to change up the two-party system, or something like that probably. Oh and he'll say that while being President would have been nice, he didn't care too much about it.

  Depressing Prediction #7 - No matter what happens, Trump will face absolutely no consequences for his actions.

  Let's have a calm and "rational" discussion!

  EDIT: Some grammar edits, editing #6 a bit, and adding prediction #7.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:

    Fun predictions!

    I don't have any of my own, but I do have bookies that I keep up with. The bookies are saying:

    **Democratic Candidate**

    * **5/1 (long) odds on Sanders** being the Democratic nominee. They give Sanders a **17%** chance of being the nominee, assuming fair odds. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
    * **1/8 (short) odds on Clinton** being the Democratic nominee. They give Clinton an **89%** chance of being the nominee, assuming fair odds. Since they shorten it (probably quite a bit) to gain profit, they think her odds are actually lower.
    * Amazingly, they are also giving 25/1 (long) odds on Biden somehow becoming the nominee. Obviously, they real odds are much longer and they're shortening it, but it's hilarious to imagine Biden becoming the next Democratic nominee 4% of the time. Probably some people are betting on this so they shortened the odds a huge amount to make more cash.

    In any case, since this adds up to 118%, you can tell they're shortening the odds to make a profit. Even so, the bookies disagree about who is likely to become the Democratic Party nominee. Sanders may well be our nominee, but it seems that the people who make a living off of making good probability estimates think it's more likely, though not certain, that Clinton will be our nominee.

    **Republican Candidate**

    * **4/7 (short) odds on Trump** being the nominee. Assuming fair odds, they give Trump a **63%** chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
    * **7/4 (long) odds on Cruz** being the nominee. Assuming fair odds, they give Cruz a **36%** chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
    * **9/1 (long) odds on Kasich** being the nominee. Assuming fair odds, they give Kasich a **10%** chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower-- probably much lower. 
    * Romney and Ryan are both in there with very very long odds, that are still probably shortened for profit. 

    So, it looks like the bookies agree with you on Trump being the Republican nominee. Since this adds up to 109%+, you can tell they're shortening the odds to make a profit.


    **Next President - Outright**

    * **2/5 (short) odds on Clinton** being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Clinton a **71%** chance of being the president. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think her odds are actually lower.
    * **5/1 (long) odds on Trump** being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Trump a **17%** chance of being the president. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
    * **8/1 (short) odds on Sanders** being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Sanders a **11%** chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
    * **10/1 (short) odds on Cruz** being the president. Assuming fair odds, they give Cruz a **9%** chance of being the nominee. Since they shorten it to gain profit, they think his odds are actually lower.
    * Small chances in here for Kasich and (wow, again?) Biden as well. 

    Pretty fun. Again, as always, they shorten the odds for a profit. Here, we see 108%+ chance, added together. These predictions are from a standing start, not contingent on anything in the future, and the odds change over time.

    **Winning Party -- Outright**

    * **1/3 (short) odds on the Democrats winning. 75% chance if odds are fair**
    * **9/4 (long) odds on the Republicans winning. 30% chance if odds are fair**

    Pretty fun. Again, as always, they shorten the odds for a profit. Here, we see 105%+ chance, added together. These predictions are from a standing start, not contingent on anything in the future, and the odds change over time, especially as we see nominees.

    Looks like your predictions on the electoral outcomes are not implausible. Trump will likely win the Republican nomination, and will likely lose the general election. Although Clinton is more likely to win the Democratic nomination than Sanders, Sanders still has a good shot at it.

    The moral of this story: watch for Biden coming out of left field! Biden 2016! Biden 2016!
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Thanks for giving the odds! I laughed at the stuff about Biden. Do you mind letting me know where you got your odds from?

      The stuff about Clinton being the lead I agree with and if the elections were to happen right now, she'd win. It's just that I don't think she will be able to maintain her advantage over Sanders.
      ```

      - u/blazinghand:
        ```
        I got these specific odds off of betvictor (not to be confused with bit vector), but you can find other similar bookie websites that give similar odds. I can ask one of my british friends what his bookie is giving on american election odds. Those guys like to bet on everything.

        Also, it's probably like super illegal to actually bet on american election outcomes if you are an american-- just look at the odds if you like, but don't place bets. These sites are for europeans.
        ```

      - u/blazinghand:
        ```
        By the way, the reason Biden is listed as having a chance is the possibility of both Sanders and Clinton withdrawing from the race. Let's say Clinton has something come up like she gets thrown in jail or something and completely withdraws. Then, Sanders has a stroke cause he's like a million years old and just dies or becomes unable to run. This happens, like, 3 weeks before the convention or something.

        In this situation, the party needs to go take a look at who it has lying around who could step up and run for the presidency, since both candidates who have delegates are disqualified. The Democrat with the best national-level name recognition who might be able to win the general election from a standing start is Biden. So, if both Clinton and Sanders withdraw from the primaries, Biden will be the Democratic candidate.
        ```

    In Fanfiction parlance, exclam means "version of", and can generally be replaced by "version of" or a space. So for example, in fanfictions in which harry potter is born a girl or named harriet potter or something, authors will refer to it as a "Fem!Harry" fic. In fics of Naruto where Naruto is ruthless and evil, it's a "Dark!Naruto" fic. Harry has secret magic? "Powerful!Harry". Replacing the exclam with a space or with "version of" makes sense of it.

    This lingo was obviously developed by people who are not programmers.

    I've never seen anyone use that. If I had to guess, though, ff.net users with alternate character interpretations like to say, for example, cold!dark!smart!harem!

So from there people would use Rational! in their summaries to denote that it's a rational fic, and from there, tl fit in ff.net's restrictive character limit, they'd contract down to R!

  Fanfiction Question:

  So first things first, this question will have little to do with rational elements at ALL (unless you count trying to manipulate an audience somewhat rational), so I apologize in advance:

  I'm writing a Shokugeki no Soma (Food Wars, an anime) fanfiction called [Nisegami](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11804422/1/Nisegami). It's currently about 75k words, 9 chapters and it's been out for like two months (I update it pretty much every week).

  Here's my question: I'm trying to maximize the amount of reviews I get on my story. I don't want to break my chapters up into smaller ones (which could be a valid way to increase my review spread) So, with my review goal in mind, is updating every week too often? I just wondered if leaving longer gaps in between updates would make people "thirsty for more", thereby increasing the story's popularity? There may not be a specific right/wrong answer to this question but many of you are experienced, intelligent authors, so I figured I'd ask :)

  EDIT: And even beyond just my initial question about spacing out updates, what are some of the other methods you guys have seen/used to increase the amount of hype/feedback your story has gotten? I'm already posting updates on the subreddit of the series, and I do my best to reply to all of my reviewers. What more can I be doing to get views/reviews?

    If maximizing review count per chapter is your sole goal, you can finish your author's notes at the end of each chapter with a direct question to the readers, maybe some kind of poll pertaining to the direction the story is to take.

    I wonder, though--when searching for a new story to read, how many frequenters of FanFiction.net look at review counts, and how many look at favorites? I personally sort by favorites, and try to give less weight to reviews, specifically because reviews are multiplied by chapter count, while a person can give only one favorite to the entire story. Also, a review may be positive or negative (e.g., *[Chunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411)* is #11 on favorites but #1 on reviews among English *Naruto* stories, while *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* is #48 and #73, respectively), while a favorite obviously always is positive.

    It'd be an interesting survey to conduct.

    (In particular: I've given out 33 reviews in the course of my FanFiction.net career, in comparison to my 299 favorites, and probably half of those reviews were negative--so I *really* don't consider reviews to be a very good indicator of a story's worth.)

      Hmmm. Interesting point. It sort of eliminates the advantage that multi-chapter stories would have. It also doesn't allow "guest" favoriting either. Sorting my favorites vs reviews gives me an entirely different list of stories. #1 in reviews can end up being like #5 in favorites. Interesting metric.

    Directly asking people to review would probably work well. There's a reason that most Youtubers end their videos with "please like and subscribe" -- it actually gets people to like and subscribe who wouldn't have otherwise.

    Personally, I think being consistent is the most important thing you can do in a serial, so it's really a matter of what sort of pace you can keep up on a regular basis. Longer than a week and you risk losing attention though; attrition is the enemy.
