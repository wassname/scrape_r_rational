  The answer is "no" :) But it seems to be a big thing because hundreds of people sent me the link! I'm gonna read that or listen to the podcast as soon as I can!

    It's a big thing in many ways... seeing your interest, you might want to save a week for that, or forget about sleeping for a while. And then there's the unavoidable descent in everything rationalist, from which some never come out.

    Btw LOVE YOUR WORK. I'm getting Augie and the Green Knight as a gift for a friend but I'm definitely going to read it a few times before handing it over.

      Boulet is indeed amazing and both me and my daughter cannot really wait to get Augie (it is Augie, not Angie) in our hands.

      Or maybe to explore fun phase space.

      I don't know about HPMOR  canon but in HP canon Harry saw a fully accurate scale model of the milky way galaxy being sold in diagon ally.

      I don't know about a magical spaceship but wizards probably have spells or divinations to explore outer space without actually leaving Earth.

        I wonder how reliably canon Harry rates the accuracy of milky way galaxy models.

        >I don't know about a magical spaceship but wizards probably have spells or divinations to explore outer space without actually leaving Earth.

        I would probably still go in person, even if I had an identical experience available in some sort of virtual reality device. I suspect, I would not be alone. 

        Besides, I feel that this type of spell would be a bit inconsistent with the canon universe. The society described in the books does not look like a terribly outward-looking civ hungry for exploration. Sure, the spells were probably invented at one point or another, but they are not widely known or available. At least that's my reading.

          I feel like we don't really get to see the wizarding world accuralty because we see through the eyes of Harry.  He barely interacts with other people his own age besides Hermione and Ron.

          The wizarding world is probably advancing spellcraft and magical theory all the time, its just that Harry doesn't care about that sort of stuff.  I do think though there probably isn't an organization dedicated to systematically progressing magic.  In our world we have universities, research groups, and companies all advancing science and technology.  The wizarding world has some advancement, but its probably done indipendently by curious wizards

          There probably isn't a government sponsored wizard!NASA but I wouldn't be surprised that there is a loosely sffliated group of wizards somewhere who study and explore space or something.

      That's probably the best reason I've ever seen, but still it suffers from an issue that it is a pretty niche interest, especially in a society that doesn't have stuff like Star Trek. And even for wizards it's probably not trivial, as you'd likely have to invent spells for stuff like radiation shields.

      Still, I'd really really like to read a "wizards-colonise-space" story. To The Stars does the magical space colonisation from a different angle (and is therefore my favourite space story), but it might be more fun with wizards because the big magics in To The Stars can be used just once per lifetime.
