  Very good. I [](#s "got the twist about when they talk about the writing being copied over and over again. It's definitely one of those things that you either get or don't. I'd read an article about this before.") I appreciated the reference to Ozymandias.

  A summary maybe?

  EDIT: I read it and yes it is good.

    It is a good story and you should read it without spoilers.

    The description on FimFiction is
    > Daring Do can't believe her luck when she is asked to help explore the most ancient tomb known to ponykind. But terrible danger awaits her, for beneath the earth rests something beyond equine understanding.

    EDIT: Just read it. This is really all the explanation that can be given.

    No.  This story is brilliant when read without spoilers.  No summaries.

    Yes, I realize it's *My Little Pony* fanfiction.  Read it anyway.  Besides, ponies are great.

      I personally find ponies to be some mixture of utterly boring and completely terrible, but this story was nonetheless totally amazing and worth reading immediately.

      Just for contrast.

        The MLP:FiM community has a higher proportion of older males in in, compared to all the fanfic communities populated largely by 13 year old girls. It's therefore somewhat easier to find fanfic that appeals to the demographics of this sub than many other fandoms of similar or larger size (largely because fewer people are trying to write romances, and more are trying to write adventures and sci-fi).

  [](#s "I recognised it the second it mentioned the hedge of spikes, but") I still definitely enjoyed it.
