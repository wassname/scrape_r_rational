  > “What don’t you like about yourself?” I asked.

  > “Oh, lots of things,” Amaryllis replied.

  The Amaryllis technique of getting a boy to date you: first, magically remove all romantic interest you have in him, keeping him fully aware of this. Second, have a child by someone else (magical deer are preferred but not necessary). Make sure he is present during the conception, although the conception can occur before step 1. Then, have a genuine outpouring of all the things you dislike about yourself, especially if those things are related to feeling guilty about stabbing people. The boy asking for cuddles as an oblique way of asking you out is soon to follow, at which point you have succeeded.


  Jokes aside, we're about two significant Mary-Joon interactions away from them being officially a couple (that they admit to themselves. Everyone else on the isle is shipping them hard). It's been a long time coming, and been handled very well, showing that they're genuinely friends and depend on each other.


  The interactions with Grak and Raven have been nice in these chapters as well. The bit after the meeting with Esuen shows, rather than tells, how much Grak looks up to Juniper (other than literally). In contrast, Gemma returning is mentioned in one line and then basically forgotten.


  Speaking of Grak, loyalty 20 is pretty close, and that will be a big thing. Not only will Joon get ~40 in warding instantly, Grak will get access to all of Joon's magics. For someone who really dislikes himself, I'm wondering how he will handle getting the ability to change himself so freely. Would boosting his values effectively end or lessen his depression? His comments on what Fallatehr did to him seem to indicate that this would work.


  The jokes are always good. Uther just using the German word for castle, using the German grammar for naming the people who made the metaphorical castles, the Tuung calling themselves Battletoads, *The Princess Diaries*. Some of the understated things get a laugh out of me as well, like the blunt "yep, this thing just makes elk." I'm sure there's some that went over my head, as a number have in the past.


  For the Respec, I'm a little unclear on a few things. Taking Rune magic seems odd given that there will probably be tight restrictions on people entering the runeforge. Air magic is said to have a really good use case, but I'm not seeing it right now. And warding seems redundant given that Grak will be hitting Loyalty 20 soon and give Joon an instant 40 in warding, which would make it on par with his other skills for a number of levels. And speaking of that, not unlocking warding seems a bit odd given that Grak is one of the best warders alive and is right there to train Joon.  Just finding out if he can quickly make a wand and monocle seem like they are worth the time it would take to unlock warding.


  This comment has gone on long enough, but as a last note I love the idea that Joon got the effective skill of at least 10 years spent as a flower mage, and then gave that skill up, before he ever actually used a flower.

    ```
    Air magic partially covers the weaknesses of stilling - it can defend against suffocation or poisoning the air. Just from the description, it seems like it would compound with water magic, being able to create large-scale pressure gradients to draw in water vapour, and being able to use that water vapour to do the fine air manipulations that a power focused on separation has trouble with
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Absolutely.  Considering that they've already lost a party member to poisons, and they know Fel Seed uses poisons, it shouldn't be a hard decision at this point.
      ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    I think Grak is depressed, having half Juniper's Soul/Spirit power would allow him to fix that, and I think he will.  I expect Juniper will feel a bit bad for not having taken care of it for him all this time.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      I don't know. Juniper is pretty anti soul manipulation. You remember how badly he reacted when he found out Amaryllis edited hers?
      ```

      - u/Marand23:
        ```
        I don't know, removing romantic feelings and removing a depression does not seem in the same ballpark. A depression is universally seen as a bad thing. We treat it with pills and therapy right now, but if we could make them go away with a snap of the finger I'm pretty sure everybody would do it. It would, of course,  not fix the cause of the depression, but diagnosing and fixing that becomes easier when the depression is not in the way, murking the waters.
        ```

        - u/burnerpower:
          ```
          I mean I agree in principle but based on Juniper's editing of himself the way he would accomplish this would be to lower the spiritual emotional threads involved. There is no depression thread or value to change. There are just the threads that are reacting to the in Grak's case the tragedy that caused it. Basically if my understanding is correct to accomplish what you're talking about would require Grak to make himself care less about the fate of his home. If Grak was still suicidal I could see Juniper endorsing this but with the situation as is I don't think anyone will see it as necessary.
          ```

          - u/Argenteus_CG:
            ```
            Joon's understanding of spirit is pretty good at this point. He could probably fine tune the feedback mechanisms of the spirit to favor motivation and hope over self-hatred and despair without affecting the individual weighting of specific things relative to each other (except insofar as the changes will affect Grak over time).

            If he only had soul magic to work with, you'd have a point given that that's how the values system works, but spirit seems to be ALL ABOUT manipulating feedback loops, and depression (and many other mental illnesses) can be understood by seeing our mind as a vast system of various feedback loops, some of which, particularly in the case of mental illness, are tuned suboptimally and are thus too excitable/susceptible-to-positive-feedback or too unexcitable/susceptible-to-negative-feedback. This is of course a vast oversimplification of the actual processes involved (which probably differ between Aerb's spirit based system and the electrochemical processes we use on earth), but Joon is something of an expert on spirit, and based on what we know of spirit, this seems like exactly what it's good at.
            ```

            - u/burnerpower:
              ```
              Maybe he could, but that's just speculation at this point. If you were right though I think he would have edited himself differently than he did to deal with the Bethel situation. That he didn't while having Spirit 100 implies to me that it's not possible to so easily and cleanly deal with depression.
              ```

      - u/WalterTFD:
        ```
        I mean, he edited his own during the Bethel situation, he edited a guy's during the Mome Rath deal.  I don't think it is fair to say Juniper is anti soul manipulation when he does it more than anyone we know of and has no plans to ever stop doing it.  Like he talks to Masters and explains that he is fully willing to soul manipulate, that it is expressly on the table.
        ```

        - u/burnerpower:
          ```
          He considers it a necessary evil sometimes. When he edited himself, he was guilty about it and considered it giving in. When he soulfucked the cultist he described it as crossing a line. The first time Amaryllis did it he called it a violation of self. I don't think he would endorse Grak editing out his depression as Grak seems to be recovering pretty well as is. I'm not sure he even still is depressed based on how we've seen him acting.
          ```

          - u/WalterTFD:
            ```
            I dunno, I judge folks on what they do, not what they say about it.  

            Like, if somebody hits their girl and then talks up a storm about how they are just the worst and should never have done that, you know, ok.  Then they do it again and are like, 'yeah, I crossed a line'...ok.  And then some dude is like 'hey, can you maybe promise to stop hitting your girlfriend' and bro is like 'hey, I'm not gonna take it off the table.'  That dude is an abuser, yeah?  You wouldn't call them vehemently against domestic abuse, because of all the abusing that continue to do.

            Like, we saw Juniper let Amaryllis self modify, plus or minus some talking.  I don't see a reason to think he'd do different for Grak, maybe there's a hypocritical lecture, maybe there isn't, but I think the day Grak gets essentialism is the day he cures his depression.
            ```

            - u/burnerpower:
              ```
              Well yes but this comment chain started with you saying that Juniper would "feel bad" for not curing Grak's depression sooner. Even if Grak's first action on hitting Loyalty 20 is to edit himself, I don't think Juniper will ever feel bad for not editing his friend's soul.

    Scrubbing certain gases out of the air, or moving it into. The faulty wards that killed Darili Irid were probably wards on air magic, considering the description given. Vibration magic also has obvious synergies (at the *very least* with breath).
    ```

  - u/Igigigif:

    Air magic also has massive potential synergy with velocity magic. One of the primary limiting factors on a velocity mage's speed is retaining enough 'mass' to displace air

    As a German native speaker I just want to note that "Schloss" also means lock which - at least for me - adds to their mysteriousness and elusiveness. I'm guessing it was intentional on the author's part. (feel free to weigh in @[cthulhuraejepsen](https://www.reddit.com/user/cthulhuraejepsen/) ;-) )

  Also, in case you missed it, [Worth the Candle: A Brief Description of Aerb](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20629112) is the worldbuilding doc that came out between this batch of chapters and the last, and might be worth a read if you really love worldbuilding.
  ```

- u/VilhalmFeidhlim:
  ```
  Post-Respec it definitely feels like the social values have gone down and the mental values have gone up, in a more noticeable way than just 'Juniper immediately solves complicated maths problem to indicate he is now smarter,' as some media might do. He thinks his way through his problems more logically (though I guess this could be some kind of placebo effect on my part), or at least seems to - when he raised issues with Amaryllis and Esuen, it seemed like there was less waffling, and more of Juniper zeroing in on a problem, and either finding a solution or asking what solution was preferred.

  Also it seems a bit like the enhanced MEN is helping to allay some of the potential fallout from reduced SOC, which... actually makes a lot of sense? Sometimes in the past it felt like all the enhanced SOC did was make Joon aware of a problem, without pointing out any resolutions. If he allocates those points instead to MEN - well, sometimes people really *aren't* all that complicated, and *can* just be solved by knowing more things. Or maybe it's that, without Joon trying to be suave and understanding, his bluntness comes off more endearing and honest than his half-hearted attempts at manipulation did?

  In any case, great chapters. These felt like downtime chapters, but even so the interaction and subtle complications that arise are keeping me very much invested. Even the introduction of those minor characters, like the captain, or the border guards, feels like the introduction of nuanced characters - enough that, in any other book, I'd mark them down as being plot-relevant later on. Bravo, Mr. Wales. 

  Highly anticipating next time's (royal) courtroom drama!
  ```

  - u/sibswagl:
    ```
    I kind of feel the other way? Maybe I need to reread some high SOC and some low SOC chapters, but Joon felt very socially competent here. He talked things out, expressed concern for his companions, listened to Eseun’s concerns and worked on a solution, etc.

    Obviously, low SOC doesn’t mean he reverts to asshole Joon, he’s grown as a person unrelated to his stats, but I didn’t feel a SOC drop.
    ```

    - u/VilhalmFeidhlim:
      ```
      Right, but that's what I meant by MEN compensating somewhat by giving him better analytical ability. He doesn't have to rely on a social sense in all situations, he can sometimes just rely purely on his ability to figure things out and apply it to other people. 

      To me, he felt a bit less smooth, and a bit more direct when it came to his conversations with, for example, Grak, explicitly telling him what he thought Grak's version of heaven would be instead of going for a more subtle resolution.

      I don't know if that makes sense? Essentially, what I'm trying to say is that (at least to me) the drop in SOC made him a bit less socially competent, but the hike in MEN meant that that wasn't as noticeable, because he could see what people wanted and how to give it to them anyway. 

      There'll probably be consequences for the SOC drop at some point anyway (and like you said, he's grown as a person unrelated to his stats), but for now it feels a bit like Mr. Wales is pointing out that there's a lot of overlap when it comes to social abilities and just pure cognitive ability.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Personally, I thought that in that scene he was incredibly rude. *Telling* someone what you think their heaven would be? Really?! How about just *asking them*?

        ...Of course, when I went back and checked, I saw that Grak explicitly asked him to do so. Which put a damper on my outrage and made a real point to me about how easy it is to miss details and how that can shape our understanding. The best fiction makes you think about reality, and this just did. Thank you, /u/cthulhuraejepson

      I think the lack of a seeming SOC drop is because he's still riding Amaryllis' social skills through the companion bond, and those are higher than what he had before he respecced.  IIRC his actual stat didn't change all that much, just the skills?
      ```

    - u/t3tsubo:
      ```
      I'm with the original comment. He seemed rather rude and socially oblivious to the other person's feelings throughout the chapters' conversations. The text even seemed to note that with some funny looks or facial expressions from Amaryllis when Joon was being especially low SOC
      ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      Without a skill he reverts to being a regular human instead of a game character, right? It could be that regular Juniper plus the life experiences he's had in Aerb is more socially adept than where his stats were.

      In these chapters he feels a lot like he does in the flashbacks with Tiff. Perceptive, caring, talks about feelings in a way that's a bit overly clinical and direct.
      ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    I felt the same as well that Juniper was still handling social problems as well as before the Respec, but in a more logical manner. It seemed like that he didn't suffer any drop in ability, because of Symbiosis and the fact that narrative is having an effect on him. It just wouldn't be a good narrative fit if he reverts to prior social incompetence after all of the social problems and challenges he needed to overcome.
    ```

  - u/kurtofconspiracy:

    Also, he didn't drop SOC itself, only the skills related to it. Or did he move the floating point around?

  > “It’s probably Tommul,” I said, squinting. The squint didn’t do much good. 

  Dude, Juniper, you can alter your eye's optical properties (as per the Optics 20 virtue). That's bound to be much better than squinting!
  ```

  - u/MereInterest:
    ```
    Squinting effectively turns your eye into a pinhole camera, reducing the light collected but allowing images at any distance to be resolved.  Therefore, I propose that the squinting was an expression of Optics 20, a physical manifestation of the optical change made to the system of his eyes.
    ```

    - u/eltegid:
      ```
      That's a good hypotheses, but I disagree. For one, squinting must only approximate a pinhole, and he must be able to do better than that with the virtue.

      Rather, as someone else said, I think it's showing that he doesn't remember he has the virtue, in the moment.
      ```

      - u/Mr-Mister:

        To simulate squinting he'd have to voluntarily contract his pupils, which I'd say aren't part of the eye's lens per se.

  The text doesn't specify, and so I really have to ask - does The Jade Elk make live elk, or dead? Because it making live elk makes the statement that elk are extinct so trivially easy to fix that it's impossible to credit, where as an entad that just makes a huge pile of elk carcasses freaks me the hell out.
  ```

  - u/WilyCoyotee:
    ```
    Even if they are living, letting them out of your control ultimately means less money.

    People pay more money for fresh but extinct meat that they cannot get elsewhere. 

    Alternatively they could all be male or female elk, and without significant investment in genetics or maybe certain magics, they would be unable to source male genetic material/surrogates to breed more elk.

      yeah why would the people with the jade elk let any of them go free, i doubt theyre conservationists
      ```

  - u/JustLookingToHelp:
    ```
    The most plausible explanation for the elk to be produced alive but still extinct that I can think of is that it only makes one sex of elk, possibly matching an anatomically correct Jade Elk.  This further assumes no one has found it worthwhile or possible to give some of these created elk a magical sex change.
    ```

    - u/dantebunny:
      ```
      If the Jade Elk produces genetically identical copies of some platonic elk, which seems plausible given some things we've seen with entads, then even magically getting them to breed would result in an extremely unhealthy population.

  This is great. A couple things:

  The Warrens getting their first mention now makes me really feel like they are schloss. I love the concept, but fear that their existence (which never came up before in WtC via ctrl+F) is enemy action.

  The Jade Elk. 
  >“It makes elk,” said Grak. “Five hundred a day.”     

  Is the author a player or fan of Magic: The Gathering? In that card game, we've just recently been suffering a plague of elk creation, as described by [e.g. the commentors for a recent tournament](https://clips.twitch.tv/LittleTangentialTermiteDxAbomb). The card [Oko, Thief of Crowns](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/197/oko-thief-of-crowns) is extremely dominant in standard with [~67% of the most recent tournament playing Oko-based decks](https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/dnvu7q/mcq_weekend_day_2_stats_and_fun_facts/). He's also been showing up a lot in other formats like Modern. Oko's two most signature abilities are to make food tokens, and turn artifacts (including food tokens) and creatures into elks, removing all their other abilities and interactions.
  ```

  - u/Fruan:
    ```
    Raven being inocculated against the Outer Reaches and also claiming to have invented the Warrens seems like pretty strong evidence the Warrens aren't a schloss. It's just worldbuilding that never came up before.
    ```

    - u/Argenteus_CG:

  - u/Bezant:

    I like the Warrens / Schloss idea especially since there has been so much travel and discussion of travel. At the same time they would be so far reaching that it kind of doesn't fit the idea of something being subtly added.

  Okay, am I misreading something, not understanding strained parent-child interaction enough, or is there something weird going on with the Raven-Masters interaction and Juniper's reaction to it?

  >“No,” said Raven. “Absolutely not. This is dangerous, even more dangerous than just holding that construct in your mind.”  
  >  
  >“I won’t be forced out again,” said Masters. “Not this go around.”

  Raven forces Masters out of the discussion.

  >“Just as a warning, they’ll have a memory of this,” said Raven. “If you can find a way to keep the part with my father from spreading, I would appreciate it.”  
  >  
  >“It wasn’t that bad,” I replied. “He was being protective, to a level that you really, really don’t need.”  
  >  
  >“Still,” replied Raven. “I’d prefer that our colleagues don’t see me treated like a child. I’d have preferred *you* not see it.”

  Then *Juniper* describes that as Masters being protective of Raven. I could understand Raven being stuck looking at things from that point of view, but how could a third party possibly come away from that interaction with Masters having been overprotective of Raven, when it was clearly the opposite. There isn't even any reason given why this information would be dangerous to him. I smell shenanigans.

  The first hypothesis that comes to mind is that the Snag is actually an infectious meme that makes people think there is a threat to make them copy it to other people. But that doesn't really explain the discrepancy.
  ```

  - u/RomeoStevens:

    >the Snag is actually an infectious meme that makes people think there is a threat to make them copy it to other people. 

    Damn, that is clever.
    ```

    - u/MutantMannequin:
      ```
      Too many things don't line up for this to be a complete bait-and-switch. The Snag has a complex utility (subverting a specific anti-meme) that is unlikely to have arisen from anyone/thing other than Uther. If it is a trap, it's probably one Uther laid, and  I can't immediately see what would motivate him to do that.
      ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    Juniper did trade off his social abilities maybe he is simply misreading the situation as a result?  Juniper is interpreting Master’s desire to be involved as being protective of Raven which is a reasonable read on things but there are other possibilities.  I think you are right that it’s more Raven being over protective of her father than the other way around, and from a pragmatic non-meta viewpoint Masters has a lot of life experience that may be useful.  From a meta-viewpoint, having a non-companion character around is likely to get them killed, so I think Juniper made the right choice.
    ```

    - u/C_Densem:
      ```
      Masters hasn't ever come around to Raven being an adult doing adult things, and thoroughly disapproves of her doing them, probably even more so since he hasn't ever been able to have any influence on that. Raven was sick of his meddling five centuries ago and now defaults to "treat with my father the absolute minimum possible".

      tl;dr, Masters sees Raven as a little girl to protect, Raven sees Masters as a gigantic pest to be kept as far away as possible. The narrative/confidential stuff she said is true, but it's not why she did it.
      ```

  - u/You_cant_buy_spleen:
    ```
    I think Masters is usually overprotective, we've seen it before. So like many children, she is trying to counter his normal behavior. In this case, the overprotectiveness she expects is 1) get involved 2) be annoyingly overprotective. Only part one happened, she likely thinks she headed off part 2.
    ```

    I wonder if there's more to it, because the description of the outer reaches did not seem to explain Raven's behavior here. I also notice that Masters was so driven to know wtf he was spending his life doing that he initially imprisoned the party. I wouldn't be surprised if Raven's flat refusal to tell him anything lead him to do something desperate and dangerous.

  I am super excited to see what happens when you put Fire Magic, Air Magic and Alchemy together. Air Magic basically seems to let you separate gas streams with arbitrary compositions apart from one another, Fire lets you suppress or modify reactivity, and Alchemy makes you supernaturally good at chemistry? Once you have those together you can industrially produce fullerene, natural products of arbitrary compositions, encase your opponents in real time in ceramics... The possibilities in this world and with this protagonist could get really interesting. As a chemist, I am weirdly hyped.

        Well, Outer Reaches and DM-like personality suggest that Joon might go for a Conceptual apotheosis instead, but honestly I don't see the reason he has to choose *one* way to beat an entity with infinite tricks.

        They're both kinda bullshit, when really min-maxed. If Fel Seed is the god of biology, then Joon will become the god of everything else.

          And he can't become a real god before reuniting with Arthur/confronting Fel Seed (which may or may not be the same thing), it'd remove all the narrative stakes. Even ignoring the fact that this is a story in the real world, it's also a story in universe too, and the DM seems to care at least a little about that sort of thing.

    I think you're definitely on the mark here. Fel Seed either is, or is (knowingly) the product of Arthur. Juniper's image of Arthur has degraded as the story went on, and the final climax wouldn't make sense as anything else. The DM created events to break Arthur as a person over a lifetime, all for the purpose of replicating Fel Seed as Juniper created it. On a meta-(meta-?)narrative level, defeating Fel Seed is the metaphor for moving past Arthur's death. 

    Side thought, I think the community is rejecting Arthur as Fel Seed because it feels like the easy answer, and something at the scale of WtC needs some Utilitarian Machiavellian plot with an unthinkable-yet-obvious-after-reveal villain, as most ratfics go.

    I maintain it would be very strange for Uther to *independently* reinvent the aesthetic and powers of Fel Seed, even given everything else wrong with the world up to that point. It would be hard, but not insurmountable, for the story to shake us from the idea that the DM *made* Uther do it.

    >“There wasn’t a source, like the others, some magic gone awry or some entad that came out too powerful. He appeared in 34 FE, but … we’re not sure that there wasn’t some kind of incubation period, that he hadn’t gained his power, or that he was in hiding, and … there were rumors.” 

    ​

    >And at the same time, some of the exclusion zones must have logically been instigated by people who weren’t, for lack of a better term, player characters. Doris Finch didn’t fit into the same mold that Uther and I did, nor did Fel Seed, or Manifest.

    Fel Seed is contrasted with both the bulk of exclusion zones and the actions of a 'player character'. 

    >“No,” said Raven, looking back up at us. I kind of hated the way we were sitting above her, in a position of power we didn’t really need. “ No, ” she repeated. “It’s absurd, there’s a four year gap you’d have to account for, and -- and even if he had broken completely, there’s no way that he could have become something like that, whatever his sins, he just wasn’t --” She stopped and looked at Bethel’s empty seat. “If people knew that I’d tracked his last location to the Fel Seed exclusion zone, that rumor wouldn’t be so quickly dismissed. He wouldn’t be the Lost King, he would be the Fallen King.”

    It's hard to get a read on Raven here: can the head of the Infinite Library deny it while recognizing that most people wouldn't? Maybe.

Only when he returned, that’s who he was, the same entity he’d always been, ready to retake the battle zone and rebuild his City.

  I've recently started playing in a FATE campaign, and this to me looks like a rules-as-written interpretation of FATE. In FATE you spend your turns either creating aspects or caching out aspects for advantages. I figure experience playing in that system would explain some of Uther's competency in p-space.

  I’m calling it now: the schlossvolk are the final key to Juniper reaching godhood. Purely conceptual beings, with a powerful relationship to narrative, who can insert retroactively true people and places into the world? That’s the power of the DM, basically—just slightly lesser, and therefore reachable, as proven by Uther. My guess is that Joon will visit the Outer Reaches and, somehow, take the power of the schlossvolk for his own. 

  The power to retroactively edit history by inserting ‘schloss’ is so near to the power of a god that it makes little difference what you call it. And considering that the Ice Wizards are the direct result of the schlossvolk’s meddling, and also the result of the DM’s insistence on Uther following a never-ending narrative path, it seems clear that there’s a major connection between the two. Perhaps the Outer Reaches bridge the conceptual space between Aerb and whatever meta-reality the DM exists in?
  ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:

    The question then is, what do the schlossvolk represent narratively? Given the known role of the GM, what is the role of the schlossvolk? One might think of them as the players, I suppose, but that doesn't seem to hold up here in my opinion, at least with only what we know now.

    Given Juniper's reluctance to tinker with his soul to improve it, it seems likely he'll be similarly reluctant to fundamentally alter his conceptual self. But he's been willing to make exceptions when it's needed, so perhaps that won't deter him.

  > “It’s probably Tommul,” I said, squinting. The squint didn’t do much good.

  Why squint, when you have

  > **Optics 20, Clarity:** When you hold or touch, directly or indirectly, a lens or prism of any kind, you can alter its properties (e.g. altering focal point, concavity, refractive index, thickness). Any alterations you make will revert once you are no longer holding or touching the lens or prism. This includes biological lens, e.g. in the eye. Alterations must be physically possible.
  ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    > ... altering focal point, concavity, refractive index, thickness...

    None of that helps in this situation. Your eye is not a telescope.

    To increase magnification, you need a second lens.  And even if you did, the size of the lens is important, because that determines the light gathering power.

    That's why telescopes are so large, and scientists keep making larger and larger ones. You need to gather more photons from a distant object, because you receive less light from it compared to a nearby object.

    Cheap telescopes often advertise high magnification numbers, like 500x, but that is useless because the image is so dim.
    ```

    - u/redstonerodent:
      ```
      You can remove any irregularities in the lens and adjust the focal point so that the dragon is perfectly in focus. Then your vision should be limited by the resolution of your retina.

      My understanding of squinting is that it reduces the angle light is coming in from, which reduces noise and makes the image more coherent. Does squinting help if your lens is already shaped optimally? (Also, I'd think you could magnify at least a little by making the lens really thick, though not close to the level of a telescope.)
      ```

      - u/ansible:
        ```
        > My understanding of squinting is that it reduces the angle light is coming in from, which reduces noise and makes the image more coherent. 

        Not exactly.

        Squinting is the same as making a pinhole camera. The image is in focus for any distance, for any magnification. This is because only photons from one specific location on the target object may strike one location on the film or retina.

        Why don't we use this all the time? The number of photons coming in at a straight line from one point of the target is very low, resulting in a dim image. The smaller the pinhole, the better the focus, but that results in a lesser number of photons.

          No, that's the tetrahedral d4 IMO. Sure, it's platonic, but it doesn't have an up-facing side and so it has to go with a shitto workaround. They also roll terribly and are worse than legos to step on. I've seen videos of d4s based on the truncated tetrahedron, though I don't own any myself. They have a very small chance of landing on the small labelled sides (so small as to be negligible), but in return you get an up-facing side to put the label on (and thus one that's much easier to read), a die that can't double as a caltrop and perhaps most importantly a die that rolls much better (I haven't tried it, but I can tell just watching that it's rolling more instead of landing straight down). Also, I personally find them more visually pleasing with the nice clean hexagons, but that's up to personal preference. Now that I've remembered these, I might actually buy them, though my group hasn't been able to meet lately.

          The company that made the truncated tetrahedron d4s also made another die that I like in principle (but have never actually used), the rhombic dodecahedral d12. Sure, it's not platonic, but it tiles space beautifully and is just as fair.

          By the way, "shitto" was a typo, but I'm leaving it because I like it.

  I know Joon is trying to be anti murder hobo, but by golly Hyacinth really makes me want some good old murder-hoboing. Dragons too, given how utterly ridiculous their complaint is. I will say after all killing a dragon seems easier than one of the thirteen horrors. Also I don't really understand Joon's feeling that he's getting so powerful the "game" is going to be over soon. The only genuinely *powerful* thing he has going for him is the still magic at 100, but he can hardly use that lest the DM drops an exclusion again. Bethel and valencia, their most powerful members by far, were "coincidentally" removed too. Really seems like the DM is hitting the brakes because he has a pretty specific plan for Joon's power level growth, which implies a longer timeline, especially when you look at the ridiculous power of his enemies. Of course all of that slow growth can be skipped with a broken synergy, but that gets excluded.

    Think of how the Chernobyl disaster happened. There was no singular point of failure that caused the disaster. Instead, it was a compounding series of small mistakes folding into large problems folding into an overall catastrophe.

    ***Worst Case*** puts a floor on large-scale plans created by Joon, such that regardless of the number of variables involved, the overall results can be no worse than the worst case of two compounding mistakes. How it accomplishes this (adjusting Joon's planmaking, adjusting reality on the fly, adjusting things posthoc) is unknown. 

    This sounds, on the face of it, tremendously powerful. Plans of any scale can have no more than two relevant errors when written by Joon. Except...

    1. It has no real impact on smaller or on-the-fly plans, where two variables are about as much as you should be dealing with in the first place (see [Malfoy's 'Rule of Three' explanation of plotting](https://www.hpmor.com/chapter/24) in HPMOR). 
    2. Joon currently offloads all large-scale planning to Amaryllis, who doesn't have the virtue.
    3. Two compounding mistakes can still be pretty huge. The Death Star was destroyed from the results of a single mistake in placing a thermal exhaust port. When the world runs on narrative, an unbeatable plan with a single tiny flaw is arguably a *bigger* problem than an overall '90%' plan where all the bases are more-or-less covered.

    Which together explains why it's merely a level 10 virtue on par with ambidexterity, and not a capstone.

        That would be Reimer's approach to it. The counter would be grouping multiple errors into a single categorical 'mistake' by DM Fiat.

The third layer can only be defeated by a Rogue. Under a 'strong' interpretation of the virtue, your third objective can never be captured, as it would require three failures.

      ```

  - u/grekhaus:
    ```
    So there Geejo's answer, and then there's the RPG term-of-art version, which is what I think is actually being implied.

    Suppose you had a system much like the one shown in Worth the Candle. You're making a Logistics check by rolling a 1d100 die and then adding your total bonus of +50, and the Target Number is 75. If you roll a 24 (for a total of 74), that's just barely a failure, which should suggest to the DM that you only just barely failed in character. If you rolled a 15 instead, you'd have failed by a larger margin and this should suggest to the DM that your character failed to a greater degree. Likewise, rolling a total of 139 should imply a more successful result than just scraping by with a 79.

    Some TTRPGs formalize this notion as 'degrees of success' and 'degrees of failure, often with 5 or 10 point break points. For example, failing by 1 point is an ordinary failure, but failing by 10 points is 'one degree of failure', a failure which is one step worse than an ordinary failure. If this is what the Worst Case virtue refers to, it means that any failure of the third degree or worse gets treated as a second degree failure - there is a sharp limit on how badly a person with this virtue can screw up their logistics chain, in other words.

  I assume this is because I've never played D&D, but could someone help explain again the math the Joon and Reimer go through here:

  > “Right,” said Reimer. “Right. So, let’s compare you against a hypothetical optimized character, even a poorly optimized character. Heck, even one as poorly optimized for social skills as you are optimized for physical skills. An eleven in SOC means they’re multiplying their skill by ten, and that skill is going to be thirty or so, which means they get a bonus of three hundred against the TN. That means achievable range in the naive case of three hundred and one to four hundred.” He waited for me to nod. “Right, so you’re sitting here with a four in SOC, meaning a multiplier to skill of three, and you cap out at a whopping nine on that skill. That means a bonus of twenty-seven, and an achievable range, again, in the naive case with no adjustments or multipliers, of twenty-eight to one hundred and twenty-seven.” 

  Is it just in the rules that the multiplier is your skill minus 1?  And we are assuming a skill level of 3?  And an achievable range automatically adds 100?  Also what is an achievable range?
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    The add 100 is due to rolling a d100, which can have values between 1 and 100. The achievable range is the range of values that you can get when rolling against a number to see if you fail or not. With a bonus of 27 from skills and stats, the lowest you can roll is 28 (27 plus rolling a 1) through 127 (27 plus rolling a 100).

    But even if you're not Juniper, being a Gem Mage means having an automatic weapon with a couple magazines worth of target-seeking, IFF-equipped bullets. Or several shots of magical battering ram. Or the ability to cancel enemy use of such weapons on the cheap. Any or all of which can be readily concealed as ordinary jewelry of the sort a non-Gem Mage would be equally likely to wear, and which appears as such even to wards and warders.

    Furthermore, these shots can be projected from any part of the body and the activation of the magic is purely mental - making it ideal to use alongside Multithreading (which lets him focus on two things at once, say using Blade-Bound stuff on the defense and Gem Magic on the offense).

      He currently has 50 in gem magic through skilled trade, so the mental strain part can basically be completely ignored.

    I don’t think it’s been put on a pedestal. Quite the contrary, until recently Juniper constantly complained how it was a pain to use. It was only after he got a Spirit virtue that greatly reduces the downside of Gem Magic that he started considering it worth something. Its main advantage in comparison to Juniper’s other magics is that it allows for ranged attacks that track enemies.

    I may be forgetting a magic or two, but in general it's range and relative usage against most common defenses. It's sort of like how void weapons are better than normal guns, gem magic is sorta better in the same ways, it's the best possible offensive magic. I think it's put on a pedestal because it's a directly offensive magic that can in theory be used to take down an army if one has enough power behind it (which Juniper is finally hitting). That's just not a thing that's theoretically possible with any other single magic (save for example Soul Magic and modifying a commander kind of things) we've seen on screen to memory. It's homing abilities are especially scary. But I think the real issue is: are Gem Magic projectiles physical and hence stoppable by any of the kinetic mages (gold, still, etc.) or are they light and hence pretty unstoppable sans revision mage or warder, not sure if we know that yet.

    Yeah, I was wondering about that. It seems extremely useless to me, although I suppose it gives good ranged options.

    Honestly, I'm unclear why several of these made the cut. Probably for synergies that weren't explicitly stated?
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      There's only so many magics available, and a number of them aren't useful for him (wood, steel). There would need to be something he could take that is better than what he has now, and I doubt there are many skills better than the magic ones. Rune, air, and warding are a bit questionable, but the rest are fairly defensible, especially since he's both sharing skills with soon to be two other people, and they're collectively running a country. Synergies are also possible yes, particularly in regards to Fire, Plastic, and Alchemy.

    Punch lasers, yes. It's a good way of attacking large groups of people from range, and a cheap way of seeing if you can take out a stronger opponent. Vibration magic can do the same thing, but attacking a large group with enough force to be lethal uses up a substantial amount of breath which could be used on other things. The best example so far was when they were going to Kuum Doona, using gem magic with a sapphire was able to kill a bunch of soldiers that would have been hard to hit with non-homing attacks.

    ```
    It's less stupid in combat than flower magic, less obnoxious to set up than gold or pustule. It's effects are more linearly applicable to damage. And yes it's lasers and light based kinetic energy.

  - u/daniels220:
    ```
    I don't see it as being put on a pedestal? Juniper complained all the time about how useless it was due to the mental-strain cost messing up his ability to function in general—it has effective anti-synergy with *everything*. Aside from that, it was always a powerful direct-damage skill that he *wanted* to like—it's just that now with whichever virtue it is that makes the cost more bearable, it's actually viable. Even then, it's not like he's focusing on it any more than anything else...

  - u/Argenteus_CG:

    Not really sure the story's putting it on a pedestal. Joon considered it basically not worth bothering with until he got a virtue that significantly reduced the downsides, and even now it's not a focus compared to passion magic.

  I would question this wisdom of dropping social right before going into a situation that will probably require it.  All of that feels like foreshadowing to me.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Because of Symbiosis, his social skills haven't deteriorated due to dropping them, because he gets higher levels in those skills from Amaryllis.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I get that, but it's a pretty significant limitation given that they've been separated multiple times in the past.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        It's unclear what would cause Symbiosis to not give skills. Amaryllis seems to have had her Symbiosis abilities while Joon was in the Library. I also don't think either of them have ever lost their symbiosis skills.

  Am I forgetting earlier references to the outer realms or is the fact that they are being inserted like this a meta thing related to their memetic properties?

    The Outer Reaches have been mentioned before, by Masters initially and then a few times since. They've been given no description aside from that they were "no longer dormant" and that they can't be talked about.

    Masters mentioned it, Finch mentioned it and, IIRC, Joon has had a quest to deal with it for a while.

  By the way, has anyone checked if earlier chapters have changed at all (beyond fixing typos)? It'd make a lot of sense for Schloss to have been retconned into the story. If anyone's got an older backup of the story, I'm sure that'd be helpful in finding it (though I don't feel like putting in the effort right now myself, so it probably wouldn't be by me).

    I doubt that is the Alexander's style, but I have a few full pdfs on my phone I'll run through notepad++'s compare if this seems likely, and could trivially script a way to pull it from the internet archive if you don't have copies.

    No clue why you were downvoted except that might not be seen as playing fair with the mystery.

      >I doubt that is the Alexander's style

      I kinda figured the same, but I remembered a similar incident with something else I used to be a fan of, so I thought it was worth bringing up the possibility. No harm in checking, after all.

      >No clue why you were downvoted except that might not be seen as playing fair with the mystery.

      I can't imagine how. If AW had put in changes for us to find, how would it be breaking the unwritten rules of the mystery to, you know, find them? I guess there's an argument against automating it rather than looking for changes by hand, but I'm not too sympathetic to the idea that that amount of tedium is necessary for the challenge to be fair.

      My guess as for why I was downvoted was that someone didn't approve of me not feeling like putting in the effort myself.

  Preparing us for a downer ending! Vaguely remember something about the ending already planned (or was that MoL?), but this seeming throwaway from Pallida can't kill the rampant speculation.

  > “He’s not going to just bust out of his prison of amber or whatever and then make me a god, or solve everything forever. There will be things to do after that, or at the very least, things to talk about. But … I don’t know. I learned about Arthur coming here not all that long after I came here, and he’s touched so much of Aerb in so many ways, I just … yeah, you’re right, maybe it’s not the end, maybe that’s just the real beginning. I should temper my expectations.”

What would you want to be known for? What would you want your new life to be, if you weren’t so desperately needed?”

  All this talk about endings and beginnings and new lives and Arthur the alpha and Joon the omega is making me see why Mary's really taken to the Bible.

  P.S. that alchemy as mundane chemistry is a horrible burn.
