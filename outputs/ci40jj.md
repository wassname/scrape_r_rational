## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  **On Fighting**

  I usually try to avoid being an elitist or a pedant but when it comes to action and combat in serial fiction, I can't help myself.

  Much like Star Wars fans reacting to Rey's unexpected proficiency, a character with limited athletics and no background in combat successfully wading into battle will get me frothing at the mouth.

  There are certain areas of combat where there is no definitive source of truth. We don't know a ton about the best styles for armed single combat (especially between characters with different weapons and body types), we don't know a ton about the best styles for unarmed 1v2+ combat, and we obviously don't know the best styles for use of each world's magic system. **If a fighting style can't be practiced regularly on resisting training partners safely, it will be difficult to get to a useful level at that style (looking at you, Krav Maga).**

  What we do know a ton about is the value of certain styles for single, unarmed combat. If you have any plans for writing single combat, I would recommend a set of different types of videos. Even if you don't plan on writing about unarmed single combat, these points will still be informative, even if they don't translate perfectly.

  1.  Watch some videos from worldstar, /r/fightporn , or 4chan's fight threads. Fights between untrained amateurs (95+% of the population) are sloppy, short, and very odd looking. Size and athleticism make a huge difference. Following the initial adrenaline dump, both participants "gas out" if the fight continues past the 60 second mark. Fights regularly end up on the ground and there is nothing more dangerous than falling and hitting your head on pavement.

  2.  Watch some random amateur or regional boxing, mma, or kickboxing fights. In this day and age, nearly every prizefight will have a camera or phone recording. This is a good template for writing fights between protagonists and their rivals. Fights between two trained competitors look completely different from street fights between drunken hooligans. Relative advantages in technique, athleticism, preparation between competitors are very important. Differences in style, different martial disciplines are extremely important at this level. Note the vast differences between how fights look when fighters are allowed to clinch, trip, throw, elbow, kick, or knee their opponents compared to when you allow punching exclusively. Note the value of grappling in determining where the fight takes place and the vast gulf between an untrained grappler and an experienced grappler.

  3.  Look up the early fights of elite combat athletes. Jon Jones' early career ([1](https://youtu.be/P1xq7OkEF14),[2](https://www.mma-core.com/videos/Jon_Jones_vs_Stephan_Bonnar_-_UFC_94_-_Full_Fight_-_Part_1/10127150)). Vasyl Lomachenko's first few pro fights ([1](https://youtu.be/rVhN7-lXaLw?t=385),[2](https://youtu.be/SQ0MPEz-2pw?t=1109)). Jose Aldo's early career ([1](https://youtu.be/rIhj4NzgRME),[2](https://www.mma-core.com/videos/Jose_Aldo_vs_Alexandre_Franca_Nogueira_WEC_34_Part_1_Full_Fight/10117542),[3](https://www.mma-core.com/videos/Jose_Aldo_vs_Mike_Thomas_Brown_WEC_44_Part_1_Full_Fight/10117550)). Here you will start to see glimpses of greatness. You will see what happens when someone who just has that "it" factor fights your average trained Joe plumber. This is a great instructional for writing the up-and-coming hero. What is the point of a main character if they don't have that special something? Note the value of pace, the value of top-tier athleticism, the value of specialization in one style or well-rounded preparation. You will find some spectacular, action-movie techniques on display at this stage.

  4.  Watch a few MMA title fights. Great inspiration for scenes where your protagonist faces off with the BBEG or their killing-machine bodyguard. Sometimes you get a knock-down, drag-out war where neither man can break the other's will. Sometimes you get a dominant performance where the superiority of one man becomes unquestionable over the distance of the fight. Sometimes it comes down to a single failure or minuscule advantage, sometimes it comes down to who wants it more. The better fighter does not always win, but he usually does.

  Conflict is the central pillar of prose. Combat is often a central pillar of serial fantasy and serial fiction more generally. Fighting is ingrained in our DNA, in our morphology. Every culture I've encountered has an indigenous form of combat, often some form of wrestling or open rules fighting. Don't ignore the rich history and wealth of evidence at your fingertips. There is no substitute for experience, so don't workout montage or powerlevel your characters, especially in rational or rational-adjacent fiction.

  **Rant Over**

    This also bothers me a lot. I'd like to add that there is some knowledge of weapon and armor based combat available and we have surviving manuscripts from the middle ages and ahead that do a decent job at explaining how they fought and how optimized things were. 

    &#x200B;

    Experimental archaeology, HEMA, certain eastern surviving weapon based martial art practices, we also have a lot of renaissance era military level swordsmanship manuals, soldier memoirs..

    &#x200B;

    We don't know what is the best because things change based on the period, their technology, armors and weapons used etc. But we can tell how people fought for the most part with reasonable accuracy specially for the later periods.

    I'll link a feel youtube channels that are relevant and enjoyable:

    I suppose what I would add is that people shouldn't use MMA fights as a template for how the fight would *look*, just how fighters look as they skill up and some insight into fighting techniques that you might not have thought of if you didn't think about it (before Royce Gracie did people think the ground game mattered? idk.)

    Like, I've been a fan for about 5 years now, and as entertaining and skillful as fights are, and as much as I LOVE grappling, it's... not realistic. It's as close as you can probably get to realistic while still having a sport that isn't waiting for someone to die, but MMA fighters are not literally trying to kill each other. A lot of the time they even *like* each other. They aren't allowed to fish hook, low blows, soccer kicks, grab clothing, use weapons, leave the confines of the cage, spend too much time trying to wear someone down without advancing position, spike people onto their heads, hit the kidneys, hit the back of the head, fine joint manipulation, headbutts, scratch, bite, poke eyes (unless you're jon jones amirite) etc. Those are all banned, essentially, *because they are very good strategies if you want to injure your opponent*, and that's what people would be doing in realitic. 

    Also, so many great MMA fighters are women so I just want to point that out as you've applied male pronouns pretty liberally. Nunes in particular, I love her. However I think the Rousey Holm fight is probably instructional about fighting with hubris, or something: maybe watch Rousey Tate II and then Housey Holm for a bit of contrast.
    ```

    - u/Dent7777:
      ```
      I'm probably Amanda Nunes' #1 fan, so the male pronouns are just because I am writing from my own perspective.

      I agree that MMA is not the be all end all for what fights should look like, but I do believe that they are a really good approximation, especially when you take early luta livre and Pancrase matches into account. There, you can see how headbutts, grounded kicks and knees, roundless fights, and more. There were matches where low blows were allowed in the old days, and standing headbutts are legal in lethwai. There are plenty of instances of illegal strikes you've mentioned being used to great effect, but with their illegality it is hard for fighters other than Jon to make them part of their regular game plan.

      With that being said, I think historic training methods likely had rules as well, even if actual combat did not. I think MMA is a framework through which you can view other forms of training and combat.

      In MMA, we've seen the value of innovation, specialization, well-roundedness, strategy, tactics, psychological warfare, and many other facets of combat. Even if the specifics don't apply to every situation, the story does.

      The very early days of UFC are worth checking out, there really were very few rules back then. It's probably the closest you can get to televised real fights between skilled fighters.

      Also, Royce Gracie really did revolutionize everyone's idea of fighting in UFC 1, it's fascinating to watch just for that alone.

      [Filtration](https://www.glowfic.com/posts/575?per_page=100) is I believe the oldest Daevinity story, and the only one I can recall that's entirely contained *in Daevinity*. Daevas are just so much more interesting to strand in other universes and [watch the fireworks](https://www.glowfic.com/posts/325?per_page=100).

      Mind you, past the inital wariness it's very much a saccharine wish-fulfilment story. Part of the [Incandescence](https://www.glowfic.com/boards/44) continuity, and therefore falling prey to the [glowfic pattern](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bxvocf/d_friday_open_thread/eqf6cqn/), so remember you're allowed to drop it when you get bored.

      &nbsp;

      [twilight of the idols, baby](https://www.glowfic.com/posts/153?per_page=100) has a daeva summoned into a sci-fi variant of the Silmarillion. The Silmarillion has Melkor and Sauron in it - *high-tech* Melkor and Sauron - so, not so much with the saccharine wish-fulfilment.

      I know a couple of other cool Daevinity stories - even some where Cam isn't the protagonist! - but they're super deep into their respective continuities, can't get to them without a ton of glowfic context.

  Ive decided to get into audio narration. I know quite a bit of this community does podcasts. Does anyone have recommendations for microphones to record with?

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    I've got a Blue Yeti and while it is a good value mic, it may not necessarily be the best choice for audio narration. If your environment is a little loud, it will pick up a lot of things other than your voice.

    Honestly, the room or environment where you record is more important than the quality of your mic, 9 times out of 10.

    [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoiceActing/comments/8iw0pf/would_a_usb_mic_be_good_for_doing_voice_acting_as/dyvabqa/) recommends a setup.

    For a whopping £14 off Amazon, the Neewer NW-7000 is probably the best bang for your buck. Voice recording gets into very marginal gains very quickly. I don't use it much, and certainly not for anything professional, but I have no concerns with it when I do. I use some light EQ mostly calibrated by ear, and after some noise reduction to remove the sound of the computer fans I honestly would struggle to tell the difference with a professional setup.

    How much you want to spend is more determined by how much you're willing to spend for finish, rather than some price floor you have to hop over. It's not at all like headphones or speakers where £14 mostly gets you garbage.
    ```

    - u/SkyTroupe:

      Im just using it to casually record for my own pleasure so $20 is perfect. If I end up getting real into it I can start doing more later.

        > Do you mean equalizing by EQ?

        Yes.

        To be precise, [this is the curve I use](https://i.imgur.com/e6TVcEO.png). All of 300Hz-3kHz is already pretty flat and it's only the lows and highs that need a greater nudge, so without equalization it sounds a bit sharp, though still presentable. This is also to personal taste for my voice, and might not reflect the mic itself too exactly.

  Can anyone help me with a time travel story?

  You have successfully invented a time travel device. Congratulations!

  However, the question you need to answer is when you go back in time, there are two possibilities. Are you creating a new timeline as if it's a fork where the two branches correspond to the original and new timelines, or are you overwriting the old timeline with a different one? One allows for an infinite number of timelines and the other only allows for one timeline.

  The issue is resolved if you can send back objects to the past. If you are only receiving objects/messages from the future, then you know that there is only one timeline because otherwise you wouldn't exist to remember anything being sent back to the past. On the other hand, if you remember sending something back to the past, then you know that multiple timelines exist and that you are unluckily in the branch of the original timeline (actually it's still possible to only receive things from the future if there are multiple timelines, it's just that it only happens in the 'final branch' where no one ever time travels ever again).

  My issue is, what if you can not send anything to the past, and that you can only send yourself directly when time traveling. Both methods of time travel seem as if they look identical from the perspective of the time traveler and I can't think of a test for you to distinguish between the two types of time travel after time traveling.
  ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    The only method I can think of is to identify what mechanisms are allowing for the time travel. Since we usually take the existence of time travel as an axiom for our setting, we can't use this trick, but if I were ever in this situation in the real world I would analyse how the mechanisms for time travel evolve from other mechanics. Unfortunately a dissatisfying answer.
    ```

  - u/onestojan:
    ```
    > Are you creating a new timeline as if it's a fork where the two branches correspond to the original and new timelines, or are you overwriting the old timeline with a different one?

    Send yourself something (bury a ring) and "the lack of something" (steal the family jewels) to the future. More dangerously you can use the "[grandfather paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_paradox)" (without killing the grandfather) and slightly alter a family event:

    > Despite its title, the grandfather paradox does not exclusively regard the contradiction of killing one's own grandfather to prevent one's birth. Rather, the paradox regards any action that alters the past, since there is a contradiction whenever the past becomes different from the way it was.

    When you go "back to the future", you will have your answer. If the ring is there and the family jewels are missing you are overwriting the timeline. If not you are creating a new timeline.

    Looking forward to your story!

    Edit: small correction

  Some hot takes on media criticism:

  * There are no "apple to oranges" comparisons: you can compare anything to anything else and people do it all time. Maybe you’ll decide not to watch Stranger Things tomorrow but to play Dark Souls instead. Just because one has a completely different aspect to it (gameplay) doesn't mean that you can't compare its other aspects or even the whole work to the other one and find one better as a whole. It applies outside of art too: just about everyone thinks it's ok if you think going out with friends is better than watching the latest GOT season. If you agree with *that* and then you can't say comparing books to films or action movies to drama movies is not valid. Not saying every kind of comparison is valid (e.g. you can't fault GOT for not having enough gameplay) but you can always compare how much you enjoyed each experience or whether something is better to spend your time with.


  * There is a hierarchy of mediums from best to worst roughly: books, tv shows, films, anime, video games, comic books. While you can find works from any medium that are better that others in any other medium it’s difficult to find as many great works in the lower tier mediums than in the higher tier mediums. And no Sturgeon's law doesn't work; the standards for what video game or comic book fans consider as a great story are a lot lower than what book or film fans do. I believe this is related to the barriers of entry to the medium (lower is always better), to the demographics that each medium attracts and the industry monopolies that have captured each medium.

    - u/AmeteurOpinions:
      ```
      I agree that anime is pretty low, but I wouldn’t quite put it at the bottom. It’s badness is mostly due to strange factors of Japanese markets and production committees. However, when we’re talking about the capabilities of different art forms, anime has incredible potential *in theory* because you can communicate very unrealistic ideas and scenes without millions of dollars of CGI and it will look *good*. Textual prose can do this too, but it’s totally dependent on the reader’s capacity for imagination and many people don’t have much at all.

      I disagree that VR is the final art form. It was thinking about arts a thousand years from now, you’d have VR, the future version of tabletop role-playing games, and some kind of comic that perfectly uses images where images are optimal and prose where prose is optimal, but still has no sense of time of its own, unlike the first two.
      ```

    - u/Hypervisor:
      ```
      To be clear, my hierarchy is on how many great works each medium has not on how high or low are the standards that its fans have. I would agree with that anime fans have lower standards than gamers.

      That said, I still think anime has a bigger amount of great stories than (single-player story-driven) games. Video game stories have characters and plots that are little or no better than your average Hollywood action movie (but on tv-series-like length) and their worldbuilding has no ounce of originality in it, always aping the most popular sci-fi and (especially) fantasy tropes. Meanwhile, while most anime do promote their terrible clichés they very often try making unique worlds and systems (with the best of them succeeding) and while most characters are full of melodrama or edginess the best ones turn out to be realistic while video games only know how to write 'action movie heroes'.

      I guess for me it mostly comes down to this: if I am in the mood for good gameplay I will find a non-story-driven video game to play because those tend to have the best gameplay. Whereas if I am in the mood for a good story I see little that story-driven video games offer that other mediums don't do better. I can see why one would want to avoid anime. But if you are looking for SFF and/or action in an audiovisual medium I don't think there aren't many options outside of anime.
