  Got tired of waiting for Fanfiction.net to get their act together, so I posted it over on GreenDogPress, my vanity publishing shop which I really need to get set up with its domain name and a nicer theme with better organization.

  Offtopic:  If anyone else has original fiction that they would like to sell, I'm happy to host it on GDP.  No charge, no commission, just trying to make people's life easy.  You'll just need to get yourself a way to take payment and do delivery -- I suggest signing up for SendOwl and Stripe, but it's up to you.

  EDIT:  "Read the excerpt" in this case actually means "read the rest of the chapter"

    Uhm, why exactly is it a green dog and not any other color?
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      It's not any other color because it's green.  It's green because it reflects light waves that have a wavelength of roughly 510 nanometers.

  Between this and The Waves Arisen, Worm, and Ra I'm starting to feel like this is /r/crapsackworlds. This has generally been lighter than the others, but geez.

    Does it help if I say "Hints of Dawn" is code for "hey look, things are starting to get slightly better"?  :>

    In seriousness, I've done enough kicking the cutie to establish my cred, it's time for new stuff, some of which will be making the world better.  Which doesn't mean bad things won't continue to happen, of course.

    Well, how can you best show off your rational skills in a Utopia? The worse off a world is, the more impressive it is when you manage to improve (read: optimize) it.

  Holy shit. I didn't realize how insanely effective dust of sneezing and choking is on high level characters. Even if you save, you still suck for 5d4 rounds.

    Yep. It's about the only way to quickly take down someone who's been through the FLEA.  At least, the only way I'm aware of. FLEA-graduates will make every save on a 2 or better (1 is an auto fail) so anything that allows a save doesn't work on them. 

    Of course, it's a guaranteed takedown against *anyone* and it's a lot quieter than a sword fight, so I figure it works well for the way drow would fight. Especially if combined with a Silence spell.

  I just realized something, couldn't Suze just admit to the authorities that she was the one that commited the murder at the FLEA a few chapters back and that Ellen had nothing to do with it. She is death afterall it's not like they can just arrest her, plus she could just resurrect the she killed. You'd think two people with enhanced intelligence could have come up with something so simple.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    There's a few reasons that didn't happen:

    * At the time, Ellen wasn't enhanced
    * Suze has been too busy going crazy and starving to death to think about things like that.  
    * Suze doesn't actually know that Ellen is a fugitive from Flobovian justice.
    * [Ellen ](#s "knows that there is something weird about her fugitive status -- how did the Justiciars know her name?  Why did they go to such efforts to capture her?  Who were those five high-level adventurers who came to capture her and April?  She doesn't want to go anywhere near that situation.")
    ```

    - u/bulls55:
      ```
      Those reasons make sense but it doesn't change the fact how odd it was that during their third meeting and going through the FLEA and being taken to the drow caverns Ellen didn't even once think to go "hey Suze since you're here would you mind clearing my name since you personally know the emperor of Flobovia and are the one that actually commited the crime I am being charged with". The idea is simple enough that a non enhanced person could have thought about it and going through the FLEA her wisdom and intelligence she should have been smart enough to realize it would have made things easier in the long run even if she didn't plan on going back to Flobovia.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Ellen isn't worrying about getting her name cleared right now because (a) she's got much bigger problems and (b) she knows that there's something weird about her legal problems and just wants to stay away from them until things calm down a bit.
        ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    I seem to recall a hint somewhere that the authorities are not looking for Suze because of that murder but rather for some other reason. Maybe Jake is trying to find/help her?
    ```
