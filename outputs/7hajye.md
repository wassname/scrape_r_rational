  I'm starting to get back on track, huzah! 

  ~~This is actually one of those chapters that I wrote ages ago, I think even before chapters 1-5, but which I edited over a dozen times. You can still tell the style is more anime-esque though, with countless perspective-jumps, even after I deleted several segments. Sometimes I think it would have been better to just throw out these old chapters and write them again from scratch, as I'm worried that they feel too chaotic and disjointed right now in a way I can't easily fix.~~ 

  NEVERMIND I CLEARLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LIKE. I'LL JUST SHUT UP NOW.

  Amazing.
  At first I was confused about Naruto's stance but the chapter finally made it clear to me that he refutes both Neji's and Lee's.
  Also that moment at the end, mysterious dark side confirmed

  Support ninja kind of get shafted by the tournament fighting setup, don't they? Sakura, for example, is a medic, who can also use some water jutsu and genjutsu if she's forced to fight, along with basic throwing weapons and such. On a team with Sasuke and Naruto, she's a fantastic asset, as she can act as a force multiplier by healing and using general battlefield control. Similarly with Ino and her clan jutsu. But in a one on one fight, a majority of their skills are either useless or nearly so. Sakura vs Sasuke or Lee is a joke, even when Sakura has a skill set much more suited to what ninja do as their role.  Any medic that is even more specialized for support is even more screwed, because the tournament style test makes their abilities irrelevant.

  It's not really as relevant, but Temari is kind of the same. Her ability to control a battlefield is insane, she can deflect any number of brown weapons, and she generally forces every ninja that isn't allied with her in a large fight to keep what she can do in mind. That she is rather specialized is mostly irrelevant because Kankuro can have puppets to defend her while she forces enemies to get behind cover. She lost against Shikamaru in canon because one on one is a terrible use for her skill set.



  Also, what is up with team Guy? You have 2 melee specialists, and instead of rounding that out with a medic or ninjutsu specialist, they throw in the most limited range specialist available? If any of them gets injured on a mission, they're just *fucked*. Similarly if they have to fight someone like Temari or Gaara who focus on aoe ninjutsu, as seen by Lee vs Gaara. They're overspecialized, extremely so.

    We know from canon that even though support ninja are heavily disadvantaged, whoever handles promotions does keep that in mind, since Shikamaru was raised to Chuunin. 

    Or of course, it doesn't really matter in the greater scheme of things. Naruto and Sasuke were technically Genin until the very end IIRC...
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:

      Shikamaru is decent in single combat. Not great, and it's not his specialty, but his shadow is flexible enough and he's clever enough to make it work. He still shows his skills even if he loses. Medics don't, and controlling the battlefield is difficult when there is essentially no terrain to speak of, and only two contestants.

      Basically, the tournament should be team vs team combat, because that's what ninja actually do as their job.

      Presumably ranks mean *something* when you aren't the main characters. Otherwise why would people risk death or severe injury for the chance of promotion?

  YES! YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!

  I've been following this fic for a while (maybe you remember some of my early comments), and the entire time my main gripe with it was that, even though the writing style, world-building, and characterisation was excellent, Naruto didn't feel smart enough to be the protagonist of a rational fic. Either he was being overshadowed by Sakura's keen analytical mind and epic memory, or Sasuke's own genius; to me, the Naruto shown earlier in this fic just didn't seem clever enough to be the protagonist, an honor that I thought Sakura deserved more.

  But this chapter... man this chapter was awesome. It was like it took all my gripes about Naruto and shoved them back at me in a climax of tricks and tactics. You managed to take one of Naruto's core personality traits from the first series, his unpredictability, and make it rational. You've managed to justify why Naruto is the main character.

  Sakura may be able to better analyze and dissect the techniques of her opponents, and Sasuke may be more skilled. But Naruto will do stuff that's new. Naruto will invent new techniques, or re-purpose old ones; Naruto will trick his opponents, not just beat them, and earn his name as Konoha's Number One Most Unpredictable Ninja through wit and guile. I like it. I like it a lot.

  And even my critique about Naruto not seeming clever has been answered. Naruto is Naruto; his first instinct isn't to be tricky, or witty, but nice. Naruto wouldn't be Naruto if he wasn't always trying to be nice. And because of that people underestimate him. But here's he's shown that Good is Not Stupid, and I can't wait to see how the other characters react to what I think has definitely been the most straight-up in-universe demonstration of Naruo's intelligence since the fic began. 

  All in all, keep up the good work!

    I agree with your main points regarding the demonstration of Naruto's intelligence but I am not sure what you are talking about regarding him showing "Good is not Stupid". This seemed more like an overpowered prodigy using the darkest elements of manipulation against a comrade to secure victory in a conflict that is ultimately insignificant.

    The willingness of Naruto to mock the accomplishments of a respected Jounin and the hard work of a peer in order to prove some kind of point seems more like an indicator that Naruto is not a good person rather than that he is an intelligent good person who is not nice.

    I think that Naruto's drive to humiliate and crush the drive of Lee in this fanfic is a mirror of his drive to support Lee and defeat Neji in Canon. In Canon Naruto supported Lee and opposed the determinism of Neji as he considered himself to be similar to Lee in that he was a hard working underdog who was competing with prodigies. In this Fanfic the exact opposite is true as Naruto considers himself to be a unrecognized Genius and is offended by the fact that his peers who work harder than him are held in higher esteem. This seems most demonstrated in the Naruto-Sasuke dynamic but I believe hints of it are seen throughout the fanfic.

    Naruto's behavior to me in this fight seems less like a desire to educate and more an expression of his inner demons. His disrespect for his peer and superior are ultimately driven by desire to be recognized as  special due to his position of a unique intelligence and perspective directly conflicts with Lee's strident support for the power of hard work.

      woah that is actually a pretty concise and analytical character interpretation. I'm going to have to reread the fic and think about that some more.

      Maybe my previous experience with Naruto has colored my view, making me assume things that aren't actually shown, but does Naruto not work hard in this fic? I read this chapter after having not looked at the fic during its long hiatus and, honestly, after having stopped reading it a while before that, so I may have forgotten. Is this Naruto just talented, rather than the hardworker he is in canon? I mean from this chapter and, what I can remember, this Naruto is always thinking about how to get ahead/thinking of new ideas for techniques or seals, and he seems pretty good at seals. Is he just talented at seals/techniques, or has he actually put in a serious amount of time studying? I do remember him going over to Sakura's for help studying way back in the first chapter, and thinking about how Haku could use his powers of teleportation for good back in Wave, but that's all.

      But even so, I have to dispute that in this fic Naruto is not a good person. Maybe it's because it's one of the first scenes I really liked in this fic, but in the Wave Arc he was very, very upset about how he lived in a world where people could do things like teleport and raise massive stone walls instantly, and yet people only seemed to use those powers for killing rather than using them in the hundreds of mundane ways that could do a lot to improve the world. This Naruto still seems to have retained canon Naruto's innate desire for peace, so I would argue that he is still a good person.

      And like he said in this chapter, he didn't actually believe anything he told Lee about his teammates, or Gai (he only really believed his spiel about accepting reality in order to overcome it; the one belief I think every rational protagonist has by default). He was just trying to goad Lee into doing something stupid. 

      And here lies what I think is the first true divergence of this Naruto from canon Naruto (except for the fact that this Naruto lives in a rational universe and so is smarter and was raised differently). This Naruto is still the same good person, with the same goals at heart (and I would argue still works hard; all of those tricks and new techniques and tactics don't come from nowhere; sitting down and thinking for an hour may not look as strenuous as doing push ups for the same amount of time, but it's still hard work), but has started to give up on being nice, and just started focusing on winning. And we can see this in the chapter. Naruto watched a bunch of fights were the blatant unfairness of what was going on made him feel ill and angry; even protesting about how such fights could be a valid demonstration of skill. And then proceeded to fight Lee in the most unfair way possible, by hiding underground and totally removing Lee's skill from the equation, all in order to win.

      So while I would argue that Naruto at this point is still a good person, but I do agree that your ideas have a lot of merit. The way this is going, and the way this fic is progressing, could eventually lead to Naruto not being a good person. He's a clever kid with big dreams who wants to become stronger, likes inventing new techniques, and wants recognition; this is the first fic (except for Like Me) that could actually sell Naruto as the next Orichimaru and have me genuinely believe it. He's willing to humilate Lee (even I still believe he didn't truly believe what he was sayig) just to win a Chunnin Exam preliminary fight; already he's starting to slip away from Canon Naruto's morals. What he'd be willing to rationalize himself into doing in a real fight, with real stakes (like in the Invasion, if that happens in this fic), could be a big turning point in his character. 

      So essentially, I disagree with Naruto not being hardworking and not being a good person, but do think that with the way he's behaving he could quickly become a sort of Orochimaru-esque anti-hero obsessed with The Need to Become Stronger.

      >person who is not nice.

      It is a fight. You get all the advantages you can. You can be nice outside of fights.

        So if you are debating a fellow student in front of your school it would be okay to start insulting their parents and mocking them for their dyslexia? Would it okay for one soldier sparring with another in a exhibition match before their shared community and superior officers to mock the military career and service of his opponents mentor?

        Lee is a ninja of Konoha and a comrade to Naruto. The fact that he is currently competing with Naruto does not change that. A certain minimum standard of behavior should always be maintained. The idea that anything is acceptable in the pursuit of victory is counter to the underpinnings of any civilized society but is particularly opposed to the ideology of Kakashi and his belief that "Those that would disregard their comrades so easily are even worse than trash. And those who don't have the decency to respect the memories of their comrades are the worst."
        ```

          Random debate and an actual bloody ninja fight that might give you a promotion are a bit different. Not to mention that we are kinda made to understand it's not usual to get promoted outside that.

          If you are able to win by psychological warfare, that is just probability for the promotion.

          How do we define a civilized society? They are child soldiers.
          ```

  I really can't wait to see what justifications the author comes up with for why "Madara" doesn't just teleport in to Konoha (Like he did in the prologue), take Kakashi's eye and using said OP abilities to kidnap Naruto and the other Jinchuriki. 

  Edit:He could solve the plot in less than 10 minutes. 

  He already awakened his Mangekyo. He already has Hashirama's cells. As soon as he would take back the eye he would manifest his own Rinnegan. Then he doesn't need Pain or the Akatsuki at all. 

  Yeah, I really wanna see how you handle this one author.

    There is, in fact, a really easy solution to that problem.
