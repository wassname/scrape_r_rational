## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  What are some rational works that are high quality, but have an [audience-alienating premise](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceAlienatingPremise) or a lot of [values dissonance](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ValuesDissonance) with general audiences here?

    I'm not sure what you're going for, but my 140,000 word gay vampire romance novel might fit this as many people didn't care to give it a chance due to the subject matter. Just the premise, though, not values dissonance.

      About eight years ago, I beta read ~100,000 words of romance between a Nazi trans woman cyborg and a trapdoor-spider like molluscoid alien. That's more or less what comes to mind when I think of higher quality writing with an audience-alienating premise. 

      It's no longer online and it wasn't smut, actually.

          Just read it because I like both vampires and want to read more gay fiction. Well written and nice world building, but I suspect there's something just fundamentally very incompatible between the romance and rational genres.

          Also very alien relationship IMO. As a gay male could not relate in the slightest lol. Now I get what people mean when they complain about male writers not writing proper female characters...

            Oh, that's interesting. I'd love some more specific feedback to help me in the future! Regardless, I am glad to help people understand that as bad female characters bother me.

            >  I suspect there's something just fundamentally very incompatible between the romance and rational genres.

            I wrote it as a rational story, so I'd be keen to know why you thought it was incompatible. I wrote all the characters as coming from genuine, consistent points of view, having a fundamental values conflict which is addressed through people learning and changing their minds, and to have the people involved undergo character development more generally. I included blue and orange morality / unaligned AI analogue. I'd love to know what didn't hit!

              >Oh, that's interesting. I'd love some more specific feedback to help me in the future! Regardless, I am glad to help people understand that as bad female characters bother me.

              Part of it is I think subtle and I can't really describe. But part of it is more crude, there's just a lot of hair touching and lip docking and no/little timeskipped sex.

              >I wrote it as a rational story, so I'd be keen to know why you thought it was incompatible.

              I agree you included all those, but IMO it doesn't match the characteristics on the sidebar at all. Red I think is particularly bad at all of it. He is not intelligent, he doesn't have any goals nor motives beyond "I love my bf", no consistent morality at all (he freaks out about gargoyle slavery but doesn't care about humans beign murdered?!), and doesn't improve in the slightest. I guess William is slightly better but again there's no real reason for him having an abrupt change of mind beyond "I love my bf". 

              Which is all infuriating from a rational story standpoint but I think is the whole point of romance? I think romance is all about characters parting ways/getting back together because *feelings*.

    [The Last Sovereign](https://the-last-sovereign.blogspot.com/) is a harem building H-RPG made in RPGMaker with non-consent elements baked into its premise. Pretty much any one of those would turn away a good chunk of people, so to call it "audience alienating" is putting it mildly.

    ... It's also one of the most rational RPGs I've ever played.

    The story is about a tired widower whose continent is being slowly but inexorably conquered by a powerful and perverted (h-game, remember) overlord who is powerful enough that he'd have won long ago if he wasn't insane and easily distracted. After spending years training and escorting a succession of arrogant, entitled "chosen ones", he becomes infected by power of the same nature as the overlord he's been fighting. Seeing no other way to save his homeland, he resolves to embrace the power, even knowing that it will make him a pariah if it is ever discovered.

    What makes it rational (despite the very irrational setting) is a strong focus on making sensible, practical decisions rather than flashy displays of strength. There is also a very strong focus on "soft" powers such as economic or political. The game does a fantastic job intertwining them into the plot.

    The writing is incredibly solid. Not so much "quotable" as very well put together, with memorable story beats and a way of intertwining a complex world.

    For anyone in this sub who can get past the dealbreakers listed above, this is a game that definitely needs to be played.

    You might try Seth Dickinson’s Baru Cormorant books. I found those very high quality but also incredibly difficult reading: over and over again the character has to make decisions in situations where only bad outcomes are available.

    I will also mention that Inhabited Island got a new translation over the pandemic, based on an uncensored version of the book, and the translation is rather good.

    Edit: thinking about it more, but I raise these works because they are very well crafted, but very uncomfortable reading for me personally; but it is less clear what an audience-alienating premise or values dissonance for this group might look like in general. What values might we, as a group, generally hold that a work might rationally present the counter of? Not the low hanging fruit of cultural taboos, which are in any case never as universal as they feel from inside the culture, nor do they stay unchanged for very long at a time; what is there that is specific to us?

    Perhaps intellectual honesty and intelligence as a virtue might be one set of such. “Definitely Maybe” might be a work to explore here. Defence of a finite lifespan ending in death might be another; I can’t name a relevant work here, but I have one on the tip of my tongue - I will come back and edit once I have access to my bookshelves again (am travelling for the next few days). 

    What else can people name?

  I'm looking for fiction that features extremely long-lived characters.

  I've recently read "The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August" (which I very much recommend), and there's just something about main characters living far longer than the norm that grips me. Now in that book it's a time-loop sorta (?) deal, but it doesn't have to be that way.

  * Bonus points if the plot, characters and worldbuilding is rational or rational-adjacent.
  * Bonus points if the story takes place over a long time, like centuries or even millenia.

  But the most important part is that the main character (or at least a character that appears a lot) is old. Very old, with perspectives very different from the average person. One way or the other.

  I know that this is a very particular request, and that there's probably not a lot out there that matches what I'm looking for. But hey, maybe someone here knows something that fits the bill.

  Have a nice week, everyone :)

    In decreasing fittingness:

    [A song for Two Voices](https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480), by Swimmer963, is a rational fic that fits this definition. It's a fanfic for the Valdemar series, but I had not read that ahead of time and was still perfectly able to follow along. It features several very old characters in the main cast, most notable Leareth, who is a millennia old mage and >!eventual Deuteragonist!<. However, it does not take place over centuries.

    Good Omens by Terry Pratchett and Niel Gaiman is not rational, but both authors tend to be popular among the rational crowd and is excellently written. It is spread across 6 millennia, but in fairness the majority of the words take place on the scale of decades. Both of the two main characters are immortal and very old.

    Much of Tolkien's Legendarium delights in these characters, but it's especially notable in [The Silmarillion](https://ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__the_silmarillion__en.htm). Tolkien is a slow paced writer, and some have said the silmarillion can thus drag at points, but he makes up for it IMO by being legitimately incredibly talented as a writer. It is explicitly not rational, but takes place over millenia and has not just an old character but a great many.

    If that's an interesting premise but the writing isn't your speed, [At the end of All Things](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3451040/chapters/7569143)by Lintamande is a rational Fanfic thereof. It's still quite well written, but unfortunately is largely dead as a single story and is only continued as Glowfic, for which ymmv.

    Taking a step further on,

    [Now you Feel Like Number None](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/) by Omicron has some phenomenally done old characters, but while the main character is objectively rather old they didn't give the same impression of it that some of the others did. It is well written, but is not rational and does not take place over centuries.

    [Speak of the Devil](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/speak-of-the-devil-cross-post-vertigo-pmmm-rebellion.42/) is a bit of an edge case, as the main character is themselves old but pretty much the entire rest of the cast is not. Its source material on the DC side does have more of this if you enjoy it and is significantly above average quality for DC, but isn't solely about it.

    The passages in the void series takes places over millions of years, is from the POV of space probes terraforming planets and whatnot. I think you might enjoy it. Unfortunately, it's not terribly long, about 40,000 words all up IIRC, and divided into 5-10 short stories. 

    http://localroger.com/ for a landing page, first story is here: http://localroger.com/k5host/pitv.html or kindle version of the "main 3" is here: https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Passage-Trilogy-epic-stories-ebook/dp/B00OEB1GM2/

    In terms of rational, idk, but it's very scientifically accurate, nothing even close to light speed travel. It was written as an  answer to "if the rare earth hypothesis is true, isn't sci-fi dead?", so the central conceit is that earth is the only planet in the galaxy that developed life

    ----

    Dragon's Egg might also count: it's a first contact book between humans  and aliens, but the aliens life span is much shorter than the humans (an alien lifetime is about 15 minutes). So the humans become ancient, long-lived people as alien lives spring into being and die like fireworks. The aliens live on a neutron star and the book was written by a neutron star physicist, so again, very hard sci-fi. Rationality less-so, though I don't think I've read it since I got into ratfic.

    A journey of red and black is good: https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red

    It's a vampire novel, but reimagined (and without sparkles). The humor can be a little off sometimes. But the characters are good, but very different morality-wise, and sometimes have instincts or compulsions that override their rational mind. Not sure if it's entirely "rational", but it's good and interesting nonetheless. Takes place over a long period of time. Very good world-building.

  Been reading some manga recently, so I thought I'd recommend the best ones I've found so far.

  **Ookami to Koushinryou(Spice and Wolf)**A manga about a merchant who meets a wolf goddess, who helps him with his merchant-ing. Already been recommended here before, actually describes some interesting economic concepts, and has somewhat interesting worldbuilding, although I felt the romance was a little off. Recommended.

  **Oshi no Ko(My Star?)**A manga that takes a surprisingly deep dive into the Japanese entertainment industry. It's got a very interesting premise that helps develop the story, and I'd say the main character is fairly rational. Recommended.

  **I'm Standing on a Million Lives**I thought this manga was average isekai trash. The interesting mechanics of it kept me there, and I'm glad that I did, because after the third quest, the story really picks up. The realism that is shown in the manga was shockingly good, and it does not fall into the usual tropes of harem, bad romance, and OP protagonists. The protagonist is not exactly rational, but he makes intelligent decisions, and while his value system can be somewhat annoying, it doesn't come up so often that it should bother you. Highly recommended.

  **Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryokou(Girl's Last Tour)**A ... heartwarmingly depressing manga about two girls trekking through an urban Escher-like dystopia. The banter between the two girls is fun, and the lack of information about how they came to be in the situation they're in draws you in. Overall their decisions are sensible, and they don't really hold the idiot ball for longer than a couple moments. The implementation of the story is pretty unique, and well done in my opinion. Highly recommended.

  **Yugami-kun ni wa Tomodachi gai Inai(Yugami-kun has no Friends)**Slice of life manga about a successfully anti-social protagonist. The whole cast are actual people, and most characters make decisions that make sense from their point of view. The story is told through his new classmate, and is ... satisfying. If you like slice of life manga and want to read one that is a better done than the rest, this is for you. Conditionally recommended.

  I'm interested in knowing how many people on r/rational read manga. I have a list of manga that aren't quite rational that I'd be happy to share.

  &#x200B;

  EDIT: Welp I was planning on releasing this once I'd added tags and a recommendation system like Sprague Grundy did, but I guess I'll get some early feedback.  
  Here's my mostly-complete list of recommendations across all forms:

    Go read Mizukami's work. Hoshi no Samidare, Spirit Circle or Sengoku Youko to start. All worth your time.

    Edit: I got my hands on some of I'm Standing, and I noticed some things that reminded me of Mizukami's Hoshi no Samidare (Also known as The Little Devil and the Biscuit Hammer). Turns out the author of I'm Standing considers it his second favorite manga and was going out of his way to use it as a reference.

    Edit2: Finished reading all I had available of I'm Standing on a Million Lives. It's definitely a fun read. It's a more interesting take on Psyren's premise (it's an direct inspiration I think), with the idea of being conscripted to interfere with events in a different world by a time traveler. This time it's a fantasy world, not the apocalyptic future full of psychic monsters. It manages to be a lot more grounded than Psyren, despite this.

    The manga's "missions" in the fantasy world are always thinly-veiled allegories to real world situations, to the point the characters notice and comment on it. The author holds back from preaching their personal ideology, and the protagonist character is kind of a douchebag (with some pretty good moments peppered in, always by the hand of someone else) so it doesn't feel masturbatory.

    The emotional cuts aren't clean, unlike Mizukami's work. The author fumbles quite a bit with how to make the reader feel immersed in the emotional lives of the characters. Sometimes characters fail to develop because they spend an entire mission out of commission (likely to reduce the cast size and maintain some focus as the cast grows). Characters act intelligently, but they're not really super rational and sometimes the bad guys are defeated via the idiot ball. It's not the perfect story, but it's pretty good.

  Anyone have anything that’s set in an “old” setting? 

  It could be any genre, but I just love settings with a lot of history and weight to them. One of my favorite books [Against A Dark Background](https://www.amazon.com/Against-Dark-Background-Iain-Banks/dp/0316036374) is set in this kind of solar system, that has almost 10000 years of recorded history. 

  Another work, this one more recent is set in a universe with “1 million years” of history [The Eternal Seeker Saga](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50278/the-eternal-seeker-saga)

    It's a game, but Breath of the Wild is an astonishingly great example of this.

    Tolkiens works are almost all good at this,but you can especially strongly feel it if you go through LotR after the Silmarillion, reread or otherwise.

    [An Undertow of Sand](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/an-undertow-of-sand-percy-jackson-and-the-cthulhu-mythos.90629/) is a Percy Jackson / Cthulhu mythos cross that does a good job of this. Leans a bit on exposition to do so but the writing quality is good so it's fine.

    [Of the Stars](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9059345/1/Of-The-Stars) is a Sailor Moon fanfic that does this,but it is unfortunately dead. [Usagi Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/usagi-quest-ck3-princess-maker-sailor-moon.73457/) does so a bit less effectively but is still live.

    40 Millenniums of Cultivation qualifies for this, but with the standard warnings of "this fic kinda sucks for the first 100 chapters before the author decided to take it seriously, just skip those" and "this is a translated work." apply.

    [Legacy of the goddess](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/legacy-of-the-goddess-a-rational-zelda-quest.72138/) is a somewhat worse fit for the request but I decided to include it anyway because it's a ratfic.

    Oh hey, thank you for recommending my story (sort of \^\^) ! I just saw that some people clicked the link in my story's referrer page.

    I would personally recommend The Duchy of Terra novel series from Glynn Stewart. Although most of the Precursor/old history elements only pop up later in the series, when they do they become a major theme. Just beware that the change between each trilogy in the series can be...Jarring, to say the least.

    Other than that some settings have detailed histories and some interesting background, but it is not much more than a few thousand years at most. If that still interests you, then the Safehold series from David Weber might be what you're looking for. It deals with a planet settled by humanity, as a hidden colony from a genocidal alien empire that wiped out Earth and all other human life, and the colony expedition director is an insane luddite that threw humanity back to the middle ages and created a religion engineered to keep an eternal dark age over the planet to prevent the aliens from wiping out humanity for good. The Honor Harrington series from the same author also has some interesting, deep history, unfortunately it is nearly completely irrelevant to the main story until the last few novels, and is mainly supplied through the secondary series and supplementary materials.

    Lastly, for my own story, technically the setting has a much larger time scale than that. Recorded, detailed and reliable historical records in it only go back a million years or so (1.6 million years for the Hyperdimensional Republic, but the first 600 millenia are mostly internal affairs, as the region they were in was pretty damned deserted), but there are many events before that, it's just that the historical records are considerably less reliable. For example scholars know the Terran Empire began its collapse 2.6 million years before the story takes place, but they're not sure of the precise timeline of it. They know the broad strokes, but a lot of data has been lost, and the accounts left of it are contradictory at best, blatant propaganda at worst. Same goes for basically everything they know from the Terran Empire itself, as it extensively rewrote its own historical records for ideological goals, and thus are sometimes even official Terran accounts are of dubious reliability. As for pre-Terran records...There are none. What they have is basically archeological data on an interstellar scale. They know *someone* blew up what appear to be a good quarter of the dimensions in the multiverse around 14 billion years ago (the big bang being essentially humanity's home dimension being blown up and more or less hard reset), but they have no idea who did it, let alone why.

    Sorry if this was rambling a bit. Don't worry, none of what I wrote is spoilers in any way shape or form, just background lore. Still, I hope you'll enjoy my story, and that at least one of my recommendations might strike your fancy. Have a nice day !

  Anything good in the A:TLA or LOK fandoms? I haven’t read anything from them, so anyone with experience there that can rec some good fics would be appreciated. 


  Of course I’m not looking for strictly rational fics, there probably aren’t any. Adjacent, or simply good stories you enjoyed are totally cool. I love interesting worldbuilding just the same as most here.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    There's not a lot of good ones, and none rational. Here's the best of what I've found over the years

    [Embers](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5398503/1/Embers). It's very long, has great writing, Zuku centric, and a ton of creative worldbuilding. However, this must be taken with the caveat that it can't fully decide if it's a For Want of Nail fic or a full AU, and it suffers somewhat for it. Aang especially suffers for this, narratively speaking, although it gets its act together there later on.

    [Somebody that I used Tahno](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/somebody-that-i-used-tahno-a-lok-si-complete.670771/) This one is legend of Korra. I'm not really a fan of the actual series LoK because it repeatedly undertook plots that required the authors to actually know something about politics and it's clear they didn't, but with that out of the way there's actually some good worldbuilding and setting there and this fic takes good advantage of it. Has a currently updating sequel taking place during season 2.

    [The Dragon King's Temple](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple) Crossover with SG1. This fic has no right to work at all, but it does. If you enjoyed Embers, you'll also enjoy this one; if you didn't, you might anyway but there's a decent chance you won't.

    [Beneath the Raptor's Wings](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/beneath-the-raptors-wings-avatar-the-last-airbender-star-trek.738814/) This one is weaker than the previous but still good enough that I don't regret reading it. Crossover with Star Treck.
    ```

      ```
      I second Somebody that I used Tahno, since that's the only one I've read here. It has a pretty abrasive SI protagonist at first, but I really liked how he developed. The dialogue and chemistry with other characters is also well done. The best thing is that the story landed the ending well.

      ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      Seconding Embers, it's one of the greats. I understand some of the criticisms to an extent, and have a few of my own that I don't tend to see elsewhere, but it's better qualities outshine its flaws to a dramatic extent. I haven't been able to fully decide how I'd rank my favorite fanworks, but this is probably Top 5. One of the rare fics where I like the setting and plot more than canon.

    [*The Dragon King’s Temple*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheDragonKingsTemple) is a crossover between A:TLA and Stargate SG-1 which manages to integrate the two different universes surprisingly well. It follows Zuko and Toph as they get stranded with the SG-1 team and everyone has to work together to get them home (with plenty of additional complications, but I don’t want to spoil anything). I’ve reread this fic maybe five times, I enjoy it that much. Knowledge of Stargate helps but is not obligatory; the author does a good job of showing everyone’s characterization without requiring you to already know everything about them.

    [Three Families](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7197056/1/Three-Families) (Complete) Is a very well written AU following three different groups as they pursue the last airbender. I remember being suprised at the quality of writing, especially for the OC characters, and impressed by how natural the AU elements were.

    [In A Darker World](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12572582/1/In-A-Darker-World) (Incomplete) A tastefully done self insert. Interactions with Team Avatar were interesting enough and not beholden to canon railroading. However what I was really drawn in by, was the way the SI navigated the world of Avatar, given their situation.

    [Deep Red](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/deep-red-avatar-the-last-airbender.50358/) (Abandoned) Is a tricky recommendation for me. [Originally a quest](https://fiction.live/stories/Deep-Red/3Qk82fibaeXXuvJXm/home) (interactively written in second person), Deep Red is not only incomplete, but left (presumably indefinitely) at an arguably >!unsatisfying!< conclusion.

  I'm looking for fictions where the main character has superpowers that are very difficult to use in combat, but nevertheless enters combat frequently.

  So I don't want superpowers that are always on like super strength, or activate automatically on death like a time loop. Similarly, superpowers that need a lot of prep work or practice to use correctly, such as vancian magic or controlling large numbers of bugs are out, because even though the superpower is "difficult" overall, it is still "easy" to use in combat afterwards.

  Basically, I'm looking for superpowers that seem "Awesome but Impractical", but the main character somehow makes it work.

    Sylvester from [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) practically specced everything into Social with a little bit of Athletics for climbing. He's perfectly able to predict people's responses and pick up on even their smallest tells during social combat, but when he actually tries to throw down, he usually gets his ass kicked because he overthinks or doesn't react quickly enough. Basically the only reason he's still alive by the story's start are his friends, some of whom are genetically augmented for combat. Together, they form a team of vat kids performing black-ops for a British empire that conquered the worlds with zombie armies.

    Two my hero academia fics might be what you're looking for. 

    OreGairu where the main character can copy 108 superpowers at 108 their strength which functionally makes even the most powerful of quirks all but useless. However after an encounter with All might which lets him store strength in a slow and painful way, he starts to think up clever combinations and push his creativity to the max to be a hero. 

    Juxtapose where Midoriya has the weak ability to vanish 10 grams of matter from anything he touches and uses that power to try and become a hero.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Assuming I'm thinking of the right one, the first fic here is "My hero school adventure is all wrong, as expected." OreGairu is the other source material for the crossover, not the fic itself.

      For the first request, the My Hero Academia spinoff Vigilantes might fit.

In my opinion it's one of the highest quality fics on SpaceBattles. I started reading it with zero prior knowledge of either anime, so I think it stands very well on its own.

      However, I'm not sure it fits the request, since the op specifically said that powers that require prep work don't count. Hikigaya's abilities require a nearly crippling level of prep-work, but after he puts in the time his versatility and creative thinking put him on par with other heroes.

        Yeah I don't think I explained myself well because I'm getting recommended powers that seem weak but can be highly effective when used correctly, which is close but not quite what I'm looking for. 

        I'm looking for powers that are difficult to use in the sense that the activation conditions are difficult to achieve. For example:

        * Powers that fire easily avoidable projectiles, i.e., slow-moving, highly visible, not too many at once. So you have to somehow pin down your enemies to actually hit them.
        * Powers that only activate at specific spatial/temporal coordinates. Like planting landmines. So you have to lure enemies to those coordinates or stall the battle long enough for the power to activate.
        * Powers that require the enemy to take a specific action. Like Shinso from MHA, whose power temporarily brainwashes enemies who verbally respond to him. So you have to manipulate enemies into taking that action.

        I'm sure there are more categories that I'm missing, but essentially I'm looking for powers that you don't simply get to fire at will. Specific things need to happen first, and not just in the sense that you need to put bullets in your gun before battle.
        ```

        - u/sl236:

          Not any sort of fiction at all, but “so you have to manipulate enemies into taking that action” reminded me of https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/5818/waving-hands where one of the potential ways of winning involves manipulating your opponent into casting the instant-lose spell on themselves

    One of my favorite superpowers was the story with the "Dream the previous day" power.
     Every time he slept, he got to redo the previous 24 hours, free to try other things. But this was *not* timetravel, or a do-over, it was simulation/divination, and the only thing he could keep from the dream days was information. 

    Which is super useful, but totally impossible to apply in combat. No previews of the day, no do-overs.

  Last thread [*Wearing Robert's Crown*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11861559/1/Wearing-Robert-s-Crown) was recommended. 

  >The Robert Baratheon who takes the crown in AC 283 is not the man who they expected, nor will he be the king they looked for. Through the eyes of others as the Seven Kingdoms seeks an new balance of power under a new dynasty. (SI).

  It's pretty good, I enjoyed that there were so many POV characters, and it was interesting that the SI didn't actually have a POV, so we're left seeing his actions only by Westerosi characters, who don't know what's coming.

  I also like that the SI isn't a mary sue like we see so often. Their achievements are believable if you imagine an average guy suddenly found themselves in Westeros.

  The characters are quite good, but they don't quite match up with the source material. In some cases this can be attribute to the SI changing the timeline, but I found that for some characters their mannerism weren't quite right, though some were spot on (Stannis for example).

  The author started writing this in 2016, before season 6 of GoT started, so some things aren't the same as in the show (like the White Walkers), but I didn't really have a problem with it. All in all it did feel like ASoIaF.

  The only thing I didn't like is the writing. It was okay, no spelling errors but there were quite a few grammatical errors, mostly because the author didn't use punctuation where they should have.

  Other than that it was a fun read. It hasn't been update since May 11, 2021, but there's enough that you can spend a few days reading it if uplift/SIs are your thing.

    Eden Green by Fiona van Dahland I recommended it as a rational horror fiction. A rational and thoughtful character who is a bit obsessed with order discovers her best friend is dating a man who has discovered a strange spike parasite that can heal anything. They're both excited, thinking they have just discovered a way to change the world and perhaps even immortality. She is more skeptical and starts testing and observing how things work and acts like someone intelligent would if they discovered something magical or otherworldly.

    Where DO the creatures come from? Why does it heal it's host as it has to get something out of it? Why are there such odd physical changes in things that heal? What happens if this gets near someone that has just died? Then things get worse. There is also a sequel that deals with the aftermath and a slightly unmasked world that is also really good.

    Part of the horror is that the main character IS a rationalist and her thought processes are described in great detail for why she does things, how she tests things, and her educated guesses. Which makes things so much worse when she starts investigating and the sheer fridge and actual horror is described in painful detail. Word of warning for monsters, body horror, and philosophical fridge horror.

    I usually recommend [Katalepsis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28023/katalepsis) (already recommended) and [An Imago of Rust and Crimson](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/an-imago-of-rust-and-crimson-worm-crossover.1326/) (a masterfully written worm AU/Crossover that places a big emphasis on supernatural horror).

    But this time I'm also going to suggest [Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus). a Harry Potter "crack" AU. This is a slightly unorthodox recommendation, especially for this audience so I'm not really sure how to sell this, but here are some disclaimers from the first chapter:

    >I suppose if I'm going to label this fic in any sort of genre I'd call it absurdist.  
    >  
    >\[...\]  
    >  
    >This isn't a crack fic. It presents itself as a crack fic, most of the time, but at it's heart it isn't one.

    I'm suggesting this because I think it does existential horror well when it gets around to it. There's a funny sense of dread I get when thinking about this Author's works. A lot of the premises seem like standard fanfiction fare but then things get wild in a way that you could mistake as just crack fics being crack fics but is genuinely disturbing once you're invested in the writing.
    ```

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  It's been recommended here before, but not recently. I highly recommend [Re: Monarch](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37951/re-monarch) by Eligos. It feels like the good parts of Mother of Learning and Re:Zero combined into a cohesive whole. I actually like it more than either, but more because of the good characterization and emotional moments than the rational reasoning and thinking. 

  The premise is similar to Re:Zero, in that the protagonist lives through time loops but doesn't know when conditions have been met for a "save point." Which can mean that dying will reset him back to previous save point, or it could reset him to 5 minutes ago. And the more the protagonist achieves, the farther forward his save points get, so he doesn't have the same room for munchkinry. Which he tries to do of course, but if you wanted the same sort of MoL level of speedrunning that's not gonna happen. The protagonist sometimes faces problems that are insurmountable even with a lot of preparation, and he doesn't have endless loops, so more often than not the solutions end up being pyrrhic but also out of the box. Of course, the main enemy is another time looper who's been in the loop for a long while, but what's interesting is that the enemy has a vested interest in killing the protagonist *for whatever reason*. 

  Characterization is very good, for RR. Almost every character has depth beyond the surface level, and the protagonist is one of the best characterized male protagonists I've read on RR. His reactions, emotions, deepest fears, truimphs, everything is revealed to the reader, which makes the emotional moments strong. The protagonist also has a modicum of emotional intelligence, and his communication skills are pretty good, which is also a delight to read. What I liked best was that this story has a romantic subplot with a very satisfying confession scene that felt sweet but also realistic. 

  As far as rationality goes, nobody seems to have held too big of an idiot ball, although there are idiot characters. The big bad seems a bit cartoonish evil at first but the in story reasons for her being that way make sense, as well as the fact that she's also playing the cartoonish evil act for a reason. The protagonist is pretty good under pressure, and none of his plans and munchkinry felt like deus ex machinas. 

  Anyway, I really like this story. It's like Purple Days but with a Re:Zero esque time loop system, and a protagonist who is initially more likeable and develops much faster.

    [Administrative Mishap](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/administrative-mishap-supergirl-worm.871945/) is a worm/DC crossover featuring Addy (formerly: queen administrator) as the protagonist, and unlike some of the previous works I've seen under that premise isn't just Taylor with a new name. Great writing but definitely more focused on the DC side of the cross. 

    [Felix Fortuna](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/felix-fortuna-worm-hp.56551/) is a Harry Potter / Worm crossover, with a young Fortuna as protagonist.

    [Companion Chronicles](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-el-goonish-shive.57643/) Is weird. Jumpchain fics are shit but they are, apparently, technically possible to do well with enough wrangling, and this is the example of it. It's not solely a Worm Fic, but that's the first real setting in it and it spends a few hundred thousand words of good writing there.

    [Impurity](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/impurity-worm-au.64859/) and [Trailblazer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trailblazer-worm-gundam-au.680881/) do have Taylor as the protagonist, but they're different enough they managed to not turn me off despite how done with Taylor I am, so you might enjoy them anyway if you really want more worm fix.

      Well, to be fair, *Companion Chronicles* is really a deconstruction of how horrible the entire jumpchain genre is.

      ```

        > is really a deconstruction of how horrible the entire jumpchain genre is

        Overall, I'd probably say it's less "jumpchains suck" than "self inserts have a *lot* of ethical issues that are rarely explored".

        For what it's worth, my interest was flagging a bit during Breath of Fire (JRPG rather than anime), but I do think the current arc is the best since Worm. Very different tone and style, since it's slice of life with very little action or adventure, but the slice of life is executed pretty competently. The characters and conflicts feel solidly real and enjoyable, and it mostly works as a low stress exploration. 

        Not everyone's thing, and it's definitely not a retread of the Worm arc, but if slice of life stories appeal it might be worth picking up again and giving it a try.

  I recently started reading "r!Animorphs: The Reckoning" but I've become somewhat confused with the story. I never read/watched the canon material that could be it. I could try reading reading the chapters again however I'd prefer if I could find summaries of the chapters so far (that don't contain any future spoilers).

  I tried searching around but I couldn't find any such summaries. If any are out there I would appreciate if you point them out. Alternatively, if someone could post a detailed summary of the story up to chapter 15 without any future spoilers I would be very very grateful!

    Honestly, I would recommend [Parting the Clouds](https://archiveofourown.org/series/118552) as a better starting place for Animorphs rational fanfic. It retells the Animorphs story with rationalist characters rather than a setting overhaul, and frankly part eighteen (a retelling of Animorphs #19) is one of the best examinations of the genuine difficulty of being a rationalist I’ve ever read. If you read Animorphs in the past, you will pick up on many references to, and gags about, the series, but without having read Animorphs first you won’t be missing major chunks.

    I found The Reckoning hard to follow, even being familiar with both Animorphs and other works that that fanfic was based on.

      I remember briefly looking at this long ago and getting the sense it was extremely canon rehashy and didn't have a lot of actual diverging consequences. Care to confirm or deny?
      ```

      - u/Zarohk:
        ```
        It starts off like a canon rehash written at a higher level, and starts to slowly divergent, leading up to bigger and bigger changes, from >!Cassie recruiting Melissa and other folks as non-morphing agents!< to a radically different ending to #19, and a wild time-travel mess involving the Time Matrix and the David arc. It doesn’t diverges much as Daemorphing, but it’s good both as a series we write, and as an excellent example of how rationalist characters can exist in the world as it is with all of its irrationality, and how a person can make the world and the people around them more rationalist.

      The Reckoning is literally my only exposure to Animorphs, but I don't remember having a hard time following it at all. Perhaps your familiarity with the source material made it harder, since you were expecting something different than what was written?

  So until recently I had been proceeding under the assumption that I was essentially familiar with most or even all subgenres of speculative fiction. This saddened me.

  Then I stumbled across Xianxia, and the fact that there were still wide swaths of spec-fic phase space with novel clusters of tropes and conventions rekindled my will to live.

  Are there other such subgenres that I might be unaware of? Examples might include ideas at the resolution of rational fiction or isekai or something on the scale of an aesthetic like cyberpunk, urban fantasy, xianxia, etc.

    Have you already perused the wiki list? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_writing_genres  

    There are several on there that I have never heard of.

      Good. Point.

      On a first pass through it, Weird West and Fantasy of Manners are things I've seen before but not categorized, so that's helpful, thanks!
