  So, googling around for flower meanings:

      holly: Defense; Domestic Happiness  
      hyndragea: heartfelt emotions / white lily: humility and devotion 
      cherry blossoms: fragility and the beauty of life  
      daffodil: rebirth and new beginnings  
      cactus bud: warmth, protection and endurance  

  Hazo is pregnant?

    There was a lot of discussion of this in-thread, and u/EagleJarl reminded us that we should base our analysis on Japanese culture rather than western ones.
    The western reading is something like "Your beauty calls my spirit to persevere in its pure and chivalrous love for you until you welcome me past your cold exterior to begin our lives together in domestic bliss", with extra hints of 'being her defender'.

    Japanese symbolism:

    Holly: "Looking (Single and "--")"

    Hydrangea: Pride

    White Lily: Purity/Chastity

    Cherry blossoms: Kind/Gentle

    Daffodil: Respect

    (Just flowering) Cactus: (beginnings of) Lust/Sex

    This is basically the flower language equivalent, when combined with Hazou's totally straight-faced delivery, of "I think I like you and you're really pretty and I promise I don't mean anything nasty or dirty but if you tried to kiss me I wouldn't say no and do you maybe like me back?" 

    Like, third-grader "do you like me circle y / n" - tier shit. Mari is a goddamn genius.

  Important thing to know: /u/Velorien and I typically don't have time to review with each other before writing and publishing. We know the worldbuilding, we have planning sessions, but each release is a surprise to the other author. 

  As I read through this chapter I was commenting in real time with /u/Velorien via the GM chat. About halfway through I say "this is either the most epic plot twist ever, or you are messing with my head in a truly epic way."

  Then I found the answer.

    You were reading Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy at the same time as you read through this chapter? Impressive.

    EJ: WWDTTY? 

    Literally Everyone Else: **YES**

      Seems like WWDTTY is impossible to google. What Would Donald Trump Try Yyyyh?
