## Help! Miraculous Ladybug Rational!AU

### Post:

Hi everyone! I’m a fan of Miraculous: Adventures of Ladybug and Chat Noir, and working on a (long, complicated) fanfic for it. The primary antagonist is a terrorist weaponizing negative emotions to obtain a pair of McGuffins that, when used together, can rewrite reality, at the cost of a balancing sacrifice. For example, an AI can become human, but it would cost the humanity of the AI’s creator. The (emotional terrorist , Faustian) villain wants to save the life of his comatose, possibly dying wife.

This sounds like it has MASSIVE potential for a Rationalist AU, but I’m struggling with the morality of the (creative) protagonist to just use the McGuffins to eliminate Death altogether for humans (it would probably mean a genocide for some other sentient species, which is deeply out of character for her). 

I would also love advice for writing villains that can read the protagonists’ minds/emotions without much effort.[Echidna](https://archiveofourown.org/works/18637792/chapters/44197456)

  The problem with balance comes down to a notion of "gains from trade."

  I'll only make a trade if the thing I'm getting (a soda) is worth more to me than the thing I'm giving up ($1).  Soda machines work because Coca-Cola and I *disagree* about the actual value of a soda.  

  Maybe Coke can produce cans for $0.50/each, and the drink provides me with $2 worth of pleasure.  That difference is valuations is what motivates us to trade.

  If I'm offered a trade that's equal according to *my* valuation, then I'm not doing to bother.  By definition, it doesn't make me better off, so why expend any effort?

  If the McGuffin uses some other valuation, then it can be useful, but at that point, we start looking for exploits.  I'd more of less pick what I want to buy (eg. "a cure for my friend's cancer") and then start searching for the least-valuable-to-me thing that the McGuffin regards as a fair exchange.

  For instance, if the trade is "a life for a life" then I'd head to the grocery store, buy a couple lobsters, and sacrifice the lobster's life for the life of my friend.  (Then try bugs, or clams and see if I can heal everyone in the local cancer ward)

  If we're restricted to human lives, then I'd cast the spell targeting people who are seconds away from death due to some natural cause.

  I think the narrative problem here is that the things are too similar.  If we do "life for life" then either we prefer one to the other, or we say that they're similar enough that the outcome doesn't matter.

    There was an SMBC comic about Satan counting zygotes briefly combined and then technologically separated as souls, and so they made enormous "soul generators" to sell to satan for immortality and no negative consequences. 

    Sounds like that, honestly.

    There is one way to benefit from a 'balanced' trade which varies in reward based on the perception of the user towards the trade, and that's to give someone who doesn't fully understand what they are doing the McGuffin. As an example, /u/CreationBlues said lower down in the thread that a dog level AI would be incredibly helpful for AI research. Now, if you were to tell an AI researcher to make that trade, they would presumably have to sacrifice huge amounts to create that dog AI, as they have an intrinsic understanding of the huge amounts of good that could come from that trade. On the other hand, give your average (trusted) adult who has different things to worry about the McGuffin, and order *them* to make the  trade, and they won't understand the full consequences of the trade they are making, and thus the dog AI gets made for much cheaper than it otherwise would have.

    So if the protagonist wants to end death, if they can't do it in a roundabout way and have to do it very urgently for whatever reason, then maybe they talk to the town crazy who believes they have unlimited power over life and death. The protag gives them the McGuffin secretly and tells them to end death for whatever reason, then silently takes the McGuffin back. This would only be done in the worst case scenario, of course, and would normally take place after very carefully vetting candidates who are just the right combination of loyal, and uneducated in a specific area. Example: an adult who has received no formal training in physics is told to wish for a chunk of rock, using a gold bar as a sacrifice. Obviously the gold is viewed as much more valuable than the big chunk of rock, and thermodynamics has been violated easily enough.

    And if the value of the trade is made from a static subjective position, like the average of human belief, then the plan still somewhat works - as the average human probably places about the same value on a dog AI as they would a living dog.

      You could do a great twist on "Those who walk away from Omelas^1 " based on this:

      > Timmy loved his dog, and wouldn't trade him for anything in the whole wide world. 
      >
      > And that's why the McGuffin men came to his door

      ^1 Or maybe John Wick?

  Considering the main villain is already opposed to death, maybe he realizes that he could potentially persuade the protagonists (one of whom is his son!) to his side by manipulating events in their lives. He could leverage the more powerful tool his McGuffin offers him - to surveil the emotions of others, rather than just use those emotions to corrupt them - to ensure the creation of a dystopian society that everyone would wish reformed.

  &#x200B;

  Instead of creating supervillains who get instantly defeated, create superpowered agents (Lila, Nathalie) who manipulate society from the shadows, empowering them temporarily to make mundane changes to society's detriment and exaggerating the flaws of its selfish aristocracy (the mayor's family).

  &#x200B;

  If Ladybug personally experienced death and suffering that she needs her McGuffin to fix, perhaps she could be persuaded that the status quo needed changing. The villain doesn't even need to know her true identity to influence her this way.

    Since you’re familiar with the source material, can I trouble you for constructive criticism for what I already have up? I’m going to have all the pieces close to where I want them by Sunday, but “the villain had a valid point but needs to think on a grander scope” is... always problematic.

  I am familiar with the source material. I've been thinking for a while on what I could advice you, but after seriously thinking about it I don't see any objection in letting the Villain try out using the McGuffins, and undo it if things went southwards (didn't know about the secondary effects of using their combined power though).

  As best\_cat said, the best option is to play it straight. Either have the MC be more worried about the possible fallout of allowing the Villain the single use of the McGuffins, or let her do it and deal with whatever happens afterwards, including any guilty concience in case of a massively horrible consequence. If you change the main conflict to the morality of the usage of the McGuffins, the Villain's methods to secure them can be changed a lot from physical to psychological. If the Villain can be open about his goals it can even produce additional conflict between the 2 MC's.

  I'm going to preface this with the idea that I'm not familiar with the media you're referencing, so I'm not sure how acurate my analysis will be.

  Obviously, the goal here is to minimize suffering while maximizing return. An AI? Sure, humanity's cool and all, but a lot of what we want out of an AI can be had with animal level inteligences, for example, a dog AI would be massively helpful. Considering that an AI could be theoretically extended with high level modules that could handle things like memory and logic, and you find your bang for your buck starts going pretty far.

  You could go pretty far with that. Livestock massively outnumbers humans, and even with a shitty conversion rate for life force, you get a fast and humane way of slaughtering them.

  Consider letting the villain that can read the protagonist's mind win.  Like, that ought to be a huge advantage, and its a twist most readers won't see coming.  Make the villlain's objective something that they can achieve without breaking the story too much, then have them achieve it because "telepathy, son!"
