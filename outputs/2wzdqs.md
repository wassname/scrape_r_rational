  This is one of my favorite young adult fantasy series.  Its not strictly rational fiction of course, but few fictions recommended on this sub truly are.  Its also one of the few settings that has entropy as the big bad and a pretty awesome afterlife. 

  If you like interesting magic systems with interewting world building you should defiently check it it out.

    It's "rational" but not "rationalist", in the sense that the characters are do things that a real-life person would think to do in their circumstances, and think about their problems in genuinely effective ways.

    So, to give an example, when a white hole pops out of their spell for *finding a lost pen* that accidentally transported them to some kind of freaky other dimension and gave them a vision, and the white hole says that a named artifact of some sort has gone missing... what do our two young wizards do?  That's right: they go find some ~~Senior~~ Advisory Wizards and ask for their help and expertise.

  After /u/eliezeryudkowsky referenced it in the last HPMoR chapter, it turned out some people still have not read this series.  That's *terrible*, since we *totally* need to have a LessWrongians meet-up at CrossingCon 2016.  Thus, ALL OF YOU READ THIS NOW.

    How "young adult" is it? I've read a few young adult books in the past year, and have become increasingly disdainful of the writing style that most of them have chosen to go with.

  As somebody else mentioned in the Ch 112 thread, and which I will repeat here because he phrased it so well:

  This is the series that taught me that entropy was something I should oppose.

  [Spoiler-ish, but not really]

  I loved the series as a kid, though EY's reference to it didn't quite make sense to me. Unless I'm misremembering, the book was notable for its LACK of traditional big, powerful, magic (ex: wish granting). Wizard spells didn't just come from thin air, they needed components and work, and they weren't that powerful. They were just more tools for the protagonists, which is one of the things I most liked about it. 

  Can someone elucidate?

    Examples of the big stuff below - but note that everything has a cost, and for the most impressive stuff it's often someone's life.  Or there are special circumstances... but even then, someone will probably die of it.

    In the first book Nita casts a spell to permanently separate a volume of space from creation, rendering it immune to everything up to interdimensional travel or retroactive changes to history - at the cost of an unspecified portion of her lifespan.

    In the third, various people travel more than ten trillion lightyears - they're trying to escape their pursuer by getting outside the observable universe... and it works for almost 24 hours.

    Book four features the Four Treasures of Ireland, weapons or devices that embody the ideal of a classical element.  The Spear (Luin, fire) is reforged using iron portalled in from the heart of a first-generation star - any newer iron has lost too much of it's potency to survive the forging.

    Five includes lessons in finding and commanding the "kernel" of a planet or universe, which grants control over the fundamental rules of that place - from gravity to possible topics of conversation.  

    Later we see management of stars, creation of universes, halting the expansion of space, moving civilisations millions of years through time, and more.
