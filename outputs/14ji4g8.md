## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I have been enjoying Time To Orbit: Unknown by Derin Edala. It's about malfunctioning colony ship awakening a sociologist who has to do a fair bit of fixing of said colony ship. Characters are  flavorful and just that bit off from modern sensibilities. Also a long running set of mysteries slowly get unraveled over time. It's definitely in the aesthetic of the Rational community and I think it fits here on the Rational Fiction community too.

    [Link](https://derinstories.com/2022/06/04/001-the-problem-with-the-javelin-program/). Not finished yet, but so far, this is _really_ good. Not only is it well written, but so far it seems like one of the better examples of rational fiction that I've seen posted in a while.

      Yeah it checks all the boxes for me except the high bar of teaching rationality.

    I'm about a dozen chapters in and enjoying it so far.

    That being said, it always mildly exasperates me when scifi stories written as late as 2022 depict AI as being dumber than GPT-4 (or GPT-3, going by what was SOTA at the time of writing).

    Or the utter lack of robotics, so far. Seriously, a few remote manipulators and some things barely more advanced than the products of modern Boston Dynamics would be nice to see!

    And the technology seems quaint given how far in the future it's set. You'd think they'd have full immersion VR or something like that, leaving aside cybernetics.

      I'll try to avoid anything too major, but minor spoilers: >!issues with the AI become a plot point. Additionally, I think that some limits of AIs in the story universe were added to prevent other plot issues, but yeah it does seem a bit jarring given current AI abilities and that this is supposed to be pretty far in the future. !<.

      As for the tech level, yeah it does seem a bit odd. I think it got set in the future to fix some issues, but that also sort of caused other issues. However, the story isn't _too_ tech focused beyond just needing to know that some things work a particular way, so I'm mostly willing to give it a pass on the minor quirks, although I do agree with your description of the weirdness. 

      Another very minor spoiler: >!This story is trying to be almost entirely a psycho-social drama, so it's purposefully avoiding tech solutions to some problems because it _wants_ to explore the human aspects of them, even though I think that in a universe like this one, plausible tech solutions would exist!<

      In short, I think I agree with your characterization of things, but for me they don't seem very major in this story, given the way it's being written and the things it's trying to do.
      ```

      - u/self_made_human:

        Thank you, and if anyone else is reading, I concur the spoilers aren't major.

        I still find this highly grating, like a pea in an otherwise cozy mattress. It's a forgivable sin for fiction written before, say, 2015, when even a well informed observer couldn't have predicted the rapid pace of progress in AI. But for something written in 2022 and ongoing in 2023, it just annoys me to no end, albeit not so much I don't like the story.

        Of course, my annoyance makes sense when you consider I was so annoyed at the sheer lack of technological progress, not just in Tomorrow AD settings, but in the distant future, that I even write my own web serial where [I take scrupulous care to throw in every technological advance that makes sense haha](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65211/ex-nihilo-nihil-supernum-original-hard-scifi-with).

        Now, I'd still rate the novel an 8/10 and happily recommend it, so take that as you will. 

        (Not really a spoiler, but at least my gripes about cybernetic prosthetics not existing was wrong, and prosthetic limbs do show up, even if they're really bad for the time period)

        IMO the best colony ship story/s are in the [*Sunflower* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/168556-sunflower-cycle)by Peter Watts.
        ```

        - u/TheSunflowerSeeds:
          ```
          Sunflowers produce latex and are the subject of experiments to improve their suitability as an alternative crop for producing hypoallergenic rubber. Traditionally, several Native American groups planted sunflowers on the north edges of their gardens as a "fourth sister" to the better known three sisters combination of corn, beans, and squash.Annual species are often planted for their allelopathic properties.
          ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    I'm only a few chapters in, but I can already tell that the writing quality is quite good. The story has set up some urgent short term problems for the protagonist to solve, along with some overarching questions (like what the hell happened). I'll give it a tentative recommendation.

  [Virtuous Sons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia) (VS) has recently wrapped up a major arc, so I thought it might be a good idea to give my thoughts. VS is a series that has been recommended multiple times on this sub, and that I have just finished binging through the past several months of updates. In case you aren't familiar, it's basically a Xianxia novel but Greek. So here goes.

  Firstly, I think it's well above average for Xianxia, but, in my opinion, this is more an indictment of the average quality of Xianxia than particular praise for VS. If you are someone who thinks that most Xianxia is pretty good, then you will probably really enjoy VS because it's better than most Xianxia. If not, well, VS is ...fine in my opinion.

  The world building is pretty good, and I do find myself interested in learning more. The characters are pretty decently written and have mostly unique voices to where you both expect different characters to behave differently in a given situation and are generally correct about how a character will react. 

  I have two main criticisms though. The first one is _extremely_ common among serialized web fiction and is therefore kind of minor (or at the very least not surprising): The pacing of chapters combined with the update schedule mean that the story is SLOW. Maybe not Delve level slow, but honestly not that far off. This problem is slightly exacerbated by the fact that it's slowly being taken off of RR to be released on Amazon. Which means that if you read it when it was free, but no longer remember what happened way back in the beginning, you have to buy the book to re-read it. This isn't an inherent problem; authors deserve to get compensation. Although the fact that there is also a Patreon sort of muddies things. I'm not sure if patrons get free copies or not, but it sort of feels like they should, since a patreon subscription can, in a very short amount of time, add up to far more than it would cost to buy the books. Anyways, moving on. 

  Secondly, and for me a far bigger issue, is the style of prose. I am not someone who likes overly florid or artistic prose. If the consensus opinion on a book or work is that a large portion of why it's good is the beauty of the prose, that's generally a good sign that I personally will not like the book. Also, criticisms like Brandon Sanderson's prose being "workmanlike" do not phase me. I really enjoy his books and the prose does not detract at all from my enjoyment of them. I realize that this far from a universal view, so if you don't feel this way, you can probably ignore this, or at least, take that context into account. All that being said: the prose in VS is almost unbearably overwrought. It actively gets in the way of understanding what is going on. I find that I often can't figure out what is happening because everything is so incredibly draped in metaphor. Part of this is the nature of the world. Metaphor is a _huge_ part of how things work in this universe, and I like that aspect. But in my opinion the works goes too far. The text needs to always primary serve understanding of what's going on (remember my earlier descriptions of my personal aesthetic preferences please), and VS fails pretty badly at that. I can't go so far as to say that it's bad, it's just a stylistic choice that _very_ much does not work for me, but it appears to be intentional and that the author is successfully achieving what they want to achieve. 

  It's to the point where I have considered dropping it several times despite liking most other things about it but am interested enough in the background to stick with it. The current arc is just wrapping up (FINALLY) and I'm hoping that future arcs will be a little tighter.

  So in summary: Virtuous Sons is a Greek flavored Xianxia web series that is currently a little over 175k words long. It has very few SPAG issues, the world building is extremely unique and done in a pretty interesting way. The characters are well written and give the sense that these are actually different people with different ways of viewing the world and interacting with it. The pacing is slow and you need to buy the books on Amazon to read the beginning if you haven't already. The prose is _extremely_ artistic and filled with metaphor to that point (in my opinion) that it sometimes hinders clarity and understanding (as well as contributing to some of the pacing issues by bumping up chapter length). 

  Hopefully this will be helpful in deciding if Virtuous Sons is something you might be interested in reading.

    The obstacle for me is the characters...they tend to be unbearably arrogant and unlikeable.  I didn't get that far...do they really count as rational?  It was hard for me to get invested in what happened to them.  I feel this is a common problem in both Progression Fantasy and rationalist Fiction.    


    As far as your opinion on prose...as a general principle I agree.  I generally dislike flowery prose and \*HATE\* pseudo-archaic prose.  I prefer straightforward casual prose.  Unpopular opinion, but the prose in **Super Supportive** is actually really good...it's not trying for what your typical Fantasy novel is, but it does a good job of making the MC feel like a person.
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      Them being arrogant kind of comes with the territory in Xianxia unless the work is specifically trope-reversing like "Beware of Chicken" or something. As for likability, I find myself liking some and disliking others, but that's sort of a personal opinion, which I think comes from having relatively well defined characters. I can certainly see why many of the characters would be unlikable to some people, even though it doesn't particularly bother me.

      As for whether it counts as rational fiction: in my opinion not really. But the bulk of what gets suggested in these threads doesn't really seem to qualify (again: in my opinion). In the recommendation threads themselves, I don't think it's that big a deal. I personally wouldn't share this story as a top level post, but, as is always the case when this criticism comes up, this sub isn't so crowded that it particularly matters. I didn't really think that PGtE was rational but it's one of the most popular works on this sub (and deservedly so, it's really good....just not very rational). 

      This sub has sort of developed a culture on the kinds of works that people "like" and things that fall in that group get recommended, even though it doesn't perfectly overlap with "rational" fiction (and barely overlaps at all with "rationalist" fiction). But because rational fiction is, itself, a kind of nebulous and hard to define category (lots of people would disagree with my personal definition, I'm sure), I don't really think it's possible to fix this issue, and it's not a big enough problem to worry about.

        >Them being arrogant kind of comes with the territory in Xianxia unless the work is specifically trope-reversing like "Beware of Chicken" or something.

        Agreed.  Which is why I'm here.  I sort of come to this forum in the hopes of finding deconstructions and sensible characters who aren't 1000% certain every gamble will pay off, and don't insult godlike beings who can squish them.

        >As for whether it counts as rational fiction: in my opinion not really. But the bulk of what gets suggested in these threads doesn't really seem to qualify (again: in my opinion

        Totally...and that's occasionally a frustration for me.  I just thought it should be noted.  This is more a book for fans of Xianxia and macho assertive independent action heroes then rational fiction purists.  

        >This sub has sort of developed a culture on the kinds of works that people "like" and things that fall in that group get recommended, even though it doesn't perfectly overlap with "rational" fiction (and barely overlaps at all with "rationalist" fiction).

        Agreed.  Personally, I violently hate the fiction the "culture" of this group has come to favor, and am here for  the occasional book suggested by people who read the sidebar and haven't yet realized "Oh...that isn't really what his group is about, exactly" and wandered off.

          To be fair most of the rationalist stories I've tried were really dry, didn't have great characterization, and were frankly kinda boring at times. I like the fact that the weekly threads are a bit more relaxed about the definition. I'd rather have a rational-ish (or even irrational) story with great characterization than a rational story with robotic characters. I think the individual threads that get posted here are more strict on the definition, while the weekly threads are more relaxed, which imo works pretty well as a system.

    fwiw, I'd say the prose's at least partially necessary to actually get the world building and character motivations down right, cuz there's often not a 3rd person narrator and >!the way people think, as one example, shapes what they can do!<
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      Yes, to a degree it absolutely is.  As I mentioned, a large part of the way the cultivation works in the world is through metaphor; therefore, it's required as part of the world building. But I think it goes too far. I think it could be accomplishing the worldbuilding and characterization goals, be consistent with the cultivation and convey how it works while still allowing the reader to understand what's happening. If I didn't think it was intentional on the author's part, I'd suspect that it was a habit the author developed from talking about the cultivation that they then got stuck in and carried over to other parts of the text that didn't need it. In other words, I don't think it should be entirely scrapped or gotten rid of, I just think it's overdone. And just to be overly repetitive, I fully acknowledge that this is a personal aesthetic preference that others might not share, including the difficulty following what's happening. Since I don't generally like this kind of prose, I probably have less practice interpreting "artful" prose than people who like it.

  Yo, been lurking on this sub for months after reading HPMoR, been reading rational fiction happily since! Figured I'd recommend a few recent reads of mine I haven't seen reccomended elsewhere.

  Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint: MC gets dropped into the world of their favorite (fictional) novel and it goes SO FAR with that premise. It has some of the deepest worldbuilding I've bever seen WITHOUT the self-insert angle, and it just gets deeper when you add it. Whenever you think you understand everything, they just add another layer to it all. Characters' decisions feel realistic,especially the interactions between the current protagonist and the original protagonist. and big twists are really well-foreshadowed. At it's best, it really sucks you in! It's not totally rational: The MC can be really dense at times, usually for comedic effect, and there's an occasional bit of plot contrivance. But it's absolutely worth checking out. It has a way of sticking with you in the way a good ratfic tends to.

  El Goonish Shiv: Saw this one on a past comment section and want to re-reccomend it. I binged 20 years of comics in like, a week. It's about a bunch of highschoolers getting involved in a complex world of magic, mostly involving transformations. It's good at just sort of having characters talk with one another about their feelings, about gender identity and gender roles, while having great slow-burn worldbuilding. The first few months of comics are rough, but it really does get good over time.

  Elsewise, if you haven't already, Super Supportive and The Game at Carousel are wonderful on RR. They've already gained a bit of traction recently, but they're worth another shoutout. If you haven't read them yet, they're really good.
  ```

- u/Wispling:
  ```
  They're published novels, but I recommend the works of Adrian Tchaikovsky, which I've been binging for the past week.

  *Elder Race* is a good starting point - it's a novella, so not terribly long or involved, and a good example of Tchaikovsky's work. It's one of those science fiction settings which mimic fantasy genre tropes, but it's very self-aware, and uses the premise as a way to explore interactions between characters who interpret the underlying reality in different ways.

  [*SASUKE: The Fanfiction*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-the-fanfiction.1097835/). It just started, so there's only a few chapters out, but (title aside) so far I'm liking it.

  The basic premise is that Sasuke was born with an eldritch entity within him and has essentially merged with it, so he's not quite human, but he's trying to fit in. It mostly follows canon, it's starting to diverge with the Chunin exams in the latest chapters.

  It's well-written, no grammatical/spelling errors that I can remember, or at least nothing that really sticks out.

  Worldbuilding is fine. It's basically the Naruto world. Nothing added but that's fine.

  Voidherald's (Perfect Run, Vainquer, etc) latest story, Aztec vampires! I've really been enjoying what I've read so far (though I am ahead reading on Patreon).

  Iztac is the latest in a *long* line of emperors chosen by the Nightkin to rule the Empire for a year, before he will be feasted upon and ritually sacrificed to the Nightlords worshipped as their gods. 

  Story is equal parts court politics by day, and an exploration of the Aztec underworld by night, as Iztac searches for a way to escape his fate and overthrow a brutal regime from within.

    The Grandmaster Strategist - Main character is a tactician with no combat capabilities of his own, but it's a Wuxia setting and there's a decent amount of focus on his right hand man's growth as a martial artist.

    Xianxia seems to be much more popular in terms of translated novels, Mao Ni's stuff probably counts as Wuxia and appears to be pretty well-liked, though I haven't read it.

    A lot of the Wuxia manga/manhua I love end up being cancelled for one reason or another (goddamit), but I would recommend checking out Chang Ge Xing, Heresy, and Blades of the Guardians.

  Please recommend me something with a painfully sane, self-aware, borderline sociopathic MC, akin to those from HPMOR and Mother of Learning.  

  I keep asking this same question and keep getting bad recommendations. Here's attempt ~~#3~~ #4!(I'm super attentive and asked in the last week's post just today)  

  Started *Worth the candle* - there's not an ounce of rationality in it, the MC is a bumbling fool stumbling upon adventures and achieving lucky resolutions due to nothing but his thick plot armor. Dropped it 52% in and really shouldn't have given it that much time to prove itself.  

  Started *Only Villains Do That* and it doesn't live up to its name, it's basically management porn in a gacha world. The author explained numerous times that his goal was to create an MC who isn't as smart as he thinks he is and I guess the author succeeded, because the protagonist ended up being five times as lucky as he is smart, otherwise he wouldn't have made it past day 1. Maybe it gets better, but it lost me at 34%  

  p.s. does anyone know if Mother of Learning is getting reworked? The author said he was aware of the problems of his writing in the early parts of the story and wanted to do something about that, but I don't know if anything came of it yet.  

  p.p.s. I don't want to seem like a jack-ass, I'm just trying to keep this short. I'll gladly elaborate on my opinions about any of the titles I mentioned, I'm not really that hostile towards any of them.  

  EDIT: I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my request, all of you very much helped me line up a nice queue of reading materials for the foreseeable future. You all were most helpful, but of course, I didn't expect anything less from r/rational. =)

    >I keep asking this same question and keep getting bad recommendations. Here's attempt ~~#3~~ #4!

    Maybe try rephrasing / rewriting your request to better articulate what you're looking for? For instance, neither HP:MoR nor MoL have "borderline sociopathic MCs", so it's unclear whether you want stories that are similar to those titles or stories that have ~~sociopathic~~ ruthless MCs.

    For the time being, maybe try the following:

    * [*Waves Arisen*](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/)
    * [*Blood Crest*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest)
    * [*Reincarnator*](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/) — noticeably drops in quality in the last ~quarter, but at least the first 1/2 is rather well written (for its genre)
    * [*Kaleidoscope*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12539731/1/Kaleidoscope) (up till the first arc's ending, then depending on how you're liking the rest).
    * [*Reverend Insanity*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ReverendInsanity) — super long, but at least the first 25%-50% is really well-written
    * [*Too Young to Die*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die)
    * [*The Metropolitan Man*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man)
    * [*The Number*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48012/the-number)
    * Macronomicon's works to certain extent, e.g. [*Wake of the Ravager*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager)

    Once you find something from this list that you like, I can maybe suggest something similar to it if you describe which parts you liked and which ones didn't.

    >does anyone know if Mother of Learning is getting reworked

    Uhhh, Luminosity, probably? (Just Luminosity, Radiance is not nearly as good).

    I also liked "Need to Become Stronger" most out of the "Naruto Ratfic" out there, but it's pretty much dead. If you don't like to read a dead fic, probably Waves Arisen.

    Ah, the Metropolitan Man probably counts as well. Actually, since you specified "sociopathic MC" it probably fits the most.
    ```

    - u/EtheusProm:
      ```
      Oh yeah, I meant to read the Metropolitan Man - everything I know about it tells me I should like it, but I keep putting it off, because it's so short and I know I will swallow it(also it's Wales' work and I am already not a fan of Worth the Candle, so I might just quit on it the moment I start seeing the same patterns of writing a book without writing a story I hated about WtC).  

      The other two... Maybe when I really run out of things to read. I just don't like literally anything about their source materials and don't care to see them fixed.  

      Do any original works come to mind though?  

      Also, the *borderline* sociopathic requirement for the MC is not mandatory. Maybe I shouldn't have written that part at all, since most people instantly translate it into "the MC sees people as inconvenient meat that should stop moving" and it's not *exactly* what I meant...

        Going off your complaints about WtC and OVDT - are you after a *competent* protagonist?

        Luminosity (and Radiance imo) are both very good, and have extremely competent protagonists, and don't require knowledge or appreciate of the source material. To some extent, like hpmor in places, they comment on flaws in the originals (not super familiar with twilight but I think it's true). I think they are probably the best recommendations for you.

        Waves arisen likewise has a competent main character (group, in fact). I don't think you need much knowledge of canon.

          Congratulations, your comment was the straw that broke the camel's back - the number of recommendations I personally received to read it finally exceeded my previously built-up predisposition against anything twilight-adjacent and forced me to actually evaluate my position on Luminocity. Which came out surprisingly favorable.

              I assume people just expected more of the same from Radiance and it just didn't scratch their itch. If I ever get to it - I'll make sure to read something else between the two to make sure I go in without any subconscious preconceptions of what Radiance is supposed to be.

    >painfully sane, self-aware, borderline sociopathic MC, akin to those from HPMOR and Mother of Learning.

    So, people always ask this question, and it is fundamentally self-contradictory.  Sociopathy is  considered a mental illness...a sociopath is by definition not "painfully sane".  They also tend not to be super self aware or super rational either.    


    The other problem is in fiction sociopathic MCs are often used as a way of enjoying the fantasy of being able to do what you want without guilt or consequences.  So "Sociopathic MC" is usually used as code for "murder hobo", and these characters tend not to be super rational.  

    You should probably try to subdivide which of these qualities you want.  Rational MC are kind of hard to find, even here.  Sociopathic MCs are super easy to find if you find the right corners of the internet.

        The world is ravaged by a phenomenon known as the Nightmare Spell. Gates are randomly spawned that releases monsters into the world. Humans are randomly selected to undergo trials by the spell, in which they get sent to a ruined magical world filled with monsters, and if they survive, they gain superhuman powers and a flaw. If they die, they become a gateway for the monsters. 

        Humanity is losing against the tide of monsters, and losing badly. 

        We join the protagonist slumrat Sunny, who starts off the story infected by the spell with one of the worst powers possible. He overcomes his first trial through pure spite and ingenuity, receiving a mighty boon...and a crippling flaw. Training with others for his second trial, he plays up the crouching moron hidden badass, knowing that it's over for him if his flaw was ever discovered. And after months of hard-work and preparation, in his second trial he ends up being sent to an unmapped area of the parallel universe with monsters way above his weight class, with no way back...

          Alright, I'm sold! That's a solid description!  

          One last question - does his flaw stays relevant throughout the entire story? Because I've seen and read many stories where any initial problems the MC has are relatively quickly circumvented or even entirely ignored after a certain point because the author got bored of them and just wants the story to proceed.

            The flaw is only sometimes relevant depending on the context.

            >! He can't lie or refuse to answer a question, and anyone knowing his true name can enslave him. So it is only relevant in situations where awkward questions are likely to come up. !>

    Worth the Candle is a weird one for me. I read it as an audiobook first and foremost, since that's how I've been consuming a lot of books lately. And it was amazing. The characters were believable, and the long conversations were endlessly listenable. After binging the first two books, I immediately wanted to read more! And after reading a few chapters, I dropped it and waited for the next audiobook. The ponderings on D&D and what it means to be in a story just didn't work in written format like they did in audio. I get it if you don't want to give it another shot, but for me, the audiobook completely redeemed it. The Metropolitan Man audiobook on HPMOR podcast was also great too, though I have no idea how much I would like the same written work. To me, Wales' writing is at it's most compelling read aloud. No idea if anyone else has had that same experience, though.

      Oh yeah, a good VA can sell you on otherwise average material. Sadly, audio books are just not my thing, I'm used to reading and I love it as a process, a ritual even.

        Totally fair! Audiobooks are only a recent love of mine, and they're not for everyone. I recently got a job with a lot of time to listen to audio while working, so they became a great way to keep reading even when I'm busy.

        As for recomendations, have you tried out Super Supportive and The Game at Carousel on Royal Road? I'm not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for, considering Zorian and Harry are such different characters to begin with. I don't see Zorian having the sociopathic tendencies Harry does, at least not nearly to the same degree. But the protags of those two stories are always curious, tend to be distrustful, and think in ways many in their settings don't. Hopefully they'll scratch your itch.

        Otherwise, maybe try out Harry Potter and the Prancing of Ponies as a fan-sequel to HPMoR on Fimfiction. I've tried out a half-dozen fan-sequels to HPMoR, and that one's the only one that scratches the same itch as the original. I've read the whole things through twice, and parts half a dozen times, just like the original. Harry and Quirrel are the dual-protagonists of the novel, and they're perfectly in-character, so if you want an MC like Harry, congrats, you have two of them! Maybe not the best read if you've never seen MLP:FiM, but if you have, it's really, really good.

          > Super Supportive

          I'm sure I've checked it out before, but I have no clue why I didn't start properly reading it. Having read through several pages just now I'm quite hooked, so I'll give it a chance. is it finished?  

          >The Game at Carousel  

          Seems interesting, but I'm trying to stick to finished books when I can and I already had plenty of finished projects recommended to me.  

          >Harry Potter and the Prancing of Ponies  

          ...

          Okay, I downloaded it.

    I second *Waves Arisen*, though it's relatively short.

    Maybe *Harry Potter and the Natural 20* though that's often quite wacky. 

    [Postnuptial Disagreements](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements) has a very competent and borderline sociopathic protagonist though it's often played for laughs.

      >Postnuptial Disagreements  

      Read a bit of the first chapter, seems like something I might like. Thank you very much for advising without judging - some people seem to have an issue with me actively seeking out fiction with lizard-brained protagonists.

        I think the negative responses are mostly due to the tone of your post instead of the content – which isn't how it's supposed to be, I guess, but that's how it is...

    A Song For Two Voices by Swimmer963.  Its not talked about much on here since its pretty lengthy and slow. It holds the title for longest rat!fic work at 1.7mio words, beating out WTCs 1.65mio! It takes a super messy fantasy setting (Valdemar) and succeeds at rat!ificationing. The deuteragonist Leareth - which is the character you'd like - isn't the main viewpoint though. 

    https://archiveofourown.org/series/936480

    Why am a reccing you a 1.7mio word fic thats not even what you asked for? Well theres a toooon of fan-fanfic of it over on glowfic.com that features Leareth as MC. And ho boy does Leareth not joke around on the painfully sane, painfully goal-oriented scales. 

    ON GLOWFIC: 

    Its its own little format with specific conventions, perhaps this one is a good introduction, even though Leareth again features more as support character.

    This is a bit longer but also works well as intro.  https://glowfic.com/posts/3913

    You could try [Godclads](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59663/godclads-monster-mceldritchcyberpunkprogression). Cyberpunk story where the protagonist starts off as a ghoul with a taste for flesh, especially flesh that struggles. Weird mix of eldritch magic and cyberpunk. MC starts of explicitly sociopathic, trying to get his emotions and morality back. He's also sane and self-aware, just, you know, with a bad case of hunger for ~~human~~ flesh. :) 

    Maybe also try R. Scott Bakker's Second Apocalypse series. Multi pov story with one of those characters being a proactive sociopath.

    WtC is my favourite ever story though it's definitely not due to Juniper's rationality, I simply find the world buildings eminently readable. I also think Amaryllis is a rarer example of trope inversion where a highly rational protagonist *doesn't* have sociopathic tendencies.

    Saying that, I think I can recommend [Double Blind](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50553/double-blind-a-modern-litrpg) that I am currently following. MC is almost clinically certified, but is aware of it and has a good value system to work around issues. It's fairly readable fast paced page turner, and as a homage to MoL (author of Double Blind is a fan iirc), >!there is a non-protagonist time looper in the story which is incredibly cool!<. Unfortunately it's not finished (though book 2 just ended).

    Surprised that nobody has recommended ***Pokemon: The Origin of Species***, which has a very rational MC, who is also pretty similar to Harry from HPMOR. You'll probably like the antagonist and other side characters even more.

    Description:  
    "Enter the world of Pokémon from a rational perspective. Instead of starting his journey in ignorance, Red has spent his years studying the creatures so central to his world... and he doesn't quite agree with all the information in his books. No time for rookie mistakes here: he's on a quest to discover the true nature of Pokémon, and maybe even find out where they really come from."

    Other works:  
    \- ***Pathfinder Series by Orson Scott Card*** (veeeerrrrry reminiscent of HPMOR, protagonist has the ability to see the paths of living creatures in the past, and goes out to learn more about the world)  
    \- ***Dune Series by Frank Herbert*** (just in case you haven't read it yet)  
    \- ***The Queen’s Thief Series – Megan Whalen Turner*** (court, national, and continental intrigue in a mythological greek world, starring the Thief)  
    \- ***Isekai Speedrun*** (speedrunner gets stuck in the dark fantasy game they speedrun, tries to go for the good ending)
    ```
