## [RT][HF][WIP][Rom] Vampire Flower Language - Michaelmas Daisy (or: the definition of personhood gets a look in, someone with alien values tries to do some manipulation, and it's just generally sad)

  SPOILERS BELOW

  /u/juliandelphiki2 , I'm excited to "make your day" with a new chapter so I thought I'd tag you! It's one of the longest yet. Uh, sorry about the contents. 

  (seriously though the compliments mean a lot!)

  The discord chat / beta readers got mad at me for making them sad. I'm mad at me for making myself sad. My coauthor did some last minute edits to the chapter before it went up that really twisted the knife, too. 

  Julias and his conversation with Red... it's so fun to write someone who has a really different value function. Every action Julias makes is in an attempt to further William's happiness. 

  William is in a bit of denial, not being quite sure what he's doing with himself. Red's guilty. 

  And Julias is fuckin' panicking. He wants William to be happy. He's got a vampire who's in love with a human on his hands and 100% in denial about it, and he isn't *quite sure* what exactly is causing the problem. 

  It's a little bit autobio, in retrospect. About two months ago my ex and I broke up, and he was, well, a real /r/slatestarcodex or /r/rational or /r/LessWrong stereotype. And I'm like that, too, obviously: I'm writing a story on here for crying out loud! but... he was moreso. And the same things that Red finds troubling in William, in retrospect, I'm glad I don't have to deal with anymore now my ex is out of the picture.

  (Turns out you can be Rational And Logical while also not having $MISC_BAD_QUALITIES that I won't enumerate for fear of alienating  my audience)


  ----

  So yeah, the story's going to transition. We're going to follow William first, but there's an interlude coming up where we get more insight into Julias's thought processes.

    Thank you!

    As much as this chapter hurts, it had to happen. William is just too different to Red and this isn't something that will be fixed in just one chapter.
