  Tantalising.  


  I find it fun to imagine it as a spiral rather than as a closed circle--one person dies, another is (others are) inspired to seek immortality by the death of those before them, and each generation/{people-who-are-alive} in turn walk the same path, with the same goal, with the same hope and will.  


  The Type-Moon multiverse also flits through my mind, each mage passing on their research to their successor, everyone seeking the origin of everything through different paths.  That always bothered me in how fragile each line was, though--how the fruits of centuries of research could be lost all at once with a single clash and death, with no or little persistent accumulation.  Then again, maybe that was a necessity to avoid a world-crackdown that happened whenever the opposite was attempted, part of the exclusivity which was the price for the chance offered.  


  \--However, I cannot actually remember whether that was canon or not.  Whether it was truly that each 'loophole' was shut as soon as each person went through it, or just that each approach was different and so couldn't go through the same loophole.  But presumably others could imitate it otherwise, so...  


  Ahh.  ( [https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Magic#Acquisition](https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Magic#Acquisition) )  Canon indeed?  Yet, I've gotten off track.
