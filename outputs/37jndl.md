  Megaman is a lab assistant. He was neither built nor programmed for combat. However, one feature makes him nearly unique among all other robots: he has true, autodidactic intelligence. When he faces off against advanced, combat-optimized robots, he often gets his ass handed to him. If he manages to survive for a rematch, though, he adapts and exploits patterns to strong effect. Add in the ability to copy abilities from downed foes, and you have one of my favorite rational heroes.

  Another major selling point is the art. It is a sprite comic, harking from the early dawn of webcomics and bobandgeorge.com. Unlike most others, though, the author draws *custom sprites from scratch for practically every panel.* It's insane, and the art is, at times, stunning.

  The link drops you at the start of an interlude between arcs. Running for 72 strips, it works great as a stand-alone short story, and if you like it, just keep reading on. There's plenty of high-quality content before this point, but I recommend it as a starting spot for new readers.

  I am not the creator. "MS Paint Masterpieces" is not related to MS Paint Adventures, 'aka' Homestuck. :)

    Updates very slowly, but to my continued surprise, not actually abandoned.

  Yay, the only remaining Bob and George subcomic!

  This old strip really takes me back... I have an @bobandgeorge.com e-mail address that I still use.

    Still used? Wow!

    Yeah, I'm honestly shocked it's still being updated. I definitely consider this one to be the best of all them - would you agree, or do you have a different favorite? (That said, Fusion Adventures was at times hilarious.)

      Well, I can certainly say the one I WORKED on wasn't my favorite. :P It... kinda... died after I came on, because the rest of the group never wanted to work on it...

      MSPM is definitely one of the best. I also liked Author Hunters and Sakurai Diaries.

      Fusion Adventures was hit-and-miss, but yeah, it did have the occasional good part.
