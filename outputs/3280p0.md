  Will this be continuing?  I really like the premise. 

  I wasn't very clear on what was happening in the beginning -- I got that the humans used mustard gas, but I wasn't clear on why they were putting up shields and all that. As to destroying the world but it must have had something to do with the gate opening and then not closing -- did they dial a black hole?

    I'm certainly intending to continue it. I don't yet know how it's going to end so I'm not ruling out that I'll accidentally write myself into a corner or run out of steam, but there will definitely be more chapters.

    It's deliberately a bit under-explained, to be further elaborated on later (the intended chapter 2 is from the PoV of the people responsible), but yes basically that's what happened.

      If you are going to continue it, then why does the chapter numbers show 1/1? This usually means that the story is a one-shot. Is the continuation going to be a separate story?

      Great story by the way.

        No, I'm just bad at AO3. Thanks for the catch. Fixed now. :-)

  I see what you did there.

  As a big time fan of the series, I am happy to see rational SG fan fics. Really enjoyed your first SG fic on how the Ancients inadequately software tested their Gates. 

  Looking forward to seeing how this one goes, especially since Baal is one of my "favorite" Goaulds. Do you intend to include Anubis in your fic ?

   How about the ascended Ancients and the Ori ? I assume post-singularity players will break a rational fic really fast.

  So, rational!NID using a slightly different tactic to eliminate threats now rather than just genocide through biological warfare then?

  ```
  Note: This is not a sequel to Stargate Physics 101. If you expect it to be a similar story you will be disappointed.
