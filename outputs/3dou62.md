  Most of the background information on Aeria will come from Aeria itself in the form of in-world texts and things of that nature. The inhabitants of Aeria have a specific perspective on their world, which may not perfectly map to the world's true nature. 

  I'm curious what sort of munchkining this magic system will allow. Its very powerful and its *known* to be very powerful, but there are probably still 'cheeky' uses for it that I haven't thought of.

  This is probably minor, but I dislike how the term magic is being used to represent both the 'motes' that are manipulated to perform spells and the spellcraft itself. I would have used 'mana' instead.
