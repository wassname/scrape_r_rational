    You know, I'm rereading the last chapter and it [really](http://i.imgur.com/wwc6fbg.png) reminds me of his style. Might just be influenced by him, though, or confirmation bias.

    Then again, I doubt he'd write [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2upavf/ffrst_the_waves_arisen_ch10/cob8kyb) if he was secretly the author.

    I also tried to find the guy back then and completely failed, I agree it's probably a throwaway identity, but why someone would bother writing an amazing story with one I don't know.

      That's exactly the sort of thing that Yudkowsky would write to throw you off the scent.

        I cannot confirm or deny that I am wertifloke.

          Theoretically speaking if you were wertifloke, would you happen to know where to find any writings of similar quality and/or style?
          ```

            In said theoretical scenario that list would equate to a list of the fictional writings of Eliezer Yudkowsky, yes?

              Already theoretically read all of those.

                So you are asking for stories similar to his writings? Maybe something like this then: https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3f9gly/list_of_stories_similar_to_hpmor/

        Want to do a comparative [stylometric analysis](https://psal.cs.drexel.edu/index.php/JStylo-Anonymouth#You-can-download-it-here)? (But if it *was* Yudkowsky, he'd probably be expecting that, and have used the other tool on the page to anonymize the writing. I wonder if the suggestions the Anonymouth tool makes are predictable enough to prove its usage—whether words are effectively re-attributed to the robot's particular style. That'd be evidence of *something*, at least.)

        One could also likely generate a stylistic signature for every corpus on FF.net to compare to, if one had the inclination.

          NOT PARANOID ENOUGH!

          http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3307, only with /u/EliezerYudkowsky instead of Hitler.

          ^I ^mean ^I ^guess ^a ^charismatic ^cult ^leader ^could ^come ^in ^handy ^*sometimes*, ^but ^it's ^getting ^a ^bit ^creepy ^guys.

            I mean, to be fair, I still don't know how Zach gets such accurate information.
            ```

    *Yudkowsky

    Also, it was posted from January to February of this year. Which a) was, AFAIK, months before Eliezer put up the thing about confirming or denying that authors were him, which seems unnecessarily risky (the other way around seems better), and b) was during the long sprint to the finish for HPMoR, which strains belief somewhat in terms of the writing productivity he'd have had to have.

  I had a similar thought a few months back.

  The author created the username Wertifloke specifically to post and promote The Waves Arisen on a few webesites, then never posted with that username again. From my research, Wertifloke isn't associated with anything else, or any other user. It was an identity created for The Waves Arisen and discarded immediately afterwards.

  I'm seven chapters in. It reads like an imitation of Eliezer's style, but not quite as interesting to read. I don't think it's him.

  Edit: I've finished reading the whole thing. Impressions unchanged. It had some funny parts, but I'm positive it's not Eliezer.

  ```
  I'm pretty sure it's Yudkowsky, especially this paragraph

  >It really hadn’t been that much unlike the case of the nine-tails—certainly not as much as he’d felt a minute ago. Sage mode *had* been playing tricks on his mind. He resolved that in future he would try to have shadow clones in existence as a precaution at all times, and he’d require all important decisions to be made *outside* the influence of sage mode, even if it seemed pointless to bother at the time—or, no, *especially* if it seemed like he shouldn’t bother. And if he ever caught himself trying to avoid even thinking about it so that he could stay in sage mode, that would initiate the emergency shutdown procedure, and his brain would unleash untold horrors upon itself.

  It just reads like his writing. It reads exactly like when Harry makes contingency plans.
