## [BST] [HF] What magics have *low* economic impact and *don't* revolutionize society?

### Post:

Whenever we introduce a form of magic into our fictional worlds, even a seemingly costly form of magic, we have to ask about the economic impact of people using that magic in the obvious way.

Is there a spell that creates a permanent Gate between two portals?  OH HOLY SMOKES DISTANCE IS MEANINGLESS transport costs drop prices equalize between all areas big boosts to specialization since a single factory can sell anywhere winner-take-all markets people can live anywhere so urban density drops and empires have an easy time extending their reach lots of immigration EVERYWHERE IS CULTURALLY AND RACIALLY HOMOGENOUS within a couple of centuries...

Even if that Gate requires sacrificing a hundred virgins to create, people are going to create enough of them - the advantages are just too large and immediate and visible, and any society that refuses do it will probably be crushed underfoot, etcetera.

So the converse question is:  What kinds of magic can you introduce into a setting *without* completely upsetting everything?  This depends to a significant degree on where the background falls in a Stone Age to urban fantasy setting; magic that allows for instant communication wouldn't revolutionize today's world, nor would magic that allows for expensive instant communication revolutionize a steampunk world with telegraphs, but it might be a significant thing to the Roman Empire.  Let's assume the background is Standard Medievalish Fantasyland but with slight urbanization or modernization being okay, so long as the Industrial Revolution doesn't start.

My thoughts on this so far:

- Destructive magic that isn't bomb-scale and can't be used to operate a steam engine, although plausibly they just don't yet have steam engines (those were admittedly invented considerably after fire).
- Magic that can create or copy things but is very expensive (too expensive to be used as a printing press)
- Health/medical magic that doesn't work for indefinite life extension.  If it works for contraception, that has large social effects and then starts having evolutionary effects in a couple of generations.

What we really ought to have is the entire rational dictionary of Magical Effects and their Economic Implications, but for now I'm just interested in arguments for which classic or novel types of magic are "relatively innocuous compared to Gate spells", and can have been in the hands of thousands of people for hundreds of years without implying an industrial or post-industrial society.

  It depends on what magic we're talking about, how expensive it is, how reliable it is, and who has access to it.

  * Only one hundred people can do magic at any given time, each day they use magic they have a one in a thousand chance of death. Low impact on setting relative to effects.

  * Everyone can learn magic but it's difficult enough that only nobility do, magic exhausts the user, and magic fails during certain astrological configurations. Medium impact on setting relative to effects.

  * Everyone can use magic, they get better with skill but the benefits are minor, there's no real cost. High impact on setting relative to effects.

  So if we had a dictionary of "Magical Effects and their Economic Implications" we would also have to include axes of difficulty. (You can't replace the horse with a spell if that spell has worse results than a horse.)

  There are spells like D&D's *Ghost Sound* that allow you to shout as loud as *four humans*, which does basically nothing when you can do it for ten minutes three times a day but can be harnessed for motive power if you can make that effect permanent.

  I think you're largely looking at efficiency per dollar, but in some circumstances that can be hard to calculate, especially when magic is doing things that can't otherwise be accomplished like reading minds, erasing memories, creating demiplanes and extradimensional spaces, etc.

  Edit: Take VirginGate, for example.

   * If VirginGate lasts for ten seconds then shuts down, it doesn't revolutionize the world, because you can't put enough stuff through it.
   * If VirginGate requires a million virgins, it doesn't revolutionize the world, because no one is going to be able to overcome the logistic costs associated with it.
   * If VirginGate atomizes 90% of the things that pass through it, it probably doesn't revolutionize the world, because you're taking an automatic 90% loss on putting things like armies or trade goods through it. Though I suppose you could still keep resending letters, so it still allows for long-range communication.

    So ,basically, impact of spell, as well as some piece of engineering IRL, depends on its cost and logistics associated. 

    Can't rules of thinking about mundane technology impact be applied to magic as well? Is there even a *categorical* and not *numerical* difference between how we should think about impact of wheel on our history and Gate on some fictional setting, for example? Yes, Gate may be faster etc, but they are both tools for enhancing mobility and bring nothing new in principle, only in (important, but still) details such as speed. 

    So question boils down to "What costs/limitations should be assigned to spells to avoid breaking setting down?", doesn't it?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Yeah, the big issue is when you start bringing in effects that don't have an analog, like shape shifting, mind reading, mind control, enforced truth, memory erasure, and things like that, where you can't really boil it down to *just* cost and logistics.

    > that can be hard to calculate

    Use the socioeconomic effects rather than the physical/magical ones. They'll probably have the same effects as if there was a purely science-based product/device which offered the same change to process.

    Also, if VirginGate lasts for ten seconds *reliably*, it still has 90% of the functionality of a permanently open gate. In ten seconds, you can put a high-speed train or other timed cargo carrier through it. You can also put people in elevators and drop them through it. You can deliver most small to medium items. You can pour sand, grain, oil, water, and all sorts of other things through it, even if you leave half a second either side for testing/checking.

    It becomes a matter of how much volume you can stuff through a gate, or series of gates, or set of parallel gates, per 24 hours (or per quarter) per dollar. If the cost is high, then it's going to be used sparingly - only by governments, militaries, and very wealthy people/corporations. If the cost is low but the volume is also low, it's only going to be used to transport things which are valuable for their size or would benefit from immediate transport. It would still revolutionize communication. If the cost per gate opening is high but you can put a *lot* of volume through it before it closes, it might be used by primary industry and for long-distance bulk transport - think international airports and ports rather than domestic ones. And so on.

    Tangent: there was a hilarious /r/dnd post about a guy whose party arranged for a whole team of people to scream at the main villain 24-7 with this spell.

    Your restrictions can reduce the impact of almost anything. If the cost is low and risk is low but the impact is still small that would be a more interesting answer.

    Before steam power, a 90% loss would still be worth it on many trade goods.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I was thinking about this in the shower last night. For a 90% loss to be economical, transportation needs to make up more than 90% of the cost of the trade good at its destination. My mind went to the Silk Road, meaning spices and textiles, and the triangular trade across the Atlantic, meaning slaves and tobacco. I didn't remember to look it up until now, but it's really hard to find prices for things before steam power, let alone *relative* prices for things that are quite far from each other and using different currencies. 

      (I believe slaves were the more valuable commodity to go across the oceans, mostly due to excess supply caused by ethnic wars. There are great numbers available about the cost of slaves at their destination, but a paucity of numbers about the cost of slaves at their source. I don't have too much trouble believing that transport costs were 90% of total cost though, but owing to fluctuating currency conversions it's tough to say, and I'd have to subtract profit margins as well, and we can't assume the portal is a perfectly frictionless mechanism for trade with none of its own costs.)

      At any rate it's not clear to me which trade goods would have been worth it. That aside, *useful* is very different than *revolutionary*. A portal that reduces the cost of transport by some fraction (even by half) would change the shape of history but not actually make a society undergo something equivalent to the Industrial Revolution.
      ```

      - u/Uncaffeinated:
        ```
        I suppose it depends a lot on the particular time and place. I think spices would have been worth that much for most of history though.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          Like I said, I've been looking around trying to get some actual numbers and they're hard to find. If someone would just say "In 1660 a pound of cinnamon cost the equivalent of £10 and sold in London for the equivalent of £110, with transportation making up 91% of the increased cost" then we'd know for sure, but so far I haven't found anything that goes into that much detail.

          African slaves were more profitable than spices for a long period of time, but the closest that I can get is finding the price of a slave in South Carolina and comparing it against the price of a slave sold in Zanzibar (both places with relatively good record keeping). If I had a few weeks to work on it I might be able to make a chart of the difference in price, but that would mean trying to figure out the exchange rate of Maria Theresa thalers (used in Zanzibar) with the three varieties of currency used in South Carolina. My best guess is that there were a few decades where you could buy a slave for one money unit and sell a slave for ten money units, but that this was by no means constant.

          And ten to one doesn't actually cover it, because a few of the sources of increased cost remain, including the cost of transporting payment or personnel over that distance, export tax, import tax, etc. Which would be more weeks of work to figure out and would depend on some of the particulars of the portal.

          Anyway, that's all sort of moot because the big difference between historic trade routes and the annihilation portal is that they value different things. If you're moving goods by caravan or by sea, what you most care about is profit per pound, because it costs you £X to get 100 tonnes from Sri Lanka to London. With the portal, the thing you care most about is relative price, because it costs you price of goods in Sri Lanka times nine to get any number of tonnes from Sri Lanka to London. If a thousand tonnes of some material is £1 in Sri Lanka and £100 in London, then it's completely unprofitable to ship (the average 17th century sailing ship would gain £99 from the trip, which wouldn't be enough to cover crew/supplies/repairs) but wildly profitable to portal.

    If it provable atomizes exactly 9/10 items, and the 10th item in the sequence goes through every time, you could just chuck filler material through there.

    10 seconds then shuts down would work really well for FTL travel or extremely high data transfer rates in a modern, digital society. Just chuck some raid arrays through there - bam, extremely high speed short duration data transfer. Copy of wikipedia sent to space colonies?

  What about something like "turn rocks into gold" as a non-trivial answer? I'd you've got a society that uses a literal gold standard, a naive reader might think this is instant wealth, etc. But my understanding is that gold's value was a combination of rarity, prettiness, malleability and, hence, desirability by true wealthy types. (Or is that a "just so" story?) 

  So while valuable if the spell is unknown to most people (and not overused, so that wizards are still price takers), once widely available, you'd see inflationary effects and/or a move to a different metal for money, and things wouldn't change much. Gold jewellery would become as common as plastic earrings are to us, although it would still take work to produce, houses might have more guiding (but, again, work requirements would limit it, etc.) 

  No doubt it's even more complicated (how many wizards are there?) but I can't see it transforming the world. Thoughts?
  ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    ~~Without its rarity, gold is essentially useless to a medieval society, I believe.~~ It wouldn't just be jewelry, it would be cheap jewelry for peasants. The upper classes would be wearing copper or aluminium, perhaps.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      Gold's got a bunch of useful characteristics.

      OK, what could you do with gold in medieval societies if it were actually cheaper than rocks.

      Gold is non-tarnishing and easy to make watertight. You'd cover roofs with it. You'd cover outside walls with it. It's malleable, so it'll wear off, but it's also easy to repair.

      Gold is heavy. It makes great ballast for boats. It makes great ballistic weapons - bullets, cannonballs. It's not really strong enough for arrowheads.

      Gold is watertight and malleable. Gold piping would be used everywhere, canals and tanks would be lined with the stuff. Poor farmers would use it to line and cover their irrigation ditches.

      You can beat gold thin enough it's transparent. Gold foil isn't all that strong, but it's durable. It would be used instead of paper for long term record keeping.
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        Gold pipes obviously dont poison their users over time, as opposed to lead pipes. 

        No more robbing teeth from the dead for tooth replacement, just use gold. 

        If its really ubiquitious you might try to enhance your cobblestone roads with it.
        ```

        - u/ArgentStonecutter:
          ```
          Another one I thought of driving home. You would use the spell for mining and tunneling and road construction. It's easier to dig into gold than rocks, so you'd turn the rock into gold and dig it out with picks or melt it out with fire. If you could control it well enough you could cast the spell into a plane *behind* a rock face and peel off a layer of marble veneer that would be more valuable than gold.
          ```

          - u/Xtraordinaire:
            ```
            I guess it could also work for destructive purposes. Turning critical pieces of stone buildings like castles, cathedrals, bridges and later sky-scrapers will probably result in destruction of said building. Medieval sieges could be very different.
            ```

            - u/ArgentStonecutter:
              ```
              Good point.

              Heck, how about turning _people_ into gold?
              ```

              - u/alexanderwales:
                ```
                I think that most magics that don't have firm bounds on them can become Endbringer class by just amping them up. If you start with "turning things into gold" then the impact it has depends on the range, control, etc. A spell that you can cast three times a day to turn a touched piece of rock not greater than a cubic foot into gold is pretty minor if everyone can do it. Being able to freely turn *anything* within line-of-sight into gold at the speed of thought destroys civilizations. Same goes if you're limited to stone but stone includes things that are in the human body. If rock includes "[mineralized tissues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralized_tissues)" and the spell requires no line-of-sight and can be done at great range, then you could seriously injure a person.

                Mostly I think it's difficult to find an effect that's not revolutionary once you start lifting some of the explicit or implicit restrictions. "Create light" is implied (or explicitly) something like torchlight, limited to line-of-sight or close by, not stackable, difficult to make images with, only in the visible spectrum, etc. But once you start lifting those, you get revolutions in dozens of different directions.
                ```

                  Like in that Niven story where Beowulf Schaeffer discovers the Core Explosion, and spends some time trying to remember if any of the Puppeteer's customer species can see in X-Ray, since his ship's hull is designed to be "transparent" for all of them.

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    Now there's an interesting question.  Is there anything world-breaking you could do in a world (that's already adapted to the magic, not our world, so no stock market shenanigans) where divination spells can only be asked binary questions, are 60% accurate, and multiple castings by different people with related questions make correlated errors?
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      Another way of looking at this is that the oracle only provides evidence with 0.6:0.4 likelihood ratios.  You ask "Is my spouse cheating on me?" and the answer is yes, but you were only 1.5 times as likely to get that question in cheating scenarios than in non-cheating scenarios, so if your prior was lower than 40% it should still be under 50% after hearing the new evidence.  It seems like society could survive that, especially since people would know many many cases of divinations being wrong - they might even have started to grasp the concept of prior odds.

          More importantly, it would be much easier to decide which research to pursue. A 60% guarantee that there is a meaningful effect to investigate or that a given research path would reveal the source of an effect would be a tremendous boost to any proto-sciences being developed.

      How closely correlated are the answers? And how smart is the spell-engine? ("Was the answer to my previous query accurate?")

      If it wasn't a deal breaker, it would lead to some interesting effects, at the very least, with level 1 intelligent characters. Information theory would be developed much earlier than otherwise, at least. OTOH, this is how a fair amount of nonrational!fic, and possibly historical humanity, treats divination and similar methods, and no-one thought of this, so maybe not.

      More seriously, it would probably eliminate (high stakes) games of chance; there is too much people can do to break them. Or at least, it would change them in interesting ways. Hmmm...

    - u/thesteamboat:
      ```
      With a source of randomness (which worked independent of the casting) you can do [boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_\(machine_learning\)) to get near perfect oracles. E.g. Is the answer to my question yes XOR this next coin flip comes up heads.

      The usual causal loop outcome pump tricks would still be potentially useful. It wouldn't be as strong an effect, but would still at least allow nontrivial tweaking of probabilities. Wouldn't be _as_ powerful, but depending on specifics of how it worked, could still potentially let someone clever tell thermodynamics to go jump in a lake, among other things.

      Security/espionage/etc would have to adapt to that possibility. The usual "code words"/challenge-response protocols would be risky for any higher security thing if this trick could be abused to have at least a reasonable chance of successful infiltration.

      These are just some possibilities off the top of my head.

      A possible countermeasure for the infiltration thing would be for the security people to do the divination themselves. Depending on how correlated the errors tend to be, you could predict a vulnerability in advance.

      Actually, investigating ways to abuse the fact of correlation of errors between related queries seems like a general thing to consider.

      Shipping and weather forecasts. Field management. Fewer lost ships makes trade cheaper and easier. Explorations and expeditions safer. Stock up on trade goods more likely to sell high. If you take the 60/40/on a large stack of goods, your margins almost certainly go up. Chemistry and medications become better tested. More dyes with rare ingredients get developed. More and cheaper metals from better mine site selection...

    - u/None:
      ```
      As others here pointed out, it really depends on exactly what "correlated errors" means. 

      It makes perfect sense to interpret this as meaning that identical questions get identical answers. But what if X and Y are events and I ask "will at least one of X and Y happen?" How should that correlate with asking whether X happens, whether Y happens, whether both X and Y happen?
      ```

    - u/MaxChaplin:
      ```
      It depends on how correlated. You could test it with questions like "Will a mathematician from [city name here] prove that 2+2=3?" and "Will my [body part name here] be on the moon tomorrow?" to see whether the answer ratio is 60%/40%, 100%/0% or something in between. After finding the conditions for correlation, prophets could start process akin to crystallization: starting from a question with an obviously true (false) answer, they'd ask slightly modified questions which get similarly true (false) answers, thus expanding the truth-crystal (bullshit-crystal) throughout the answerspace.

What is the first bit of its output?" Repeat for second, etcetera. If there is an exploit, this finds it. Depending on how chaos theory works, I expect a Simurgh song optimizing the world a fraction of a bit at a time, or a grainy black and white picture of the perfect plan (because I happened to fill the output into squared paper).

          It can predict that each bit of output has a 40% chance of being flipped, and adjust the output it sends accordingly. (By the way, this doesn't even need to be AIXI, just the AI from [that Computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcdVC4e6EV4&feature=youtu.be&t=153), since it has a perfect model of reality by definition)

      ```
      The daemons depicted in *His Dark Materials* were as physically powerful as the animal they took the form of, but there was an extreme, pan-cultural taboo against a human touching the daemon of another person. Daemons can touch daemons (indeed it's part of courting rituals), but pretty much only married couples touch each others daemons, and even then it's salacious.

      Soldiers have wolf daemons, but the wolves only fight other soldiers' daemons. The dog daemons belonging to cops do doglike things, but they're not going to bite a human. They might trap the human's daemon, though.
      ```

      - u/Geminii27:
        ```
        Which is a huge cultural weakness. Anyone wanting to conquer them would simply attack/capture the daemons. They might even bring trained non-daemon animals of their own, effectively allowing them to field two armies that looked to the enemy like one.

        I mean, hell. Send in your trained wolves / wardogs / whatever as a rush. The opponents' social conditioning means that their human soldiers, and thus the bulk of their weapons, don't get deployed. Their daemons are smarter, yes, but they're also constrained with the distance they can wander from their humans, making them slower to cover ground. Even if your entire wardog division is destroyed, they might lose 30% of their daemons *and thus 30% of their humans*. Meanwhile, your human army has zero casualties, isn't needing to take care of wounded or deal with piled-up corpses, and hasn't just come out of a pitched battle.

        (Come to think of it, given that your wardogs would be that much faster over terrain than your opponents' armies, why not send them into your opponent's camp equipped with timed-release poisons and biological agents (or explosives, if you have them)? Or infect them with something nasty before the charge?)

        Then, of course, once you send in your humans, their daemons might be conditioned not to attack you (if they're OK with attacking daemonless humans, you can release a bunch of dumb wildlife onto the battlefield to take up their attention) - but you have no such restriction.
        ```

          > trained non-daemon animals of their own

          > you can release a bunch of dumb wildlife onto the battlefield to take up their attention

          The problem with this idea is that, canonically, animals and daemons recognize each other as *other*. Animals know that daemons aren't animals, even if you have a sparrow daemon sitting next to a sparrow. The sparrow is going to fly off. This is (headcanonically) the result of thirty-three years of evolutionary pressure caused by daemonically-assisted hunting and also (maybe canonically) because daemons dissolve into gold sparkles when their human dies. I think that humans are also able to differentiate daemons from animals, but i'm not certain if that's covered in the books. Generally a daemon without its human would be more willing to speak.

          But aside from that, the wardog approach to warfare is the equivalent of near-future dorne/robot warfare. Send in the non-humans, because they'll kill the humans. If it's a feasible technique, then any up-to-date military will have a nonhuman assets program, just like any up-to-date military will have machine guns and training in enfilade fire.

      I think the overall impact vis-a-vis Progress or Quality of Life would still be pretty low, since there aren't a *lot* of tasks a human population needs done that what basically amounts to a random distribution of frolicking woodland creatures can do significantly better, and historically, humans *have* domesticated animals for exactly those reasons.

      Maybe it turns out that tiny monkeys with human-level intelligence are good at building tiny computers, or something, but I'm not convinced a society containing tiny monkeys with human-level intelligence will think of *inventing* tiny computers significantly earlier.

      Water breathing in Skyrim requires level 50 Alteration, so it would only be usable by people with substantial training (halfway to perfection). Probably useful for fishermen, but it only lasts 60 seconds so it probably wouldn't help with transportation, unless it was just a small team of amphibious troops crossing rivers or whatever.

      Probably some battles go differently, perhaps a few fewer people die of starvation in rural fishing communities, but I don't think it would be a huge shift if it were very difficult.

    Do you realize how useful those spells are? 

    * Candlelight: Instant light bulb anywhere without need for electricity, you could use it to do stuff at night like read, build, etc.

          It'd let people read at night and when they were inside with no source of light. It'd allow cellars and enclosed rooms to be useful without needing torches or lanterns to be brought in, maintained, and replaced.

      I think "Candlelight" actually fits the requirements if the result is really only as bright as a candle and one person can only cast one such spell. Sure, people wouldn't buy (as much) candles anymore but I don't think candles were that expensive to begin with (they can be made from animal fat).

      Another necessary restriction might be that the spell can't be cast in quick succession otherwise it could be used for Morse code.
      ```

      - u/Phhhhuh:
        ```
        Morse code is rather easy to do without magic: a flame in a lantern/container, quickly move a shutter back and forth to block the light from the viewer. Humans have been able to do that since forever. It has short range, and almost zero range at daytime.
        ```

    - u/Phhhhuh:
      ```
      Candlelight, Muffle and Waterbreathing are practical, but not society-breaking in any way. What would they revolutionise? No business for candlemakers.

  Illusion magic in a limiting aspect would simply improve entertainment. It would be easily identified as an illusion so you couldn't use it to deceive or bluff. It can't be permanent so you can't create hidden entrances, or even better a permanent repository of knowledge that can't be destroyed conventionally.

  It can only be cast a short distance. It obviously would still improve communication. This could be limited for example by the magic needing to be put on something physical like a piece of paper first, so the cost of sending messages wouldn't lessen.

  I'm sure it could still be used for psychological warfare or torture such as showing something grotesque but as I said before illusions would be easily identified by any layman.

  It can't provide any form of lighting otherwise you could produce cheap illumination. Maybe you could eventually allow it such as coming with the same cost as flash powder or similar things, but depending on the setting it couldn't provide lighting unless someone is nearby to maintain it constantly. Something like having a light in your hand, but the effort is so much that it can't be maintained that long.

  It may be okay to let it improve documentation such as conjuring an image of an animal nobody else has seen before long enough for someone to sketch it onto paper. This would allow someone that does that to send teams of illusionists into the world to document things and come back with the results, but it obviously is still coming with the cost of simply having a team of sketch artists do the same thing.

  I hope I've covered enough on the magic and how to limit it properly.

  Any magic that operates on an absolute ("instant" anything, subverting the idea of relative time, "unbreakable" anything, subverting the idea of force or erosion, "anywhere" effects, subverting the idea of distance/space, etc) can and will break society-as-we-know-it once a munchkin of sufficient intelligence is born to recognize the non-obvious advantages it can be used for.

  On the other hand, magic that just makes doing things more expedient/easy can be fairly low impact and not utterly upsetting the economy/society, assuming the person gaining the ability/training it is rare enough to be treated like a super-specialized professional. 

  Some ideas:

  * Botany Magic. Basically being able to do what we do with careful breeding and genetic engineering of plants, but more "intuitively" and faster.  It could create very nutritious and high yield crops, effective medicines, deadly poisons, etc, but wouldn't really "break" society unless users start making chimera creatures that cross animal kingdoms, which could be restricted by arbitrary "the magic only works on plants" type of rules, or less arbitrary reasons why doing it with less "simple" organisms is much harder and unpredictable.

  * Illusion Magic of almost any kind. A team working in tandem that can create sounds, smells, sights and so on can revolutionize entertainment and alter how wars are fought (depending on how big/massively affecting the illusions can be), but in general being able to make people perceive things you can imagine doesn't usually break much in society.

  * Telepathy Magic, as long as it's sufficiently distance restricted and doesn't grant sapience/intelligence to the receiver. It would make  any activity dealing with animals much easier (being able to know that your dog is barking because it smells what it identifies as another dog versus a potential home invader), including domestication and using trained animals in more specialized situations, from construction to cartography to warfare.

Bureaucratic and multiperson systems which operate based on one person seeing the results of another person's work (not so much in terms of a dense stack of text, but more along the lines of "I see that the mail-sorting team has placed no items in Master Importantdude's pigeonhole this morning, so I don't need to carry anything to his desk."

      To be honest, most fantasy kind of requires a suspension of disbelief when it comes to a lot of what we consider mundane details of living in a pre-modern world, not to mention population and resource logistics. Cities with even a hundred thousand people, let alone multiple cities with hundreds of thousands, were practically nonexistent, and even rich kingdoms with arable climates had to devote hundreds of miles of land between cities to farming just to maintain their population. Any food more luxurious than bread or rice and stew would be almost unheard of for the vast majority of the population, and the amount of time the average person had to spend worrying about food opposed to doing "basic" other things like learning to read is almost completely ignored. Not to mention how prevalent and crippling the multitude of physical ailments and diseases were.

      Magic botany would go a long way toward increasing the standard of living and population sizes from "realistic medieval" to what we might consider "standard fantasy" in any given story with that setting. Whether it accelerates things to the modern era or not I think is a different question: certainly it makes it easier to reach it, but the presence of other threats (say, roaming packs of goblins or magical creatures making life or trade difficult and requiring resources devoted to protection) would be a separate obstacle to offset the ease of acquiring food.

  > Health/medical magic that doesn't work for indefinite life extension. 

  Eh, I'm pretty sure that any medical magic, even if it just gave this medieval society access to the equivalent of current day medical technology, would be pretty damn revolutionary, it doesn't have to be indefinite life extension. If the child mortality gets reduced family size can be reduced allowing parents to invest more into each child which ends up effecting pretty much everything in society.

  ----

  Anyway regarding non revolutionary magic. I'm not sure if such a thing can exists, the mere existence of magic ought to revolutionize our understanding of the world. Even if the magic only allows us to do things we are already capable of through mundane means but at a far greater cost, it would still be a worthwhile field of study with who known what kind of ramifications.

  Though the first thing that comes to mind, if I recall correctly, is early Discworld books magic which by magical law can never be any more efficient or cost effective than a mundane approach, kinda cheating. 

  Second thing is the fey magic in Tad William's War of the Flowers, where the magical fey society somehow only manages to become a slightly outdated equivalent of human society. Though I don't remember if this was just due to some kind of societal inertia, or creative sterility on part of the fey, or some cosmic/magical law that states that the mundane human and magical fey worlds need to be reflections of one another.

  I see a difficulty in the presentation of the problem.  Is magic merely a sufficiently advanced technology, or is it a physics breaking phenomenon?  Physics breaking, in any form, is likely an economic unbalancing.

  For example.  A person who can cast magic missile is potentially creating energy from nothing.  With enough time and ingenuity, there will be infinite energy.  Infinite energy means infinite matter and the ability to create whatever you want.  No economy.

  The counter-argument to your 100 virgins for a gate is that a village of 50 people would never pay that price.  So, cost is always the limiting factor.  There must be a price for everything.  Conservation must hold.

  The economic breaking aspects of magic are almost entirely tied to breaking the law of conservation.  There lies the question/secret.  What is the cost of a super-power?

The fact that their energy comes from splitting atoms rather than from nowhere doesn't really enter into it. Earth is not a closed system. Huge amounts of energy are being added from the sun all the time. No fantasy world I've seen produces energy on a scale that would hold a candle to that energy input.

  Even if you don't allow magics that trigger technological revolutions, technological revolutions happen anyway. Society is never stable. OK, we've just invented magical teleport gates. For a while they're going to be rare, so you can put your story in the transition period. Or you can nerf the gates:

  * They're permanent but still require maintenance. That maintenance costs a lot of time and money. If you don't maintain the gate, it starts randomizing things that go through.
  * They're permanent but decay. Everything that goes through the gate shrinks it, just a little. Old gates are no more than a few centimeters wide, and are telegraphs or mail slots.
  * They're permanent and stable, but the first gate in a region makes it harder to set up more gates. After a while you can't set up any more gates. Some places are gateless because saboteurs set up a bunch of short hop gates that are just as much of a problem as longjump ones. Other places are stuck with gates to places that are no longer worth traveling to.
  * They're permanent and stable, but they interfere with each other. After a while you have too many gates in an area, and you can't rely on them, you come out the wrong place, or don't come out at all. You end up with expanding "dead patches" that you can't gate into surrounded by newer still-reliable gates outside the interference limit. 

  But "small magics"?

  * Magic that enhances the flavor of food. Other mild sensory enhancements and euphorics.
  * Magic that glues things together, not too strongly. It does make cloth stronger, and it's useful for putting up notices. You can't use it to climb walls... it's a permanent attraction between two objects, not a "sticky pad".
  * Magic that pushes things apart, not too strongly. You can use it to improve bearings, but it's not strong enough to make a hoverboard.
  * Magic that sets the state of an object and lets you reset it to that state. Then you have to cast it again. There's limits to how much change it can reset, and how often it can be done, and it doesn't work on living things... but you cast it on new clothes and take them to a magical laundry to make it "like new" again. Also great for secret messages.

  Turning humans into other animals, assuming:

  * Vertebrates only. Cell cultures do not count.
  * The process is somewhat difficult, and to do so requires sympathetic items of the target, several minutes of preparation, direct visual contact and/or ingestion of a substance, and the sacrifice of a healthy individual of the chosen species.
  * The target does not retain any of the knowledge, goals, or personality of their original form.
  * The transformed target starts out proportionately satiated and aged to the original human form.
  * The process can be reversed. This requires equivalent preparation to the initial transformation. The target retains the experiential memories of being transformed, but through the perspective of the target species. Interpreting this is a hard process which takes several years of training, and is roughly like learning to control a limb after moderate brain damage. Difficulty is proportional to genetic distance from humans.
  * There is a significant "recovery time" which is equivalent to suffering mild trauma.
  * You can only choose a species, and have no control over the exact appearance of the chosen form. The appearance varies with each transformation.
  * While transformed, the target has the metabolism, vitality, and lifespan of the chosen species. Injuries and aging sustained while transformed carry across proportionately and to developmentally analogous anatomy.

  This is not too distant from examples encountered in literature and folklore.

    I like it. In old russian tales werewolves were actualy wizards that knew how to turn into an animal.

    I believe even a transformation that retains knowledge will change little in a society. (IMO the way you made your spell is just a more fancy way to torture/kill someone, totaly worthless,  I don't see its long time effects on a society)

    This ability would be helpful while obtaining food from a forest so only useful in small villages, not impacting the develpment of the setting. Other then that it can be a powerful weapon in time of war,  It would make melee more deadly so giving lot of possibilities on how warfare changed to fight agaisnt such beasts, without revolutionazing the same way gusn did. In the form of a bird it can be used to spy, which will lead to paranoia towards animals (religious fanatics that want to kill ALL Vertebrates, vegans on steroids)

      Retaining human cognition effectively gives you a way to very simply super-domesticate anything. This gives us:

      * Warfare changes drastically as you can use elephants as combat engineers. Castles are no longer viable. Riderless horses can trek across vast steppes, making logistics much simpler. The Mongol-equivalents find it even easier to steamroll civilizations than in OTL.
      * Access to the seas and oceans allows for entirely new forms of infrastructure and warfare. Aquaculture is entirely feasible, gives access to rich fertilizers, and encourages further marine exploitation. Whales with pikes are left as an exercise to the reader.
      * Turn your most of your serf population into ground squirrels and have them hibernate for the winter! (This one is actually possible even without retaining human intelligence, but making them easier to corral might make the difference in terms of utility.)

  Water purification (a standard Cleric spell) would impact the alcohol industry (beer and wine), but relatively little else.

  Some kind of personal invulnerability shield would probably do OK, as long as it's rare enough to be limited to a few specific individuals. 

  A spell to summon diseases or plagues.

  Any spell that creates a human, or a humanlike creature, to order - or with specific properties, like a demonic self-serving adviser -could *probably* be tailored so as to be similar to simply hiring someone from the existing labour pool. (Requires expensive materials, can't produce people who are too exceptional/impressive, random component etc.)

  An "evil genie" mind control/reading spell, as an analogy for torture. You'd need to make it costly enough, obviously, but torture is already a thing. (We can say with reasonable confidence, looking at history, that it would be implemented in an incredibly slapdash and irrational manner by almost everyone, so that's nice.)

  Healing spells *would* have huge effects, honestly. You've got the ability to cure STDs; you've got reliable medical care for the rich (where before they had only quacks and charlatans, pretty much); you've got unknown and as-yet unmeasured effects on intelligence, political views, and God only knows what else from growing up with lower parasite load ... actually, that might explain the usual tendency for pseudo-medieval worlds to be populated by pseudo-modern *people*, with sexual equality and such.

  The standard D&D *raise dead*, where it can't raise those killed by old age and requires 5,000gp worth of diamonds or whatever, is probably fine.

  I'm not certain, but I think a *Perpetual Light* AKA lightbulb spell wouldn't break anything important.

  Any kind of "illusion" spell with purely entertainment/data visualization applications, like a spell that shapes smoke or fire into particular forms.

  Any magic with a co-introduction of sufficient counterbalancing. While this could be an intrinsic limiter to the magic itself (e.g. costs years of your lifespan), it could also be a second magic. This would circumvent your limitation clause, though add a conditional one. 

  The nature of the interaction between a proactive magic and its counterbalance is interesting. The counterbalance needs to be intrinsically more powerful than the proactive magic unless that magic is not that powerful (such as Yudkowsky's destructive magic example). The reason for this is that an option introduced, no matter how weak, is strictly a buff. Even if a counterbalance works 100% of the time you've still given people an option they didn't have before given isolation from counter-mechanism. If I cast bull’s strength and any person who sees it can purge it at will, I'm still a more effective laborer in my own time, or among cooperative people. There's no drawback to bull's strength, even if it's ineffective in combat. Conversely, invisibility vs. an AoE negation gives the potential for punishment, which, depending on the method of delivery, could limit the practical application of invisibility to honest work (hunting for instance), a non-impact. 

  Generalising from here, I think that any magic that produces value without pissing someone off is difficult to counterbalance using the introduction of a second magic.

  Do you mean by "upsetting everything" radical change or specifically radical change in a good direction?

  And is means of getting/inheriting etc part of this question?

  I can think of a few magics which would prevent the enlightenment or even undo it.

  For example hereditary super speed/reflexes like in Naruto (even without ninjutsu) would render guns worthless as equalizer.

  Supernatural things in general would make the clergy more of a problem.

  And a Interdict of Merlin amped up to 11 would blur ALL written things.
  ```

  - u/derefr:
    ```
    Presumably, "radical change" means the carefully-crafted story setting falling apart and turning into something else too quickly to tell the story, or to leave open the possibility for telling further stories in that canon.

    Naruto's world definitely has one of those "settings that would fall apart", as demonstrated in *The Waves Arisen*: someone sufficiently motivated to "just put together what's in front of them"—without any novel research or large-scale engineering!—could completely reshape the Naruto world into something that's worthless for telling stories about ancient clans having Ninjutsu battles.

    Any setting that *has* an "eschaton" event in the story is one where eschatons are already really quite easy to trigger, in the same sense that memorized spells in D&D are quite easy to trigger—almost all the work of "casting" the spell has already been done. *Neon Genesis Evangelion* in all of its incarnations demonstrates this quite well: the story is basically about the protagonists trying to *avoid* an eschaton that really, really wants to happen. Through the various media, the heroes repeatedly start it up *accidentally* in *different* ways, and then have to clean up the mess.

    I'm not as sure about eschaton events that aren't exactly due to power 'harnessable' by any mere human. *Chrono Trigger*'s apocalypse-event is pretty easy for various parties (Queen Zeal; Magus) to trigger, but it's more the kind of "trigger" that involves prodding a paperclip-maximizer to get on with its paperclip-maximizing already. It's really only the paperclip-maximizer itself that has enough power to destabilize the setting, and it gets to "decide" the rules for what will or won't set it off, based on its own goal-tree. Unlike *Evangelion*'s Instrumentality, you can't really *predict* Lavos as if it were a law of physics, which means you can't really *harness* Lavos to your own ends (as Queen Zeal found out.) It's less "nuclear bomb" and more "evil god."

    And, to emphasize the point of the linked article: *reality* is a really good example of something that *won't* fall apart very easily. If it was easy enough to create e.g. grey goo that can unilaterally outcompete all other life, nature would have already happened onto the formula and we wouldn't be here. Every low-level phenomenon we study in labs is already happening (or has already happened) somewhere in the universe by pure chance; every particle we produce in particle accelerators has likely already been produced. We're not going to blow up the world just by making a new one. We might blow up the world by a *concentrated effort to apply those principles*—plutonium decays in the Earth's crust all the time, but never in concentrations enough for supercriticality—but it's infinitesimally unlikely that there's anything laying around our universe that we might accidentally "activate" to our doom.

    (Unless, that is, it was built by some other sentient race, who "cast the spell" for us. I feel increasingly wary of the idea of life being possible in a universe that *doesn't* necessitate the Fermi paradox; imagine if, ala *2001*, there really *were* precursor-race artifacts left laying around for cavemen to find.)

      (The reason why molecular-nanotech grey goo doesn't happen accidentally is that proteins, which must be evolvable out of other proteins by mistake, are held together by weak van der Waals forces rather than covalent bonds.  This is why steel and diamond are so much stronger than bone, but don't get used in the body.  Nanotech grey goo is to bacteria what diamond is to flesh.  But your logic holds for grey goo that was made from amino-acid-chain folding proteins.)

        That's not entirely true, first Proteins are held together with covalent bonds, ionic interactions, van der Waals forces and even steric effects (their shape prevents them from unfolding in certain ways). Secondly the idea that proteins are less strong than steel because they are made with covalent bonds suggests you haven't been looking at spiders and their silk very closely. Thirdly I don't know on what scale you think Nanotech is but anything smaller than a protein seemingly can't be specific enough to do anything to other molecules in a controlled way, not to say it's impossible but it's also not magic.

        Right, I more meant to imply that none of the chemistry that goes on on Earth—organic or inorganic—has any simple route to building a parallel evolutionary process for molecular nanotechnology. So you'll never "stumble onto" grey goo by throwing chemicals together in a lab. It'd take *extensive R&D* to develop grey goo.

        I don't mean to imply that it would take *Manhattan Project* levels of R&D, though. It's possible that grey goo is something that someone living in 2050 could solve the engineering challenges for in their basement over the course of a few years—somewhat like the most scary hypotheticals for uFAI. But it's not just sitting there as a corner-case in chemistry, the way an [energy virus](http://qntm.org/nine) would be a corner-case in quantum physics. There's no single misstep we could make that would result in grey goo. It'd have to be a *large number* of missteps. (Or a single misstep at the very end of the path to some useful technology that happens to be 99% similar to grey goo.)

  But if you replace virgins with something worth 10xGDP of a typical nation, the gates suddenly won't be popping like mushrooms. Another common gamedesign trick is making each Portal price grow exponentially.

  Magical effects from the World of Darkness series of games and books etc. are protected from the most of society through a series of taboos mostly but also an incredibly powerful effect called The Veil which may or may not be maintained by Satan, it's a long and interesting story. 

  Those mages who have access to magic that is controllable in a very useful fashion, as opposed to Vampires and Werewolves whose magic is more inbuilt and generally very inflexible, have the common problem of spells that only work when you believe in them. The overarching plot of Mage:the Ascension is the idea that traditional Mages are being pushed into obsolescence by the Technocracy who are Mages that use super-science which is simply a different name for magic but who success allows the world to advance behind them and grow technologically. 

  So if you make magic harder the less plausible it is you also vastly reduce its effects on your setting by giving the setting primacy over magic rather than the other way round. World of Darkness's setting runs on the expectations of it's residents but only so far as the plot allows, I find it interesting to think about though.

  So, I'm going to regret this, but hey, try to exploit this power.

  You can transmute a volume of wood to an equal volume of rough-fired ceramic, and back. The object has to be lifted single-handedly, so that your arm is the only thing supporting the weight of the wood/ceramic, and the wood/ceramic has to be freefloating in air and not supported against gravity by any major forces other than your arm.

  I honestly can't think of anything insanely clever to do with this. Make pots out of coconut shells??? Make neat looking wood objects by sculpting and then transmuting clay??? Some sort of... weapon that uses easily-replenished single-use ceramic blades, like obsidian-edged swords? Try to make money by transmuting wood to clay and then to really expensive wood (except that'd just crash the economy for expensive wood or expensive porcelain since lots of people can do it, and both of those things are just luxury materials for artwork anyways)???

  Someone prove me wrong. There's PROBABLY something cool you can do with this but as far as I can think of, it's as innocuous a cantrip as it gets.

    -Arm has to support 
    * reinforce arm 


    - can change wood to ceramic, reversible 
    * well, that's a change in hardness, so there might be something that can exploit that 
    * I wonder what ceramic can be used for, since we have *lots* of wood

  Certain kinds of magic may actually lock society into the "Standard Medievalish Fantasyland" civilization.

  See Brin's [_The Practice Effect_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Practice_Effect) for one example.
