## [RT][HSF] Exo a Novel (Jumper)

### Post:

So much science so little time. Anyway its the 4th book in the Jumper series. 

Deals with Cent, a girl with a teleportation power, which she uses for space exploration and related activities. Also contains some crafty solutions for various problems. Contains some ammounts of hand-wave science though, but otherwise is pretty spot on in terms of space protocols, hazards and problems. Plot is okayish, but it spends a lot of time on space talk and actions. 

I am reading it right now and I am halfway trough so I cant say if its completely good or not. I haven't read the previous 3 books so I can't tell if they are good too. 

Original recommendation credit goes to /u/alexanderwales.

  I have read the previous three books, and they are very good.  The characters act sensibly, there's good development of motives, and interesting explorations of the possibilities and limitations of the jumper ability.

  Glad you're enjoying it - I agree that plot is not the book's strong suit, but if you want someone intelligently exploiting a power and a lot of detail about space, this is the book for you. (Characterization is fairly strong too.)
