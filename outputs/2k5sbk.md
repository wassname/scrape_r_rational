## [HSF] The Zero Escape series

### Post:

I'd like to recommend a couple of 3DS games that could use more love.

There are two games in the Zero Escape series: "9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors" and "Virtue's Last Reward." They are visual novels with multiple paths and endings, and the gameplay between story segments consists of room escape puzzles. 

Both games are great, but the second game is where a lot of elements that tend to appeal to rational fiction enthusiasts appear. It's high-concept and high-stakes, with crazy science stuff and a ton of mysteries to puzzle out. It tackles subjects like game theory and...well, anything else I could say would be spoilers. Best of all, there are characters who make an open and concerted effort to work out all of the mysteries based on the information they have. The story devotes a lot of time to characters suggesting theories that may or may not be right, debating each other's interpretations of the evidence, and re-evaluating earlier theories in light of new info. 

I really highly recommend both games. VLR is the superior of the two, but they should definitely be played in order. You can get the English versions [here](http://www.amazon.com/9-Hours-Persons-Doors-Nintendo-DS/dp/B003VR5PPY/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1414117622&sr=1-1&keywords=9+hours+9+persons+9+doors) and [here](http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Escape-Virtues-Last-Reward-Nintendo/dp/B007FMSDU0/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1414117744&sr=1-1&keywords=virtue%27s+last+reward). Be careful about googling them--these are the kind of stories where almost everything you could learn about them in advance would be a spoiler.

(A warning for anyone who plays through to the second game: It's possible to obtain optional "gold file" rewards for completing bonus objectives. These give you extra background information about the setting and characters, but *don't read them* until you've finished the game, because they heavily imply some major spoilers.)

  I've read a bit of the iPhone version of 999. The part I remember best so far is the characters discussing chemistry while trapped in a freezer.

  I loved playing these games. I'm looking forward to the third one...presuming it gets an english release.
