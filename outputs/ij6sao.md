## Any books like 1984 but with a happy ending?

  You mean, a happy anti-utopia? Hmm.

    I guess, a really bad dystopia that has an actually feasible society. Most dystopian books are poorly written and focus more on character development than actual world design, the plot is then shafted five times to hell whenever the Mary Sue needed it to and the dystopian world then wraps up everything cleanly in a Disney ending.

    Rant aside, yes, a rational dystopian (or anti-utopia) book with a happy but reasonable ending would be nice. Plausible villains, a feasible society, heroes who understand, accept and revile in grey philosophy/non-dualism/etc. to achieve the greater good and an ending that isn't rushed and quickly tied up lazily.

      Brave New World seemed fairly functional, as dystopias go. The plot focused on character development, but as standard in the genre in the end they achieved nothing they strove for. The world continued to function, though. Happy ending? I dunno; it was happier than I expected, at least.

        I never read Brave New World, but from the bits and pieces I heard of it it doesn't sound *awful*, for a dystopian world. I think with dystopia there's also an issue of separating things that are genuinely horrifying from things that are just *different*. Describe our world to a medieval man, it would sound dystopian, and he likely wouldn't think all the planes and modern medicine are worth losing your soul in such a godless era.

        This usually especially strikes me for "yeah, in this future everyone is actually, genuinely happy and lives in peace... but it's all built on a LIE" dystopias. Like, yeah, sure, you think our world doesn't also exist by perpetuating and believing fundamentally fictional social narratives? There's worse original sins for a society than believing e.g. in a fictitious past. If I lived in such a society, and someone "brought me the truth", and then I saw my entire world collapse again into chaos and violence because of it, I'd be pretty pissed.

          I'm pretty sure Brave New World sounded a lot more like a dystopia in the 1930s than it does now.  There are certainly elements that stick out as ahead of its time, and elements that are retrograde.  (The African baby factory is more productive than the English one but they're trying!)  

          In general large parts of the book seem like they're written about eugenics gone too far (the social crusading movement, not the Nazi racial purity fetish).  As we face the excesses of individualism now, the fears of the book seem far less relevant.

            I canâ€™t say I entirely understand what OP was looking for, but Brave New World is a must read classic so I second that recommendation.

      The red rising trilogy?

        I did not find those well written. At all. To the point where I couldn't even finish the series despite my friend's recommendations. When I was first reason, something seemed a little off to me and was making me dissatisfied with the writing style, but I couldn't quite place it. Then there was a particular scene that crystallized the problem for me.  


        The main character is attempting to sneak into a building. He does so by ascending a wall empty-handed during a high wind. He spends several pages doing this, and at absolutely no point in the entire process is there a single bit of actual tension. You can tell the author tries, but those attempts boil down to "the wind rose, and I was worried I was going to lose my grip. But then I didn't, and I kept going". By that point in the book, you know that there is a zero percent chance he fails to scale the wall or be unsuccessful in his mission, so the attempts to add tension feel useless. The entirety of the first two books have that same feeling.  


        TL;DR: I liked the concept of the books, but it was poorly executed and I cannot recommend.

      *The Stone Dance of the Chameleon* by Ricardo Pinto is a fantasy (very low fantasy) dystopia with a happy (well, maybe) ending. That being said, the dystopia is not really the focus of the books as such.

      Honestly, *I* can only really recommend the first book, but it comes strongly recommended. The others are not bad as such, I just didn't enjoy them very much (if you just ignore the shuffling grasping of the idiot ball in the last ten pages it stands very well on its own).

      Ian Irvine's *The Three Worlds Cycle* is pretty dystopic. Honestly, considering your wishes it is a rather good fit.

      Honestly, I think Fallout: New Vegas is one of the better dystopian works I've experienced.  All of the criticism you've made could apply to it to a degree, but not as much as most dystopias I've read.

  The Handmaiden's Tale is at the same time a worse dystopia and yet is kind of... happy for certain reasons, pretty sad for others.
  ```

    That was my thought.  It has a semi-positive ambiguous ending.
    ```

  ```
  Walkaway by Doctorow has a happy-ish ending...depends on your perspective
  ```

- u/PastafarianGames:
  ```
  the Baru Cormorant books? the Ninefox Gambit books by Yoon Ha Lee? the Graydon Saunders "Commonweal" books? (okay not that last one probably)
  ```

- u/scruiser:
  ```
  FeluriansCloak got me thinking of Cory Doctorow... Little Brother is set in the near future as the government goes in a dystopian direction but is about a fairly effective resistance and has an optimistic ending.

  For a blast from the past, there's Johnny Zed (John Betancourt 1988), a sorta cyberpunk revolutionary book.  They more or less win the revolution, and things do sorta get better, but they are kinda mired down by all the work of actually governing afterwards.  There's no, "and everything was totally better after the revolution" type ending.
  ```

  ```
  The Tripod Trilogy comes to mind. Not so much a happy one but a hopeful one.
