  That was a novel experience, I also enjoyed it a lot, I was afraid there would be no resolution but instead you managed to end it in an interesting way.
  Absolutely loved the bethel chapter, I laughed

  Edit: oh fuck me I had no idea about the  ending until I read about it on the discord, very well played, masterfully so

    The implication that there are potentially a myriad of Juniper copies being run for every decision is slightly horrifying

    Agreed, very well done.

      Go to Ravens chapter, then hit next chapter.

        In general, with CYOAs with page numbers you jump to, you should always try manually incrementally looking through the pages after you’ve otherwise finished for bonus content and meta content.  For an example on this subreddit I think >!The Library Unpublished!< had a few extra scenes.

  Interesting. So we know on top of the 7 companions we encounter in canon Fallateher was another option. So who would the 9th be? 

  The Fallateher verse probably ends with Juniper becoming a soul mage and using all Fallateher's creepy mind control methods as his default toolset. With Fallateher helping him minmax once they work out how the character sheet works, which he'd find fascinating because of its connection to the soul.  Maybe this is the Evil!Juniper path?
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    The 9th is the control, with no companion.

    The Fallatehr-verse would be Fallatehr!Juniper. It's a play on "loyal companion" - who's the loyal companion?
    ```

      Finally, a chance to deliver a Word of God and annoy readers everywhere.

      Juniper meant he got the memories of 9 other doors, so he wasn't counting himself.

      Additionally, he explicitly didn't make it to the door in the House timeline. A single extra companion wouldn't be much wiggle room, don't you agree?
      ```

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        Ahem, don't give us more data to overthink your identity.

        But weird. Is there a return policy on the Qullqa Inventory?
        ```

- u/None:

  Given how meta Juniper tends to be I'd expect his immediate thought upon meeting Solace to be "Ah, I've found the tutor npc" since she fits so many of the tropes of a wise mentor character (ancient, powerful, last of her kind, in touch with nature) and can conveniently explain the rules of the universe to him

      It would make sense, but I really don’t want it to be true.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        on the other hand if the DM was playing as Solace, that gives some hope that the DM is more friendly to Juniper than otherwise indicated. Solace has been actively helping him out and giving life advice, which would make a counterpoint to DM's tormenting
        ```

        - u/silian:
          ```
          I really don't think that's necessarily true. The DM seems to be a standard DM which means he is neutral overall, and if Solace is a potential DMPC helping the party as it were I don't think that really demonstrates anything. The DM is just putting challenges in front of the party while providing the means to resolve them; he is neither antagonistic or friendly by nature, he is just the driving conflict of the story in its every aspect.
          ```

    I kind of want to see that fanfic now.  In feel like Solacec would lead things in the opposite direction of Amaryllis, where Amaryllis stresses over character sheet optimizing and narrative structure, Solace would intuitively take things as they are.

    Plus a timeline where Juniper doesn’t neglect and whine about the Locus but actually appreciates it would be fun... although I’m not sure even Solace saving him would be enough to get this timeline.
    ```

- u/RUGDelverOP:
  ```
  The Amaryllis chapter pointing at WtC was hilarious.
  ```

- u/nytelios:
  ```
  Chapter 8 reminds me how I want to peer beyond the veil (DM screen) of WtC but also don't, for reasons. Endings are a hole.

  Another great fic, thanks! Going native with the pseudonym tradition?
  ```

- u/TrebarTilonai:
  ```
  That was a fun read. I also read through your other "what really happened while high on unicorn blood" chapter, since that appears to be the only other thing you've posted. It's good work, and I gotta say the writing style matched closely to canon. You sure you're not just AW spinning out some non-canon canon to get anonymous feedback on it?
  ```

- u/absolute-black:
  ```
  Loving it, but I'm lost in 'chapter 4' - Juniper fills time "by further examining the bottled forest and its clearing" before Solace pulls the bottle out?
  ```

- u/adgnatum:
  ```
  Typo thread! (I knew this post was missing *something*.)

    Thanks, everybody. I've also removed Solace's time loop [feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/i1gx1v/rtffworth_the_candle_multiplex/fzy5xc8/) for balance reasons, might reuse it in a future release.
    ```

- u/suyjuris:
  ```
  Nice! To be honest, I first clicked on the Amaryllis one, noticed that it lead back to WtC, was confused, and then proceeded to read the rest linearly. Bad luck, I guess.

  (Then I thought that it was weird for Juniper to enter all those different houses and find random companions from the future, but I am very good at automatically ignoring nonsensical plotlines.)
