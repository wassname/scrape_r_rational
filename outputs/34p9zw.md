  So uh does someone want to give a summary or something?

    OK I've only just started, but from the games introductory infodump:

    >the incubus king came from across the ocean and assaulted the world with his hordes of horny ogres and succubi nymphomaniacs. Armies that attempted to oppose him quickly fell prey to their own lusts and joined his ranks of mindless sex-addicts. 

    >When the great powers of the world combined their forces, they succeeded only in fighting the Incubus King to a standoff. For decades, the world attained a kind of peace. Many nations grew complacent, failing to realize that the Incubus King was only gathering his powers to take control of the world once and for all. And then fuck it in the ass - definitely metaphorically, possibly literally.

    >You are a young man born in this era of tenuous peace and granted a momentous destiny. You have been chosen by the goddess Ivala, granted special powers to fight the Incubus King and his evil.

    >But power has a way of corrupting, and only time will tell if your power will be used for good or evil...

      Sounds rational!

        Sounds deconstructionist. Deconstructional. Whatever.

        Edit: If you want self-aware parody hardcore fantasy smut, you might want to try [The Pilfered Princess](http://www1.asstr.org/~A_Strange_Geek/novels/PilferedPrincess/Part1.html) [NSFW].

        I just tried it out, and to my surprise I'm still playing an hour later. So to offer a counterpoint to the intro blurb above, the very introduction/beginning of the game was very misleading (and distasteful, really, IMO) but it quickly does a very unexpected and somewhat clever 180. I was just about to quit when that happened, too.

        The combat itself is... fairly well done, if basic. It actually brings back a lot of old memories from playing similar RPGs on GBA back in the day (Golden Sun comes to mind as the primary example).

        The plot is beginning to look a little more interesting and innovative where I'm at, after the initial plot setup is over (I suspect), but besides all the funny meta RPG genre jokes and the decent writing, I'm not sure exactly where the rational part comes in, to be honest. If you can't at least tolerate very explicit (and sometimes *weird*) sex scenes enough to scroll past them, then this isn't for you.

        I'm not sure whether I'll continue it, but I *might.* It's been surprisingly not-bad so far. Without the whole sex angle, I'd definitely recommend it just for the interesting story angle (if perhaps not here, though I reserve my judgement on that point for later, if I continue).

        On an aside note, [weak spoilers](#s " this game makes me feel bad for Chosen One mentors everywhere. There's clearly a classic adolescent, Leeroy Jenkins player sitting behind the controls there.")

  And now the censoring of "F___lord" is pointless, because I forgot it'd display the URL. Dammit.

  Seriously though. It's not necessarily obvious at the very start of the game, but it's really something different and **is worth playing for the story**.

    Is it really? I mean, is it only particularly good for an erotic game, or actually good?

      I'm a couple hours in.  Game-wise it's competent but ultimately just an RPG-maker rpg; good balance of skills and such, paced well so far.  Very, _veeeery_ railroaded straight with no really solid sidequesting or anything so far.  Monsters are finite, so presumably it's set to not require grinding.  Don't know whether that will change or not.

      Erotica-wise, it's _decent_ I suppose.  It's all text (and a little sprite art that I don't really count) so far, and easy enough to skip if you don't like it.  The couple of introductory sex scenes are almost funny they're so bad, but it quickly becomes apparent that it's being done on purpose, and it gets better soon enough.

      _Writing and story-wise_?  It's actually telling a really interesting take on classic rpg/heroism (and a few porn/erotica) tropes!  What really stands out is the main character; he is pretty much pragmatism personified, but at the same time he does have a personality, and the conflict he has to face is solidly done so far (if a little angsty at first, but understandably so, and not unbearable)  A fair deal of actually funny jokes thrown in to boot.

  Ah, this game. I also recommend it, and have been playing it every time it updates. It's quite good, explaining lore around the Demon King and why he behaves such as he does, as well as lots of other neat things. Like mercantile skill and poking fun at common RPG traits like rat-slaying or pail-collecting.

  I've been playing it for a while and I ... I have to upvote this! The game is genuinely engaging and good! I did not expect that at all.

  Any way to zoom the window?

    Alt+Enter will make the game full screen. That's the best I have for you right now.
