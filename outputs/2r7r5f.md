  While the story is awesome, what do you guys think about Hitler's death causing the non existence of computers and electronics?

  Wouldn't we have discovered those things anyway?

    We definitely would have those things - it's just a question of how delayed the technologies would be without the concerted war effort pulling people from various specialties in and giving them a lot of funding. In a parallel timeline without WWII (and it's a big leap to go from "no Hitler" to "no WWII") you would probably have the funding done by private companies, educational institutions, or a government that didn't really care that a war wasn't on and just wanted to spend some money.

    The first conception of the electrical digital computer predates WWII by two years, for what it's worth.

    I have to imagine that killing and displacing a bunch of scientists was bad for their research.
