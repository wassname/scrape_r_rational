  Well, no surprises about Daimen being after a Key piece :D. Should be much easier now, because he said he's in the area, and Zorian can sense it.

  I wonder if it will give them something, even in isolation? Extra Gate authorisation? If it interacts with the marker somehow, Zorian will know.
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    Agreed---an Ikosian artifact like that? I was not surprised, and rationally speaking, it’s not very far-fetched.

    I really hope that with the orb, the Guardian will be a little more informative.
    ```

      I'm sure all of them have powers. Red robe prolly had the dagger, which probably has the removal from the loop as it's a weapon.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure the erasure is a Controller function, not a Key function. And the dagger is locked away in the treasury. But yeah, quite possibly they all give benefits.

        My big question is, what happens to the keys when the loop resets? Do they have to collect all 5 in the same iteration, or will the keys stay with them somehow?
        ```

        - u/kaukamieli:
          ```
          You mean Redrobe would have stolen the abilities from Zach or something?

          The keys reset of course. The lich always has his crown.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            > The lich always has his crown.

            The lich is not a Controller. The lich does not have a soul marker that actively responds to the presence of Keys.

            But it's also possible for the keys to persist in some other fashion, eg you bring one of them to the Gate, the Guardian registers that you brought it, and you get extra privileges, without needing to bring that one back again.
            ```

            - u/kaukamieli:
              ```
              Sure, the Gate can twist things. It could even stay physically if there are conditions and the lich could even forget it had that. :D We can't know really yet what happens.
              ```

          - u/sempf1992:
            ```
            Zach probably used to know how to do that, and when he got his mind raided for information, red robe figured out how to delete the areana.
            ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        Oh, it’d be cool if each artifact had a special function.
        ```

    - u/Areign:
      ```
      I feel like from a rational perspective, it kind of has to. Otherwise, why would the emperor lug it across two countries? If it increased your X Y and Z it makes sense, but as far as a powerless bauble, it strains credulity that of all the seemingly powerless baubles with history, he happened to take the one that had a hidden use.
      ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    If this was a WoW-inspired universe, the Orb would be the least influential piece of them all. A measly off-hand.

    The Staff would be the biggest, followed by the Dagger, the Crown, and the Ring.

    But if the power is more metaphorically linked? The Orb means vision? Knowledge?
    ```

  - u/PhilanthropAtheist:
    ```
    Im gonna make a random guess and that they'll find the orb inside the bee's main hive along with the queen. It's been there all along and no one knew better because the Taramatula kept it as a family heirloom.

  Self modifying simulacrums, here we go.

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    With reveal of treasury's content, I was thinking Zorian will have some insight into Spear of Resolve's style of inward mind magic. Skill like perceiving her subordinates sense at will might translate into 'Zorian & His Simulacra's Hivemind.' A nice, albeit rather ominous, band name.
    ```

    - u/PhilanthropAtheist:
      ```
      We're getting closer and closer to my dream of having a mad villain Zorian and a Zach hero sequel.

    He would need a lot of safety precautions for that. This is the most direct way to change a Zorian, and who knows what will happen to them.

    If he ever gets the hang of compulsions (which were used by Cyorian matriarch), he could make his simulacrums a lot more safe and productive. Imagine all of them having the compulsion to not work against Zorian, and focus on their jobs.

    Wonder what else he could do to their minds? Make them re-purpose parts of their minds for specific tasks, like learning the local language, so that original Zorian can just 'download' the lessons from them? Or maybe completely change the senses and perspectives of some of them, so they can come to some real creative solutions (I mean, just a few near-death experiences changed the Zorian from the grey hunter ambush somewhat).

    So exciting!
    ```

      Maybe not. 

      > ["Thankfully, he was a copy mind, within an ectoplasmic shell"](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/63/Mother-of-Learning)

      Simulacrum have their own mind. This is supported by the fact that the simulacrum need to give original Zorian memories vs. intrinsically already having the memories if they shared the same mind. If you fuck the simulacrum's mind up, just dispell the simulacrum. I'm pretty sure it was fleshed out more concretely somewhere else that part of simulacrum creation is the creation of a fake mind but I can't find it right now. The only precaution is that you probably want to incapacitate the simulacrum in case it goes insane and starts randomly lashing out.
      ```

      - u/PurposefulZephyr:
        ```
        Fair enough, *however* the immediate danger is not the most important one.

        Let's consider following scenario: there's a significant modification to fake!Zorian.  This modification doesn't cause any apparent insanity, but it does make this simulacrum hostile towards Zorian, and intelligent enough to not show it.

        Let's also say that evil!Zorian is dispatched to deal with a task (like searching libraries in Kotch), and is far away from Zorian.

        That gives evil!Zorian a lot of possibilities when it comes to potentially harm Zorian:

        * He can learn a special spell, potion or technique, or just come up with a way to disable Zorian
        * He can stealthily modify other Simulacrums, so that they will work together against the original
        * He can give Zorian inconspicuous information for future evil!Zorians to use to further their own plans ('Hmmm? Advanced mind magic? Using potions to increase your psychic powers? Quite useful'). It's even more potent if the simulacrum will be dispelled after a set period of time (Remember that prank they pulled off with Akoja? Now imagine they went a step further...).
        * He can even, in the end-game, escape the loop instead of the real!Zorian (just like alleged simulacrum of Zach's did).
        ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  How did they get back to Koth so fast after entering the Black Room (which would dismiss all the simulacra)? They don't yet have a way to stabilise gates.
  ```

  - u/spanj:
    ```
    Plot hole! Paging /u/nobody103

    The only way I can think of a way to patch up this hole if we assume that the time of flight back to Koth was fast (so barring chained teleports) is if he taught Daimen the gate spell. They could have set up a predestined time to both activate the spell. Seeing how Daimen is a prescribed genius, it wouldn't be too hard to assume he could learn to cast the spell in a short time.
    ```

    - u/nobody103:
      ```
      Yeah, that *is* a bit of a plot hole, since I have honestly forgot about that little detail.

      However, Daimen is definitely capable of casting the Gate spell (he was just never given opportunity to learn it), so let's say they did it that way.

      It was my idea all along! *waves hand in jedi-like manner*
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        hahaha I like your honesty! I was curious about this as well. I forget if the answer to the following was fully explained.

        So, to get to Koth in the first place, Zorian used mental relays to inform his simulacrum in Koth that it was time to construct the gate spell?

        Or did they agree to check in with each other via the gate spell at regular intervals?

        And then perhaps before the black box, Daimen found someone among the Taramatulas to create the Koth side of the gate. The Taramatulas are collecting powerful mages after all. Although, I feel it would be a house liability to link with an unknown gate source.

        Perhaps having Daimen learn gate *is* the easiest solution. Could he really learn it so quickly though? It took Zorian a lot of time learning dimensionalism before he could successfully cast gate, which I believe is the pinnacle of the common variety of dimensional magic (with dimensional pockets the purview of exceedingly rare dimensional magic).
        ```

        - u/nobody103:
          ```
          Zorian and his simulacrum are in regular communication with each other over the relays. When it's time to open the gate, they just establish contact and start synchronizing their casting. 

          Daimen also spent a lot of time studying dimensionalism. It's just that the Gate spell is rare and treated as a closely-held secret by mages that can cast it, so he never found anyone willing to teach it to him.
          ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          The simulacrum dropped a chain of telepathic relays along the way, and used them to make daily reports. Then he informed the original when he found a good gate location.
          ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Thanks for the reply :).

        While we're on the subject of Black Rooms - how do they get a month's supply of air? I was thinking about whether Zorian could practice Alanic's fire magic inside, and realised it might consume all their oxygen, and then realised that it doesn't make sense to last 30 days anyway. Can they use alteration to convert CO2?
        ```

        - u/nobody103:
          ```
          They use alteration to convert CO2 into oxygen, yes.
          ```

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            Does that mean that they constantly produce coal? That C has to go somewhere.
            ```

            - u/nobody103:
              ```
              They produce carbon dust/blocks of some sort, but I don't know if they would qualify as coal.
              ```

                  ```
                  That's about 7 kg of carbon per month per person. They could easily like this amount in the corner.
                  ```

      - u/sempf1992:
        ```
        There is possibly an easier way. Zorian goes to Cyoria (or any other strong manna well). Makes a simulacrum, and that simulacrum starts a teleport chain. Since Zorian is still in Cyoria, he and thus the simulacrum will have very high manna regeneration, and can thus teleport often. This should be doable right?
        ```

        - u/nobody103:
          ```
          Any teleportation chain would take days (with a 24 hour effort each day) to reach Koth. Even if Z&Z ensure maximum mana regeneration along the way.
          ```

          - u/sempf1992:
            ```
            24 hour effort each day with simulacrums which can be dismissed seems very doable, you can gate and replenish tired simulacrums :). But I did not think it would take that much effort for a chain teleport to work properly.
            ```

              Here's his comment from last month: https://www.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/5pjv30/en_mother_of_learning_chapter_64/deer3ql/?st=j0vae7jj&sh=135e7db4 
              He said it would be a 6 day grueling effort with Zorian alone, and a 3 day with considerable assistance from Zach.

              He doesn't go into his calculations, but this is his story and he is an accountant after all.

              Tired simulacrum are a non-issue, tired Zorian is, a few chapters back it was mentioned that they go inactive if he's sleeping. Presumably it would be Zach carting him around and teleporting him while he sleeps, and the same for when Zach is sleeping.

              Mana regeneration caps out at anything higher than a rank 3 mana well, so being in Cyoria (rank 9) isn't truly necessary or helpful. The 30 minute estimate for mana doesn't take into account simulacra either, and I think Zorian caps out at 3 simulacra right now, which slows his mana regeneration to a trickle, making repeated long range teleports impractical. I think Zorian's just using 2 or so at a time at the moment, so that he and the simulacra have some spare mana for casting spells.

              I get the impression now that his simulacra is still mostly relying on paying people to do teleports, and only occasionally using his own mana for it.
              ```

              - u/sempf1992:
                ```
                Ah, thank you for that link. I had not seen that post. It sometimes amazes me how much nobody103 spends thinking about details. 

                Using his information of 200 teleports, and 1 teleport every 30 minutes, which seems to be a high estimate given that both Zorian and Zach seem to be able to teleport more often than that, even with simulacrum of Zorian running around, I get around 4.4 days nonstop work, so then 6 days might be a good estimate without powernapping. 

                Ps, do you have other links where Mother of Learning is discussed, I only knew the /r/rational sub, I'd appreciate them

                  thrawnca put together a post with almost every MoL link: https://www.reddit.com/r/motheroflearning/comments/5v0zl0

                  nobody103 has said in a couple places that he had done a lot of world building, and then decided it would be fun/worthwhile to try writing in the world and figuring out/adding new stuff to it, which I think we're all appreciative of.

                  I don't think either you or thrawnca or I are entirely content with his math, but like I said, he's the author. Even after adding in 12 hours for the two extended range teleports that require long rituals, it still feels like the Koth trip should be shorter to me too. 

                  Mostly though, it would feel like a waste for the characters to spend a big chunk of their limited remaining time (maybe a fifth of it?) just traveling to get to necessary locations, and that will be an even bigger issue for the other Key pieces on other continents later. So there was a need for Z&Z to develop a faster method of travel, such as the Bakora Gates.

                  Edit: I took too long writing my post, got ninjaed by thrawnca.
                  ```

                  - u/thrawnca:
                    ```
                    One thing I overlooked in my initial maths was that mana regeneration is significantly reduced by the presence of active simulacra. Each one costs nearly a third of his regeneration, and since the point of sending one to Koth is to stay productive, he'll probably want to keep at least two around. So paying people - which could be optimised - remains much more attractive.

                    > Zorian and Zach seem to be able to teleport more often than that

                    Mana costs scale - faster than linearly - with range. So yes, they can teleport relatively often over short distances, but not continental ones.
                    ```

                    - u/Cheese_Ninja:
                      ```
                      Only problem is that we never see them chain teleports or exhaust their mana from teleporting when traveling around the Eldemar kingdom. It's tough to get a good idea of exactly how far they can go with the basic teleport spell, or how much of their reserves get used up for a max range teleport. Judging from the maps, Cirin to Cyoria or Kynazov Dveri really should be near the range limit for the spell.

                      Here's my list of factors that affect the mana consumption of teleport:

                      *Divination component (reduced by divination shaping mastery)

                      *Dimensional component (reduced by dimensional shaping mastery)

                      *Range (influences both divination and dimensional components)

                      *Additional weight (passengers)

                      *Familiarity with destination (influences divination component)

                      *Overall shaping skill

                      *Overall spell mastery

                      *Teleport beacons and wards

                        > max range teleport

                        Maximising each jump is probably not efficient anyway. Jumps apparently don't scale linearly, so two smaller jumps may well get more distance out of your mana reserves.

                        ```
                        I actually wonder about that divinaiton component. Could Z&Z teleport straight to Koth if they built a Gustav-like gun to launch a scrying beacon there, thus significantly reducing teleport costs? Or use one of those "beacon" teleport spells Zorian was using to teleport out of the dungeon.
                        ```

      - u/sambelulek:
        ```
        I would like to suggest a solution. Since Zorian's simulacra already pointed safe places to put down relays (and open a gate, sometimes), then it is make sense if Zorian can simply chain-teleport through the them, albeit needing some time to replenish mana. This way, Zorian can cut the time to move from Eldemar to Koth. As a note, this is only applicable for Zorian who's just exiting the blackroom. Fresh restart will involve uncertain factors on relays' location that might hinder safe teleportation.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          You don't need relays to chain-teleport; you just need to be familiar with the destination. The problem is the mana replenishment - especially with active simulacra putting a drain on it. Could easily take several days to a week.
          ```

      - u/elevul:
        ```
        But first they'd need to have a way to communicate with him in real time to coordinate the simultaneous casting.
        ```

        - u/nobody103:
          ```
          They can also just arrange to start casting at the same time in advance. Which is how mages other than Zorian do it.
          ```

      - u/jimbarino:
        ```
        I just assumed that Zorian would have left his simulacrum in Koth when he went to Cyoria, just like he did when he went to Koth. It seems like teaching + coordinating with Damien would add a bit of complexity and trial and error that wouldn't be necessary.
        ```

        - u/nobody103:
          ```
          The issue is that the moment Zorian gets into the Black Room, he is cut off from the outside world and every simulacrum gets dispelled. Including one left in Koth. So he would have to send a simulacrum on a multi-day journey to Koth all over again once he gets out. Unless he teacher Daimen the Gate spell and arranges with him to open the gate at a predetermined moment in the future, which neatly sidesteps this problem.

              ```
              Wait for the next one. I dislike making substantial changes to a chapter once it is done. It is one of the limitations I placed on myself, to prevent my old problem of constantly going back to rewrite old chapters before the story is done from flaring up. Best not to play with fire like that unless it's something really important.

            ```

      - u/spanj:
        ```
        I just thought of another potential issue. How rare is the Gate spell? 

        Presumably you have more than one person in each country who knows the Gate spell. It can't be that rare can it? Lets put a theoretical lower bound of one person per country. Say this Gate spell user from Country A has a vendetta against Country B. He could groom a loyal student such that the student learns the Gate spell, no matter how long it takes. The student then goes through the bureaucracy of international travel (Chapter 64, where it states teleporting between countries is slow because of nations wanting to secure their borders). The student then opens a dimensional gate with the help of the teacher connecting Country A to Country B allowing for an invasion.

        You wouldn't even need a vendetta. If there is any mage who knows the gate spell under a warmongering government, it seems like it makes it extremely easy for discreet mass movements of people.

        So if this is a well known method on how to use the Gate spell, in a world where it seems like there are plenty of imperialistic governments and ill sentiments (Noble houses resenting current governments), it would put the instability of this world at an unrealistic level.

        You indicate https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/622at6/rt_mother_of_learning_chapter_67/dfjhwls/ here that other mages do in fact use the gate spell like this, which is why I assume that the spell isn't so rare that there are only a handful of people in the entire world who know how to use it.
        ```

        - u/nobody103:
          ```
          If you looked at the political map of Altazia, you would immediately see that states do indeed have a lot of issues holding themselves together...

          That aside, the thing that makes such Gate use impractical for invasions is that:

          1. In MoL-verse, there are no mages that can solo entire armies by themselves. If you want to conquer a country, you need to bring an army. Gating in a small battlegroup would be insufficient to even conquer the tiny statelets that exist between major nations.

          2. Transporting an entire army in this way would be very slow. Armies are big things with thousands of people, and they come with supplies, war machines, war beasts, and so on. 

          2. States routinely run patrols and divination of their territory. This is not enough to catch individual mages like Z&Z or small groups violating border security, but any attempt to establish a beachhead for an invasion would be caught very quickly.

          3. You cannot supply an army with a single mage gating in things. So this maneuver would quickly see your invasion force run out of ammo, food and such. 

          4. The student is vulnerable to assassination, and you can bet that the defenders will pull every trick they can to get rid of him (and thus the army's ability to gate reinforcements).  

          5. If you get put into a bad situation, you cannot easily retreat because you are deep in enemy territory and have no fallback point. You could lose the entire invasion force very easily if things go wrong.

          6. There are more than two nations in any given region. If you are committing your army to a distant battlefield, you cannot defend against your regional enemies.

          The end result is that a Gate can only be used in this way to conduct raids, terror missions and spitefully go down in a blaze of glory. Which is indeed a known danger. Countries generally try not to back powerful mages and groups into corners because then they have a tendency to use their 'last resort' type magics... and all powerful mages and groups have at least one of those.

    I'd say either the chapter was out of order, for pacing purposes; or they got there the same way they did before, by chaining teleports. That should be easier now that Zorian and his simulacrums have been to each location they have to teleport to---they don't have to hire people to teleport them to places they haven't been.
    ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Considering Zorian would want Daimen's assistance for the rest of restart, refreshing his Koth simulacrum is the most reasonable to do. Meaning, he repeatedly open the gate to dismiss and recast simulacrum spell every, say, 2 or 3 days. Explaining this in the chapter can be tedious. I am fully agree with author to skip the detail.  

    Edit: I seem to miss the point. I blame it from early morning non-alertness.

      - u/sambelulek:
        ```
        We didn't know. Casting simulacrum involves creating a fake brain (so that the simulacrum can think) and maybe a token of authentication (so that the simulacrum can draw the original's mana for spellcasting). I suppose there would be a need for the original presence during the casting.

        Simulacrum references the soul to create copies. That's why it requires personal soul awareness before one can cast it. And it's also why only the original can cast the spell, because simulacrums have no souls.

  After reading this chapter, I have to say that I'm a little bit disappointed. It's a well-written chapter with an efficient progression of the plot, but I was expecting drama with Daimen and to see a confrontation between the brothers over Zorian's psychic abilities and whether or not Daimen has any. I was even hoping to see more of Taramatulas to better understand the family but they barely say anything.

  Basically, everyone was in character and mature enough to not act like people on a sit-com, but the chapter wasn't as exciting as I was hoping for and the cliffhanger was obvious coming from chapter #66.

  The biggest point of interest is how from the very first meeting, one of the Taramatulas telepathically probed Zorian. It says a lot about a family if a member is so willing to do something potentially politically dangerous so soon after a first meeting. What it says is the question.

  Daimen using mind blank so casually makes me think he had reason to worry about mind mages from the Taramatulas in addition to Zorian.

                      I think that changing those would be over-doing it. It's why I specifically brought up those two. I'm all for editing the spelling mistakes, typos and grammar whenever it's required, but not everyone talks like they're teaching a class of ten year olds, or says "blimey, that's quite unfortunate" when they could express the same emotions with more intensity with a simple "Fuck."

                      Oh, but if you're going above and beyond in editing, could you consider changing some of the "digest this" to "considered this"? The former expression was just used frequently for a few chapters for a while, then was dropped again. It just stood out to me as odd. Or some of the time passages, where they negotiate for hours about a deal. A single minute is a long time, when involved in a discussion. Half an hour should be more than enough to negotiate everything in details already, most of the time.

On the master branch I'm just doing proofreading, but then I merge it into my 'airline' branch where I also do language substitution.

                Unfortunately, I've only added line breaks after paragraphs, so there are a lot of conflicts; in hindsight, I should have inserted line breaks after every full stop. But anyway, I have a shell script to re-pack the ePub, and then I can use Calibre to convert it to Mobi (for my Kindle), PDF (for family), RTF (although non-ASCII characters seem to have problems), etc.

        I doubt the story will go into that much detail, just like it doesn't describe the exact chants and gestures to cast a spell. We know he had access to a ward scanner, and plenty of time and retries available; he must have analysed the defences until he found a way to prevent them from triggering. After all, there must be some legitimate way of opening it; if he could determine what criteria the wards used, he could fake it.

    That's probably because we're in the middle of an arc. There wasn't much tension when Zorian was wandering around the countryside working for Gurey or delving in Knyazov Dveri's dungeon, either.

    I have no doubt that the tension will return when they have to fight in the real world, where death is permanent, the primordial might actually get loose, Red Robe may still be unaccounted for judging by how things are going on that front, the invaders have an army of demons added in, and they'll have to deal with Quatach-Ichl *permanently* in some fashion. Bearing in mind that they have no idea where his phylactery is on Ulquaan Ibasa, it likely has insane defences, and if they banish him, he's powerful enough to teleport back with his new body within hours, and he'll be out for blood (or souls).

  Is no one talking about the most exciting thing in the chapter for me? More deep mental self-manipulation!

  I am interested to see what kind of stuff Zorian will end up learning in this field - possibly live-editing other people's senses to be effectively invisible or unnoticeable? We saw the Matriarch do this early-on-ish.

  Will he become just straight-up more intelligent? I know high-level smart characters are intensely difficult to write, I'm sure everyone on /r/rational knows that. What's down the pike for this? We already have Zorian with essentially an eidetic memory, though he needs to actively choose the moments to remember at the time that they are happening.

  What other stuff has been mentioned? Would a magical calculator be useful? Lots of room for creativity with this stuff! I am excited!

    Zorian discussed these techniques in chapter 54:

    - Filtering out distractions. Potentially useful to ignore pain, discomfort, etc during combat.
    - Blunting emotional highs. This sounds easy to abuse (the mind has emotions for a reason), but very powerful.
    - Placing compulsions on oneself. Precommitment can be very potent. Also good for defeating akrasia.

    The matriarch was also skilled at integrating perceptions of multiple aranea. If that kind of thing is available in their research notes, it would help Zorian to work better with his simulacra.

  Judging from careless mind-probe from Taramatula younger member, I suspect the family has established mind-magic tradition, training their young so they can secure the House's future.

I love to imagine how would Aopes react when Zorian share this info.

  - u/bludvein:

    Mind magic is probably how they control the bees they work with, so it's not really surprising. 

    I rather doubt her probe was ordered by someone else. Zorian is a bit of an unreliable narrator when it comes to standards on mind magic, but with the way he describes it she's barely Tinami level. Even if he was an ordinary mage reading his surface thoughts wouldn't be easy for her, so it makes no sense to use her to spy even if she's deniable.

    My guess is Zorian is simply being himself and overthinking things. She was probably just interested and got more than she bargained for.
    ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      Of course the girl isn't at Tinami's level. One, she's younger (young teenager might imply 11-14 years old, compared to Tinami or Zorian's 15-16). Next, she's not the House's heir. Now imagine Orissa, she's (possibly) House's heir and older. I wonder how good is her mind magic.
      ```

  - u/renegadeduck:
    ```
    I take that to mean just the opposite. :)

    If the Taramatulas used mind magic I would expect one of:

    * Lots of probes: mind magic users that aren't worried about exposing themselves like the aranea. They would likely be open about mind magic as well, since their use of it would be obvious to anybody else with much mind magic experience.
    * A few skilled probes: trained and careful mind magic users who don't want to be exposed. They don't expect someone with aranea-caliber mind magic. A youth wouldn't be allowed to go probing people randomly because it could expose the whole house.
    * No probes: they know what they're dealing with an don't want to be exposed.

    A single probe from a youngster doesn't fit for me. That suggests they're not public about mind magic, but also aren't careful enough to keep their youngsters in line.

    I don't think she's a canary (i.e. they ordered her to probe him) either. The worst case for them would be the probe turning Zorian hostile and him ripping the knowledge about mind magic out of her head.

    I guess we'll find out soon enough.

    Zorian spends the entire chapter tinkering with a complicated assembly of pocket dimensions and mental compulsions that is eventually revealed to be unmistakably a pokeball. "Grey hunter, I chose you!"

    Zach and Zorian finally escape from the time loop, only to find themselves on a deserted beach, with a broken down statue of liberty before them. Zach remarks he has the strangest urge to shout "NOOO!" all of the sudden.

    Zorian builds a giant ~~mecha~~ *armor golem* and uses it to fight Sudomir's bone dragon in an Epic Battle of Epic History. Everyone around is just watching and providing over the top commentary, like it's an episode of JoJo or something.

    What better way to keep an extremely proud/arrogant mage than to make her seem like forbidden fruit?

    Honestly, the fact that mind magic is critical for their bee-keeping specialization, and one of their members tried to use mind magic on Zorian makes the theory more likely to me.

    Damien is a natural mind mage (Not sure if the Taramatula are or not.), a genius known across his home country, has huge reserves of magic, and is looking for whatever hidden treasures the lost Ikosian emperor died with in Koth.

    He also uses mind blank to defend himself with...suggesting he has little to no actual talent in defending himself from mental magics in other ways. Orissa (or whoever) could have gotten to him pretty easily.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's also possible that they want him to be with Orissa for their own reasons, but are decieving him into thinking they'd rather otherwise for some reason.
    ```

  - u/lostatnet:
    ```
    On the contrary, I think it just got more plausible.  Daimen couldn't find the Orb after months of searching, even with the help of his fiancee's family:  "I'm close to finding it, I know I am, but I just can't seem to zero in on the actual location. I don't understand. We combed through the whole region – and I know it's the correct region – but everything is just…"
    That sounds like Daimen got close but was misdirected.  The biggest suspect for this misdirection is from a family of mind mages: aka, the Taramatula family.  They may have found the artifact & used it to establish their power.  I find it likely the Taramatula family decided to kill two birds with one stone.  By manipulating Daimen, they kept their powerful artifact hidden & gained a psychic bloodline.
    ```

  A short chapter (in terms of story) overall though, not much happened.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    As for me, I couldn't imagine mage of Daimen's caliber would chase something lesser than the Key, if the rumor of his skill-level is to be believed.  

    At the body of the chapter, his reaction is fully in accord to his reputation. Calm, collected, cautious, while also confident and charming. The thing toward the end though, when he cackling amusedly, is a little out of character. I am imagining the respond like when Zorian gaves to Xvim (*That amount is the pocket change*) will suit him better. But I don't know, the same reaction would potentially make the novel repetitive.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      I viewed that reaction like this: Daimen has been spending so much time searching and obsessing over this artifact for months or maybe over a year now. And then it turns out his baby brother was magically stuck in a time loop and one key to it all is the very artifact he wants to find? 


      Not only is the irony is maddening, but with Zorian’s resources, he is very likely to finally find his treasure. I might cackle too! hahaha
      ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      He's been stuck in his search for some time in the worst possible way. He knows he is close but the prize inexplicably eludes him. His frustration is apparent in the guest house scene.

      So his a bit hysterical reaction is fitting. Even if he is usually outwardly calm and collected, sometimes he breaks down. He's had one hell of a month, it makes sense.
      ```

  - u/thefreegod:
    ```
    Well he is psychic so it would be easier for him to cast the spell then it would be for most people.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Are you sure of that? Being psychic makes it easier to learn mind magics, but Mind Blank involves shutting down any such abilities and I don't recall Zorian ever using the spell. So it may be harder for psychics than non-psychics to learn.

      Although it clearly demonstrates Daimen's abilities when one reads the following quote from Novelty back in chapter #23:

      > Anyway, the problem isn't just the Mind Blank – it's the fact that any mage powerful enough to cast it is also powerful enough to take on the entire aranean Web all on their lonesome.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > harder for psychics than non-psychics

        Probably not *harder*. Remember, a skilled psychic can achieve it without a spell. But I'm not sure it would help learn the spell faster.
        ```

      - u/TimTravel:
        ```
        I thought the causation went the other way: being immune to psychic attacks makes you stronger.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          There's not actually direct causation between "can cast Mind Blank" and "can take on the whole aranean web"; rather, being able to cast MB *implies* a powerful caster, who presumably has sufficient combat skills to take on the web. Theoretically we could imagine a highly specialised caster who actually has no combat skills at all, but Novelty was making a point about using MB in combat.
          ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      That's actually not certain. I don't think that any named aspect of the psychic ability makes casting MB easier, without proper aranean training at least.
      ```

- u/sambelulek:
  ```
  I am fully aware, Zorian cannot make a scene at Taramatula's estate, so he can only wait until Daimen is ready before he ask for his assistance. On the other hand, Daimen cannot be careless if his little brother's life is at stake in light of high-skill magic demonstrated by suspicious Zorian-shaped guy. It's full of restrained excitement! I love it.

  ```
  What if the giant bees are actually highly intelligent and psychic? (sort of Koth's analogue of aranea).

  The bees are the ones mind-controlling the Taramatula family, not the other way around, pretending to be dumb servant animals to maintain the illusion in the eyes of other human communities. 
  That's their way of attaining power and safety, kind of like how the Cyorian aranea planned to integrate into Cyorian society.

  That'd also explain their interest in Daimen - as they would instantly recognize him as "Open".
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Interesting theory...but I'm not sure that bees could make the charade convincing. Their psyche would be too different.
    ```

    - u/Obnoxious_Individual:
      ```
      They don't have to manually control every little detail, though.
      Heck, it might be enough to subtly mind-edit some key figures in the family every once in a while to guide them towards whatever they want.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        This is such a fun theory. I find the hive-mind nature of bees makes them less likely to develop higher intelligence and self-awareness, but then maybe only the queen bee exhibits that kind of intellect!
        ```

        - u/darkflagrance:
          ```
          The series has already shown us gestalt intelligences in the form of cranium rats. Maybe these are cranium bees?

          The hive shall rule all!
          ```

- u/23143567:
  ```
  I think that Daimen staying under the Mind Blank confirms that Daimen has extensive psychic abilities.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    I think exactly the opposite. Mind Blank cuts the psychic from The Web, granting absolute defense but at the cost of all offense and utility.

    He has potential, maybe some innate abilities, but he is not trained. Not trained enough to consider his psychic skills outweigh the defense of MB, at least. Zorian for instance would not use MB.

    On a side note, the Tama... the Bee family probably wants his psychic genes.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > the Bee family probably wants his psychic genes

      Do you think they'll try to tempt Zorian with one of the other family members Daimen mentioned? Even apart from his time loop skills, he is apparently a more powerful psychic than Daimen (it had side effects on him).
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        I had that thought, but I think there is not much time left in this restart. When Z&Z find a Bakora Gate to Koth so they could go there on day 3-5 of a restart, it can happen. That psychic girl that probed him could hit on him, even.

        edit, wait, maybe *that is* the way the bee people flirt, and Zorian mentally slapped her, hue hue hue.
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:

          > edit, wait, maybe that is the way the bee people flirt, and Zorian mentally slapped her, hue hue hue.

          Holy crap. You’ve found the love interest!!!
          ```

        - u/Kuratius:
          ```
          It makes a lot of sense for Orissa to be interested in Daimen because he's psychic. Has Zorian met Orissa yet? When he does, that might clear things up.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Zorian saw Orissa in this chapter, but she didn't say much.
            ```

            - u/Xtraordinaire:
              ```
              Zorian met a lot of people from the bee family, and none of them struck him as Open. So unless there is a serious flaw in Zorian's perception, they aren't natural mind mages.

              But that doesn't mean much, Aopes aren't Open either.

              I think Orissa knows that Daimen is a psychic, but more importantly knows he is an untrained one. He doesn't know his full value and thus is easier to bargain with. And as a house relying on mind magic, they are *really* interested to weave some innate ability into their family tree. Remember how Tinami got excited at the prospect of becoming a psychic through some dangerous untested experiment? Same here, through good old safe matrimony.

              I wonder whether Daimen's recent failures in his searches are purely coincidental or are a result of sabotage from bee family, though.

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Hmm. I don't know about Zorian being able to actually *control* the swarm. That sounds like it would take a lot of training and/or bloodline talent. Smack it down, yes, he could likely do that.
          ```

  What's the chance the bee family is actually a hive mind and that was an actual attack

    The cranium rats are a hive mind, and they're pretty obvious to Zorian.

  I think people called that ending already, but the main hghlight of the chapter for me was the info about self mind modification. Also,  I am interested to see more of Tarmatula family,  they rarely said anything here. That will also probably answer the question what actually Daimen saw in her.
  ```

- u/TheAtomicOption:
  ```
  This is still such a great story! *squeeee!*

  * Interesting new plot/drama setup with the Taranatanatlurna mind mage girl
  * Damien mind-blanking constantly says there may be interesting things we have yet to hear about where Koth politics is concerned. (possibly related to the mind mage girl?)
  * Damien is looking for a key piece (no surprise) means new mini-arc in the epic quest
  * setup for new learning montage & power level-up via learning of a safe way to start on 'inner' mind techniques.

  As always I can't wait for the next update!

- u/serge_cell:

  I'm surprised that Daimen didn't yet demand his share of data transfer through Time Loop, because that's his due as elder brother. I also expected him to be more of asshole, but guess he is too smart to show it now.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    He's still adjusting to believing that the time loop is real. Also, his first introduction to it was discovering that ZZ could probably wipe the floor with him. I don't think he'll be making too many *demands*. He might ask for help finding the orb when they get out, though.
