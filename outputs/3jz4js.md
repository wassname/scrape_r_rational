## [D] Good ideas in bad stories?

### Post:

Mr. Yudkowsky has mentioned ([here](http://np.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3chqm9/survey_between_hpmor_and_partially_kissed_hero_in/csyb466), as well as elsewhere previously, IIRC) that *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* is to *[Chunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411)* as *[Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/)* is to *[Partially Kissed Hero](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/103)*--and, of course, it's undeniable that *Time Braid* and *HPMoR* are superior overall to *CED* and *PKH*. However, it's equally undeniable that Perfect Lionheart came up with a lot of very interesting ideas, even if they were irksomely interspersed with such nuisances as harems and Islamophobia. Just recently, I finally forced myself to start re-reading the second half of *CED* for the first time, and rediscovered a whole bunch of cool deconstructive ideas--for example, the ninjas of the Village Hidden in the Sand make heavy use of sealing techniques in D-rank missions to bring barrels of water from distant water sources, rather than building vulnerable aqueducts that would lead invaders right to the Village's location.

Are there other such "schizophrenically-rational" stories--and better counterparts to them? Some that come to mind are *[The Unincorporated Man](https://www.goodreads.com/series/62126)* and the later books of [the *Jumper* series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49082).

  Leo Frankowski immediately comes to mind when you talk about interesting ideas in really, really, really poorly executed stories. His most obvious major failing that makes him pretty unrecommendable are the extreme misogyny and resulting plot elements from the extreme misogyny - it's extremely blatant and not pretty.

  His longest running series, the Conrad Stargard books, have some interesting technical details and so forth in a typical 'time travel to the past, start reestablishing technology'. The technical bits are well executed and it's generally good Connecticut Yankee type of story for a lot of the book - but it has sufficient bad bits that I can't really recommend it. Also, the protagonist benefits way too hard from luck at certain junctures - especially what he had with him when he went back, for example. However, I particularly like that he time-travelled to a time period where historically a major invasion was about to destroy most of the country he was travelling to, giving the character some concrete goals to work towards ('Stop the Mongol Invasion in 10 years'). The technical bits are well done and interesting. The book series gets progressively worse, though, and eventually is unreadable (under no circumstances should anyone try to read Lord Conrad's Quest For Rubber, it is just unrelentingly awful throughout). Conrad's Time Machine is notable as a prequel novel about constant time-travel abuse, which gets more and more stupid and misogynistic as it goes, but also has some interesting time travel exploiting stuff in the way of Bill and Ted's Big Adventure-style exploits, where people control their own access to information to allow them to go set up time loops later on consistent with their own understanding and so forth. Copernick's Rebellion is a standalone book about biotech taking over and revolutionizing the world, transhumanists extending immortality to others and increasing their own cognitive abilities, and prominently an extremely powerful artificially created biological intelligence becoming divorced from human goals and allowing many humans to get killed a lot because those human deaths were orthagonal to it's own goals of it's survival.  Copernick's Rebellion has so many cool plot elements stuffed into it's ~200 pages that the rampant misogyny etc nearly doesn't ruin it all!

  Goddamn thinking about Frankowski's stuff makes me feel sad now. So much potential, wasted.

  In terms of better counterparts: If you want less misogyny and so forth in your 'guy takes present day knowledge and uses it to take over a society and implement technology', then David Drake and David Weber and Eric Flint and SM Stirling have done that plot to death much less objectionably (The Safehold series and Heirs of Empire [Empire from the Ashes #3] for Weber, the Belisarius and the General books by Drake, 1632 by Flint and Island In The Sea of Time books by Stirling). In terms of timetravel-exploit books, there have been innumerable well done timetravel books but the aforementioned Bill and Ted Big Adventure finale is probably my favorite in terms of raw exploits. Copernick's Rebellion has a heady mix of a bunch of different ideas that I don't think has an exact analogue anywhere, but every single idea has been done at least a few times in less objectionable books.

    Stirling's Emberverse books are pretty good as well. The basic premise is that suddenly gas compression beyond a certain point as well as electricity over a certain threshold just stop working. While those rules are not entirely clear, they are upheld throughout the series and none of the characters are too stupid. Since most modern technology stops working, food is scarce, so the first novel (Dies the Fire) is mainly about different groups organizing to fight off bandits, adapt to the suddenly-medieval world and cultivate food. If the idea of pikemen riding to battle on bycicles sounds appealing to you, you should definitely check it out!

  [The Golden Oecumene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Oecumene) trilogy by John C. Wright has a really impressive scifi setting.  Humanity has branched a lot and actually seems alien without being unrecognizable. It also has some rather interesting memory issues and logic puzzles, as well as some interesting discussion of AI.  Unfortunately, part of the way through it turns into Atlas Shrugged in space.  Still, if you can stomach that its a pretty well constructed world.

    John C. Wright is a very interesting person.  At the time he wrote The Golden Oecumene trilogy, he was an atheistic, libertarian transhumanist with a fanatical Randian streak.  

    Several years later, however, he survived a car crash which left him with a radically altered philosophical outlook. He transformed overnight from a fanatical libertarian into an equally fanatical fundamentalist Christian.

    The author who once wrote about radically transhumanist utopias now frequently writes shockingly intolerant and homophobic polemics.  For example, take a look at [his response](https://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/8225391-perverting-the-story-to-kiddie-propaganda) to a Legend of Korra writer revealing that a character was gay.  It reads exactly like something out of Westboro Baptist, and honestly makes me wonder if that car crash involved head trauma.

    In any case, I liked The Golden Oecumene when I first read it.  I felt that the Randian themes made sense in a post-scarcity economy where they wouldn't in modern society.  However, when I look back at the series with what I now know about the author, a lot of its ideas and themes seem less innocent than they did on first reading.

      That's scary as fuck. Imagine if you hit your head and became some kind of extremist bigot, all your carefully reasoned thoughts and beliefs corrupted into something unrecognizable, abhorrent, and completely out of your control. That's horror story material right there. 

      It reminds me of when I read about the [correlation between the outlawing of lead in gas and the sustained reduction in crime over the last 30 years.](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline) How much of what we choose is actually the result of completely unknown factors nudging or even pushing us in any given direction?

      - u/ExiledQuixoticMage:

        That's actually related to my conspiracy theory as to why U.S. politics is so divisive these days.  If you look at when many of the most extreme politicians were born it's right around when leaded gasoline was at its peak.  Maybe they, for whatever reason, had enough self control not to become criminals but they lost the amount necessary to compromise or consider other viewpoints.

        It's probably nonsense but I found it interesting to think about.

      Wow, that letter is just amazing. You can often get caught in echo chambers where a lot of the criticism is couched in language the critics think sounds better "rubbing it in our faces", "sold out", "pandering".Nope. He just strips that all away.

        From the same author and with similar problems you have Orphans of Chaos, a trilogy of sci-fantasy novels that makes for a really good read when you know nothing about the author, but then you start questioning if some of the traits and preferences of the protagonist, contrived as part of the plot, arent informed by some sort of mysoginistic ideology.


        I still recommend the books even if their author can make reading them uncomfortable. They're essentially about 5 kids with contradictory but ambiguously correct worldviews exploiting them and the abilities conferred to them by their strange birthright to change their situation.


        I personally believe wildbow might've read it and used it as inspiration for the lambs of Twig. They have a very similar dynamic.

    >Unfortunately, part of the way through it turns into Atlas Shrugged in space. 

    As in it got very preachy and characters started spouting philosophy essay's for pages at a time, or as in the writer had political views you don't agree with that resemble those portrayed in AS?

      I was curious about this as well, and read some reviews on Goodreads:

      > At the beginning of the trilogy, the story's pretensions toward philosophical complexity could be ignored in light of its luxurious imagery and bewitching, kaleidoscopic narrative structure. These redeeming aspects fade to the background, however, and are soon replaced by a simple philosophical debate. And I do not mean that figuratively: by the third novel, the whole substance of the story has taken the form of an endless discussion between the characters on questions of abstract philosophy.
      ```

      - u/ExiledQuixoticMage:
        ```
        I'd agree with the review.  The books progressively go down hill as the clever world takes back seat to preaching.  I'd say it's similar to the Unincorporated Man that OP mentioned in that after a while it stops being about the future and starts being about the author's particular hobbyhorse.

        And to clarify about the Atlas Shrugged comment, I actually enjoy Rand even if I disagree with her.  It was just disappointing to see this story stop focusing on the areas in which it excelled.

    Haven't read that, but *Awake in the Night Land*, short stories set in [The Night Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Land) is one of the most amazing things I've read in years. Lovecraftian Horror with Victorian Writing.

    And, to be clear, Awake in the Night Lands was written by Wright in his fundamentalist streak, but if the author interjected his beliefs into it, it works with the settings. It is, after all, an homage to a series of stories written a century ago. Wright manages to make a bleak, nihilistic worlds where humanity is losing (and destined to lose, and die horrible deaths) and turns it into a romance. 

    It is chaste, horrifying, and beautiful.

    For the eragon magic system, you might be talking about [my writeup](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3dnmuj/d_bst_ff_munchkin_the_inheritance_magic_system/ct72ea5) in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3dnmuj/d_bst_ff_munchkin_the_inheritance_magic_system/)

      Excellent read, thanks. Particularly the point that doing magic with the ancient language is more like writing laws than programs, I'd never made that connection.

        I didn't notice it during the series, but it's definitely true. There seems to be two components to the magic - the language, which establishes limits around what the magic will do, and the intent, which pushes the magic to do as desired within the limits of the language. You can do spells in two broad categories, as well - either you use very little language and shape the spell with intent, or you use next to no intent and shape the spell with language. The result of this is that it's technically possible to do spells without using a word of the Ancient Language, or recite spells without understanding half the words. We see both in the series - Eragon learns several complicated healing spells far above his Ancient Language reading level by rote, and occasionally rewrites reality by will and power alone. The most common spells use a short phrase to define broad limits to the magic, then rely on intent to take it the rest of the way.

    My own enjoyment of it came mostly from how thoroughly the concept of "souls" were explored (and exploited)—turning them into something that felt more like ems participating in a consensual-reality simulation, with the ability to split, fuse, etc. and having to work out rules about how to keep various experience-lines of oneself from corrupting the whole. This is also in large part what I enjoyed about Alicorn's *Effulgence*, and a part of what entertains me about *Dungeon Keeper Ami*: as a distributed systems programmer, I just really enjoy reading about the practicalities of (what are effectively) the distributed-systems problems of AI.

      It's also a near-perfect clone of the magic system in David Edding's *Belgariad*.

    In my opinion, at least, the brainwashing is perfectly in-character for Sasuke (see also: Karin), and the romantic aspects are quite minor and easily ignorable. I read *[People Lie](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099)* for the *romance*--I read *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* for the *action*.

      For a second I thought that your sentence implied people lie is actually getting updated, but then I saw it wasnt :(

      I will say about the romance that it was interesting seeing two really badass MCs in a relationship without too much cheap stuff.
      Also while I think they explanation for the polyamoury was not perfect it wasnt too bad when you take the setting into account.

      But yeah, the fact that the story is about sakura being badass definitly made it possible to get away with way more OP Naruto than would be possible otherwise. Allthewhile keeping the powerbalance interesting. So the action was a huge plus

  Lawrence Watt-Evans' world-building is strong-to-incredible, but his narratives are often a little too mundanely realistic. They tend to read like awesome DnD/Pathfinder campaigns with ~rational characters.

  Of particular note, *The Annals of the Chosen* is set in a world where inanimate objects and locations have non-sapient spirits that must be appeased, negotiated with, and trained, with dangerous untamed spirits rampant outside the bounds of settlements. The plot revolves around the Wizard Lord, near-omnipotent ruler, and the Chosen, 7 individuals given supernatural mastery over traits like swordsmanship, thievery, beauty, etc, and tasked with taking down the Wizard Lord should he turn evil. The first book in the series is good; the other two are fine.

  As someone who started reading C.E.D when it was just starting out (~10 chapters) I would like to say that it is perhaps the greatest example of a story that starts off with tons of hidden potential, only to be completely and utterly **fucked up** by the author. C.E.D was comprehensive, funny, enjoyable and rewarding. Then we shifted into an amount of bashing that honestly made us more annoyed at the author than the characters, unrealistic harem nonsense and the pleasant image of Sasuke Uchiha being forced to shit himself because our main cast found it hilarious to do to him, despite the fact that he'd done nothing to really deserve it, other than being a cold asshole. I was so disappointed by the turn the story took and it will forever be my Hero. As in Hero from Worm. Such great potential brutally torn away before we could see it come to fruition.

  Sorry. But C.E.D weighs on my mind to this day, and it's been a grievance I've had for years. Shameless ranting aside, [Naruto's Compensation](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4611673/1/Naruto-s-Compensation) does a decent job at being rational. Not an AMAZING job, mind you, but it's worth a perusal at least. Naruto's approach to being a shinobi is unique and it's an approach I could see many r/rational subbers taking, assuming we could get it to function the way he did.

  The Doc Future series has a lot of great ideas, particular around the implications of a speedster with no magical force to keep them from breaking the world around them, but the polyamory it sort of shoves down both you and the Doc's throat is a bit of a turnoff. At least to me. 

  That's kinda all I can think of right now. Sorry I didn't have any real schizophrenic ideas. Hope these help :)
