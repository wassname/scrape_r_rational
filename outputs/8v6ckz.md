## [D] Offering Bounties for Breaking My Magic System

### Post:

# Bounties!

*(Note: This post was cleared this with mods ahead of time.)*

I am offering bounties for useful / fun / novel / setting-breaking ideas with regards to magic in a setting I am developing for a Rationalist Quest. Specifically, if I judge your idea to be useful to me, it gives me new ideas for filling out idiosyncratic details of the setting's cultures, or it otherwise helps me get closer to ironing out potential issues in a way I haven't yet considered, I will pay you $5 via Paypal or Venmo (will ask for details via pm), or 1 month of Reddit Gold if you prefer. If you also offer a good fix for setting-breaking ideas that maintains the desired setting, I will pay you $15 (additional, if the accepted setting-breaking idea was yours).

The level of consistency and detail I am aiming for here is somewhere between "would not be out of place in a Brandon Sanderson novel" and "you can do some physics to it without it immediately breaking everything." While there isn't a meaningful limit to the number of ideas I will accept, I have a rather high bar for acceptance criteria, and have already put a great deal of thought into this myself. If your idea does not clearly state assumptions and include significant critical analysis, it probably won't be accepted.

Of course, I am only one person, and I will never have it said that I--a mere mortal (*for now*)--thought myself above the capabilities of a veritable horde of rationalist munchkins. Hence this post. I would much prefer to get most of this out of the way so I can account for it in world-building rather than having players break it later.

*Additional Note: I will be omitting most of the details of the setting and mechanics for hopefully obvious reasons, including only information I expect to give players near the start of the Quest, which is also roughly what an average person that is particularly knowledgeable of magic would have access to.*

#### Details have been removed to prevent future metagaming. Sorry!

In general, any information from this post or any information recorded in comments should not be considered canon, or even particularly reliable. Things have changed over the course of revision and additional worldbuilding.

#### Cutoff Reached:

Thank you all for your contributions! This succeeded harder than I imagined it would, and has become immensely difficult to keep up with.  I will still try and respond to new replies and award bounties, but I'm not going to be able to reliably answer clarification questions and probably won't respond otherwise unless your idea is particularly compelling.

  If I understood Energy Burst properly, a Prismatic mage should be able to make solid objects which disintegrate when forced or dismissed by essentially creating kinetic energy force fields in whatever shape they want. Such objects would be mostly useless for all direct purposes, of course. [An average punch](http://www.science.ca/askascientist/viewquestion.php?qID=821) contains around 150 joules, so making armor or weapons will rapidly exhaust the mage's mana supplies and render them ordinary not-elves again.

  However, using such objects as industrial molds should be trivial. The force field only cares about repelling whatever material you pour into it, so molten metals can be contained as easily as any other liquid of similar density. A rank novice with a 20 MP cap can create a mold which will withstand 2,000 J of force before shattering, which is quite a lot when all you need to do is keep an otherwise stationary fluid in place until it cools enough to be self-supporting. This allows Prismatic mages to create arbitrary objects out of any metal this civilization has the capacity to melt, limited only by their capacity to hold the details of these objects in mind while creating the form.

  Assuming mundane mathematics exists in this world, much of the limitation in imagination can be mitigated by meditating on the set of equations which define your object, rather than mentally simulating the object directly. However, that isn't the really important bit. The hardest part of setting up heavy industry isn't having the idea of an automated loom, it's having the technology to create sturdy enough parts to create such a machine which will hold up to wear. DaVinci had sketches of bicycles, but the first ones weren't created until the 19th century. This is because we couldn't translate the parts DaVinci imagined into reality with enough fidelity to make a bike which actually worked, and because we didn't have enough good steel lying around to make the idea practical until then.

  With Prismatic Energy Burst Forging, the imagination-to-reality gap is gone. Precision forging of small, detailed pieces for intricate machines becomes easy the moment you have a machine-worthy alloy. In fact, smaller pieces are even easier to create than larger ones, as the metal involved will require less force to shape into the required form. The only hard limitation on the intricacy of machines is the intricacy of the most complicated part, and once someone has the idea to start mass-producing screws and other fasteners, even that goes by the wayside. Any part which could be broken down into simpler parts becomes easy to produce. The only limitations on the development of industry become metallurgy and the number of Prismatic mages available. That sounds like a real limit, until the first Prismatic mage starts making precision tools to replicate what they can do with force field molds. Precise lathes and other metal-shaping devices would allow normals to start creating replacement parts for machines, and once you have that, you have a full-on industrial revolution.

  This trick also applies to the handling of any other fluid which humans don't want to handle directly. Glassblowing can be revolutionized by blowing the glass into a perfectly shaped mold which vanishes the moment the glass hardens. Poisonous gasses can be transferred between containers in perfect security by containing them in force field jars in the interim. Prismatic surgeons could make arbitrarily sharp scalpels and easily ligate bleeders all on their own, as it takes a relatively tiny amount of force to keep even a major artery closed.

  Now that I think of it, the fact that no diseases exist means that trauma surgery should be far more advanced in this world than it would be in ours under the same circumstances, as you don't need to worry about the waste of resources involved in a "saved" patient dying of sepsis. Their wars against not-goblins should not leave thousands of crippled casualties behind, as civil-war-and-earlier battlefield amputations were overwhelmingly done to prevent infection, rather than to stop bleeding. Anyone who doesn't bleed to death should survive any battle wound, in the long run.

  Just in general, a world with no disease will be so astoundingly different from our own that I'm not sure you can be reasonably expected to simulate it well enough to write a story with no plot holes, whether obvious or not. Food will either keep indefinitely or just become less nutritious over time as it breaks down, but you will always be able to eat it safely as long as no foodborne pathogens exist. Everyone should be drinking directly from rivers and streams, as without cholera and other waterborne pathogens, the impetus to create safer drinks like beer will not exist. Overpopulation will be solvable only through advances in technology increasing the amount of people you can feed with a given amount of land, war, or autocratic policies directly limiting the reproduction of the masses. In fact, this might be the major impetus behind repeated, failed campaigns against the not-goblins. Win or lose, a ton of peasants you couldn't feed are now dead. Insert conspiracy to repeatedly fail in conquering the ancestral homelands and/or prop up the occasional smart not-goblin warlord as long as possible to serve this purpose.

  Screw the magic system, actually. No diseases is way more interesting.

    > A rank novice with a 20 MP cap can create a mold which will withstand 2,000 J of force before shattering

    Since joules measure work rather than force the mold can actually be infinitely strong provided it doesn't do any work - i.e. if it doesn't change shape / move around while full, or otherwise create energy from nothing.

    This is *definitely* exploitable with the right physics, for example making diamonds from graphite with an externally powered magical vise.

      Are you sure you didn't confuse joules (unit of energy) with watts (unit of work)?

      - u/sdmat:
        ```
        Yep, joules can measure both work and energy while watts measure power (the rate at which work is done / energy is transferred).

        The way energy burst is specified joules are used as a unit of work ("100J change in physical energy per MP spent"). I.e. up to 100J can be magically transferred to the physical environment per MP. In a comment somewhere in this thread the OP mentions phrasing it that way after a discussion with their physics professor so presumably it's a deliberate choice.
        ```

        - u/skairunner:
          ```
          Ah, so the unabbreviated unit should be J/MP.

  - u/-Vecht-:
    ```
    u/Frommerman: Regarding your points about molds, I had to consult with my ex-physics professor co-QM about this one. He brought to my attention that the limits I specified on the ability was problematic. It is in fact total energy change to the environment that should be the limiter, so if you attempted to use Energy Burst to create molds in this way, they would be broken by the heat of the metals. Also, the forms don't last very long, and certainly not long enough to allow forging.

    Thanks for your suggestion though, and I'll award a bounty to this for pointing out an issue that needed refinement. PM me with details or let me know if you prefer gold. (E: Donation.)

    Regarding the disease stuff, this falls under setting-specific, so I won't be speaking to that.

      Give the bounty to the ACLU. They need it more than me right now.

      Edit: I also realized I was making this way too hard. If Blue mages are allowed to manifest forms in the middle of a barrel of slightly molten candle wax or gallium or something, they can freeze themselves permanent objects around which ceramic molds could be formed. If they are only allowed to manifest objects in open air, they could do a sort of 3D printer impression by selectively freezing the surface and pulling the object out carefully. It would take a ton of skill, but they might be able to turn themselves into a primitive prototyping machine.

  Imbue Object seems ripe for abuse.  

  Can a mage Imbue an object with enough power that it recharges itself in ~1 month, and has the ability to cast 'Imbue Object', passing on a lesser form of its abilities?

  Is mana or time the main bottleneck for imbuing objects?  If it's mana, then Siphon on captured enemies, willing apprentices (who would be useful even if they never get trained), or other self-charging objects (if they are a valid target) could speed up the creation process enough to unbalance things.

  What are the limits on mana capacity for imbued objects?  Can a mage spend five years pouring power into an object imbued with Energy Burst, then release it all at once to destroy a castle in a single blow?

  ---

  Transformation is permanent (unless countered with Heal)?  I see two strategies that make logistics easier for an army.  

  First, transform every soldier into a "normal" form, so that all equipment (armor, boots, etc.) is perfectly interchangeable.  This can also replace physical conditioning if the mages are precise enough.

  Second, if animals are a valid target, transform a cow into a mouse (spending ~1 hour to shrink it), carry it where you're going (and feed it over time), de-transform it, then eat it.  Depending on how hard it is to do, this may only be useful for Special Forces.

  ---

  This is probably just an artifact of your summary, but one joule of electricity is *far* deadlier than one joule of fire or water jets.

  Telepathy can be heavily optimized through the use of code, although your familiarity/complexity costs may cover that already.  "3-7" *sounds* simpler than "A force of approximately 100 goblin-things are currently traversing the North-East pass", but it conveys the same information.

    * It is theoretically possible (not known to be impossible) for a mage to imbue an object with enough power that it recharges itself in \~1 month, but this would take a staggering amount of magic
    * Imbued objects can cast imbue object on other objects, but because of the minimum cost, you will lose efficiency with each step.

    >Is mana or time the main bottleneck for imbuing objects?

    Time and mana are both important, but we're talking order minutes for an expert mage to put all of their capacity into an object. I suppose Siphon could be used on someone using the Imbue Object ability, so there is definitely the possibility of gathering magic from enough sources via Siphon to put much greater magic into something than is otherwise possible. It isn't physically possible for someone to concentrate for 5 years, but...

    If you can offer an analysis with reasonable numerical assumptions on Energy Burst that convinces me this is setting-breaking, it is worth $20 (extra because there's an easy fix).

    This is a really neat idea and easily worth $5. :D

    In general, mages this talented won't be abundant enough to make "normal form soldiery" standard practice.

    Shrinking livestock for transport (or maybe to store in fortified locations overnight?) is really cool.

    >This is probably just an artifact of your summary, but one joule of electricity is far deadlier than one joule of fire or water jets.

    One joule of energy imparted. Even if it looks different, it's normalized.

    >Telepathy can be heavily optimized through the use of code, although your familiarity/complexity costs may cover that already.  "3-7" sounds simpler than "A force of approximately 100 goblin-things are currently traversing the North-East pass", but it conveys the same information.

    Yep. To speak more to complexity, it is measured by the relative frequency of words in the language you are using to communicate with the target. This means that using codes for cheaper transmission is indeed clever and effective, but not an idea I didn't already have.

      > Time and mana are both important, but we're talking order minutes for an expert mage to put all of their capacity into an object.

      Wait, so if you get about 10% of your MP back per minute, an expert mage can dump all their MP into a new object every ten minutes, over and over?  So for a four-hour work day I can crank out 24 wands?  That seems super broken.  At that point MP isn't even a limitation in a fight, because everyone has a bandolier of wands that they made the day before.  And now your resource concerns aren't "I can only cast so many spells per day/combat" (per day already nuked by 10-minute regen time), but "I can only carry so many wands."

      Especially if imbued objects can be used by non-wizards.  In which case, wizards should never leave home.  Just make wands.

      One in a two hundred people is a trained wizard.  So in just over eight days, everyone in the entire population can have a Wand of Healing.  (okay fine, you need to be an advanced wizard to make wands and regen mana this quickly, so if you need to be in the top 10% of wizards to do this it takes society about three months to give everyone a magic item).  I'm not sure that's what you want?

      Reading through the rest of your posts, I don't think that I can make a siege weapon anymore, the individual spells are too weak to pay for the overhead of imbuing an item.  A handgun bullet, falling three feet, 1 cm^2 of third-degree burns, or a defibrillator charge is about 500 J, and a cannonball is about 1,250,000 J (2500x as much energy as a normal attack).

      That being said, a magical [Hwacha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwacha) could serve as an expensive but deadly force-multiplier if loaded up with energy-projection wands.

    Oh, and only one actor can use Imbue Object on an object at a given time, so no storing tons of magic up in Imbue-object-imbuers then dumping them all into one object. After an object is imbued, it can't be re-imbued until it is inert.

      Well now you’re just adding more exploitability. You could create secure currency that can’t be counterfeited, or secure containers for important messages by using imbue object on it just to say “this has been imbued with the Royal Seal”. The fact that it was imbued is proof enough, it wouldn’t matter if the imbued object had any other abilities. Possibly not practical except for very large transactions or very important transmissions, but without a way to hack imbue object after it’s been placed there is a lot to work with.

  The first thing that comes to mind is transforming into a creature that contains valuable polymers or chemicals that are just a difficult to manufacture configuration of common elements. For direct combat application, grow glands that produce incredibly potent venom from rare, very small animals that wouldn't be a feasible source of poison ordinarily. Then extract the venom and put it in toxic gas, giving the not-elves chemical weapons at at least a WWI level that should wipe out any group of goblin-things too stupid to be wearing gas masks. Which is most of them.

    Has to be based on the user's experience, and organic in nature. I don't think there are even any such creatures in existence.

      Thanks! About a month ago I thought up a fantasy setting that had transformation as its main feature, and I decided to drop every other element of the magic system to see just how broken I could make permanently transforming body parts into those of other species. It gets a bit crazy when you throw invertebrates into the mix.

- u/CaseyAshford:
  ```
  The immediate idea for a possible exploit that could break the setting comes from the use of Transformation as a means of achieving Immortality by transforming into younger versions of yourself or other people. One possible change you could make to the spell is to have Transformed individuals still suffer from debilitating mental conditions like Alzheimer's disease or dementia that effectively cause their death even if their body is young. This would allow for the existence of a very interesting setting where everyone above a certain social or financial position can retain perpetual youth without having to deal with the massive implications of an undying ruling class.

  This may not be necessarily setting breaking but another idea based on Transformation is the potential ability of a Not-Elf to transform himself or a trusted compatriot into a Goblin-Thing. The Transformed Not-Elf could use their superior Not-Elf intellect and technology to acquire a position of power and unify the Goblin-Things. This seems like a great plot bunny as the Dark Lord unifying the monstrous races is a classic trope for a reason.

    >The immediate idea for a possible exploit that could break the setting comes from the use of Transformation \~\~\~

    Transformation does not allow fine-grained control of the target form, and does not allow for any changes except for mass or volume (including age). It cannot be used reliably for infiltration. You could transform into a goblin-thing or a not-elf or vice versa, but the details wouldn't be exact and your mannerisms would give you away.

      ```
      If you just want to transform into a generic goblin-thing, does the imprecise essence impact this or does it mean that all that anyone can transform into is golem-like shapes without facial features or fingers or any smaller details like that?

      Are goblin-things clever enough to collectively figure out that the powerful goblin-thing ordering them about on pain of magical death and surprisingly successful raids on not-elves is secretly not a goblin-thing, and would they care given that they have no culture and the strange goblin-thing with more magic than any five other mages is making their tribe more successful than any others in living memory?

      Could this work repeatedly on a cyclical basis if the goblins only have word-of-mouth to pass down their tribe's history, or is word-of-mouth retelling more culture than they can manage?

  I'm not worried about bounties :)

  > Transform one's body, or the body of a willing or subdued target to that of another form. The form must be based off of one's experience of living creatures, and must be vaguely organic in nature. The caster does not have fine-grained control of the target form, but can reliably produce the same form. The cost to reverse the transformation is negligible. One may "master" one form with a great deal of practice. Every successful transformation reduces the time it takes to complete the transformation by up to a few seconds, to a minimum of 3 seconds. A mastered form may be replaced by spending an entire day in another form (that form does not become mastered).

  Convert elephants to mice, launch sacks of mice from catapults, convert back to elephants in the 3 seconds they are in flight, it's now raining elephants on your enemies? 

  Convert mice to elephant, butcher elephant and feed whole town/all your troops? (Or cows, if you want to be inefficient.) I know someone already mentioned doing this to transport cows, but why bother? Just transport (or catch) mice and have a mage who can turn mice into cows.

  One question, you mentioned in one of your comments that transformed creatures wouldn't be able to breed. Would a transformed chicken still be able to produce unfertilized eggs?
  ```

  - u/hikahia:
    ```
    Ooh, another thought about transformation. Elephants live for 60-70 years, mice live for 2-3 years. If I transform a 6 month old elephant into a mouse, let it live as a mouse for a year, and then transform it back, is it now a 20-year-old elephant (equivalent amount of aging as a mouse) or is it still only a 1.5 year old elephant?

    If they age, that opens you up to all sorts of fun with sped up breeding, you could whelp a litter and have them aged up to breeding age in a fraction of the time it would normally take.

  Firstly, this is a great idea! I hope all the responses aren't overwhelming you. With that in mind, here are some thoughts I've had:

  * You've commented that Energy Burst travels via some illusory medium. Depending on what blocks it, that could lead to those fearing such attacks wearing protection like wide-brimmed hats with long veils. These wouldn't absorb energy but instead block the illusory medium. Of course, it could easily be that you can just target the hat and the ice spike will continue on through.

  * It's possible to make lenses out of ice. Energy Burst with blue mana could create such lenses temporarily, for a cost of only 1MP. This might be more economical than scrying over long distances when line of sight is available. Archimedes-style solar weapons using giant lenses probably aren't possible, though.

  * When making kinetic attacks with Energy Burst, is kinetic energy measured in the caster's frame of reference or in the frame of the planet? If it's the caster's frame, you could see magical jousts where casters launch their attacks from the backs of galloping horses so that the kinetic energy of the attack is higher in the frame of a target they're charging towards. If it's measured from a particular part of the caster, like the hand, Transformation could be used to put that part on a long, flexible limb, so that the spell can be released as that part is being whipped towards the enemy.

  * In a similar manner to the Transformation for venom, could Energy Burst with green mana be used to produce a burst of nature-based energy in the form of poison or acid? That could cause more harm than might otherwise be possible, as minimal physical energy would need to be imparted. Of course, the substance would have to be fast-acting enough to cause harm before it vanishes.

  * Is the time horizon of Luck distinct from its duration? If you've narrowed a battle plan down to two options, would it help to cast Luck then toss a coin to choose between them? If a personal stake is required, you could also bet on the outcome of the battle. From the sound of it, it would be hard to tell whether this works or not - it might be a sort of superstition that some generals have. It probably counts as relying on Luck, too

  * You've mentioned magical backlash as a possibility that is more likely when Siphon is used. Would Luck help to avoid this? Also, could this be used to counterspell by sending mana (ideally of a kind useless to both sender and receiver) to a caster as they're casting?

  * Would the magic present in the environment ever be a limiting factor? Depending on how quickly it's replenished, you could have the elves pursue a scorched earth policy of sending patrols through an area using mana, perhaps literally scorching the earth with it, in order to create buffer zones that lack enough ambient magic for the goblin casters to recover. This is partially inspired by Trudi Canavan's Magicians series, in which I think magic items are used with a similar purpose at one point.

  * This is a little morbid, but without disease, famine would presumably be the main nonviolent form of disaster. However, no disease also means that amputating limbs to eat would be less risky, and the availability of healing magic could perhaps allow those limbs to be restored in times of plenty. 

  * It sounds like the default unit of organisation for mages should be a trio containing one with an affinity for each type of mana, one of whom knows siphon, so that each can benefit from the unusable mana reserves of the others.

  * I'm aware that you're no longer offering transformation bounties, but two options that I don't think have been ruled out are transforming for superior eyesight and other senses, and transforming into a form that can fly. Both of these would be great boons for recon and guerilla warfare by the elves. 

  * How distinct are the mind and the brain? I'm assuming that Transforming an elf into an ox wouldn't diminish their intelligence, but what about transforming an ox into an elf? Could that make animal training easier?

  * On a similar note, it might be possible for the elves to train large docile animals and Transform them into more dangerous forms for combat, but I expect it would be a challenge to have the Transformed animal fight effectively.

  * Lastly, I know you're not looking for setting information but I'm curious why the elves launch attacks on the goblins rather than clearing out the wilderness in their territory, since that's a major cause of deaths and having more farmland would increase the elven population

    It's stated that **matter** created with the form is temporary, but the implication is that *energy* is permanent. That is to say, if you burn something with a Red Energy Burst it doesn't "un burn" a little while later. In that case, you should be able to use a Blue energy burst to precision freeze a form out of a pool of water. It'd require some craftsmanship, but I'd imagine "Ice Fabricators" in this way would be relatively common since it doesn't require a big MP pool.

These wouldn't absorb energy but instead block the illusory medium. Of course, it could easily be that you can just target the hat and the ice spike will continue on through.

    This is pretty clever, and I like it as a worldbuilding detail. +1 bounty. PM me for payment details or let me know if you prefer gold. (E: Claimed)

    >It's possible to make lenses out of ice. Energy Burst with blue mana could create such lenses temporarily, for a cost of only 1MP. This might be more economical than scrying over long distances when line of sight is available. Archimedes-style solar weapons using giant lenses probably aren't possible, though.

    This doesn't work; the form don't last long enough to be useful for anything.

    >When making kinetic attacks with Energy Burst, is kinetic energy measured in the caster's frame of reference or in the frame of the planet? If it's the caster's frame, you could see magical jousts where casters launch their attacks from the backs of galloping horses so that the kinetic energy of the attack is higher in the frame of a target they're charging towards. If it's measured from a particular part of the caster, like the hand, Transformation could be used to put that part on a long, flexible limb, so that the spell can be released as that part is being whipped towards the enemy.

    Haven't considered this; will get back to you after consulting with physics-QM.

    >In a similar manner to the Transformation for venom, could Energy Burst with green mana be used to produce a burst of nature-based energy in the form of poison or acid? That could cause more harm than might otherwise be possible, as minimal physical energy would need to be imparted. Of course, the substance would have to be fast-acting enough to cause harm before it vanishes.

    This is limited by the energy change in the environment, so you couldn't cause more absolute damage than with a fireball, but it would let you have some control over what kind of damage you cause (frostbite vs burns vs acid burns).

    >Is the time horizon of Luck distinct from its duration? If you've narrowed a battle plan down to two options, would it help to cast Luck then toss a coin to choose between them? If a personal stake is required, you could also bet on the outcome of the battle. From the sound of it, it would be hard to tell whether this works or not - it might be a sort of superstition that some generals have. It probably counts as relying on Luck, too.

    Who knows? ;)

    >You've mentioned magical backlash as a possibility that is more likely when Siphon is used. Would Luck help to avoid this? Also, could this be used to counterspell by sending mana (ideally of a kind useless to both sender and receiver) to a caster as they're casting?

To expand on that point, burst to create elemental ice as a shell around the water form. This freezes the water within. Then extract the object and set it on a dry surface. The elemental ice will vanish leaving the real frozen water intact.

  Hmm, one of the things I see is implementing a tax break (or reward, or whatever) for people who are sensitive to magic, but not strong enough to be actual mages to let you siphon off their mana.  That way, you don't have to worry so much about exhausting your apprentices doing the siphoning to them.

  Next, implement a telepathy based post office.  The telepaths can work in shifts, and while they are on shift, they'll be 'in the post office' meaning you don't have to worry too much about where they are to send stuff to them.

  You can also implement a scrying based message passing system: use writing or a sand table or whatever to draw your message and have someone scry it.  This would seem to get around the complexity limits of telepathic messages.

  Could you make a device that could recreate the scried image/drawing/letter?  Then you have magic fax machines.  You also have a magic printing press.  (Example of how this could be done: energy burst fire in the form of letters, to simply burn them into your paper/parchment/whatever.  Or energy burst an ice block with your letters sticking out and then just ink them and press.)

  Write a 'code book' for telepathic messages.  Take a page from ye olde maratime radio codes, and reduce 'common' message to collections of 3 letters (or whatever).

  The post office lets yo gain all sorts of advantages from real time communication.  Example: weather tracking, if a big storm is coming in, your telepaths can tell the post office in the port city (or whatever) about it, so they don't send out their fishing fleet (or whatever).  I know ground based weather tracking stations were used with the advent of radio.

  In addition, the post office allows for much more centralized government.  You don't need to delegate decision making power to some baron if the village mayor (or whatever) can just ask the central government for what they want done.

  If you can scry on some object high above, you can do things like send a kite up over your army, scry the kite, and get a birds eye view of what your army (and the other army) is doing.  In fact, scrying on a kite for general recon should work all the time.

  If you can revoke transforms at a distance, you can fire blue whales (or whatever) at people, by making the blue whale smaller, getting it over them, and then letting the transform go.

  Telepathy also means you have a method of determining  longitude while at sea.  At local noon (or whenever) on the ship, you talk to/scry the post office in your capitol to find out what time it is there, which lets you compare the times and find what your longitude is.  This is a pretty big deal in long range ship navigation.

  You can probably use energy burst to mimic explosives.  (Example, use a fire or electrical burst to flash a little bit of water to steam in a confined space).  This lets you do things like cut roadways, fire cannons, quarry stone, etc much easier than ye olde pick and chisel method.  If this works, you end up with star forts instead of castles, since castle walls don't resist cannon fire.  This also lets you do things like have large stone blocks pre-prepared to block roads in the case of invasion, and when the invasion comes, you just drop the rocks.  (IRL, South Korea has several pre-prepared big blocks of concrete to block roadways, etc in the case of invasion.)

  You can do much more intensive training on people if you can heal all the 'minor' joint, ligament, bone, and muscle damage to the trainees.  Train until your muscles are tearing off your bones, get healed, do it all again tomorrow.  You can't do this this IRL because of long recovery times and the build up of incremental damage, but if you can heal all that, go wild.

  You can probably get 'canned' food by using energy burst to sterilize food in an airtight container (e.g. a glazed piece of pottery).

  [Wrote these before reading other comments to avoid contamination, so may repeat things. ]

  The **magic transferring** is going to be the biggest thing. You can effectively get around any of the mana restrictions by having enough minions to get the magic from them. 

  Depending on how fast magic builds up/dissipates in a person then you would either have arrangements with as many people as possible to regularly give you their mana, or have them all kept nearby for when needed. If it’s a semifuedal society then you would probably make them your close servants/retainers. Having a large retinue would be important for retaining power and status. [This would end up being similar to how breath works in Sanderson's Warbreaker, or the magic in the Black Magician series.]

  The next bit depends a lot on how much mana an individual can hold and for how long: 

  * if there isn't a limit and it dissipates slowly/not at all then you would end up with individuals building up as much as possible, under they are storing a nuclear level amount personally. (This would fit in well with the fuedal lords, e.g. each lord has a couple of hundred serfs who ritualistically give them mana regularly). 
  * If it dissipates or is capped then you would have people absorbing as much as possible, then putting it into objects and stockpiling those. (They effectively become mana storage batteries, but with a specific use.) Which ends up with a similar dynamic, but items are potentially easier to steal, deny access to, or buy and sell. 
  * If these items can be used by anyone, then you have an equivalent of the invention of gunpowder, where you could equip a group of soldiers with premade magic items, making them as powerful as mages for the length of a battle. This would be a potential way to explain why the not-elves have maintained military superiority, if they have squads of professional trained soldiers all with magic weapons, and the enemy has rare mages and lots of grunts. (Again the firearms analogy). 
  * Socially this also changes the role of mages from front line combatants to manufacturing weapons en masse, and means having a separate professional soldier class using the weapons. 

  If magic is capped/dissipates, but mass production of items isn't an option: You would have mages with teams entourages of dozens/hundreds on hand to power their abilities. E.g. in a battle situation a mage effectively acts like an artillery piece, with minions as ammo, continuously rotating to refill them. Tactically this means defending the entourage is important, and by killing them you can disable opposing magic users. Also since they are a limited resource the mages will run out eventually, so the side with the bigger supply has a major advantage. So how fast you use your reserves compared to your opponent is key. Meaning there might be tactics of forcing your opponent to use theirs up early in a battle. 

  Another way to nerf the imbued magic items would be to have them also slowly lose magic over time, or only be usable by the the original maker. 

  **Telepathy/scrying** gives a massive military advantage, allowing the side with the better mages (presumably the elves) to have a level of information and coordination that wasn't possible until the modern age. Obviously this makes it easier for them to set ambushes, send small groups to intercept, etc. Total information superiority is a big deal. So you may want to add an antiscrying ability? Scrying can also be used as an equivalent of telepathy, if you have someone write information in a pre specified location a scryer can read the messages. Which might allow you to get around some of telepathy's restrictions, in exchange for the added restriction that its one way. E.g. a soldier i the field can write out a page long report and leave it on top of a predeignated rock, bypassing the information restrictions on telepaths, With two scryers you can have an instant messenger style conversation with them each writing on paper and reading the otehrs paper. 

  Also, havign fast long distance communication means you can have a much more modern centralised state and culture than would be possible before the modern era on earth. Meaning fuedal lords would be much less independent, and news travels a lot faster. Which has various politicla and economic implications. Combines interestingly with people not being able to travel much because of the monsters etc, as that means walled cities with telepaths can be culturally and politically linked, but the people rarely interact in person

  **Where does the food come from?** 

  * For the elves, you say they are on a small area of not very fertile land, does that mean they have a strictly limited population (much smaller than their original one) and frequent food shortages? That makes control of land and population control a big deal politically. 

  * For the goblin/orcs, do they have a cohesive enough society and enough intelligence to have large scale farming? If not I can't see them maintaining a population without magical assistance. This then opens the question of why they are good enough at coordinating for that, but not for other things. 

  Related to that,  I'm not a big fan of the big dumb warrior race trope in general. Since its hard to do well without getting into uncomfortable territory. Though there are ways you can play with it. How do they maintain larg enough societies for food etc, if they are innately violent or stupid? Is there some limitation that only comes out as groups get larger? Could there be tribes who were coordinated enough that the elves could trade with them? That opens interesting possibilities with havign different not-goblin nations trading with the elves or acting as buffer states/mercenaries. Also allows things like selling some good quality weapons to one tribe and setting them off aginst their neighbours


  **edit** also, there's al sorts of fun you ca have if invigorate spells can be used for magic power, intelligence, speed of thought, skill in magic, etc. But I assume those would be not allowed. Maybe make a hard rule that it can only apply to physical attributes? Being able to remove the need for sleep or food would aso be a big deal

  **edit 2** Can energy burst pass through objects? If yes, then I create an extremely thin but large and wide sheet at approximately neck height in the middle of an enemy formation, killing them en masse. In general it would also be most useful to deploy very small shapes targetted at vital areas. (Tiny amount in the eye/brain is often fatal.)

  I've got a bunch of questions though I'm sure you'll answer them in the way that doesn't clearly break the system.

  For Imbue object:

  How does the Magic Ability get triggered after the caster has imbued an object? Can these Magic Abilities be triggered without a person to use them? E.g. Could I imbue a rock with energy burst to keep hammering the same spot over a long period of time?

  How is the Magic Power of the imbued object determined?

  Could you imbue a single marble in a bag of marbles with Imbue Object so that it imbues another marble with Imbue Object? And then later both of those marbles imbue two other marbles with Imbue Object? And so on until you had a bag of marbles with a lot of MP?

  What happens if a caster tries to imbue an object that has already been imbued (but isn't yet inert)? 

  What counts as an object? Could a caster imbue a building with Soothe?

  For energy burst:

  Can the user control the density of the energy? E.g. Can a caster make a large block of ice that isn't filled with much energy and so doesn't cost much MP? Can a caster make a bullet that's imparted with a lot of energy? 

  What happens when the temporary object fades? E.g. Would this kill a person if they breathed the air of a green energy burst when it disappears? 

  What does a form consist of? Could a caster make a form that is oil and then burn it? Could a caster make a gold coin and sell it? Could a caster make gunpowder or other explosives? Could a caster make carbon nanotubes?

  Do the created forms follow the laws of physics? E.g. if a caster were to create a large rock above someone, would it fall to crush them?

  For transformation:

  What happens if you reverse a transformation in an area that is smaller than the real body? How fast does this reversal happen?

  For all blue magics:

  Can these be cast on an involuntary target, either by a caster or by an object imbued with their spells? e.g. could you throw a cube of scrying at a person to take them out of the battle?

  For telepathy:

  Can a caster send telepathic messages to people who don't want them? Can a caster send a message that's very long but not very complex? E.g. Could a caster send the equivalent of tv static or me saying "Hi" on repeat for 1 hour?

  Is a message sent all at once or does it happen over a period of time? If the latter, what happens if the target moves while the caster is sending a message?

  For heal and rejuvenate:

  Is the mind of the target at all affected by these? E.g. What would these do to someone who had memory loss due to being hit in the head?

  "Further, Prismatic energy does not naturally occur, but Blue, Red and Green energies may be combined in equal parts to form Prismatic energy, with all due implications."

  If I have 1 Red, 1 blue, and 1 green, does that make 1 prismatic or 3?

  'For theory-crafting purposes, assume that a novice Magician will have ~20-50 MP, adept Magicians will have ~50-100, and experts will have ~100-250. "
  How long does it take to reach novice (do they start at that?), and is there any change in efficacy, casting speed, or regeneration rate or just in storage // Is increased storage correlated to spell pool  / efficacy / casting rate, and if so how strongly?

  What does open sky mean for scrying? Can you block scrying by cloud cover? Mist? A massive umbrella pavilion? Kicking up a dust cloud? Carryign rock sheets?

  Is prismatic a separate attunation from the standard three, or is having 1 enough?

  "The form must be based off of one's experience of living creatures, and must be vaguely organic in nature."

  Is Transformation permanent? If so, then depending on what vaguely organic in nature covers, expect things like spider silk, some metallic bacteria; I might also expect that mages would look into heavy metal poisoning of animals, then turn stock animals into these sickly, metal-laden animals in order to turn magic into rare materials, which would make the price of materials equal to the price of that mage's time and magic. This isn't neccesarily setting breaking, but should have big impacts ont he ecomonics of precious materials.

  Can you use luck to get a favorable result ona  psuedorandom outcome, like blindly throwing darts? If so, can you use it as a discount scrying for throwing darts at a map to identify locations or the like?

  Healing can't effect aging, but can it affect side effects of aging, like wrinkles or memory loss or hair whitening?

  So I might or might not be braking your setting exactly, but arbitrary tf magic will do terrible, terrible things to your cultures.

  The first thing you need to understand is that the earliest evidence we have for a humans capacity for imagination is [a furry](). Every cultures first religion is based around anthropomorphised concepts. Every culture that has ever existed has extensively used anthro characters in their art, religion, and myth. Significant fractions of your not-elves are going to not be not-elves.

  "Oh, well, people into that stuff in our world aren't common, so that means people into that stuff in my world would be the same." Except the people historically into that have been the cultural and religious leaders, people like actors, shamans, artists, priests, etc. Which means that their culture is going to have a strong culture of exploring that.

  Species swaps are going to be a huge thing, since rock eaters have at least one form that they are familiar with: their own, and mages specializing in transformation are going to be spending a lot of time swapping around forms so they can familiarize themselves. Are the rock eaters better miners? Expect a lot of miners to voluntarily become not-elf/rock eater hybrids. I expect that not-elves actually come from using transformation magic to optimize their stat-builds, which would happen anyways. 

  Referencing the above, body mods like horns, weird skin, double eyes, etc. etc are going to be made and passed down, accumulating in the gene pool.

  Birth would be a cake walk for

  I know you are no longer rewarding points about transformation but I have some questions about how you are modeling the effect from a nurobialogical level.

  I am assuming it is intended for the brain to at least vaguely cross over after a transition, IE they keep memories, habits, and skills. I also assume that you intend for things to change from one not-elf to mouse or most other biological transformations as long as you have the mana.

  I am wondering how you keep the complexity of a sientinent brain working when condensed at such small levels. Human brains are already very efficient and without offloading the processing I don’t know how a mouse can run human software. I am also worried about how it is even paserving the very complex patterns that make up memories.

  I know you had a disclaimer about size working in weird ways, but I have fiddled with scientific transformations and have been unable to find a method I liked. So if you have found an eligant solution I would like to hear it.

    As the form materializes and travels, it pushes air out of the way. The energy required to do so is accounted for in the 100J delta-energy per MP limit, but is generally negligible. This does mean that attempting to use it in water or some medium denser than air is going to be less effective. When the effect fades, it does so gradually (you can imagine it continuously shrinking away into nothing), and whatever medium it traveled through will flow back to occupy the space.

  >Telepathically communicate with the target individual. Complexity is bounded by one's understanding of the target's language. Distance is soft-bounded by needing to know roughly where the target is in relation to the user. This limit can be mitigated with use of scrying, and also with practice over time.

  If I'm reading this right, you can break this to create long distance military communications. Is the only Mp limit message complexity ? How do you define complexity ?

  Write a code in which each command or information is keyed to one or two phonemes. Like, the TH sound in "The" is enemy and the TH sound in "fourth" is ally. Since there are languages  in the real world with upwards of 140 phonemes, it should be fairly easy to convey any complex orders using at most 5\~6 phonemes for trivial MP costs. Think morse code, except instead of binary you are working with base 140. Prefer using very common phonemes, and leave the rarer phonemes for weirder words.

  Nail down a chair and train all communication officers (blue mages) to keep track of where the chair is in relation to them.  Teach officers to end communications with a indication of location so the mage in the chair can relay back messages.  Congratulations, you just created a [Telephone Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_exchange) that can relay orders in real time, instantly, at all moments for little to no cost, directly to the receiver's brain. Even modern day military would kill for this kind of security.

  Now put a Scryer just beside that chair for the duration of pitched battles. You now have both instant communications and the magical equivalent of satellite surveillance while your enemies are using scouts. You see where i am going with this.

  Communications is the most broken thing in warfare that I know of. And these guys have communications that are impossible to intercept.
