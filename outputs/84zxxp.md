        [](/rbdblush) I'm right with you - it's a trope in romance for a reason!

  Not a big romance person usually, but I like this a lot so far. The exploration of vampire culture via the opera and everything surrounding it drew me in right away. The idea that having a human lover might become a status symbol because of the time investment required is pretty clever--I'm guessing relationships between two vampires require much less frequent interaction than a mortal would expect?

  Another thing I really like is that we get a sense of what motivates William right off the bat, and that he's almost immediately in active pursuit of a goal. That's a major factor in how easily I can get invested in a character. 

  I also like that we're immediately shown his appreciation for the opera, to the point of greatly admiring a specific librettist and considering the event a "treat." Sometimes rational protagonists can come across more like value-maximizing AI than real people. From the opera scene, I could tell right away that William isn't that kind of protagonist.

    I think everyone likes romance more than they'd care to admit, even to themselves - last year when we were writing it "full tilt", I listened to a great podcast episode that covered romance as a genre and it really solidified for me what I like about it, and all that. At the end of the day, most everyone wants to fall in love with and kiss attractive people, so it's funny that most people don't want to read about it. 

    (And, well, I'll admit I don't read much romance either. Or vampire novels. My coauthor actually had to make me re-do one of the scenes because as written it was basically identical to a scene from Twilight...)

    It depends on the vampires; there's a lot of variation because vampires come from all the cultures of the Earth, while at the same time having their own culture. It ranges between extremes: two vampires who are married and fiercely monogamous/loyal to one another even though they live on different continents and see each other once a century (but exchange frequent letters), to a pair who literally do not leave one another's side for anything, spending every moment of their unlife together until they kind of become one person in two bodies.

      I should say that I *can* enjoy romance a hell of a lot, it's just that like 99% of it fails to resonate with me (maybe because I don't want to fall in love with and kiss attractive people, haha). I love passionate emotion and I love intense affection between characters, so when romance is good it's really good. I have high hopes for this being one of the times I enjoy it! 

      Even if I don't end up enjoying the romantic stuff itself, I know I'll still enjoy the story for the the characters and worldbuilding. The various ways vampires do romance sound really interesting, especially the "one person in two bodies" kind--will we be seeing examples of these in the story?

  Our update schedule is going to be one chapter a month with a one-page interlude halfway in between. Some of the interludes will advance the plot or provide foreshadowing; some will explore interesting ideas; some will just be cute little scenes we wanted to write but couldn't fit elsewhere.

  This one gives a look into vampire society and behaviour. 

  Chapter 2 is going through a final round of edits and will be released on Easter weekend.

  I just read this chapter and now I'm wondering about several things.

  Why the slow update schedule when you've said that you have all/most of the story already written?

  Why do vampires have such a elaborate social customs when such customs tend to develop out of mating displays? If animals do anything that seem like pointless energy waste, that's usually a way to signal ability as a mate aka peacocks with huge tails. But vampires are immortal and don't *need* to have children and if they retained that desire *anyway* after turning, then they should be acting towards humans who they could be viewing as their 'child' instead of other vampires. So I doubt they are 'performing' out of a reproductive desire. Maybe they are doing status signalling like humans would? If so, then why and how?

  Status signalling matters when you can get something out of a higher status. But what do vampires earn with a high influence with other vampires? Humans do it mainly for authority, money, fame, and/or prestige. Vampires don't seem to find it difficult to earn money, so that only leaves authority, fame, and prestige. It would mean very different things depending on which of the three the vampires wanted.

  Finally, are all vampires like William? It would be somewhat odd if all vampires were as well off as William with the time and energy to spend on learning elaborate skills like he does. I suspect that we are only following the equivalent of vampire nobility rather than a typical vampire since it would be very odd if all humans develop similarly neurotic-like impulses when turning into a vampire.

  PS As you probably can tell, this is a really great, well-written story if it gets me thinking about all of the implications. I loved the bit about Red being a deserter and what that [implied](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/81wqs3/rthfwip_vampire_flower_language_chapter_1_an/dv6tg48/).

    Wow! A lot of questions! Thank you. I will do my best to dance the thin line between answering them and keeping some mystery!

    > Why the slow update schedule when you've said that you have all/most of the story already written?

    Written is one thing; edited is another. You might notice I say "we" a lot - it's because this story is written by two people working together. Which is *great* when you have writer's block, but when you need a final pass of edits in a chapter, to work out some minor detail about a character or interaction, etc, it requires two people to have the time, be available, etc. Based on experience, with the runway we have, one chapter a month is doable for us and *even then* I fear that the final chapters won't be ready in time. The accountability will help, I hope!

    >Why do vampires have such a elaborate social customs when such customs tend to develop out of mating displays? [...] Maybe they are doing status signalling like humans would? If so, then why and how?

    Something along those lines; it's also a signal of self-control. Notice how William, when he's upset, starts using the 'sign language' instead of speaking? 

    > I suspect that we are only following the equivalent of vampire nobility rather than a typical vampire since it would be very odd if all humans develop similarly neurotic-like impulses when turning into a vampire.

    You are right, though all vampires have designs on nobility and so emulate it. This whole story is three volumes, two of which haven't been written yet, and we're hoping to get into that sort of stuff in the third especially. (I'd say the second is going to be short, but I thought this one would be half the length it is, and it's still not finished...)

    Thank you so much for the compliments, I hope you continue to enjoy the story despite the waits!
