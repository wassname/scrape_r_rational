  It didn't feel like an infodump to me, but I seem to have an extraordinary ability to stomach infodumps when I find a story interesting, so this is not enough evidence.

    You are not :) As I've mentioned before, I am abominably bad at naming characters, and will grasp at any idea that pops into my head for what to name someone if the shoe even half-way fits.

  I found this story when it was on chapter 19 and read all of it up to that point pretty quickly.

  Really cool stuff. Taking a deep and serious look into a world that I always found pretty interesting. I also likr how it's pretty even handed; there are good things and bad things about this world, strengths and weaknesses of the society. And those strengths and weaknesses are different than the ones in our world. The coolest science fiction does this.

  Of the whole story the part that I liked the most both in concept and execution was Blue's sister influencing ther Clefairy's metronome. That really gave me chills! I want to see more like that.

  I really like the way that psychic attacks are depicted as more mental/psychological attacks than blasting with energy. I also think that the concept of dark (and people being dark) is cool, and the term really makese sense. It's not dark like as in evil or sinister, but that they're noninteracting with that phenomenon. dark matter. no blips on that radar. dark.

  As for my thoughts on things not yet revealed about the setting:

  Even before pokeball technology it seems like humanity has a certain... affinity for them. Humans are quite different from all the other non-plant life in this world (pokemon), and it seems that in one way or another they developed ways of controlling pokemon as their method of survival. I think it's a little bit deeper than how people in our world tamed animals. The way these characters form bonds with the pokemon seems very... instinctual, like it's not a learned social behavior but it goes deeper than that, that humanity was interacting with pokemon this way for the entire course of its existence, and controlling pokemon may have been the reason humans gained intelligence in the first place.

  It'd be cool to see some of their cultures' equivalents to the garden of eden myth: i.e. their mythological explanation for why humans are different than pokemon.

  One interesting thing I noticed is that it doesn't seem like there are any 'domestic only' species of pokemon-- that populations raised in captivity for generations have not significantly deviated from their wild types. I suspect this means something, but I'm not quite sure what.

  Question, mostly just out of curiosity:

  I know it's comparing apples to oranges, but how far along in its technological development is this world compared to ours? If you were to reduce the maturity of a society to a scalar, would you put them in our past or our future? I get the impression it's somewhat in the future, since with things like only old people really living their countrys' native customs it feels like their world has been globalized for at least a few decades, where ours is really only beginning to be so.

    Thank you, I had a lot of fun writing that part :) Hopefully I can deliver more moments like it soon!

    >It'd be cool to see some of their cultures' equivalents to the garden of eden myth: i.e. their mythological explanation for why humans are different than pokemon.

    We saw this a bit at the beginning of chapter 18, and will definitely get into it more later!

    >One interesting thing I noticed is that it doesn't seem like there are any 'domestic only' species of pokemon-- that populations raised in captivity for generations have not significantly deviated from their wild types. I suspect this means something, but I'm not quite sure what.

    There are definitely some pokemon that aren't particularly dangerous, and so could be called "domestic," but outside of a few circumstances, pokemon are never bred to be less dangerous: human's survival relies on them being able to fight wild pokemon, and while some are raised for non-combat purposes (like for beauty pageants and whatnot) that hasn't been going on nearly long enough to affect the species.

    > know it's comparing apples to oranges, but how far along in its technological development is this world compared to ours? If you were to reduce the maturity of a society to a scalar, would you put them in our past or our future?

    It's definitely hard to measure, but relatively speaking, the future. Like our world, their "modern age" signaled a rapid revolution in technology and globalization, especially with technologies like the internet, but they were far ahead of us in other regards before then, forced to develop incredibly powerful technology to survive, and in some cases like with medicine, having access to biology completely alien to us to develop their nearly miraculous "potions."

  Hey all, welcome back! Super rough draft, will try to get edits in tomorrow. Took some work to make sure this chapter didn't feel like too much of an infodump, but not sure how well I succeeded, so any feedback in that regard is especially more welcome than usual. Enjoy!

  Here are a couple of typos I noticed:
  >"Iâ€¦ see. Thank you, that's of reassuring."

  and

  >"especially with something so personal.."

  I liked this chapter as well, and didn't think it was too much of an infodump at all.  This is such a great fic, up there with The Metropolitan Man as one of my favorite non-HPMOR rational!fanfics.

  And the plot thickens! Can't wait to see Red investigating his psychic powers! It's starting to look like the true nature of pokemon is a LOT more complicated than expected. I'm guessing it will take Red longer to come up with a theory on the origin of pokemon than Darwin did with his theory, since quite frankly pokemon seem like a more difficult puzzle than real life species, because of pokemon like gastly, grimer, voltorb and magnemite that don't really make sense with real life biology. It would probably make a huge theoretical gap between biology and physics, even bigger than the one that we had before Darwin, unless the physics in the world of pokemon is significantly different, but since humans exist in it it probably can't be *that* different. This gap would also explain why technology in the world of pokemon is so advanced and yet they still cling to the type-charts. I find it interesting to compare and contrast the type chart paradigm with Aristotelian physics and elan vital. The fact that the type chart paradigm seems to be more like an "Aristotelian physics" kind of explanation than an "elan vital" kind of explanation, seems to support the possibility of such a large theoretical gap between pokemon biology and their world's physics. I'm guessing the scientific community in the story *knows* the type chart is wrong, but still use it because they have yet to come up with any better unifying theories.

  Then again, maybe the physics IS different. After all, humans in the pokemon world are a bit different than the real world in that some of them have psychic powers and things like that. It seems almost as if they're a subspecies of human slightly different from our own. Although why humans give live birth when ALL other pokemon lay eggs, EVEN THE MAMMALS is going to be hard to explain. I'm wondering if it would be better if you just retconned it so that egg laying wasn't universal to all pokemon species except humans.

  I also noticed that we're on chapter 20 and haven't even gotten past pewter city yet. That means this story will probably be significantly longer than HPMOR.

  This is awesome! Can't wait for the next chapter!

    Given the current quality of the writing I'm going to see that as a feature, not a bug.

    I'm actually retconning this: it's something I think falls under the "clearly a game conceit because the makers of Pokemon couldn't be bothered to think out the complications of an alternative and to make it easier for children" classification of justified departures from canon.

    Suffice to say, Gastly do not come from eggs in my world.

    >I also noticed that we're on chapter 20 and haven't even gotten past pewter city yet. That means this story will probably be significantly longer than HPMOR.

    I seem incapable of short-and-to-the-point stories, so sadly my estimates for how long this one will be are likely way off, and you may be correct @_@ Glad you're enjoying it though!

  Interesting. I like how you're integrating Psychic trainers and people into this rendition of the pokemon world, and the fact they're functionally a subculture is a neat and understandable twist. Red being one of them also neatly explains his averse reaction to the spinerak.

  What do "ataru mo hakke" and "ataranu mo hakke" mean?

  Also I found a typo. At first you call the psychic Colan Nerud. After that he is mentioned as Narud everywhere else. By the way, was the surname Narud on purpose? It reminds me of "professor" Emil Narud (previously known as lieutenant Samir Duran) who also had considerable psychic powers.

    It's a Japanese proverb that refers to how unreliable fortunetelling is, and that the future is always uncertain. Literally it means "Getting it wrong is fate, and getting it right is fate."

    Thanks for catching that typo!  Yes, it was a reference to him. I'm really bad at naming characters, so when an idea for one pops up that at least somewhat fits, I grab hold with relief.

  Hey, just wanted to let you know that I'm really enjoying the story, and I can't wait for more! Also, any thoughts on setting up a Patreon?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Thanks, glad you're enjoying it!

    I'm not overly familiar with Patreon, but since I plan to keep the story free and open to all (restricting viewership behind a paywall would be where legal trouble comes in anyway), I'm not sure what I could offer fans who want to support the story in exchange. 

    It's something I might look into later, as I've also been thinking of hosting the story on its own website to make the interaction between myself and fans or between fans and other fans more smooth: a lot of readers are only on ff.net, which has terrible support for communication and communities.  Thanks for the suggestion though :)

  I'm slightly upset at the idea that psychics are able to read surface thoughts and change memories. For one, it feels a bit too cliche, but I could over look that. It's mostly the fact that we have somewhat of a understanding of how memories are formed and stored. In addition, memories are hardly static and should reasonable deteriorate/change over time, therefore, the idea that removing Red's partition would revert him back to a prior state seems a lot less believable than say, it would make him a lot more emotional especially on the subject of his father. To simply be thrust back to a state that he's already dealt with, even though it was under his psychic protection, would make his prior efforts to deal with his grief a complete waste of time.

  Memories themselves are a function of the brain and for psychics to be able to alter memories or read surface thoughts you're essentially giving them the ability to alter the physical brains of others and not only observe the synaptic activities of said brains but also have the ability to understand those activities as an external system. To me that would break the boundaries of being human. It's simply too strong of a power. I also understand that there's an immense amount of training involved however that doesn't excuse the fact that psychic abilities are too strong. 

  Granted I understand that this is a fake world where our science doesn't truly follow, but it's a break in the foundation that you've built with the explanation of other pokemon abilities, i.e. charmander's ember and bulbasuar's leech seed.

  Of course this is simply my opinion and I still enjoy your story quite a lot. As I said I'm only slightly upset and I'm looking forward to see where you'll take this story.

    >I'm slightly upset at the idea that psychics are able to read surface thoughts and change memories.

    They actually can't change memories, just remove them. Not sure if that helps, but I think it's a big difference: being able to change memories would be incredibly overpowered, and I think even more unrealistic than the already unrealistic premise.

    > In addition, memories are hardly static and should reasonable deteriorate/change over time, therefore, the idea that removing Red's partition would revert him back to a prior state seems a lot less believable than say, it would make him a lot more emotional especially on the subject of his father. To simply be thrust back to a state that he's already dealt with, even though it was under his psychic protection, would make his prior efforts to deal with his grief a complete waste of time.

    The point is that he did not originally deal with it: it was dealt with for him by his powers essentially blunting the emotional response and keeping it separate from his thoughts and feelings.  If I understand the science behind neurology correctly (and I fully admit that I might not), memories change over time because of the constant interaction: hence my thought that having the emotional response to the memories kept separate would keep it the same as plausible.

    >Memories themselves are a function of the brain and for psychics to be able to alter memories or read surface thoughts you're essentially giving them the ability to alter the physical brains of others and not only observe the synaptic activities of said brains but also have the ability to understand those activities as an external system.

I also understand that there's an immense amount of training involved however that doesn't excuse the fact that psychic abilities are too strong.

    Psychic powers absolutely are "too strong," but I would say that about practically anything else in the pokemon world as well, not the least of which being the pokeballs.  But psychics are an integral part of the pokemon world, both reading thoughts and altering mental states.  Removing those abilities would leave them basically just telekensis, which is nonsensically bizarre enough, but also kind of pointless as a stand-alone thing.

    >Granted I understand that this is a fake world where our science doesn't truly follow, but it's a break in the foundation that you've built with the explanation of other pokemon abilities, i.e. charmander's ember and bulbasuar's leech seed.

    It's true, psychic powers are legitimately different from unusual biology of other pokemon.  Fair warning, the same goes for ghost pokemon and some other aspects of pokemon's powers, like the Clefairy seen earlier: that's where I wanted to first show that there are some things that are, simply put, "magic." I'm going to try and make them as rational and consistent and defined as possible, but there's no way to make them not-magic because they're not based on any scientific foundation in our world.

    >Of course this is simply my opinion and I still enjoy your story quite a lot. As I said I'm only slightly upset and I'm looking forward to see where you'll take this story.


    Completely understand, and I appreciate the feedback :) Please do continue to let me know whenever you think some aspect of the world is too poorly defined, explained, or divorced from realism. Just because I have (in my mind) justifications for having unrealistic aspects in this case doesn't mean I always will, and if there's something fundamental I'm missing about how the mind or memories work, that's something that I'd like to know so I can adjust the way psychic powers work accordingly.

  I was wondering where you got the steps for when Red is upset. Is that a common thing I've just never heard of, or did you develop it yourself? It seems useful to have something like this, especially if you get upset a lot, like I tend to.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    It's something I developed for therapeutic use (I'm a systemic therapist). I was thinking of making a flowchart to upload, but Fanfiction doesn't allow pictures in stories. Maybe I'll do so and just post it here.
    ```

    - u/Atilme:
      ```
      I would definitely be interested in seeing this flowchart. If it's simple enough, you could do it in text form, if you still wanted to put it with the story.
