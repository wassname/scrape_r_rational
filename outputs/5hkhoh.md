## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have no special powers. You know that a few rare individuals have the power to see a short time into the future. Exactly how long is unknown to you. They can see, feel hear and taste things before they happen, and choose to act differently, even if that means they never see feel hear or taste those things.

  How do you defend against them, not knowing who they are? How do you take them out?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Set up a situation where the obvious defense against one trap, leads to another trap. The trick is probably finding a practical way to do that without needing ridiculous amounts of resources... I'll noodle on it.
    ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:

    Assuming they want to kill you and they aren't stupid, you can't defend against them unless you do nothing else.

    A completely non-magical assassin could potentially kill somebody who is defended by bodyguards and intelligence services, provided they make public appearances.

    If you gave your assassin tech that already exists (like drones and nukes), even staying in a fortified compound wouldn't be enough.

    And if they had magical powers like the ones you specified they would be virtually impossible to stop.

    They wouldn't even have to risk themselves by attempting to kill you, just make a fortune at a casino or on the stock market and pay people to do it.

    They can effectively lend their power to whomever they choose by watching a feed of their vitals, visuals, and audio and directing them. Not as high precision, granted, but enough to avoid obvious things like "That doorway is trapped." or "The air is poisonous." (provided their power had a long enough window).

    That means that you're effectively up against an unending assault of superpowered assassins unless you block all possible ways of sending those signals (and, of course, you'd have to fake a believable datastream for a while to prevent them realising you've blocked it and aborting the assault to come up with a new strategy).

    So my answer is to try to figure out a way to make them not want to kill you. If they want to kill you, the only way you can survive is if they're idiots.

    Step one-Randomization
    Get as random a source you have to guide your actions. 
    Step Two-All the Plans
    If you have thirty plans going at once, some smokescreen and some snipers, for instance, they'll eventually miss some. 
    Step Three- Sensory overload
    Get some flash bangs, sirens, pungent materials, etc, so they are distracted by how much their future self and their present self are hearing. Humans are bad at multitasking, and when they do quality suffers.
    ```

    - u/Teal_Thanatos:
      ```
      I don't understand how randomization is going to help. It's precog. They either see your future or they don't. 
      multi-tasking is good
      ```

        Randomisation of tests, so you don't get too depth first, and get locked into a bad idea.

    > They can see, feel hear and taste things before they happen, and choose to act differently, even if that means they never see feel hear or taste those things.

    Are they able to will themselves to act precisely as to bring about their vision?  If not, just from chaos theory and tiny random variations in their actions, things should come out differently than their visions.  To exploit this, I would need various sources of random noise sensitive people's actions.  I don't know how long they see, so I will need multiple separate sources that will scale in time and range of sensitivity.
    ```

    The first thing I do for defense is enable two factor identification on all available devices and/or services. Biometric two factor, not simply "we'll generate a code for you". If I don't do that, it's too easy to use certain varieties of precognition to simply brute force their way past any other variety of information security, though this is always going to remain a concern.

    Taking them out involves slow-acting poisons. If I know that they're going to be coming after me within a specific time frame, then I put on my gas mask and flood the house with a deadly toxin. Their power doesn't make them immune to cameras or surveillance, so that's a point in my favor as well. And assuming that my information security is impenetrable (a big if) then they still need to manually case the joint *or* depend fully on their powers.

    (If I only have my normal resources, then I run instead of taking them out. If they follow and I can't shake them by going undercover, then explosives which are not under my control and cannot be stopped, which take longer than however long their time limit is to escape from once they're in proximity -- probably not workable if "short" is defined as something like a day.)

  What to do with the ability to copy and paste human minds from one body to another?  This necessitates overwriting, i.e. killing, the preexisting mind in the body being pasted to.  Mental disorders are tied to either the body or mind on a disorder-by-disorder basis; as a general rule, the more uncomplicatedly negative a disorder is, the more it's tied to the body.

    Okay, I've got a few questions here:

    1. What level contact is required to use the power?
      * Unique knowledge of identity
      * Line of sight
      * Proximity
      * Physical contact
    2. How quickly does the power take effect?
      * Immediately
      * Seconds
      * Minutes
      * Hours
      * Days
    3. What are the other conditions of the setting?
      * Tech level
      * Magic level
      * Religion level
      * Conflict level
      * Medical level
      * Etc.
    4. Does the machine need to be on your person?
    5. How big is the machine?

    Found a startup that pays suicidal people good money for their bodies (googling which country legalizes suicide probably puts me on some list or another.), then sells them to the highest bidder. (Going Black Ops on me is probably more effort than just buying from me?)

    I wonder how hard it is to keep a trade secret.

    I'd have to keep the price at which I buy bodies low enough that people aren't incentivized to steal the device because they have a "cheaper" source of bodies. And then I might be in trouble once that supply runs out.

    All this becomes much easier if I can store minds somehow. What counts as a human body? Popsicles? (Can I recover cryonicist's minds?) I'll guess there's no solution to this problem because "necessitates overwriting, i.e. killing".

  Transfusing blood from younger people into older people gives good odds of making those older people healthier, reduces cognitive decline, and increases lifespan. The younger the donor, the stronger the effects. Trans-species young-blood transfusions from other mammals is caught in regulatory red tape.

  One of your goals: live as long as possible, including without getting killed during a revolution.
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Some country's bound to allow trans-species transfusions in the next 40 years. Meanwhile, human blood should be commonly traded. Try to have a good income.

    I don't think this should be disproportionally likely to cause revolution, if there are few people who want blood money will buy enough, and if there are many then legislation will bring up more. It's not like regularly donating blood is tortorous.

  You have the power to change absolutely anything from green to red. How can you apply this vaguely defined ability?
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:

    Assuming that everything about the power is as powerful as possible, and it doesn't have any limits, I'd probably make a Friendly AI and solve everything.

    First, I'd buy some green paper.  Next, the "thing" I would turn red is "the parts of the paper that correspond to the source code (written so that it's readable to the OCR in my scanner and the compiler in my computer) of a Friendly Seed AI."  Lastly, I would scan it into my computer.

    Unbounded powers with no limit on how they gather information are *broken as hell*.

    ---

    Alternatively, I would turn environmentally friendly things into supporters of communism.

    ---

    EDIT: Alternatively, I could just cut out the middle man from the AI scenario.  "Change things from green to red in the combination (including both space and time) that best fulfills the values *mumble*^*mumble*^*mumble*^*mumble* .
    ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    If you can change green *light* to red as well, (and also arbitrarily change your frame of reference) then you can block/destroy any type of electromagnetic radiation.

    First, choose a reference frame where the ~~light~~ *electromagnetic radiation* source is blueshifted or redshifted the appropriate amount to make it be "green".  Next, shift it to red, which I assume happens on a photon-by-photon basis.  Repeat steps one and two with different reference frames as needed for other parts of the spectrum as well as repeating it on the same light to drop it down to arbitrarily low energies/frequencies.

    This might also work for objects, but that's a bit *too* cheesy.

    ---

    Alternatively, if you can choose *two* reference frames for a single change (i.e. change green in frame 1 to red in frame 2), then you can go the other way too, and get ~~free energy~~ *absolute control over all electromagnetic radiation*.

    Depends on range. If it's infinite range, which I think your wording implies, then I can hold cities hostage by turning all the traffic lights to red and crippling infrastructure by essentially removing green lights. I can blackmail green-eyed celebrities, or if the power is broad enough (i.e. turning green *tones* into red tones, or altering green balance against red balance) anyone who wants to look remotely normal. All it takes is some hardcore cryptography and covert communications on my end to get paid. I can also effectively destroy vast areas of wilderness and/or cropland. Plants are green for photosynthesis, so turning all of the trees, bushes, and grasses in the United States red at the height of spring would probably result in massive ecological damage. Attacking croplands could cripple a nation. That means a big payday. (Or for a more benevolent use of the power, turning all the invasive species red, which would help even if it didn't kill them because it would clearly mark them for quick removal.)

    If it has a lesser range, or I'm just not as much of a bitch towards my fellow man, then I might be able to leverage the power by looking at dye and paint prices. How much does red paint cost compared to green paint? What is my power actually doing at a chemical level? It's probably possible to save large industrial suppliers of green food coloring or green dye or green paint thousands of dollars a year, if only because it allows them to run a single production line, but this would take more research to do than I'd like for a reddit comment.

    There's also probably a tidy profit to be made in producing red versions of traditionally green foodstuffs. Maybe I could open a restaurant simply called Red which has red cucumbers, red salads, and all sorts of other novelties. This doesn't seem like a terribly efficient way to make money though, not unless the market for red versions of green foods is larger than I think it is.

    If I can change green *light* into ultrared light I have a lot more options, but by the wording I don't think that's quite a fair interpretation.

      I love how people on this subreddit can offer so much creative ideas for any given scenario. Both your and ulyssessword's answers are very ingenious and contained some ideas I didn't think of.

      There is one more very powerful application of this ability, almost as powerful as 'creating a friendly AI'. I hope someone will guess what it is :)

      Otherwise, I will post my thoughts on this ridiculously broken ability the day after tomorrow.

        You can take color green hostage , changing everything green in the planet to red would be very apocaliptic since most plants would die and a lot of other things would be affected especially in cities,especially if you define red as absorbing all light except red including non visible frequencies of light. and  you can send  faster than light signals which it's completely broken .you can make any green object absorb all frequencies of light that aren't red, this is especially useful in spaceships , you can mass produce materials with this properties which can be useful for a lot of things( especially if I can make things  reflect 100% of red light which I think would break thermodynamics  .
        I once saw the power of changing the color of things in a list of most useless powers , which was very funny since I thought that power was op even without the obvious implement this values via changes on colours solution.

  You have the power to transmute living material to stone. The process is instant and irreversible, and affects the totality of the living material (as well as any organic substances bound to it—if used on a human, for instance, the hair will also be affected). You have a limit of transmuting up to 200 cubic feet at a time—attempting to petrify an organism larger than this will have no effect.

  The stone generated is structurally similar to concrete, being a uniform colour and lacking any precious metals, stones, or substances inside.

  How do you use this power ethically?

    Is there a range (Death Note, LoS, Touch?), or a cooldown?

    Depending on the definition of living ("has not taken its last breath"?), you could literally save the universe: Attempt to petrify a frozen insect and it might turn to stone iff it would ever become resurrected. If you keep a did-not-petrify popsicle around, it would become an artifact whose owner can, in case of disaster, reset the timeline back to the attempt of petrification by reviving it, retroactively turning it into a statue.

    To check whether this works: Freeze five insects, attempt to petrify them, thaw the fifth if all failed, smash all remaining popsicles/statues, and conclude that it works iff exactly the fifth turned into a statue.

    How is the living material selected?  Does it require some spatial description "The entity at (x,y,z)." or is it a semantic description "The entity with the following characteristics."?  If it is a semantic description, then it could be used to purge bacterial infections.  "All cells within 5 meters of me that are part of the species Staphylococcus aureus."

    What counts as the boundary of living material?  Could I select a tumor as the entity to be transformed, and leave the human patient alive?  If so, it would provide a way to prevent tumors from growing any bigger, and allow for them to be surgically removed.

    Can it be used along many small organisms at once?  If so, cheap housing could be constructed by using pheromones to attract ants to a location, then petrifying them into place.

  Mediumship (and, attendantly, non-matter-hosted intelligence) is real, but limited by information theory in that communication with spirits becomes unreliable when the spirit or spirits involved would become a physical-world <-> physical-world communication channel at a rate exponential (or worse) with the total number of bits transferred over said channel. Information already possessed by the recipient is not considered to be transferred, and so a common workaround for this limit is to construct a detailed mental model of the channeled spirit via non-mediumship means and allow the spirit to 'operate' this, thus minimizing the matter->spirit->matter bitrate as well as providing a basic authentication heuristic in that the spirit conversant will be unable to effectively operate the mental model coherently if they don't share it.

  You've just had your psychic awakening as an average-level medium and have been carefully tuning your mental model of $FAVORITE_DEAD_RATIONALIST_MUNCHKIN to the point that you believe said person has now detected this and bothered to contact you.

  How do you ~~take over~~ optimize the world?

  Bonus round: what happens now that there is a semi-reliable way of detecting p-zombies, and the hard problem of consciouness is rendered inapplicable?
