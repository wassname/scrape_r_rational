  That ending, though. I don't think anything else in this story has given me as much of a sense of dread as those last few lines. Probably because it's one of the few "real" dangers that have cropped up.

  Confirmed troper.

  ...

  Suze is getting really scary-crazy. I hope she finds an anchor soon or April is enough to keep her sane.

    I did also have a bodyguard consisting of Robert, Rob, Bob, and Aerith. ;>

    >anchor

    Confirmed Worm reader.

      ```
      That's actually just standard English.
      ```

    - u/Solonarv:
      ```
      I _did_ read Worm, but I'm fairly confident that's not where I picked up this use of 'anchor'.
      ```

  Does anyone here happen to be the person who leaves reviews under the name "Someone or Other"? Because this sounded like something an /r/rational person would say:

  > You're really pushing the "people do what they do because of their circumstances, not because of their choices" idea pretty strongly in this portrayal of Suze. Then again, perhaps her circumstances are so extreme that choice is a near non-factor for her, even though it is a factor for people in more normal circumstances.

  [This is, in fact, ](#s "the point of book 2.  Suze is not crazy, she hasn't done anything wrong, and she's making choices, not just being carried along by circumstances. She's not human anymore -- she's a goddess. Gods are what their worshippers believe them to be, and right now Suze's only worshippers are a bunch of evil, psychopathic elves. She is becoming what they think a goddess should be...at least, the part of her that is Death is becoming that. Whenever I'm writing her with capital pronouns, that's Death, and She's becoming the drow concept of divinity. Suze gets lower case pronouns; she's being affected by her worshippers somewhat, but is struggling to remain who she is. That dichotomy is exactly what this story is about.")

  Okay, that was a pretty huge spoiler, but I really wanted to get it off my chest.

    I had a feeling this was the case. The earlier discussion on how gods actually have less free will then mortals, and on how they are shaped by their worshipers suggested it.

    It's an issue. It can be solved, but it's an issue that by itself serves to counter any attempts to solve it. Her current position means she *needs* that worship, and having to switch over to others could be difficult.

    The best possible choice would probably have been to go to Jake first, and have a suggestion that those who go through the FLEA spend at least a small amount of time worshiping Suze in some kind of benevolent Death aspect. With 60 levels and the need to get at least a 19 Int to cast the spells required, most people would understand the concept of rational self interest enough that having a Goddess personally interested in the survival of her worshipers (which are now as a group and individually the most powerful non-divine beings alive) is in their best interest.

    Plus they are all good, so they would have an interest in shifting a traditionally Evil God to Good through worship.

    On top of that, I'm surprised that Herrun hasn't tried a bit harder to explain what is going on to Suze, and more thoroughly describe how divinity works. It seems like leaving her to flounder can have some serious negative effects.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      There's a reason Herrún isn't doing that, but one spoiler is enough for now.
      ```

      - u/Empiricist_or_not:
        ```
        The fact that Suzie couldn't find anyone by death's threads seems to imply the spoiler.  I just hope the poor girl is the sole casualty of Jake's Jihad if he doesn't have an escape hatch planned for her.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          Which girl are you thinking of?  And what Jihad?
          ```

          - u/Empiricist_or_not:
            ```
            Suzie, and the Great Common Task i.e. the war against death I find it hard to believe Jake isn't planning on death's porfolio losing power.
            ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  I'm feeling increasingly saddened by what's happening to Suze. There seems to be much more God Of Death left and much less Suze.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Excellent.  I'm doing my job.
    ```

    - u/MoralRelativity:
      ```
      Damn you!!!! 

      :)
      ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  Short chapter this week, I fear.
  ```

  - u/Mraedis:
    ```
    Short and good is better than nothing. :)
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I usually read your chapters till the line "In a society without death". This time, I couldn't find it and panicked.

  Suze should sacrifice her knowledge of Ellen and April to a Goddess of Secrets
  ```

- u/bbrazil:
  ```
  The third last paragraph has a stray /p, presumably it used to be a </p>.

  I have Komm Süsser Tod in my head now.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Thank you; fixed.
    ```
