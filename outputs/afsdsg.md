  Oooohh, don't forget this is the nephew [he's forced to murder](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/10/10/interlude-queens-gambit-declined/comment-page-1/). 

  >There were no shades to their perspectives, and while they might fondly tolerate them in one sworn to the Choir of Mercy that indulgence should never be confused for approval. The Grey Pilgrim had first understood this when he’d smothered his young nephew in his sleep, knowing the boy was charismatic enough to unite the Dominion and lead to war against Procer. He’d tried, first, to reason with him. To show him the pursuit of old grudges through blood could not redeem a single thing.

  >The young never listened, he’d learned. And so old fools like him had to smooth out the sharp edges of Creation.

  I'm also a little confused about the timeline, I think the prince he's rescuing is the Exiled Prince and he's rescuing them from our Tyrant (kairos) but I was under the impression that this vignette is from a a longish time ago and kairos has only been Tyrant for a few years?  Pilgrim is in his 60 or 70s present day, right?  Or is it the prior Tyrant and if so do we know anything about them?

    Nice catch...now that's just sad.

    >  Or is it the prior Tyrant and if so do we know anything about them?

    There's no indication that a Tyrant (or any Name, really, other than GP) is involved at all, so I'd say it's a previous generation.

      >The Grey Pilgrim was in Helike, helping a young prince flee his murderous father.

      I don't know if the king of Helike is ALWAYS a Tyrant but Helike is where our tyrant is from and we know he's not the first of his name so it seems likely that the "king" is Tyrant of somesort. 


      >The Bellerophan’s eyes sharpened with interest as he swallowed another mouthful of wine. The Tyrant’s seizing of the throne of Helike had been one of the most unexpected diplomatic development of the last decade, in the Free Cities, but precious little was known about. A boy that had been by all reports a nonentity before the coup had in a single day taken control of the city and the army, killed the king in his own bed and purged his nephew’s supporters brutally. The nephew in question had fled the city with most of the young nobility and his surviving loyalists, becoming the Exiled Prince in the process.

      ~~[This passage](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/category/uncategorized/page/33/) seems to line up with the story, but like I said, the timeline confuses me. You're right parsimony does suggest its just referring to the previous tyrant but it would mean the same story beat happened twice in Helike a not too many years apart.~~ 

      Edit: Nevermind I misread, clearly referring to the previous rulers of Helike and not at all mixed up with our current story. People try and kill princelings alot I guess.

        ```
        The fact that the Name Exiled Prince exists is proof of that. Names are given to Roles and Roles are grooves in Creation that originate from events happening repeatedly in history.

        > I don't know if the king of Helike is ALWAYS a Tyrant

        Of course not.  The Exiled Prince's father wasn't for example

    ```
    I find it weird that he kills the nephew because the nephew wants revenge but he swears revenge after seeing his nephew all sad and despondent.
    ```

    - u/notsureiflying:
      ```
      He gets older, cynical and a better at justifying his bad actions
      ```

      - u/Jangri-:
        ```
        Is his actions truly bad? I've always viewed Pilgrim as some sort of practigal good character, that tries to maximize the overall goodness in the world
        ```

        - u/notsureiflying:
          ```
          His actions aren't that bad if you consider he is right about what would happen if he didn't kill his nephew...
          ```

        - u/TwoxMachina:
          ```
          The road to hell is paved with Good intentions.

          I'd say he's well down the road now.

          &#x200B;

          He's maximizing Goodness, and if means murdering children... that's a Good thing to do (note the capital G).

          Above does not right. It does, however, mean Good (but not good)
          ```

          - u/Jangri-:
            ```
            If u know for sure that a child will murder 2 other children, and ur only option to stop him is to kill him, is that not the right thing to do?
            ```
