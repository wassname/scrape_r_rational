  I absolutely loved this chapter. This is approximately the level of detail I enjoy to read.

  In a once per three weeks novel, it's nice to have every chapter be very plot-driven, so I can understand people's impatience, however these slower, deeper chapters make me feel the world and its characters feel more alive to me. I really like slowing down to this level of pacing---at least every once in a while, a bit like the interludes in Worm.

  I'm very curious what the Adepts decide as well.

    Same here, I like those slower chapters focusing on logistics and details... They are a nice break from the tension of other chapters...

    I also love any chapter with character development for secondary characters and I thought that the scene with Akoja was very nicely done.

    - u/Asterne:
      ```
      I think his relaxing of the rules is fair, taking into account his own nature. Even though he's been stuck in the time loop for this long, he still is hesitant to mind search innocent/good people, despite the fact that they're

      1. copies of their "real" selves and
      2. going to forget it once the time loop resets

      While he didn't actually go into this, I think it'd be a fair assumption on his part that his simulacrum isn't going to kill him and replace him, just based on his own rules of morality that he's still been following despite all this time interacting with arguably fake people and experiencing the nonpermanance of his actions.

      I also find it fairly safe to assume that the warning given about the simulacrums was based on your average user of them, who tend to be less morally sound.

      I do find it concerning that he's having his simulacrums perform tasks that he wouldn't want to do himself at times, though. He does seem to unconsciously have the mentality that they're expendable, which can be dangerous.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        I agree. Zorian seemed pretty rude to his simulacrum in this chapter, however Zorian *was* pretty pissed that not just one, but an entire series of simulacra plotted to troll him. And they did so without direct communication between them.

        Zorian may not realize it, but he *loves* schadenfreude, especially toward people who annoy him, so I'm not surprised his simulacra are acting this way.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Yeah, even after so much loop time, he's not really a team player. Even when the team members are all him.

          Maybe his simulacra will eventually knock some sense into him and make him realise that he should treat them as largely equals instead of servants. Better at some things (no need to eat or drink, can't break bones), not so good at others (probably can't survive the loop), but just as intelligent, and he should make less assumptions about being the master. Would love to read about that.

        Actually, isn't that exactly what time loop Zorian intends to do to escape the loop? He's also a mere copy albeit a more sophisticated one.
        ```

        - u/Asterne:
          ```
          That's a fair point, I suppose! I hadn't thought of that. I'm not Zorian, but I have to admit I would rationalize with the idea that Extern!Zorian having pretty nearly been (from a within the time loop perspective) stopped in time. With his simulacrums, they're both "people" who've developed at the same rate and have a respect for each other, sort of.

          So basically, Extern!Zorian and Loop!Zorian have exactly the same experiences up to a certain point, then Loop!Zorian's continue and Extern!Zorian's stop. That would arguably qualify more as an "addition" then a "kill-and-replace" (to me personally).

          But that is definitely an interesting thought. I don't think Zorian himself has thought through the implications of that yet past "I want to get out". It probably helps that he hasn't seen or interacted with Extern!Zorian at all, so he can sort of think of him as a "shell" for him.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            I'm sure that Zorian would love to get out of the loop non-destructively if he can. His original self isn't likely to be much help in fighting the invasion, but he's still a person.

            If the only way out, though, involves booting out the original soul and taking over the body - well, without loop!Zorian's intervention, the original would die in the first artillery barrage anyway. Better for one of them to survive than none. Plus the many, many thousands of other people in Cyoria who loop!Zorian may be able to save. And as you say, loop!Zorian is simply a continuation of the original, so in one sense, original!Zorian wouldn't even be lost.

            If, somehow, they both survive, that's gonna be a whole new level of interesting. Dealing with simulacra is one thing, but they had all his knowledge and knew that they were ephemeral. How would he deal with a copy of himself that is still grouchy, anti-social, at odds with all his family, and knows nothing about the time loop? Which one is more entitled to be with his family?
            ```

    - u/Overmind_Slab:
      ```
      How many simulacrums have given him memory packets to absorb? These things still have a sense of self preservation, they probably don't look forward to being dissolved after 24 hours even if intellectually they're okay with it. Maybe those dozens of memory packets are unintentionally influencing him to be less and less okay with creating so many temporary existences.
      ```

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        says it right in the chapter. every simulacrum  gives a memory packet.  they're just not full 24 hours

        and we've already seen a couple of the simulacrums dissolve themselves of their own accord
        ```

        - u/Overmind_Slab:
          ```
          It's not a strong sense of self preservation but they're more or less copies of him right? How much can they develop in 24 hours? How much of that development slips into the memory packets they send? It could be interesting to see subtle changes in Zorian as he continues to use this spell.
          ```

          - u/GoXDS:
            ```
            my point was leaning more towards the fact that they don't have an issue at all with winking out. and has never been even hinted in the slightest. death and pain are completely different stories but just dissolving doesn't seem to trigger any self preservation in them. otherwise, why ever dissolve yourself of your own accord if you can stay a little bit longer?
            ```

            - u/andor3333:
              ```
              I think the simulacrum fighting the grey hunter didn't like the idea of disappearing/being a sacrificial pawn, and reminded original Zorian of that in a memory packet? That said, they definitely aren't treating it as serously as they could and seem to accept Zorians reasoning / orders if he would accept them himself. So far the only major way they have diverged from Zorian is by getting bored with mundane tasks, which is probably what Zorian would do in their place.
              ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                I think they're mentally relying on the knowledge that they aren't really being lost, their experiences are being packaged and incorporated into caster!Zorian, new simulacra containing those memories will be created regularly. It wouldn't properly feel like death.
                ```

                - u/Fomalhaut-b:
                  ```
                  That was a really important scene. Zorian sometimes comments on preserving his senses of morality and mortality for when he leaves the timeloop. The simulacrum encountered a strong sense of his own mortality, which he identified as worth giving back to Zorian. 

                  ZZ are losing their sense of death from being in the timeloop for so long; and with it, radical desperate inspiration.

    ```
    > I thought the only limitation on teleportation was on distance and that you had to have been there before

    Mana costs scale with distance and the (number/size/mass?) of the things being teleported. Divining the location of the teleport destination is an integral component of the spell, and mana cost scales with the difficulty of the divination. The divination is made more difficult by distance and interference.

    Breaking a long-distance teleport into multiple steps makes it more practical, implying distance scaling is super-linear.

    The degree to which Zorian finds teleporting to Cyoria's beacon to be less mana-intensive (spending "most of his mana" versus... not) implies the divination is a very significant part of the spell's cost. The divination component may even be solely responsible for the distance scaling.

    In Chapter 26 Zorian implies you can't teleport "somewhere you've never set foot in". However, Zorian teleported with Kael to collect alchemy ingredients in places Zorian had not been and Alanic used Zorian as a courier without being concerned about whether Zorian had been to the destinations. At the very least you can also teleport somewhere if you have someone who has been there before.

    This requirement seems to be simply a matter of being able to divine the location sufficiently accurately. If you or some other person willing to assist you has been to the destination, that can be used.

    Targeting anywhere in the vicinity of a teleport beacon results in a very strong signal from the beacon, returning the location of the receiving area as the result of the divination. This strong signal is easier to use and takes a great deal of skill to ignore if you are trying to target somewhere else. It also interferes with teleportation departing from the vicinity of the beacon.

    A recall anchor can be targeted without having been at the destination and allows the caster to teleport through interference. A more complex anchor incorporating spell formulae has a greater tolerance for interference.

    The whole "having to have been somewhere before" looks like one of those things beginners are taught that's completely wrong but good enough for most use cases.

    Having a really good method of divining the target location may make long-distance teleportation much more practical. Some possibilities are:

    - A recall anchor
    - The link between his soul and a simulacrum
    - The soul marker on a simulacrum
    - Some sort of "beacon" spell cast by a simulacrum providing a target for his teleportation, with coordination via mind-magic

    ###[Chapter 26: Soulkill](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/26/Mother-of-Learning)

    > Teleportation had a reputation of being dangerous among most mages. This was because, at its core, the classical teleportation spell wasn't a pure dimensionalism spell – it had **a substantial divination component that divined the exact coordinates of the location the caster was trying to reach**, and if the caster set up the divination wrong… well, all sorts of weird and unpleasant things could happen. Then there was a fact that some people really didn't like people teleporting into their home and territory and set up wards that didn't just cause teleportation to fail, but to fail catastrophically. Such wards were illegal, but used by a certain type of people anyway.

    > Other than that, though, teleportation was a fairly safe and convenient method of transportation. So long as your destination wasn't behind wards. Or underground. **Or somewhere you've never set foot in**. Yeah.

    > Ah, whatever, the point was that it could get him to Cyoria in mere moments. Cyoria thankfully had a teleport beacon in the city that funneled travelers into a central location and simultaneously **made teleportation easier (and less mana intensive) for the mage doing the teleporting**. That meant that **Zorian wasn't going to spend most of his mana** on the teleport, which was a very good thing.

    ###[Chapter 30: A Game of Shops](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/30/Mother-of-Learning)

    > "Excellent. The intruder alarms shouldn't be much of a problem, then," Gurey said with a grin. "Aldwin had this neat trick where he could **turn an item into a teleport beacon of sorts**, and then simply teleport himself to its location **without having to have been there in the past**. I'm sure I can get some innocuous-seeming thing through the door, you just have to cast the spell on it. I don't know how to cast the spell myself, but Aldwin did write it down in one of his journals…"

    > "Spell you say? No spell formula involved?" asked Zorian curiously.

    > "No. '**Spell of recall**', I think it's called. It's a two-part spell – you first cast a personal teleport beacon on an item, and it immediately **forges a connection between you and it**. You can then cast the second spell at any time, causing youself to be 'recalled' at the location of the item. According to Aldwin, it was meant to be used for rapid escape – you cast the first spell on a retreat point and then use the second spell to teleport there if you end up in a bind."

    > "Why not use a regular teleport for that?" frowned Zorian. "Sounds like a lot of trouble when a normal teleport will suffice. After all, you've already been to the location you're teleporting to if you're setting it up as a retreat point."

    > "I really don't know. You will have to find that out yourself if you're interested," Gurey said.

    ###[Chapter 36: A Battle of Minds](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/36/Mother-of-Learning)

    > Fortunately, during the month-long recuperation, Zorian had come up with an idea of how he could side-step his current limitation as far as teleportation was concerned. Which was why, before descending into the dungeon, he turned one of the large stones he found on the outskirts of Knyazov Dveri into a recall anchor.

    > The **recall spell** was outright made specifically for quick retreats, and the link forged between the caster and the anchor ensured **they could teleport out even from areas warded against teleportation**. Well, so long as the wards were basic ones, since those protections simply **disrupted the targeting part of the teleport** rather than inhibiting dimensional warping as such. Consequently, Zorian had a feeling the spell would work to yank him back to the anchor, even though the Dungeon interference.

    > He was right… sort of. He had found that past a certain depth, the strain on the link became too much and it snapped. Before that happened, however, the spell worked flawlessly, allowing Zorian to quickly teleport away to the surface. The depth past which it ceased to work was too shallow for his liking, but he was confident he could strengthen the link. Over the next couple of days, he worked to combine several marking spells and his knowledge of spell formula in order to **create a stronger anchor for the recall spell – one that would allow it to power through any amount of rock and Dungeon interference**. He was largely successful in this, though the anchor object had to be pretty large to contain the final spell formula he designed. No matter, there was no need to make the anchor particularly portable for what he had in mind.

    ###[Chapter 45: Fine Structures](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/45/Mother-of-Learning)

    > [Some of this doesn't make any sense,] Zorian complained. [According to you, the Ibasans are transporting their forces straight from Ulquaan Ibasa to Fort Oroklo, then from Fort Oroklo to some unknown point in the Sarokian Highlands, and then from there to beneath Cyoria.]

    > [Yes, what of it?]

    > [That's not enough stops for an effective teleportation chain,] Zorian said. [Only two stop points **for a journey of such distance**, with the final destination point **being deep underground to boot**? There is no way that's really what's happening. If they were sending letters or small packages maybe, but no way could you transport an army like that. Even if Quatach-Ichl is the best mass teleporter in the whole damn world, **the mana costs for such long jumps would be completely impractical on that scale**.]

    > Admittedly, such a small number of stops would do much to explain how they could transport such an army through Eldemar territory without being discovered by Eldemar, but…

    > [They're not teleporting in the manner we've seen you do it,] Memory of Sublime Glories noted. [They are using some kind of stone construct to open a dimensional passage between two points. Like a door to another land.]

    ###[Chapter 58: Questions and Answers](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/58/Mother-of-Learning)

    > "Good. Let's **hurry to the edge of the city so we can teleport** to Lukav's place," Alanic said.

    > "There is no need," Zorian said with a self-satisfied smile. "Let's just find a deserted alley and I'll teleport us out straight out of the city. **The teleport beacon hasn't been able to stop me for quite some time now**."

    > If Alanic was surprised by his claim, he did not show it. Zorian supposed it was a minor thing after the revelations in the past few days. They found a sufficiently isolated place and soon arrived not far from Lukav's house, just outside the village he lived in.
    ```

    - u/DerSaidin:
      ```
      Teleport beacon is a good idea. Nice quote research.

      > The soul marker on a simulacrum

      That one is out, simulacrum has no soul.

      > The teleport beacon hasn't been able to stop me for quite some time now.

      The effect which can't stop Zorian is the part which forces incoming teleports to land there (see the first time Zorian teleported with Ilsa). Apparently, this also attempts to require outgoing teleports to leave from the expected spot (I hadn't noticed this before). This makes sense with the teleport transport network described in this chapter.

      I wonder if this redirecting/security/navigation aspect is essential to the finding-your-destination aspect, or completely orthogonal. I expect orthogonal, no reason to need that for outgoing teleports - or maybe that is an unwanted side effect?
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > Also requires outgoing teleports to leave from the expected spot

        I'm guessing that it just draws travelers in, like the soul well, and if you want to teleport outbound, you (normally) have to leave the area of its effect.
        ```

    - u/GoXDS:
      ```
      it might not be the case that Zorian was teleporting to places he hasn't been before w/ Kael. Zorian has personally explored a great deal of that region when he was running away from Cyoria and on Silverlake's requests. so it's possible he simply teleported to the general area and then him and Kael walked the rest of the way (or he really has already been there)

      in Ch 32 where Alanic asks Zorian to be a courier, there's no implication that Alanic went with Zorian (he's delivering letters and packages so why go with anyways?). so it's likely that Alanic was only sending him to go to common places or at least close to them
      ```

      - u/Cheese_Ninja:
        ```
        I agree with both those counts. The time with Kael especially, if he could just rely on Kael's knowledge of the location, they wouldn't have had to walk for hours to get to the graves.

        Also, when Alanic was curious about the soul well, he still relied on Zorian for the teleportation, since it was a place Alanic hadn't been to before himself.

        My main questions are "how much familiarity is actually needed to teleport to a place?" and "Can Zorian use his perfect-recall memory packets to shorten the amount of time needed to pick up a new location?"

        It's not especially clear how much of Zorian's reserves the teleport spell requires. The bit that cretan_bull quoted from chapter 26 only gives us some idea, along with this follow up that was left out:
        >He had to wait half an hour or so until his mana reserves regenerated enough that he would feel safe descending into the Dungeon,

        Later in the story, Zorian is able to chain 2-4 teleports to avoid being tracked, presumably without depleting his reserves and leaving himself vulnerable. He also uses short distance teleports in combat, which wouldn't be especially practical if they use up a quarter of his reserves either.  Teleporting from his home to Cyoria was probably more mana intensive because of lack of of practice with the spell and distance than the other examples I gave.

        My guess is, when it comes to extremely short teleports (within nearby visual range) Zorian can probably manage a pretty high number, say, 20 or so.

        When it comes to several kilometers, probably only 6-12 in a row.

        When it comes to the range limitation of the spell (150-300 kilometers? Hasn't been made clear in the story.) Zorian can probably only do 2-3.

        I still feel like Zorian could learn new locations on his own/with simulacra+memory packets after paying a person to teleport him there initially, then teach the locations to Zach, and between the two of them they could chain teleports and get to Koth in 1-3 days. I think Zorian's current skills in divination and dimensionalism make his spell more efficient, but Zach's greater reserves should still allow for maybe 10 max distance teleports before needing to recharge (30 minutes - 3 hours). But I'd say it's pretty clear at this point that either there's an underlying rule I'm failing to pick up on, or the author simply doesn't want to go this route.
        ```

        - u/GoXDS:
          ```
          if we take the two maps on subsection of Altazia and the northern hemisphere at large, we can get a sense of scale. we can see that Knyazov Dveri and Cyoria/Korsa aren't terribly far apart in comparison to the Altazia subregion as a whole. then when we look at the northern hemisphere, the smaller map of Altazia is tiny compared to the distance to Koth. so, the total number of jumps might be larger than you expect. also reminder that 30min-3 hours for recharge is assuming sufficient ambient mana levels. it might not be that fast in many of the destinations they get to.

          tho yea, once a simulacrum is able to reach Koth, chain teleportation is an option. but as mentioned in already, it's not their only option and it'll take some time (maybe a couple of restarts) for a simulacrum to be able to reach Koth so let's explore options while that's happening!
          ```

    > I thought the only limitation on teleportation was on distance and that you had to have been there before.

    [Quoting the author:](https://ps-dm.reddit.com/r/noveltranslations/comments/5pjv30/en_mother_of_learning_chapter_64/dcsglot/)

    > Teleportation has range limitations. The cost increases with distance and the amount of people being teleported, and the increase is not linear. Zorian would have to chain teleports to reach his simulacrum, and he'd run out of mana fairly quickly and have to wait for it to recharge. He'd lose a lot of time waiting for his mana reserves to come back, so his progress would be fairly slow, and he'd would be unable to do anything magic-related while he journeyed in this fashion.
    ```

- u/woschtl:
  ```
  The reminder of Zach's reaction to the Ghost Serpent makes me wonder if he actually did behave like a monster for a time in previous restarts. It would explain why he refuses to let Zorian read his mind, and why he always seems a little uncomfortable when they discuss the ethics of the time loop (at least to me). If it's true, Zach's change of mind is probably somehow connected to the appearance of Red Robe.
  ```

  - u/Fomalhaut-b:
    ```
    Yeah, that would be an interesting character development. He had 30 years. 

    It was implied that the  he refuses to let Zorian read his mind out of a compulsion imbedded by RR. Zach only started using anti mind magic after the Aranea made contact with him. I have a theory that they might have undone some of the damage RR did. I also suspect that Zach has the knowledge of how to control the Sovereign Gate as a Controller, and more about the timeloop, buried in his mind. This would explain how the Matriarch had solid information about this that was in her last mind package. 

    Maybe it's a bit of both.

  There might be some sort of big secret surrounding the gates, since the spiders are suspiciously unwilling to let them use them.  Not even time travel is necessarily enough for them?  Maybe you have to sacrifice people to use them lol

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Zorian is offering a ludicrous amount of money, so it can't be as simple as blood sacrifice. Slaves (and ethical concerns) are cheaper than that. But yeah, it would have to be *some* kind of permanent cost for them to be this hesitant. 

    Maybe they have reason to believe the gate can only be used a set number of times - possibly even just once?

      Yeah, he knew he was being ripped off, but I doubt he felt in any danger. It's a small town in the middle of nowhere, and he'll be gone as soon as he arranges a teleport. Nothing but a necromancer (unlikely) or a superior mind mage (VERY unlikely) could truly threaten him.

  Any other stories like this one for me to sink my teeth into?
  ```

- u/Nepene:
  ```
  I do find it interesting that we have story confirmation that the church's position that souls are necessary for sentience or true life is false. The simalcrum is fully sentient.
  ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    that was never the church's position. quote from ch 51 from Batak, the guy from the church:

    "Naturally, I follow my Church's dogma, and it states that only things with souls are considered people."
    ```

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      Which is a semantics issue, but we clearly see that the non souled creations have a similar sentience and awareness to mundane humans. They are people in a similar way.
      ```

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        except the church doesn't argue that a soul is necessary for sentience. nor that simulacrums aren't sentient. their whole stance is that simulacrums aren't people in the everyday sense. or, in other words, they're not alive (and in real life definitions, they wouldn't be considered alive either), if we're to change the wording to fit what they mean

        as mentioned, it's pushing the boundaries, but if simulacrums were considered people and afforded the same rights as normal people, I'd imagine the spell itself to be a lot more taboo/illegal than it currently is. for one, the caster is basically required to keep it active until death, never allowed to dispel them without it being considered murder. which is basically what Batak mentioned as a minority view before the quote above
        ```

  - u/KDBA:
    ```
    The simulacra do have souls - they all have Zorian's soul, it's just not attached *directly* to their body.

    Edit: a "not".
    ```

    - u/GoXDS:
      ```
      that's just really poor sophism. they're connected to the soul but it's not THEIR's
      ```

      - u/DCarrier:
        ```
        What's the difference?
        ```

        - u/GoXDS:
          ```
          they have access to it and are reliant on it but ultimately the soul isn't a part of them and the relationship is one-sided. the soul doesn't need the simulacrum but the soul does need the original body
          ```

          - u/kaukamieli:
            ```
            Does soul need a body? Isn't it that body needs a soul instead? Soul could go to some god and exist there.
            ```

            - u/GoXDS:
              ```
              /u/DCarrier, too

              I meant "need" a little more loosely than [that]. just like a child needs their parent to survive doesn't mean their utterly doomed if their parents die or abandon them (maybe not entirely applicable but puts my point across). at the very least, what I meant was that the soul wont care if the simulacrums are gone but the original body will have an effect on the soul. I'd imagine if the original body is destroyed while any magic is being active (simulacrums, persistent magic, etc. the ones that require active upkeep), that magic will fizzle out since the soul at that point is unable to keep the magic active since it can't think on its own, so it'll basically become inactive, cutting off support for magic

               if we go that route of the soul not needing the the body, the body doesn't necessarily need the original soul (though flesh golems aren't really alive so not entirely mirrored). 

              or to twist it another way, to function properly, the soul and body need each other. a body without a soul can't act (but substitute souls or animation cores work) while a soul can't think/act without a body (mind constructs and w/e else is necessary for liches or a new body can work as substitutes).
              ```

              - u/DCarrier:
                ```
                The simulacrum won't work without a soul. It's not just that magic fizzles out. You need an awareness of your soul to cast the spell. Your soul is vital to the spell.
                ```

          - u/DCarrier:
            ```
            The soul does not need the original body. Souls can survive the destruction of the original body, along with anything else anyone has ever thrown at them.

  Zorian/Akoja ship setting sail.

  **ALL ABOAAARD**
  ```

  - u/LupusZero:
    ```
    Tempting,but I'm staying on Zorian/Raynie ship. I just liked their interactions more.

    Zorian/Zach is OTP though (just kidding)
    ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      um...considering the time loop, how old are Zach and Zorian now? And how old are Akoja and Raynie? I mean, are Akoja and Raynie even of age yet? Like, I was under the impression that the academy students are all high school age, and that at the start of the first time loop Zorian was coming to the Academy for the first time. That would make Akoja what? Fourteen or Fifteen years old, maybe? I'm pretty sure Zorian was 15 at the start of the story.

      I mean, to give an example of what I'm trying to say here, a 100-year-old man dating a 300-year-old man seems a little less squicky than a 100-year old man dating a 15 year old girl. Maybe I'm wrong, but the former seems more likely to make for a healthy relationship than the latter.

      Zach/Zorian might not just be the One True Pairing. It might be the Only Possible Sane Pairing unless they can drastically extend the lifespans of everybody else after they leave the time loop.
      ```

      - u/Fredlage:
        ```
        Recent chapters have a implied Zorian has been looping for about five years (he started out as 15), so mentally he's about 20. Zach on the other hand has been looping for about 30 years, so he would be on his mid forties
        ```

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          Although I'm not sure their mental age is as good a metric as it might be, as their brains haven't changed from being 15.  Zach, despite being ~45, is still very much an adolescent in how he acts.
          ```

          - u/GeeJo:

          ```
          So what you are saying is: Zorian + Xvim?
          ```

      - u/GodKiller999:
        ```
        Them not going through any actual physical growth heavily impact how much they can mentally grow, there's some things that just won't change that much unless your meat brain matures. And most of Zorian time has been spent on magic stuff rather than relationship related experiences.
        ```

        - u/GeeJo:
          ```
          Neurological impact on personality development goes out of the window when you're in a story where souls are real.
          ```

          - u/GodKiller999:
            ```
            Why would it? If it didn't have any impact, Zach wouldn't be as 'youthful'.
            ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    > implying no Zorian/Xvim

    Start over.
    ```

    - u/TimTravel:
      ```
      No Xvim / Quatach-Ichl? Pleb.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Weren't those Xvim / Alanic and Quatach-Ichl / Silverlake?
        ```

        - u/Roxolan:
          ```
          Well now you have opened my eyes to the truth of Xvim / Silverlake.

          (The Quatach-Ichl / Alanic relationship would be... much shorter.)
          ```

            > (The Quatach-Ichl / Alanic relationship would be... much shorter.)

              For life, yes, but not for long.
              ```

  - u/FishyBinder:
    ```
    Zorian/Akoja would be fine, but so would Zorian/Raynie or a number of other classmates.  This story isn't really about romance anyways so I'm not going to worry to much about it so long as I don't really hate the match up.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I actually think Zorian would have difficulty being in a relationship with anyone not Open. Either he uses his abilities to sense emotions and thoughts, which would be a rather significant power imbalance in the relationship, or he doesn't, which would mean consciously putting distance between them. He would do best, I think, with someone who can reciprocate.

      So...*maybe* Tinami, but I didn't get the impression that he actually enjoyed her company particularly. They worked together, sure, he respected her intelligence, but that's all.
      ```

  - u/Fomalhaut-b:
    ```
    Zorian/Taiven all the way. Zorian has to cross puberty and get out of the deadly Friendzone. She stops calling him Roach when she finds out that he's older than she is.

    Though, Roach is a great nickname for him.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > Roach is a great nickname for him

      Because he's almost impossible to kill at the moment?
      ```

      - u/Fomalhaut-b:
        ```
        Zorian was like a cockroach in the beginning chapters, as he abhored social limelight, and would always scurry away from people and attention.

        He also liked wearing a lot of nondescript brown clothing. He's an adaptable survivor, small, and a bit icky.
        ```

        - u/Cheese_Ninja:
          ```
          Apparently the nickname is for the fish, not the insect. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_roach
          >Something very big was happening, and Zorian was a very small fish. A roach, as Taiven would charmingly say. Inside the time loop, he had a chance to secure his future. Outside of it, he was just another victim.

          It wasn't clear to me either. That was way back in chapter 7, and I don't think I really noticed it until it was pointed out to much later.
          ```

          - u/Fomalhaut-b:
            ```
            Oh. Thanks! 

            ..and now my simile is dismantled.
            ```

          - u/valeskas:
            ```
            This subject came up during Russian translation of the story, author answered that he meant the insect.
            ```

            - u/Cheese_Ninja:
              ```
              Weird, what's with the chapter 7 line then?

              And even for someone as blunt as Taiven, that seems like a pretty harsh nickname.
              ```

- u/UltraRedSpectrum:
  ```
  The line
  >"negotiations tended to go better if you brought both gifts and an armed entourage, as opposed to just gifts"

  seems to be a reference to the saying "you can get more of what you want with a kind word and a gun, than with just a kind word" - and variants, which this particular quip has a lot of.

- u/Empiricist_or_not:
  ```
  Have we discussed red robe being a rouge simulacra?
  ```

  - u/JulianWyvern:
    ```
    A rouge simulacra huh, so that's why he wears the red robe
    ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    This theory has been brought up extensively in the past chapter discussion threads. The biggest argument against it, in my opinion, is Zach's lack of Soul Sight. No matter how much Red Robe mind raped him into forgetting stuff, he couldn't erase this ability since it's acquired by drinking a potion. Besides, I'd like to think even Zach would notice someone else using his mana reserves, no matter how huge they are.
    ```

  - u/A_Shadow:
    ```
    I have seen that theory a lot. Where did the idea come from?
    ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      I think because Zach has memory loss in a permanant "stolen memories" style and because the Simulcra spell was mentioned very early on in the story, but I only bothered to start reading maybe a year or two in so I haven't followed the threads as well as I would have liked.  

      I really need to go do a thread then story re-read
      ```

- u/vallar57:
  ```
  I'm a bit confused by the fact that simulacrum doesn't have a range limit. What type does the process of transferring mana from original to simulacrum have? Does Zorian's mana get teleported, gated, or something else entirely? Even dimensional links get strained with range, like we saw with teleport beacons.

  Also, how come he can use Black Rooms with simulacrum out, if a Black Room severs all connections to the outside world, wouldn't that destroy Zorian's connection to simulacrum? What would happen if a simulacrum uses a Black Room and tries casting spells inside - where would his mana come from?
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    During use of the black room, you're (likely) right that the simulacrum will be cut off from its mana source during. However, this isn't a big issue because from the perspective of the simulacrum, because of the time dilation, it would only be cut off for . . . an hour or so?
    ```

    - u/Areign:
      ```
      that seems like a pretty large length of time that a simulacrum would need to survive without mana.
      ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      An hour without mana for a construct that needs mana constantly? Likely disintegration, at least if he casts spells in the process.

      Also, what about reverse situation if it's simulacrum who enters the Room?
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        From the author's comments on the previous chapter, I think that the simulacrum would be entirely unable to cast spells while cut off from the soul, and would gradually destabilise and disintegrate over the course of a few hours.

        And the Black Room operates for more than an hour of outside time. To achieve even a single day of inside time while only an hour passes outside would be a factor of 24, which only the Cyoria Room is capable of. And we know that the Cyoria Room operates for a day of outside time.

        So I'm pretty sure that it's not feasible to put one of the Zorians in the box.
        ```

  Do we know why the title is Mother of Learning?

    It's an old saying: "Repetition is the mother of learning"
    ```

- u/23143567:
  ```
  Damn, I was so excited when they mentioned Koth in the first paragraph, I really thought they were going to visit Daimen this chapter. 

  Slightly disappointed but a MoL chapter is a MoL chapter - solid and fun :)
  ```

  - u/Fomalhaut-b:
    ```
    Didn't you know? Daimen is Red Robe. Koth is just a cover story. Daimen insisted that his family visit Koth to get them out of the warzone that starts at the end of the month.

    /jk
    ```

- u/Fomalhaut-b:
  ```
  What a sweet little chapter. Hurray for ships!

  It was nice to have lost of details of the teleport mechanics. I thought that Zorian would put a teleport recall anchor on a charm and give it to Kirielle, then teleport to her when she got to Koth at the end of the month. Range seems to be the limit.

  Those secretive spiders. The Bakora Gates have been described as a "network". Spiders should be good a networks, right? Maybe they have to protect themselves from QI and others that use the Gates.

  This story has a lot of gates and nets.

  Simulacrum Zorian is my new fave character. It's interesting how he's a nested character, just as our Zorian is just a copy of real-world-outside-of-the-Sovereign-Gate Zorian.
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    yeah, it’s cool how from an emotional standpoint, Loop!Zorian is only a simulacrum of Zorian!Prime. Loop!Zorian is just in a simulation. But that doesn’t make him any less real. In fact, Loop!Zorian eclipses Zorian!Prime entirely.
    ```

- u/Funkytowel360:
  ```
  Does anyone think akoja might be red robe? During her talk with zorian you see she hold's some reassessment to the academy and if she got in the loop and asked zorian out many times, getting turned down. It would explain why zorains room was targeted in the attack during the first loop.
  ```

  - u/TimTravel:
    ```
    Don't we already know Red Robe left the loop?
    ```

    - u/Funkytowel360:
      ```
      zorian mentioned in a previous chapter that he is not sure if red robe is gone leaving nothing behind, or if a simulacrums takes his place after leaving the loop.
      ```

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        no, he isn't sure if:
        1. he's out of the loop completely
        2. normal
        3. corpse

        quote from ch 57
        "Depending on what method Red Robe used to leave the time loop, we would expect his counterpart in this world to be either a soulless corpse like the aranea or an unaware person no different from the rest of the people around us"
        ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    there'd be absolutely no reason for her to leave the ball into the city and promptly attacked by winter wolves.

    maybe a red herring from Zorian (but quite doubtful), but Zorian has already interrogated everyone. Zorian has also shown off too much and Akoja also knows what he's like and capable off (to a minor extent). she has been attending class all the time and also Zorian has already admitted to it being very difficult to keep his magical prowess a secret so what's the chances of Akoja doing the same? for much longer?

    Red Robe is also constantly shielded. Zorian can read Akoja's emotions, so she isn't. even Red Robe wouldn't be oh so clever enough to leak emotions of her crushing on Zorian to him while selectively hiding her anger/insanity of him rejecting her constantly before she even had any reason to suspect other time loopers. and what kind of person would constantly ask a person out knowing they're in a time loop and will be rejected?
    ```
