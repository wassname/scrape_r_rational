## [Q][D] What's the worst-case scenarios with a company (e.g. Google or Facebook) having access to everyone's information?

### Post:

Sorry if this question isn't the best fit for this subreddit. I enjoy this community and it was the best I was aware of. 

Anyways I've heard many people worry about the extent of an organization's influence because we willingly give them our information. They claim it's for advertising purposes but what sort of damage could they really do?

  [Scroogled](http://craphound.com/scroogled.html) by Cory Doctorow.

  Basically, they use all of that information in concert with the government to screw you.

    Until this comment, the post was off-topic.

    Now I'm going to leave it, but please let's stay related to rational/ist fiction - I know subreddit discovery is terrible, but still...

      Maybe OP was just brainstorming for a postapocalyptic story they're writing? I don't really see a problem in utilizing the rationalish minds of this sub to deconstruct an idea.

  Assuming that a worst case exists assumes you have a bounded negutility function.  That is not in evidence.

  THERE IS ALWAYS A WORSE CASE.

  In [Snow Crash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash), which I just finished reading, the CIA merged with the Library of Congress to become a kind of Pay-per-View/Wikipedia where anyone could upload anything, and you can pay to find out anything for the right price. 

  * "how many turds were in the bowl before you flushed"
  * Manuscript drafts that famous writers thought they deleted
  * Blueprints of a government facility 
  * A politician's favorite beverage

  And like E-Bay, some people make a living off of it, and the site's listings are completely public. I can imagine a future like that coming to us very soon.

    What I really don't understand is how it keeps happening that we had anticapitalist (or at least, anti-current-form-of-financialized ultra-libertarian wannabe-anarcho-cyber-capitalism) fiction, done to the point of parody, *decades ago*, and the social tides are only now turning in favor of *maybe* not letting large companies and governments fuck us over.

    To use certain terms, I have to ask why it has taken so long for people to try using Voice to fight for their own damn civilization, when even the thought of a society built entirely on Exit is almost always dystopian-grade grimdark.

  Bridge-burning mode: Ruining the lives of people who oppose them publicly and legally. Blackmail and extortion on the scale of our entire civilisation. Technological civilisation collapses as all survivors delete facebook and go to church.

    Ooh that could be fun. Does that include information such as credit cards and social security? It would force politicians to quickly come clean about EVERYTHING so it couldn't be used for blackmail later on. I think if Facebook (as a random example) played their cards right they could even keep the majority of people happy while still pressuring people in key positions.

  Planning to set a story there? Well, worldbuilding is fun, so:

  At a tech level *slightly* higher than our own, it would mean they would see literally everything. (Although no one individual or organization could reasonably *know* everything without some pretty good AI to check and index it all.)

  Opting out is an impossible coordination problem, because you would be outcompeted by opt-ins, they can watch you if anyone merely *near* you is an opt-in, and its at the very least suspicious-looking if not actually illegal. You'd have to set up an entire parallel Amish economy of opt-outs, and a single detector would gain vast economic advantages even if they only used it to look up stuff on Wikipedia.

  Enough people in key positions have done *something* wrong to steer the media and government into making various common-enough things abhorrent enough transgressions to ruin your life and credibility; so that everyone has at least one thing that society would excommunicate them for if it was made public. Racist comments, perhaps, or some Unacceptable sex thing.

  First-mover advantage, natural monopolies and infighting mean this will eventually be in the hands of one person. Who decides they hate, say, Germany, or Africa, or China, and have everyone else seal them in, starve them, and then nuke the place. (Any leaders they have are discredited and Evil Monsters; whatever justification you need can be engineered through quiet blackmail via the CIA or whatever, with no one individual aware they were responsible for anything but helping the CIA bust a terrorist ring.)
