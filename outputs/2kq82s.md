## [Q]What to do with Halting Oracle?

### Post:

TLDR: What would you do with access to an oracle capable of solving the halting problem?

Details (story):
The discovery of R'lyeh was of course an earth-shattering revelation. The greatest of all the marvels discovered in the sunken city is Cthulhu's labyrinth (the true power of which took some time to be recognized)

Cthulhu labyrinth has a single entrance and consists of indestructible extradimensional tunnels connecting rooms. All rooms and tunnels except the entry look the same. After loosing many a researcher in the tunnels, an extensive program of mapping the labyrinth was started. The first futurologists already began dreaming of an infinite civilization stretched out in the endless tunnels of Cthulhu's labyrinth-- why travel to the stars in our bounded milkyway, when we can have infinite space in the labyrinth? Even more strikingly, even an infinite mostly flat universe cannot sustain endless exponential growth (since with bounded speed of light the volume of accessible space grows only polynomially in time, not exponentially).
In Cthulhu's labyrinth, this is different.

However, the mapping project showed that Cthulhu's labyrinth is even more powerful. When you take a path through the labyrinth, you will occasionally return to the entrance room or some previously visited room. This relationship appears to be governed by a group, i.e. Cthulhu's labyrinth is actually a Cayley graph-- and the corresponding group ("Cthulhu's goup") has a turing-complete word-problem!

Therefore, the labyrinth can be used as an oracle to the halting problem: You encode your computer program into a path; if the corresponding computer program terminates, then you end up in the entrance chamber, and if it does not terminate then you end up somewhere else (and backtrace your steps in order to avoid getting lost in the endless tunnels).

This is of course madness (as can be expected in R'lyeh): Solving the halting problem is a truly godlike power. 


What should be done with this power? What would you do with it? 

Does the existence of the labyrinth impact your human values in any way? What about mind-uploading in some possible future? Does the existence of the labyrinth devalue human creativity?



Addendum:
A whole generation of mathemeticians was decimated in the labyrinth, hunting for the proof of P!= NP. One of the first "deep" expeditions, several months long, showed that indeed P!=NP and there does indeed exist a proof in ZFC, using a path which applies a (badly optimized) proof-verifier to every bit-sequence in order and terminates when a correct proof is found.

After several more lengthy expedition, the explorers found out that the shortest possible proof is roughly 100 KB long; this started the tradition of the "great pilgrimage", where young mathematicians traverse the labyrinth once, each one discovering an additional bit of the minimal proof. 

Edit:

The tunnels are not one-way, i.e. you can trace back your steps and can trace back only parts of the program. Forgot to explicitly mention, Cthulhus group is finitely presented. Short explanation re Cayley graphs (also, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_for_groups ):

At each chamber, three tunnels meet in perfect 120 deg angles. You can encode a path by a sequence of "L" (left) or "R" (right) turns, i.e. a word like "LLRRLRLLR". In a sane world, this would mean that after six left turns, you come up at your intial point ("LLLLLL" = ""), and you end up with an infinite hexagonal lattice. Cthulhu's labyrinth is described by a small finite number of such laws (relations), e.g. "LLRRLLRLLR"="", and so on. If these laws do not force it, then a path does not lead you back.

As was later found out, Abdul Alhazred already described the labyrinth in some rather cryptic poem. You can find the relations in Table 4.3.7 on page 519 in the commented consensus translation of the Necronomicon (arXiv:2029.1653v3). Many scholars believe that the relations have something to do with spelling out the elder god's true names, but nobody really knows. Regrettably, Abdul Alhazred failed to document how he came up with his knowledge; this may be excusable by his mental state and the conventions of his time.

  FUCK.  This is one of those times I *really* wish I'd done my reading on super-Turing computation models.

  Basically, there's a hierarchy of Halting levels, for each one, you are subject to the Halting Problem at your own level, but can decide the Halting Problem for all levels below your own using your Oracle.

  At level 1, you can already bypass all the known computability problems in AI, which should render you all powerful/made of paperclips very quickly, but unless you've programmed it *right* you won't get anything useful out of that.  You *can* compute all possible probability distributions, though.

  You didn't specify, by the way, how long it takes the tunnels to yield an answer in the halting or nonhalting cases: many problems are already Turing-decidable but have such complexity that we consider the relevant algorithms intractable for practical usage.  Tractability is the key to using R'lyeh's Oracles.

    I don't have a lot to add to the discussion, but I enjoyed this turn of phrase and wanted to congratulate you on it.

  So there are two general formalizations of a halting oracle. One takes a Turing machine and determines if it halts with no input. The other takes a Turing machine and an input, and determines if that Turing machine halts on that input. They are both equally powerful, and you can convert between them trivially. When it matters, I'm going to talk as if this is the latter -- Turing machine plus input.

  This isn't actually very useful unless your problem can be solved or at least cut down reasonably well with one bit of information. You're not going to use this as a way to route deliveries (traveling salesman problem) because you've got thousands of routes to choose from.

  You also need to be able to express your problem as a Turing machine, and a relatively short one at that. No curing cancer with this power. (Well, maybe, but it would take a lot of time to come up with the right Turing machine, and then it would take even longer to walk it with the requisite inputs.)

  What you'll end up doing is creating a Turing machine that creates a solution to your problem, then halts if its input is a prefix of that solution. Encode the solution in binary and now you can solve any problem in O(log output size) runs. Of course, if you can do some intermediate processing, you might be able to cut down on the search space even more. For instance, if you're trying to get a protein out of it, you might determine that there are only three amino acids that can follow the portion of the protein you've decoded so far, which means you can spend one or two attempts to determine which one follows rather than four to five.

  In general, this would encourage (to some degree) optimizing algorithms for complex problems to minimize the length of the generated Turing machine rather than algorithmic efficiency.

  If you want a mouth-watering variant, have the maze vomit viscera on you at the end, where the viscera represents the final state of the Turing machine and contents of the tape.

  It's easy to convert a halting oracle to run any finite computation immediately.  Let's say the output is 20 bits long.  First, ask whether the program that computes the first bit of the output, and runs forever if that bit is 0, else halts, halts, etc.

  I do not know of anything productive to humanity's situation to do with an infinitely powerful but slow computing device.  If it were faster, one could maybe use it to make money on the stock market and use that to do something productive.

  This seems mostly equivalent to the standing problem, "What the hell do you actually do with an Oracle that gets humanity out of its trouble?"

  I'm sorry if this answer is taking the story behind the problem too seriously, rather than considering what the implications of a halting oracle would be, but, I would do my best to bar any entry into the labyrinth.

  R'lyeh is the home and abode of Cthulhu, and I am not willing to risk advancing his potential awakening by delving into the city. He is extraordinarily powerful, on a personal level and a political one, given his ability to corrupt minds, and unless I could independently verify that we could use the oracular nature of the tunnels to gain power comparable, or preferably much great than Cthulhu (which seems rather unlikely, given he apparently has the power to create a structure such as R'lyeh), I don't think keeping them open would be worth it. Better to delay his arrival and ascend some other way.

  That is certainly a setting. Let me try my hand at clarifying the rules.

   1. All programs must return only 1 bit.

   2. The more bits long a program is, the longer it takes to run (screaming through a labyrinth).

   3. Programs will take the same amount of time to run if they are the same physical length, no matter what that program actually does.

  Those are really the only rules.

  A kolmogorov complexity solver is probably one of the most valuable tools. I'm not confident in that working though.

  That's admittedly a pretty long term goal, since it requires multiple bits. Of course you should be able to acquire each bit in parallel. Can I get ~800 000 grad students?

  I'd want to eventually implement the kolmogorov program on real hardware.

  Ooh!

  Are tunnels one way only? Try to keep all the data bits at the very end of your journey/program. Trace your steps back. That way you can rerun a program, and only pay for the bits that have changed. Once you have a well mapped program, you retrace your steps and simply tell it to find a different bit. Run multi-bit programs a lot easier. Like just a massive amount easier.

  You can just follow the path that points at a particular bit.

    The tunnels are not one-way. 

    Keeping most input bits and changing only the last ones is a cool optimization I didn't think about, nice!

      More than this you can start mapping out the space. You can leave an item with the shortest path to that room (LLRLLRR etc.) And have a database somewhere with mappings. You can use this to reduce any query you want to run. (If I'm understanding this right, if LRLR leads back to the entrance then LRLR at any point leads back to the room you were at. Or is this just an artifact of the simplified example on Wikipedia?)

    ```
    Of course you can get ~800 000 grad students. However, number theorists are in short supply, as there was a massive exodus from the field after two expeditions showed that the Riemann hypothesis is true, but cannot be proven.

  This is a brand new reddit account, so obviously this is some kind of trap. No one give him any information!
