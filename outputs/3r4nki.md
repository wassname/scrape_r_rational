## [Q] Rational Fiction around "The Ageless" trope

### Post:

Can you recommend me rational fiction (any form) that deals with a character that is ageless (as defined by the tvtrope at http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAgeless )

I know the series "Forever" and honestly, I hate how this guy does basically nothing with his gift. I mean, he solves crimes. It's just another Dexter/Police/Cop series just with a litte extra.

I recently saw "The Age of Adaline" and I felt similar there, they just don't do anthing with it. It's just a thing that's there to deal with, but nothing to be used in any creative way. A problem to be solved if anything, not an opportunity.

To clarify the request a bit: It should be set more or less in this world.

  In The Sandman, there is a normal guy called Hob Gadling who does not die, because of a bet between the god of Death and the god of Dreams. He becomes a good friend of Dream.

  He only appears in one chapter (I think? Haven't finished reading yet) but I thought it was a very good story because he didn't turn into a whiny emo "bored with life" kind of character I was expecting.

    He shows up again for a cameo again in *Season of Mists* (I think) and *The World's End*. Never surpasses that first story, though.

  Most of the characters in Peter F. Hamilton's Commonwealth Saga probably fit this bill. They have rejuvenation technology that can rewind your age back to 18 after a few weeks of intensive therapy.

    Seconded.

  Well, I can't say that the characters are rational, but [Wild Seed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Seed_%28novel%29) does involve immortals attempting to handle their longevity in different ways and one of them is breeding humans for more immortals like him.

  Try the Amber Chronicles by Roger Zelazny. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber The main character is rational in a Machiavellian sort of way.

  I'm not sure if it's rational or just munchkin, but you might like [The Girl Who Poked God With a Stick](http://squid314.livejournal.com/336195.html) Fair warning, though she doesn't understand enlighted altruism.

  "The Man from Earth" film is the most rational one I can think of.

  Forever annoyed me too he does not seem depressed and miserable so why does he keep looking for ways to die it does not make sense. The you must remain celibate if immortal trope is annoying also sure you will outlive your mate and children if its not inheritable but you will get over it most other people do probably marry again and again.

    Ah yes, I know that movie. I must say that this one did a really good job. The person does one of the most rational things with it, namely learning a whole lot of things. I really liked it and it still remains one of my favourites.

  I want to second the Sandman example. It's probably the best instance of what you're looking for. It comes from The Sandman issue #13: Men of Good Fortune. 

  Also, while the above issue is the best example, the whole The Sandman series qualifies, as it's main cast consists of immortal, yet flawed, characters.

  ```
  The einherjar and Choosers from Skybreaker's Call and the following stories are Ageless.  I examine some of the social consequences in [Eyetaker and Sivertongue](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/113590743446/eyetaker-and-silvertongue-part-1-late-shift), set right after Call, particularly the characters Eirik and Greta.
