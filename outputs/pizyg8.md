## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  It pains me to ask it but my curiosity demands… is there any rational Minecraft FanFiction?
  ```

    So, this isn't what you asked for, but you may still find it interesting. A youtuber called 'ilmango' recently did a 'technical minecraft speedrun' in which he and the rest of a server try (and succeed) to build every type of farm in the space of a month. It's not rational, nor is it fanfiction, but the idea of rapidly industrializing a world with weird rules seems like the sort of thing this community would enjoy, and your comment reminded me of it.

        It's an ongoing series of authorized Minecraft novels. Of the 8 novels in the main series, 2 have been written my Max Brooks, the author of *World War Z*.

        I haven't tried them, but they are apparently aimed at preteens, so I wouldn't expect them to be as thorough as *World War Z* was.

    It's a shame that for all the magical hacking we see in popular fiction we almost never see it just explicitly be *magical* hacking. It would explain so much.

          ... Oh my goddess, I have a hilarious idea. You know how portal fantasies extremely often get a translation magic because the author cant be arsed to write seven chapters of "Is an immigrant to an unknown world struggling to learn the language while not starving to death"?

        It would probably be at least halfway plausible to have a device that can remotely flip bits in foreign computer systems, but that would be useless against the kind of electromagnetic shielding military hardware has. A more "sensible" version of this plot would use a wonder-hacking technology to obscure an attack on Taiwan and interfere with the ability for American high command to respond long enough for China to take the island, with the expectation that Americans would cede the SCS in return for captured prisoners once the Chinese can present control over the region as a fait accompli. But then any actual *war* the US would fight would take far longer, because the Chinese couldn't just curbstomp conventional forces, so the author wouldn't get a nice, neat, easily digestible plot.

      How would it deal with nuclear (and other high-yield) weapons? Have some plot device disable them all and keep them disabled? Otherwise it is a short story.

    Can F-18 even be flown manually? It has "relaxed stability" - it's intentionally aerodynamically unstable and flown by wire by design. Without avionic even if pylot had enough reaction and stamina to micromanage control surfaces for hours he wouldn't have enough information for each exact moment then to do it, he would overcompensate every moment and enter into feedback loop.

  Looking for stories similar to [Polyhistor Academy.](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/)

  In particular, I'm looking for stories with combat and a comparable level of tension. The premise of Polyhistor is a magic academy wherein only the top 10% of scorers on the final exam graduate, and the rest die or worse. Dead or incapacitated students are treated as having gotten a 0 on the exam, so students are incentivized to kill one another to eliminate competition.

    Perhaps you'd be interested in [Postnuptial Disagreements](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8078340/1/Postnuptial-Disagreements)? A minor magus character from Fate gets entangled in a girlfriend battle royale to the death from some ecchi manga I'd never heard of. The absurd premise conceals a remarkably grim plot with some excellent tension. I haven't read Polyhistor, so I can't say how the tone compares, but it might be worth a shot.

      I've read both these works and just be aware A Deadly Education is solidly YA material whereas Polyhistor Academy is very adult.

      So the tension OP requested is somewhat present, but the characters are significantly less mature/strategic and really the magical academy death game is only superficially similar (the main threat in A Deadly Education is from the school itself and most of the time it's treated very light-heartedly).

      Edit: But the sequel comes out this month and I'll likely read it, so obviously not going to unrecommend this.

    \- creative

    \- funny

    \- badass




    CONS:  


    \- not finished yet, though most of the story is done.
    ```

    - u/gramineous:
      ```
      Eh, sorta. It starts off too goofy to really lump it together with Worm and similar, and even if a lot of the events are suitably catastrophic compared to Worm, the peotagonist being nearly immortal takes a lot of the 'oomph' out of it. It is still fairly solid and does grow in tone and scope over the story, but it takes a bit to find a groove.

      Also pretty sure the final loop is about to start, so yeah two dozen chapters to go?
      ```

      - u/Freevoulous:
        ```
        IMHO, the introduction of several things that may (or did) torture the protagonist into insanity circumvented his immortality. Sure, he cannot die, but in TPR universe death is not the worst fate, not by a longshot.
        ```

        - u/gramineous:
          ```
          Yeah, but that requires someone who prefers to torture a capable combatant into insanity rather than just kill them in the first place. This isn't the default cause of action that many people will take, and even if they do, they then have to also be able to prevent their victim committing suicide either before or whilst captured. This is all extremely unlikely for someone to be doing over just regular old killing if they don't know about Ryan's power, and the main guy who is that type of threat, the brain hijacker, is knocked out early on each loop once Ryan knows where he's going to go and how to counter him.
          ```

          - u/jaghataikhan:
            ```
            Without spoilers, there's a (minor?) antagonist who actually comes up with a pretty clever idea to counter Ryan's power despite his power basically being a Brute and thus ill-suited to handle Ryan
            ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      It has an extremely weird tone. It tries extremely hard to be goofy/wacky 95% of the time and edgy/super serious the remaining 5%. 

      I can appreciate wackyness, I just can't handle the whiplash. There's also too much self awareness and moments that come across as "trying too hard" to me. The DJ Brain is a stand out.

  I'm once again asking for protagonists with purely physical builds, preferably strength/speed focused. [These](https://youtu.be/P3T_vmWVWC4) [are](https://youtu.be/59OojP0g0_4) good examples of what I'm looking for, especially Berserker, except without the mindless aggression, and maybe without the revival from death. 

  Things I've already read/seen that are similar:

  * The New World
  * Defiance of the Fall
  * An Outcast in Another World
  * An Exercise in Stupidity (rwby fanfic)
  * A Bad Name (Worm fanfic)
  * Berserk (manga)
  * Hunter x Hunter (Gon is like that, especially in Chimera Ant arc finale)
  * Kratos in God of War 2018

  One thing I'm interested in reading about is how do you effectively use superstrength in daily life and in combat. How do you fight others when the ground and other solid materials may as well be water to you, and you can hit someone with a stick that has the same momentum as a long haul truck on the highway? What about if you have superstrength *and* the leverage (somehow) to use all that strength. Can you throw skyscrapers? Do orbital bombardment from the other side of the planet? Throw a punch that wipes out several mountains? Stuff like that.
  ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    One punch man ? You probably already know of it though. 

    &#x200B;

    Mashle. It's about a dude with super strength in a world where everyone has magic, at first it's about him trying to fit in and using his strength in place of magic. Later on it becomes shonen, albeit a funnier than average shonen.

    &#x200B;

    What you want though is more likely to be found in youtube videos of nerd dudes overanalyzing comic book physics. There's that long haired dude that looks like thor, I forgot his name. Because science iirc.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    One Punch Man? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Parasite, maybe. 

    Seems to me that when you do have super-strength and the implicit super-durability that comes with it, tactics...don't really apply. Throwing buildings and rocks would become more rule of cool than practical, assuming you're fighting someone with similar durability.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Idk if I'd say tactics don't apply at all. The World's Best Swordsman parts of WtC showed what superspeed fights are like. There's also Hunter x Hunter with Gon's strategic use of his powers (although I'd say maybe the end of chimera ant doesn't count).
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        IMO WtC's World's Best Swordsman fight would have been mostly identical had they been they moving at normal speeds. The tactics portion only really applied to the interactions between the magical and and pseudo-magical system effects. Which is why I said I don't think super speed adds much in terms of tactics? It's just the same things happening in a fight, but faster and stronger. 

        It's a different matter if you're fighting normal mooks, I suppose. 

        On that subject, traditional superheroes are very much an example of purely physical builds; see almost every flying brick ever.

    ```
    Corpies by Drew Hayes is a side story to Super Powereds that focuses on the hero Titan.  His power is that he becomes as physically strong as he needs to be. Then remains at that level until he needs to be stronger. For example, he started out basic human if he got shot his skin would increase in durability until it would take a harder-hitting bullet to pierce his skin. He is one of the most physically powerful people on earth at the start of the story.


    Titan was one of the nation’s most loved and respected Heroes, until an infidelity scandal tore his image and family apart. After decades spent out of the limelight, Owen Daniels has decided to take up the mantle of Titan once again to try and make amends for his years away. Unfortunately, the Titan Scandal is still common knowledge, and no Hero team wants such a polarizing figure. With no other options, Owen is forced to take a job overseeing a group of corpies, corporate-sponsored Supers who do rescue work… as long as there are cameras around.


    Between a team that doesn’t want him, fellow Heroes who don’t trust him, and a nation that might not be ready to forgive the sins of the past, the return of Titan could prove even harder than the scandal that drove him away. But Owen will have to push on, because his new city is far from a peaceful one. A mysterious enemy is attacking Heroes and growing steadily stronger. An enemy that only the once-legendary Titan might be able to stop.


    If he can manage to stick around this time.
