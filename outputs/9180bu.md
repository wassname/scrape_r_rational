  "Fifth quadrant"

  Please change it to partition, segment, subdivision, section, septation, or any applicable term for divisions that is not explicitly referring to a four-part group. 

  Asking for... a friend.

    lol fair request, switched all quadrant references to reflect sections.

      Thank you kindly; I've read further and I do like that I can come into the story 14 chapters in and not be completely lost, your writing is carefully descriptive and it seems you work to maintain the balance between level of detail and story momentum.

      Found a false negative, right before Seti goes into the opening ceremony with his new threads"... a memorable moment at Prestige Academy would forever be tainted by the fact that he **wasn't** dressed shabbily"

      I've been told before that it's better to have active (imperative) rather than passive (subjunctive) writing so I cut it down and took out the past tense and would (I really don't like could/should/would/subjunctive. If I have something to say, I need to say it, otherwise I'm going to annoy people by beating around the bush)

      "Lovely... a memorable event at Prestige Academy, forever tainted by his unshapely dress."

      Couldn't think of a good word to juxtapose his dress with prestige itself, obviously you probably won't want to use my sentence because **that's not fun/autonomous** but I hope it inspires you to continue improving your craft. Developing a passion is a worthwhile endeavor and while progress is oftentimes hard to measure from day to day I'm certain if you compare your first chapter with your most recent you will notice at least partial refinements to your prose.

      Thanks again for writing!

        This was well thought out, thank you!

        The moment you said that you don't like using could/should/would, my first thought was, "Dang, how in the world can someone write without those words?" But then you showed me an example!

        It's something I'll try to keep in the back of my head while I write, but I should mention that improvements for me may move slower than others because English was my worst subject in school, and I wasn't born in the United States!

        As a reward, have a bunny:
        ()()
        ( '.')
        (..)(..)

        EDIT: The bunny isn't decapitated if you're on mobile.

  And this chapter officially brings me over the 100k words count! Considering that I've never written stuff before, and I get bored easily, I can only thank the support and upvotes that made me think, "Hey, someone likes this!"

  That helps me keep writing.

  Anywho, here are some links for stuff:

  Top Web Fiction is still pending for my story, so no voting allowed for that yet.

  My [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Gelifyal) is there for anyone wanting to donate.

  I've also recently added the story to [RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/19004/aeromancer) for those who prefer that over FictionPress. Please note that it's currently one chapter behind, but will catch up next week.
  And if you'll transition to RRL, please rate and review!

    This is extremely good, and the quality of your writing is getting better every chapter. I hope you continue writing fiction after this story is complete.

    So this is your first story? How well did you map it before starting?
    ```

    - u/Gelifyal:
      ```
      I know the details behind every major incident in the story, who lives and dies, the big plot twists, and how the story ends. I have an idea of in-between stuff, but those are subject to change as the story progresses.

      For example, I have a checklist of things I want to see happening in Prestige, but am willing to cut some of those out if I think it hinders the story more than helps.

    I've upvoted every single time I've seen this. And your story just seems to get more popular.

    Thank you for your efforts.

  Well, I wonder if his decision to antagonize a whole hall of students was a consequence of using his "anger" air earlier. It seems like something he might regret pretty soon.
  ```

- u/kaukamieli:
  ```
  I read this chapter to the end now and... Seti has to tier up a bit pretty fast to do anything in all those fights and needs to save all the marbles for those.

  edit: I sure feel he has bitten more than he can chew.
  ```

  - u/Rouninscholar:
    ```
    He nearly killed someone in the first fight. He might be able to bluff his way through if he can win the first 3-5.
    ```

    - u/kaukamieli:
      ```
      It was not a fight, though. There was no fighting back, no dodging, no blocking, no anything. It was a "show me what you got".

      If he can win the first, it probably eats all the marbles. He has no idea how to fight.
      ```

- u/Schpwuette:
  ```
  I've never heard of that meta acronym before. Pretty clever I guess, although I don't really like how it ignores the idea of a metagame.
  ```

- u/destravous:
  ```
  This just gets more interesting each chapter, looking forward to seeing how Seti handles all those challenges.

  Lol way to stay incognito Serio - I thought he'd have at least a little longer before his cover was blown.

  At least he's made his first friend at Hogwarts before things blew up - Eliot reminds me a cross between Hermione's book smarts and Ron s inferiority complex towards his older bro(s)

  I liked the chapter more than the last one! it was a good chapter, thanks!  

  I have two questions/points of feedback. First is that you mention the META and anti-meta in the sports game. You say that a Most Effective Tactic Available team becomes so prevalent that fans want rule changes, but that those rule changes do not happen due to anti META teams. This means that the sport is not that old, or widespread. meta and standard types of play become stagnant with older games, and do not rapidly change in sports that don't change the rule-set. This is because sport games are mostly symmetrical. Video games, whilst the game itself is asymmetrical, the players are not. So even if the META changes, players can always adapt.  

  The sport you are describing is different. You have an asymmetrical game, because you have a variety of mancers on each team, and not just that, niches and tiers also make a massive difference. I don't think you could ever get a true "meta" in the sense of team composition. Top players can't change mancy type on a dime, and top teams would not just swich out every star player they have simply because some other team did well with a new composition. You play your strengths, and try to come up with counters with your team and players. I don't know how many players a team has in reserve and how switching players work, because that can shake up the game massively as well. This variety could make a single team dominate for a while, but I doubt that a single composition could dominate the sport for a while.

  The second question is the pins. The crafter got a large C on the pin for crafter, and Seti got a large E for Exceptions. How does this work? We have the following types of mancers:

  * Aeromancer
  * Electromancer
  * Pyromancer
  * Hydromancer
  * Geomancer
  * Crafter (did they have a mancer title?)
  * Vivamancer

  This works, All the mancers have their own letter, but why does Exceptions get the E? I'd put that letter firmly in the Electromancer group, because they were there first.  

  It might be a minor change, but I'd give the Exceptions the X, it is not used for the mancers, and also serves as a discrimination mark, because they simply get an X, something associated with wrong answers.

  Ugh, was hoping for a "Come and prove it." from Seti as the last words in the chapter, but this was still pretty satisfying. Very Shokugeki no Soma.

- u/CoronaPollentia:
  ```
  Something I'm noticing happen ocassionally - you tend to use "casted" as the past tense of "to cast". That's an archaic usage, and modern convention is just "cast". E.g. "He casted the spell." vs "He cast the spell."
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Nice one, it shows that you've put a lot of thought into your magic system.

  Have fun camping!
