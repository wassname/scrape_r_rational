  I call attention to the point that this series has lovely titles.  Why aren't more titles that good?  It's literally the first thing a reader encounters.

    I am delighted that you like my titles; I feel like I should disclaim that I stole all of them from the lyrics of a Mercedes Lackey filk song.
    ```

- u/Swimmer963:
  ```
  Note that this is part 7 of a really long existing series; they are best read in order, and this one in particular won't make any sense as a standalone.
