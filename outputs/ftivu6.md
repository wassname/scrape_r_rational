  I had some trouble writing this chapter, particularly in regards to balancing the exposition with the pace of the fight without making it drag too much. I think it turned out okay? 

  This story probably suffers as a result of overplanning a bit. Often I have so much I need to convey before certain beats that it can feel like trying to squeeze putty through a keyhole.

  As always, general feedback appreciated etc.

    I actually had this thought when reading, that stopping the fight to launch into exposition was awkward pacing. But it was also pretty essential to understanding the fight, so I can't tell you what to do about it. /shrug

  Great chapter. The fight scene was really interesting, I love how they're fighting within these restrictions that were built intentionally by the ironworkers. It's a great concept.

  Really curious to learn why utsushikome doesn't have her N resistance. She doesn't expand much on what the magic is actually checking with regards to neurology, but we can bet her lack of resistance has something to do with her disorders.

  I am sort of sad that a dadaist comedy gets more attention then a world building based mystery. 

  But I guess even on smallish reddit communities my taste is a minority.
