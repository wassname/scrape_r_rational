## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  FYI to everyone, AlexanderWales posted his Worth the Candle post mortem here: https://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/onf72r/post_mortem_worth_the_candle/

  I'm assuming the only reason why it wasnt posted here was because he didn't want to spam the sub.

    Yup, and thanks for posting it here. I think it's some inside baseball stuff that won't necessarily improve anyone's reading experience, and isn't actually that interesting unless you've been following the story. There are three things left to post, as far as my own stated obligations: the epilogues, a Q&A, and [the Apocrypha (a collection of cast offs and drafts and things)](https://www.reddit.com/r/alexanderwales/comments/oor4r7/worth_the_candle_apocrypha/?). The epilogues will be the only ones I post here. The other two will be on my personal sub, where I feel much more comfortable posting random things that I've either been thinking about or related to something I've written.

        I've been noodling through how to munchkin that, it's pretty interesting.

        Unlock skin magic by trying to fiddle with the feather fall tattoo at the start of the loop, find Amaryllis, convince her you're a time looper or whatever, learn blood magic, get her to teach you other magics by repeating your own explanation of them back to yourself. Grab the teleport key and recruit Grak (Fenn is optional). Skip the rest and go hunt down Bethel. That's social connections, warding, and firepower. The rest is how to get to the FSEZ, past Fell Seed, through the door, and through the long stairs in once piece.

        There's a lot of pressure on character build and what entads are worth tracking down, though. A social build would get through the bootstrapping faster, and might even get you past Fell Seed, but only works on a portion of encounters in the Long Stairs. A magic build synergizes with Soul Scaphism being so broken, and that + antimatter rune-bombs + gold magic might actually get you through the door before FS stops you, but it probably falls apart shortly into the Long Stairs. A physical build (I'm pretty sure unarmed is the strongest, btw) doesn't help much before Fell Seed and is a sketchy way to get past him, but makes the stairs easy.

        And there are extra wrinkles if the FS-hell dive-FS2 thing is actually mandatory in speedrun mode. That probably requires schlossing an exit before doing FS, and getting enough allies to pull off the hell run quickly.
        ```

  - u/--MCMC--:
    ```
    seconding the speed-run excitement! especially if they involve more god bothering, was a little sad with how little of that we got here

    also, in terms of post-mortems, I [chucked](https://i.imgur.com/0JffcSE.png) all the reddit comments into the cursory text analysis I did [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/om5c5u/rtcomplete_worth_the_candle_ch_246_end/h5jlu6m/), concatenating the corresponding chapters / 'mini-arcs' -- looks like comments were pretty much all high- or low- magnitude, with little regard for valence, and that emotion was positively associated with more in-comment mentions of individual characters, which makes sense (I guess in contrast, chapters chunks whose comments were more world-building-focused were elicited less emotional comments? Also interesting to see how e.g. Bethel's mention in comments was positively associated w/ comment emotion, but her mention in text was negatively associated -- maybe because of the rape plot? Comments likewise were not too emotional for Grak-y chapters, but were for... Craig? Weird).

  I've seen [FLEEP](http://www.shigabooks.com/fleep.php) the comic By Jason Shiga recc'd here before, but I just found their other comic [DEMON](http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=002) (more about it described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2pfc78/demon_the_story_of_a_rational_sociopath/)). Tag warnings: lots of gore, blood, gruesome death, suicide, very dark themes. Also the previous post i've linked to has untagged spoilers in the comment section. 

  The comics have logic puzzles, lateral thinking, and even though there is gore, the comic format makes it less scary. It's an interesting read.
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    I adore everything Shiga has ever done and treasure my copy of [Meanwhile](https://www.amazon.com/Meanwhile-Pick-Path-Story-Possibilities/dp/0810984237).

    That said I just wanted to jump in and warn anyone squeamish that you aren't kidding, DEMON is *REALLY* dark and does not shy away from extremes. I recommend it for people like me who gobble down dark stuff if it's the right flavor (e.g., I binge every season of Black Mirror as soon as it comes out.)
    ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    This made me deeply uncomfortable given the hedonistic and defecting approach of various characters, but I binged the whole thing. It's darkly compelling.

    Also, what's the connection to FLEEP? The protagonists share a name and general personality but not, as far as I could see, a setting.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Same author, nothing else.
      ```

  - u/Weerdo5255:
    ```
    Huh, I suppose DEMON is rational in it's execution, it's central mechanic though is a very profound violation of Human agency and life.

    I don't know if it's appropriate to say I enjoyed something like it, and I have to say I feel very sorry for the daughter and her upbringing as she never had a chance. 

    I'll say thanks for the recommendation though, that was a ride, but I'll reiterate the above. This is dark.

  somebody recommended me [And Then There Were (N-One)](https://uncannymagazine.com/article/and-then-there-were-n-one/), a short story by Sarah Pinsker. It's a murder-mystery set at a convention for all the alternate-universe selves of one person—namely, Pinsker herself. She discusses the story in an interview [here](https://uncannymagazine.com/article/interview-sarah-pinsker-2/). With fictionalised-autobiography stuff on the mind after *Worth the Candle*'s conclusion, I figured it'd be appropriate to share it here, as I thought it was excellent

  Hello everyone. I'm a Long time listener, but a first time caller.

  Over the past month or three, I've been reading a timeline style Alternate History story which takes the United Kingdom 250 years into the past from 1980 to 1730. I am of course speaking of the epic **Arose from out the Azure Main** also known as **Dislocated to Success**.

  The story has both good and bad things about it. You can decide which is which.

  The story can be dense. It includes illogical and unknowable British 1980s politics. The story has been written for 8 years, being published one chapter at a time to an online forum. The story isn't afraid to get deep into topics such as economics, history, medicine, politics, diplomacy, religion, morals, cultural values, identity, and race. It has typos.

  This recommendation isn't a very normal Rational one for a few reasons. Most obviously, the timeline has is no main character. Timeline-style stories in the Alternate History genre are usually defined by their many, and constantly changing viewpoints. It is also incredibly long, which isn't for everyone. The pace can really suffer, but you can usually safely skip one of the story viewpoints if you find it particularly uninteresting.

  Beyond that, the author clearly heavily researches his topics and characters and is both detail-oriented and consistent in their world-building. The world they create is very deeply thought out, with echo effects that show the author is able to step back and take a hard rationalist look at what this scenario would truly be like and is it this reason I find this story so fascinating: it makes you reconsider how did these people really think, what did they value, and what would they do when confronted with a paradigm shift? Each of these questions (and the author's answers to them!) are fascinating. Trying to avoid spoilers, are a few of the 'questions' I found particularly interesting.

  How could the entirely of the UK plausibly get transported back in time, and what are clues it would leave behind? How would the UK react to finding themselves 250 years in the past? What would their immediate priorities be, what are the second-tier priorities? How do they prioritize critical resources and people in an emergency situation? What inputs does a modern society need to keep itself running, and how would you go about re-acquiring them? What modern detail would shock someone from the 1700s most? How would this change based on their age, religion, culture, and circumstances in life? What would they think about their 'future' that could no longer come to pass? What did the American Colonies think about the British, and now the UK, given that the revolution hasn't (yet) happened, and what would the UK think about them? How would imperialism work if you had to re-do it all over again with our modern values, industrial base, technology, and experience? What tech and infrastructure would our society re-build we had to redo a lot of it from scratch?

  You will find yourself loving some of the most common story perspectives, and be disgusted by others. The story is epic length because it tells so many competing perspectives, which builds a rich world with intersecting characters with their own stories.

  I hope that was enough to get you interested, or at least confirm you aren't interested. Here are some helpful links. The story can be [read for free here](https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/arose-from-out-the-azure-main-story-only.261818/), where it was originally posted, although registering an account is required. You can also find it [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Dislocated-to-Success-3-book-series/dp/B07DYGQ7ZR?ref=dbs_m_mng_rwt_0000_share). It even has its [own TV Tropes page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AroseFromOutTheAzureMain).

  If you have any time travel/alt-history stories about rebuilding, re-inventing, uplifting, or similar, please recommend them to me!

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    It's been a long time since I read that, but I can recommend in general the alternate timelines on alternatehistory.com as they have a semi-self policing community, not as likely to call out mistakes/too many coincidences as here perhaps, especially on the ASB forums, but much better than most fanfiction communities. 

    But if you like history or even if you don't there are some very nice stories, for example:

    https://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/king-theodores-corsica.419096/

    Which teaches you a ton about real history, and by virtue of often being quite similar to real history have maximal versmiulitude and all characters behave realistically, as they were literally real people who actually did the thing, or something similar.

  This is not a recommendation, as I'm not particularly into the SCP universe (although I enjoyed the antimemetics story), nor am I into FPS games.

  That said, I know there are a lot of fans of SCP here, so when I saw a video game in that universe [pop up on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/affray/scp-pandemic), I thought that some people here would like to know about it.

  Again, I'm not endorsing this: I haven't watched the gameplay video, and wouldn't be able to tell a good FPS from a bad one if I had. And Kickstarters are backed at your own risk, so I recommend people exercise their own due diligence to ensure that this isn't a scam (I don't *think* it is, but I haven't given the project much more than a surface glance).

  But, yeah, if you're into FPSes and the SCP universe, you might want to give this a look.

  In [a previous post I made this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/olngkw/a_practical_guide_to_evil_patreon_or_no/) some people asked what I was currently reading and then recommended re-posting it in the weekly thread. Soooo, here it is!

  Series I check on regularly include:

  * [A Practical Guide to Sorcery](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34009/a-practical-guide-to-sorcery): Saw it recommended a month or two ago, and I REALLY enjoy it, though I get frustrated at the protagonist. Still, very nice world-building.
  * [Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that): Author is the same as The Gods Are Bastards, but it's a rather different (and darker) environment. Really enjoying it so far. Wish there was more, as each update is really enjoyable. I donated to the author for TGAB, so obviously I'm a fan of his writing style.
  * [Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-5-the-hunting-grounds): The first few (3 now, maybe?) books aren't available for free any more, but the newest chapters are on RR. This is a REALLY fun series, where the world is mostly destroyed, but the remaining humans get to participate in a mock-MMO "game" where if humans get to the lowest level of a dungeon crawl, they have the potential to "win back" Earth and all the people who died. No one has ever gotten close to that level, but Carl (and his "owner," a cat named Princess Donut) are determined to do so. Features a disturbing AI, a meta-story with the entire galactic economy, and great use of trope-knowledge to get donations by being good showmen (and showwomen). I used my free Kindle trial options on the first two (at the time) books, and they were WELL worth it.
  * [Vigor Mortis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis): The protagonist is a beaten orphan who gets a soul-stealing ability, and is becoming a monster over time. In the new (second) book, there's a character introduced who is a monster that is slowly becoming more human. I'm waiting to see where it goes, but the base story (following Vita) is pretty good. Great world building, I'm looking forward to where it goes, though I am not a huge fan of the trope of "monster getting into human morals" trope. We'll see...
  * [Metaworld Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles): Oh boy, a looooong series. Although the protagonist is a complete Mary Sue, it's good for world-building, using economics to revolutionize a fantasy world, and exploiting political and religious environments in an Earth-analogous setting. I love seeing how things work out, but yeah, the protagonist is over-the-top. Still, I haven't seen such a good deployment of credit cards in a fantasy setting before, and the actual setting (Australia originally, then China, and more recently Britain and then Mongolia) is a great break from the usual American-European-based stories.
  * [Beware of Chicken](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39408/beware-of-chicken): A subversion of xianxia tropes that has turned into my favorite xianxia novel. Xianxia, if you don't know, is basically "Chinese cultivation fiction," where characters train, meditate, and ingest pills to grow to new levels of supernatural enlightenment or power. This one is an "isekai" version of the trope, where the protagonist gets drawn into a xianxia world when a character in it dies after being bullied by other cultivators. Rather than try to become the most awesomestbestest cultivator ever, the MC nopes out and decides to spend his days setting up a farm in the backwoods of the world. He ends up powering up from the process without him realizing, but the stars of the cast are the animals he inadvertently raises up as sapient "spirit beasts" who all think he is some amazing grand master and not just a guy who randomly decides "I want to make pancakes today - how do I do that in this weird xianxia world?" The inversion of the setting has come full-circle to the point where I really want to learn about the world itself. Just, I want to follow a chicken exploring it, not a human.
  * [A Practical Guide To Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/): Already explained, though I am playing catch-up right now. Currently at chapter 13 in the 7th book. Honestly, one of my favorite stories I have found on this subreddit.
  * [Worth the Candle](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle): ~~Super intermittent releases, but we've had a lot recently. I'll be honest, I am considering restarting it so I can enjoy the most recent chapter releases, because I've lost a lot of knowledge over time.~~ Now finished! I plan on going back and rereading it from the beginning. It's a really great series where the protagonist finds himself inserted into a world made up of the various tabletop campaigns he has spear-headed over the years. Super good if you can deal with dark (but not grimdark - no Worm-levels of trauma here, thankfully) settings. Lots of humor, but lots of violence and trauma too.

  Ones I still have sitting and may be finished but I need to catch back up on...

  * [Lord of the Mysteries](https://novelfull.com/lord-of-the-mysteries.html?page=29&per-page=50): Kinda poorly translated, but pretty good overall. Great world-building and magic system, but again, the translation can be rough. I've heard that it ended, but I'm 1300 chapters in and haven't gotten to the end yet.
  * [With This Ring](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WithThisRing): I am not a DC fanboi, but this fanfic pretty much made me one, as I had to keep looking up IPs to understand WTF was going on. Pretty sure it has a controversial reputation on this sub due to the author's transphobic comments and getting booted off multiple sites. Still, really entertaining read and got me into DC lore. Even the MLP stuff didn't deter me, and I feel like the Paragon/Renegade routes are even more relevant with the recent release of the ME Trilogy. I should go back to this - honestly, it's been a few years.
  * [Mushoku Tensei](https://www.wuxia.blog/novel/Mushoku-Tensei): It's an anime now! I read like 13 of the LNs, but I should go back to it. It's the "granddaddy" of isekais. I had it saved in my tabs for years because I started it once, stopped after 6 volumes, and it took FOREVER to find it again without knowing the name... I actually just checked, and my link to it is dead o\_O That's been how long since I last read it... the link above I think is a more recent (and live) link.
  ```

  - u/lucidobservor:
    ```
    I sometimes, in the course of reading or looking for reading recommendations, encounter a setting that fills me with enough visceral *horror* that I cannot engage with it. Even when it's recommended numerous times on this subreddit.

    Until this post, *Dungeon Crawler Carl* fell into this category. But this particular line changes what I thought I knew enough that I'm actually interested now:

    > they have the potential to "win back" Earth and all the people who died 

    So thank you for saying the one thing I apparently needed to hear about this series!
    ```

  - u/sohois:
    ```
    I'd given up on Metaworld Chronicles about 20 chapters ago; I'd struggled through the awful opening easily enough, but at least back then there appeared to be a threat. The last chapters I read it was just Mary Sue blasting through everyone with little plot and a very limited understanding of business. But perhaps it picked up a bit since then?
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      >The last chapters I read it was just Mary Sue blasting through everyone with little plot and a very limited understanding of business. But perhaps it picked up a bit since then?

      Eh, yes and no? I felt like the Asian arc was where most of the business came in. There's still the Isle of Dogs redevelopment stuff going on in the background in Britain, and then in Mongolia she's basically nation-building with rat people. But I felt the China/Asia arc was where the economics played the most important role. Britain has economics in the IoD, but politicking is more key, and the rats need economic might but haven't really gone into it yet.

      Any longer-term threat is still nebulous - there was one chapter recently (sometime in the last 50 chapters) where Sobel reappears to quip cryptically to a council of elementals, but since then it's more running from one crisis to another, which the protagonist handles superbly each time and ends up richer and more powerful for it. There's a potential apocalypse (calamity) coming up where Gwen is supposed to play a key role, but I don't see how the most recent stuff about elves, snakes, and world trees play into it. I'd imagine Sobel's plan is >!to destabilize the prime material plane by destroying the world trees, which kicks off an apocalypse, and somehow Gwen gives into the Void to try and stop it!<, but it's all still very much up in the air.
      ```

      - u/sohois:
        ```
        Ah, I was hoping that the Mongolia trip would have resolved the dangling Sobel plot thread, but sounds like its still being dragged out. Think I might as well abandon the story permanently

    [The Two-Year Emperor](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w6279gwfusrdcsx/The_Two_Year_Emperor.zip?dl=0%EF%BB%BF) might actually be one of the first “Earth human goes to D&D World” stories, it’s old enough that the fact that it’s not on your list implies you might not have read it, and of course others might not have too.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      Good recommendation! I have indeed read it, though it was a few years ago. Lots of fun munchkinry, as I recall :-)
      ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    Mushoku Tensei is kind of sus. There was a topic here some time ago on how it's basically a pedo fantasy. The dude basically raises several girls and marries the lot of them.

    &#x200B;

    There was also discussion on how something so bad could be so successful in japan which is quite confusing.

    &#x200B;

    The rest of the recs are good though, either I'm already reading it, or they are on my list. I'm working on shrinking the percentage of my reading that comes from RR though, popcorn fiction has it's place but it becomes suboptimal when it's the majority of the fiction you consume.
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      Not to mention an elf that needs to be cummed in every day to live, and supposedly really enjoys it and has given up a lot of children. I think her current lover at some school arc is some young kid too. And a whole laundry list of other really sus things a couple of my friends tell me about. Even as a weeb, MT represents a lot of the things in the anime/LN medium that I really really dislike.

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Recently I've really been enjoying [A Journey in Darkness](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41591/a-journey-in-darkness). It's sorta a hardcore isekai where the protagonist gets really hurt and sometimes mutilated, but still finds the inner strength to pick herself back up and survive. Also biomancer MC, which is nice. 

    I also liked [Breaker of Horizons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43958/breaker-of-horizons). It reminds me of typical popcorn system apocalypse stories, except the author nails the feeling of exploration and the multicultural system. It also seems like the story has depth beyond just the protagonist trying to get more powerful, but we'll see how it goes. Protagonist is also a cute humanoid axolotl who can't speak with other people because axolotl mouth. 

    If you haven't read it already, I'd also suggest [Ar'Kendrythist](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst). Starts off derivative of Delve and has a really irrational protagonist, but it also has some of the best magic system exploration. It goes deeply into every new form of magic we face, and shows how they're interconnected at the base. The protagonist gets much better, and since the end of book 4 has been a really inspiring character to follow. I also liked that instead of just facing more and more powerful enemies, the protagonist starts to face more systemic problems that can't be solved with firepower. Said problems also have political consequences that are carried out, and that results in some nice character development.
    ```

    - u/serge_cell:
      ```
      Tentative disrecommend for Ar'Kendrythist. From the start god-like administrator in each(?) settelment looked like careless worldbuilding to me. 
      Worldbilding, stile and characters wern't impressive in general. Plot was looking like subpar of imitation of Delve. Didn't went far into it though, may be it become much better later.
      ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      Thanks for the recommendations! I hadn't heard of the first two and may try them out soon.

      >If you haven't read it already, I'd also suggest Ar'Kendrythist.

      I have tried this one and I've gone back and forth on it. I really enjoy the world-building and the magic system - though it has SO many loopholes - but it can drag on and on as Erick gets pulled into various miscellaneous sidequests. For a long time it felt like each sidequest was just the author looking for an excuse to try showing some cool new magic synergy he thought of! Then after about 100 chapters a lot of the seemingly disparate arcs of "Someone asks Erick for help, he learns a new magic to help solve the problem, and they part ways as friends but never see each other again" finally came together into a VERY satisfying overall arc conclusion, which I enjoyed quite a bit. I haven't caught back up to it again since >!all the shennanigans in Kendrythist,!< but I may take it up again some day. I dunno, in the end I felt like it was worth reading because there was *so much* to read when I started, but the thought of restarting it, especially if I did so from the beginning and had to slog through all the parts that had me bored the first time, is daunting. 

      Still, I'd give it a tentative recommendation to anyone who likes exploration of magic systems and synergy between magic spells (also discussions of physics and how they apply to the magic system). The characters themselves I found somewhat weak - Erick was frustratingly idealistic and naive, Jane came off as borderline sociopathic to me at times - but I liked the setting and the systems.
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        I think after the point where you stopped, Erick gets quite a bit more development. He's finally working at the stage his station requires, dealing with whole nations instead of individual people. His idealism and naivety gets tempered a bit more, especially due to the >!new stats!<. I'm a patron for the story and I'll say that in the coming weeks there will also be a big climax, around chapter 147-148ish.

        I do think the beginning slog is real. Erick doesn't really become compelling until after his change at the end of book 1, and even then it takes 3 more books of development until he's fully on board with Veird morals. I think you'd be find just continuing from where you left off. The past relationships don't really come back, but a lot of the ways he used to make magic are explored deeper. Magic itself is also explored deeper, this time at a proper archmage level instead of just rhyme and song.

    Tip for anyone trying Mushoku Tensei: the official English translation by Seven Seas is so much better (!!!) than the fan translations and later machine translated trash that it's worth waiting a few years for them to finish translating the rest. If you can't afford to support the official version, search up [LuCaZ].

  Last week, u/PastafarianGames asked for non-murderhobo dungeon core fics. [The Fallen World: A Dungeon's Story](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36118/the-fallen-world-a-dungeons-story)   fits that bill. The story premise is that a sci-fi engineer is forcibly turned into a dungeon core, in a world where dungeon cores are one of the few things that generate mana, rather than consume it.  The story follows two main plotlines, Alexandra Rousseau building her dungeon and preparing to take her revenge on those who transformed her, and Allya Aubétoile, a disgraced noble building a dungeon town around the dungeon.  
  
  The world isn’t a bog-standard fantasy world, which is nice to see. There’s plenty of interesting magitech available, and several of the implications have been worked out. There are international corporations, for example, which I don’t think I’ve ever seen in a fantasy setting.  
  
  There’s a few flaws, as with near everything. The author speaks English as a second language, so the prose is a bit funky at times.  
  
  The pacing is about average for a webnovel, which is to say it’s pretty slow. This isn’t entirely a bad thing, but more of a personal preference. If the pacing was moved up, much less time would be spent covering the engineering challenges that Alexandra faces, for example.

    So, uh, I'm unfamiliar with reddit (much to the dismay of a good friend of mine), but is it weird if, as the author, I upvote and comment on this XD ?

    Btw I'm here because RR shows link referrers to author, and my referrer screen went kind of insane today XD. So I hopped in to see what was going on, and stumbled on your recommendation. Thus I created a reddit account and decided to post a comment.

    Anyway, thank you for recommending my story ! I'm working on my english, so hopefully the prose will get better as time goes on (although I will make no promises on the expressions, as those are harder to get through my head, and most importantly remember), and the question of pacing has come a lot to me actually. Mostly I'm aiming for a Safehold style pacing, with a lot of setup time between major confrontations, plus throwing in some unexpected/short notice ones from time to time. I'm also toying with the idea of making a 'dungeon journal' series of short, bonus chapters about Alexandra having to deal with adventurer shenanigans, who would be too short/wouldn't be important enough to make it to the main story itself.

      I don't think it's weird. Engaging with your audience is pretty common.

      I've been reading along and enjoying it well. A question now that I have you. Maybe I have missed it but if the purpose of having people in the dungeon, in particular having them stay for long, why is there such a big focus on combat? Is there a reason that she doesn't say make a large libraby, make deal with adventures for them to just sit/cultivate in a room for a while in exchange of loot, or expand to have the city be part of the dungeon? Having people breaking stuff she makes as part of them being there has previously discussed as being pretty costly and there must be better ways of having them stick around without enduring that cost.

      I'm at chapter 31 if that's relevant.
      ```

      - u/Playwars:
        ```
        I do that a lot on Royal Road (I answer virtually every comment), but it's the first time I do it somewhere else than on RR or my discord.

        That has actually been adressed in the story (somewhat indirectly if I remember well), but you haven't reached that point yet. In short, it's because the interference zones created by people combine and amplify each other when they overlap. 1 regular person takes out a few meters around them. 10 would take out the nearby rooms at minimum. 100 would take out the floor. A thousand would take out most of the dungeon. Ten thousand would just prevent her from doing anything. Those aren't hard numbers for the webnovel mind you, just an example.

        So the younger dungeons try to avoid rushing for the dungeon town. The older ones end up englobing it however, which is why the big dungeons never change their top floors, it isn't that they don't want to, it's that they literally can't because of the interference area from the city.

          Thanks for responding!

          That makes sense in terms of not expanding to cover the town but I still don't understand how having the adventurers fight her creation is the best way of getting mojo from them. Wouldn't she get the same benefits, without the cost of repairing stuff, if she offered mutually beneficial containment rooms(e.g. library, cultivation rooms, steam bath rooms, cinema, or similar)? Or just offering people the loot they would get anyway if they spent a few hours sitting around in a room to save the repair costs? I get that in that case she won't get the mojo from killing them but my understanding is that she didn't really want that. Am I missing something?

          I'm excited about the army building. Very much looking forward to seeing what'll come of that.

          Tangentally related, I'm caught up now and I did miss that overlapping zones amplifying each other.

            No problem !

            That is because she gets mana from the presence of adventurers, and essence for killing them. Mana is her general currency, but it is also being slowly converted into essence at a fixed (and quite frankly pathetic) rate. Essence is...well, what essence is actually is a huge spoiler, but in short, essence improves her capabilities. You see the start of that in chapter 38, where she becomes better at multitasking, plus some other background stuff, like her simulations improving, her coding speed and memory getting better, her absorption speed going up, ect.

            But she doesn't only gain essence from adventurers, she also gains materials, objects, ect, which are MASSIVELY important to her long-term goals. If only for that, she would ditch the peaceful approach in a heartbeat.

            That's more of a long term thing, with slices of it dispersed throughout (as she's trying to build it under Emilia's nose), but I hope you'll enjoy it !

            Uh. I've gone back over the story and it seems it hasn't been mentionned. Damn it, I must have forgot. Well, something to add to the new chapters, even if it is quite late.

            Sorry if this comment is a bit weird and not really coherent, but it's almost 4 in the morning, it's hot and humid as hell, and I'm kind of KO. But I wanted to answer before I forgot. Hopefully this has proven useful and informative to you.

              Ouch; hot, humid, and early in the morning is a bad combo. Hope you'll be able to get better sleep next cycle. I think you were perfectly coherent except for the sentense about her doing something under Emilia's nose which kind of confused me. I think it was pretty useful and informative!

              Essense was mentioned a few times but I don't remember that she only got it from kills so that's probably good mentioning. 

              I take it that you want to write a story about a dungeon that makes killing floors, right? I can think of a few possibly better alternatives to the murder floors under those constraints (that's kind of the point of this subreddit - to optimize for what the character wants even when it's not narratively convenient) but I don't want to end up arguing with you over the type of story you want to write. If you want to hear those I can send you a private message but if not that's totally fine as well.

  If you remember the “2-4-6 game” from the *Methods of Rationality* chapter on the train, there is a whole game of that on Steam.

  It is called [**Understand**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299400/Understand/) and it involves deducing the hidden rules by which lines must be drawn in a grid of shapes.

  It’s pretty explicitly inspired by *The Witness*. I’d also compare it to physical games where the players are trying to deduce the rules, like Zendo, Eleusis, or Mao.

  I am greatly enjoying it so far. It has made me laugh out loud several times when I realize how totally different the real rule is than the superstition the game led me into developing initially.

  Has anyone got a favorite Hfy they would like to share with me? 

  My favorites are

  I enjoyed but got tired of The Jenkinsverse by hambone. In particular The Xiù Chang Saga was the best part. I love when humans are protective of children when they are other species(or our own). 

  That is just a bit of what i like. Oh, hfy stands for Humanity Fuck Yeah! Hope you enjoy my recommendations. I look forward to reading your recommendations. Have a beautiful day!

      I loved this one. I actually have an ebook version of it. Although it has been so long since I read it i have forgotten most of the plot.

    My favourite has to be [Post Human](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human). Humanity is extinct, except for one individual on a half-built asteroid base. I last read it like 2 years ago, so I've forgotten most of the plot, but I remember really enjoying it.

    I recently read [Galactic Economics](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39729/galactic-economics) (Royalroad link, it's on /r/HFY somewhere too), and it's a fun read. Humans discover space travel, meet the rest of the galaxy, and realise that they're the only race that has the concept of money.

    I feel like the author must have been a high school economics teacher, since it crams in tons of well explained economics, with links to more info in the descriptions. I do wish some of the economics was explored at a deeper level, though.

    It unfortunately hasn't been updated in over 5 months, so it's probably dead, but it stopped updating right after the end of its 2nd story arc, so it's an alright ending.

      I have come across Post Human before but at the time it was still ongoing. Now that it is complete and rather short at that I look forward to giving it a try. Thank you for bringing it back to my attention. 

      Galactic Economics sounds very interesting. My first thought is that the aliens will have a barter system on a personal level and mutual trade agreements on a government level. Also thanks for the incomplete warning. Since you felt it was good enough to rec I will give it a try. Lol, I do avoid incomplete most of the time whenever doing my own searches but there are so many gems that get skipped! 


      Thanks for sharing it brought a smile to my day.

        I know the feeling, unfortunately. 80/90% of webfiction is generally unfinished, either it's still updating, or the author just abandoned it.

        Two more potential things you might be interested in:

        - [Grand Design](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21216/grand-design) (completed) (also on [/r/HFY](https://old.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/96ir3b/oc_grand_design/)): It's been on my to-read list for ages, but I haven't yet got around to reading it. However, I've seen it recommended a few times, and has a high rating, so it's probably good. It sounds like it's about new races living in the wreckage of the empire of humanity, after humanity has become extinct.
        - [Onward to Providence](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34353/onward-to-providence) (on hiatus, but has ~370k words): I wouldn't call this HFY, since although humans are in this and do HFY hijinks, the main character isn't human. However, if you like xeno-fiction, where alien races are very different from humans, then this is amazing. Be aware that it's proper xeno-fiction and sometimes it's crazy hard to decipher alien POVs, since they don't think anything like humans.

      Thank you it was awesome to reread lablonnamedadon and both tech and humanities price were new to me. I loved how excited the human was in tech. It reminded me of the scene in rise of the guardians where north tells jack his center. 

      I was surprised to see many people saying they called the twist in the comments of humanity's price. It was not exactly a shock but it did not feel telegraphed either. It was very enjoyable thank you for sharing!
