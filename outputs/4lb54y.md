## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I'm guessing you all have seen this, but I found [this album of deep dream generated art](http://imgur.com/a/ue6ap) to be really interesting. You can make your own [on this site](https://dreamscopeapp.com/), [or this one](https://deepart.io/), or [grab the code from github](https://github.com/SergeyMorugin/ostagram). Part of me thinks that this is just going to replace or add on to a lot of the filters that are already in Photoshop and the like. But a different part of me thinks that maybe this will actually be useful for creating art, though I think you still need to get composition and balance right, and it does take a little bit of time and practice to get good results.

    I've been goofing around with it a bit lately too (e.g. see this [reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthPorn/comments/4jkr1c/horseshoe_bend_at_sunset_1024x682_oc_os/d380m1q?context=4), some [graphics](https://i.imgur.com/kFOjsbw.png) for [presentations](https://i.imgur.com/pP1zBNt.png) I've done on paleo stuff to get a more old-timey look -- though I just had a better thought: cave paintings! -- and profile [photos](https://i.imgur.com/6yCcHjq.png) on [social media](https://i.imgur.com/eNS0wkQ.png) -- sometimes it turns out really [nice](https://i.imgur.com/FxQzOZj.png) and other times quite [frightening](https://i.imgur.com/btAmB9A.png)).

    Call it a filter, call it whatever you want. The results in the album are things I would be willing to hang on my wall. It would definitely be nicer if it were to reach the point where anyone could get those results in a single click, but as long as it's easier than making such images by hand, it's progress.

    Imagine a world where "I want image X reimagined in the style of artist Y" isn't something you have to commission an artist for.

    Speaking of which. I'm curious what the legal copyright status on images altered in this way would be.

    I'm experimenting right now using [this github code](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style) (and some ice packs for my poor overworked laptop). 

    I haven't gotten nearly as good results, either because the gallery has pruned a hell of a lot of failures, or because they've found a better combination of parameters (what weight to give to each image, whether to care about minute elements or only about major trends etc.). It's a work in progress.

    Shame it takes so damn long for an image to be computed. It slows down my progress considerably.

  An interesting question: **[When did the Roman Empire fall?](http://www.alternatehistory.com/forum/threads/373830)**  
  \- 395: [Emperor Theodosius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I) dies. The empire is divided between his two sons into two portions, administered from Constantinople and from ~~Rome~~ Milan.  
  \- 476: [Odoacer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odoacer), commander of the WRE's ~~barbarian~~ Germanic mercenaries in Italy, deposes [Western Roman Emperor Romulus August(ul)us](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_Augustulus) and declares himself King of Italy. Though he pays lip service to the previous Western Roman Emperor, Julius Nepos (who fled to Dalmatia after being deposed in favor of Romulus Augustulus), he refuses to allow the latter's return to Italy.  
  \- 480: [Julius Nepos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Nepos) dies in Dalmatia. [Zeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_\(emperor\)), his eastern counterpart, abolishes the Western court and holds *de jure* sway over the "united" empire from Constantinople, though he has little *de facto* control over the West.  
  \- 565: [Emperor Justinian I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_I) dies after reconquering large areas of formerly-Roman territory in Italy, Africa, and Spain. His successors soon lose these gains to Germanic tribes and to the Sunni Caliphate.  
  \- 636: The Sunni Caliphate's forces annihilate the Eastern Roman army in [the Battle of Yarmouk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Yarmouk). The ERE abandons Syria to Muslim conquest, and soon loses Egypt and Armenia as well.  
  \- 1204: Constantinople is conquered by the leaders of [the Fourth Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade), who establish [the Catholic "Empire of Romania" (or "Latin Empire")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_Empire). Competing Greek claimants to the title of Emperor are set up in Nicaea, Epirus, and Trebizond. [The "Empire" of Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Nicaea) eventually destroys the Latin and Epirote claimant states, regains Constantinople, and proclaims a restored ERE, while Trebizond remains independent.  
  \- 1453: [Constantinople is conquered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople) by [Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottomans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_the_Conqueror), who proclaims himself Caesar of Rome.  
  \- 1461a: Mehmed II conquers [the Despotate of Morea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotate_of_the_Morea), the last independent remnant of the Nicaean ERE.  
  \- 1461b: Mehmed II conquers [the "Empire" of Trebizond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Trebizond), the last independent remnant of the pre-1204 ERE.  
  \- 1806: [Holy Roman Emperor Francis II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) dissolves the HRE, as Napoleon threatens to conquer it and transform it into a France-dominated federal structure.  
  \- 1917: [Tsar Nicholas II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia) abdicates the throne of the Russian Empire. Russia formerly was seen as [a "Third Rome"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Rome): The great-great-grandfather of Ivan IV "the Terrible", first Tsar of Russia (as opposed to [Muscovy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Moscow)), [was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Palaiologina) an Eastern Roman Emperor, and Muscovy was instrumental in bringing (Orthodox) Christianity to Russia, just as Constantine brought Christianity to the Mediterranean.  
  \- 1922: The Grand National Assembly of Turkey [abolishes the Ottoman sultanate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_the_Ottoman_sultanate).  
  \- (Some other date that the pollster didn't consider)

  So, what are the prerequisites for being able to declare yourself the Emperor of Rome?

  As weird as it seems even to me, I'm inclined to think that the most consistent answer for the *final* end of the Roman Empire is **1922**.  
  \- Religion: To say that only Christians can be Roman Emperors is ridiculous when the Empire was pagan for centuries before Constantine and Theodosius.  
  \- Legitimacy of claim: To say that only non-usurpers can be Roman Emperors is ridiculous when there were zillions of usurpations even before the Empire split.  
  \- - (There are, of course, *degrees* of legitimacy. If [the rules of *Crusader Kings II*](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Empires) are taken as a *vaguely*-accurate example, actually controlling most of the title's historical territory is necessary to proclaim yourself ruler of it, but you'll have a hard time conquering enough land to do so without either declaring holy wars or having already inherited a claim on the title. Nowadays, any "historical territory" or "hereditary claims" of the Roman Empire would be laughably weak, after so many centuries have passed--unless Turkey can be called the Empire's republican successor... but we're talking about the Roman *Empire* here, aren't we? Such a digression!)  
  \- Culture: To say that only Romans can be Roman Emperors--that the Roman Empire can be usurped only from inside, and any usurpation by an invader is illegitimate--to me seems like a slightly-stronger argument (in favor of 1453), but still rather arbitrary, since the Roman Empire contained sizeable populations of many cultures.

  Alternatively, if continuity is required, I'd go for **1204** as a *temporary* end to the Roman Empire, before its Nicaean restoration, since none of the claimants seem to have had particularly-strong claims before that time. This opinion may be influenced by the Fourth Crusade's treatment in the Historical Improvement Project mod for *[Crusader Kings II](http://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings)*, which outright destroys the "Eastern Roman Empire" title and fragments it into claimant states whenever it loses Constantinople or is held by a non-Christian.

  Unwritten rules of the ~~cape~~ Reddit scene: Length limitations on comments! At what point does a wall of text cease to be interesting and start to be annoying? [;-)](http://np.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/4k7mxz/heres_the_thing/d3d3qp9?context=2)

  On a related note, I recently discovered [the `details` HTML tag](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_details.asp), which is a nicely-simple way of condensing content ([example](https://www.dropbox.com/s/grz9dqbhwlsrek5/Italia%20structure.html)). Also, I enjoy being able to condense references into links on Reddit, rather than being forced to include them directly as plaintext on Facebook. It's like speaking in three dimensions (if paragraph-based transitions between topics are the second dimension)!

    ```
    I've always thought of it as 1453, when Constantinople fell, which is also conveniently about 1,000 years after the WRE fell. Until Constantinople actually fell, you had a large territory that for the most part was a direct successor (politically and legally) to the Roman Empire, and the people and nobles living there identified themselves (and their state) as Roman. *They* thought they were in the Roman Empire, if nothing else.

    I think there's a good argument for 476, though--this is definitely the fall of the WRE, at least. After this, Rome had basically lost control of Africa, Mauretania, Iberia, most of France, Italy, etc. Europe and many of the other civilizations touching the Mediterranean were plunged into a thousand years of war, darkness and barbarism. Although the ERE/Byzantine Empire was known as the Roman Empire after 476, in retrospect we don't call it the Roman Empire. We call it something else. It certainly isn't the same, even if it's a legitimate successor.

    My personal rule for comment length is five paragraphs, though I try to also make sure that I have something to say, and I'll go longer if I think that it's something people actually want to read (or I just really want to talk about it). I think I can also get a lot of mileage out of breaking up the wall of text with bullet points or charts.

    That said, a lot of the time people don't put the work into making their text pleasant and readable, which can really drop my enjoyment substantially and make me click away. This can be especially true on subs like this one (and /r/magicbuilding) in part because few people have either the training in technical writing to make technical details readable, or the training in prose writing to deliver exposition well. Worse, sometimes people seem to have only gathered some surface level understanding of what makes text easily readable, so they include section breaks and bullet points willy-nilly. (Alternately, there are places like /r/tifu or /r/talesfromtechsupport where people have no idea what makes for a good story and do their best *impression* of a guy who is telling an entertaining story without actually accomplishing their goal.)

    You're arguing for the last legitimate claim to the title, not to the position of "Emperor".  Once Rome lost cohesion, its power as an empire also collapsed.  Thenceforth the title was merely a means for an authority to claim legitimacy.  I don't follow why you'd do this thought experiment.

  Alice in Mirrorland is awful. You should actively avoid it. The only good thing in the movie is the main character saying "Time is a thief and a villain" near the start of the movie, a sentiment she then spends the whole film unlearning because the shortness of life makes it more beautiful.

  Merely noticing your own irrational thought processes is not sufficient to make them stop, it seems. The US Democratic primary is making this amply clear to me. My observation here is about the thought process, but obviously political mutant spider babies and all that.

  For various reasons I rather dislike Hillary, but the server or the FBI investigation are not why I formed that opinion. However, at this point that investigation is starting to look like the only thing that could possibly cost her the nomination, and all the /r/politics discussions about the Democratic primary seem centered around it. So... I didn't notice it happening, but it seems like my brain went from "I hate her so much and it's because of what a horribly corrupt incarnation of the bribe devouring status quo she is" to "I hate her and it's because she's an arrogant criminal who must never have security clearance again." And I know perfectly well that people are good at rationalizing things, and also that those narratives do not contradict, but... I can't put a finger on when the transformation occurred. Somewhere along the way my brain decided to have the exact same feelings but to justify them in a different way.
  ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    In the permutation of hindsight bias where you say "I knew that" after learning something new and intuitive, you can't remember your previous state of not-knowing.  Based on that, I'd say the change occurred immediately after you processed the new information.

    If you find yourself hating or disliking someone, imagine you in their specific circumstances and sharing their values (interpreted charitably).  What do you do?  Often I'd do something differently, but that's because I know different things.  The resultant image of the hated person may be off-base, especially if they're actually evil, but more probably it's more accurate than your previous model.  You can always update in light of events that occurred after the specific event you imagined.
    ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    I think with situations like this, there's some element that's simply locality.  Your prior beliefs about her are old hat - you likely remember the conclusions you reached easily, but your brain needs a second to pull up the supporting facts and lines of reasoning.  The new bits, on the other hand, are fresh.  They're still in your brain's cache, ready to deploy immediately whenever they seem relevant, for example, when you query your brain "Why do I dislike Hillary?"

  I've been watching the show Hunter x Hunter again since my Roommates haven't seen it. I have to say, that show is actually a lot more rational than most other anime's i've seen. The question I have to ask you guys here though, is this. Do you think the show itself is rational? There's a couple times where a bunch of stuff that happens is kind of stupid, but overall I find the stupid stuff to be minor enough to overlook it. 

  What do you think?

    The opening arc of HxH is a rather interesting beast among shounen because there are barely any actual battles that go on. Instead, almost every obstacle they face are more puzzles than fights, and that's something I seriously appreciate. Even a lot of the later fights are mostly decided by strategy than strength. So I would see that it is significantly more rational than the average shounen.

    I would not say that Hunter x Hunter is *entirely* rational (Gon is about as bullheaded as an ordinary shonen protagonist, though certainly more perceptive), but it is pleasantly more causal than others, surprising considering the number of times its introduced new setting elements.
    ```

    - u/Dwood15:
      ```
      Well, having a world where the characters are rational is different than a world that is rational. The characters are definitely not reasonable all the time,  but like you said,  the world seems to generally be causal.

  Suppose you're trapped in a room.

  There's a similiar room nearby, with your exact duplicate inside.

  Your room has a button, the other room doesn't.

  Press the button, and you will be immediately released, but the other room will be filled with deadly neurotoxin, and your duplicate will die.

  Do nothing, and after an hour, your duplicate will be freed, but the deadly neurotoxin will fill *your* room.

  Will you press the button?

  What if the duplicate is not exact, and the only difference is that he or she will choose differently, in your situation?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I press the button. Me and my clones value each other's lives equally, so since one of us is going to die anyway, it's better not to waste an hour trapped in this room.

        If I'm in the room with the button, I'm pretty sure that I still press the button, for the same reasons (also, I value a non-identical clone of myself less than an identical clone, so the decision is even easier).
        ```

      - u/blazinghand:
        ```
        That seems like even more reason to press the button, since the duplicate is a tiny bit less like you, and therefore a tiny bit less valuable to you.

      - u/Aabcehmu112358:
        ```
        I'd guess press the button, again? In the allodupe situation, the only person who leaves the rooms is someone who would've pressed the button if they had the opportunity, so why waste an hour.
        ```

  - u/Muskworker:
    ```
    I don't think I should press the button.  

    The demand is that someone dies.

    1. Ceteris paribus, I think I should rather die through inaction than kill through action.
    2. Ceteris paribus, I think I should rather whoever survives this experience come away with the emotion of "someone died to save me" (or perhaps ignorance of the situation, if they weren't told) than the emotion of "I killed someone to save my own skin" (whether remorsefully or remorselessly).

    Postulated exactness of the duplication aside, we're different people *now*. And certainly more so as the hour goes on.  So I'm not sure the idea of us being the "same" person should alter my choice.  (It does mitigate a couple of things though, like the death-fear of not being able to continue what I've started, and the question of whether the life of the person I'm saving is "worth" more or less than mine.)

    -----

    Would I hit the button if my duplicate *would* hit the button?   

    I'm not sure that changes the answer.  As postulated, that's his only difference from me, so it'll be moot after the hour anyway.

      Hmm. The clone in the room with the button knows more about this situation than another one, and has access to a weapon, however limited; on the other hand, the evil scientist could have messed with another clone's brain, therefore he would appear less threatening to the scientist — lack of explicit access to a weapon only helps here — and the scientist is more likely to underestimate him.

      So, out of four, probably the clone in the room without the button in the second situation.

  I've started building an RC airplane (kinda like those RC cars you'd often see as a kid) with an electric motor.

  Some Worm fridge horror. Coil's power supposedly allows him to split the timeline at will, while he has single mind controlling his body in both branches. He can later destroy any of them and split again.

  Consider an alternative description. Universe is constantly branching so that every possible configuration is explored. Coil's power 'only' allows him to retain the mind-synchronizing connection between his two selves in branches of the multiverse that naturally occur at the moment he does the 'split'. When he 'destroys' one branch, what actually occurs is that his mind state stops synchronizing. One instance of him goes on happily believing that he has actually destroyed a disadvantageous branch, while the other quickly realizes the horror of having to deal with the consequences of his actions multiplied by the amount of times he did this to himself, coupled with grim certainty that the other him will forever remain ignorant of the truth and will keep doing this.

    This is an interesting horror idea, but is explicitly not how his power works according to WoW (I unfortunately do not have a link available, but I think there's a WoW repository available at /r/parahumans). 

    [Spoilers for Worm](#s "Canonically, his power just looks at the two options he is considering, determines the one he isn't going to use (I forget how), then throws together a convincing illusion of that scenario, collecting any extra information it needs (like alt-Dinah's predictions) from other shards.")

      So he's *merely* killing billions of simulated people each time he uses his power...

      (We can quibble over "killed" since most of them have a nearly-identical copy of themselves that survives in the real world.)

      But that's just out-of-story word of god. The story gives no hint of this that I can remember, and in a setting that already exploits ~~infinite~~ absurdly numerous parallel universes as a source of superpowers, I'm not convinced this explanation is needed.

          But even it it wasn't, the Clairvoyant isn't *that* strong. Khepri did not gain instant awareness of every person (or, for that matter, landscape) in the multiverse. She had to specifically look for things, things she at least vaguely knew where to find. She ended up with all the capes from her own world she'd already heard of, but not e.g. the bizarro capes from the Traveller's interlude.

          Actually, the Entities explicitly prevented powers from accessing the majority of parallel universes, including those too "close" to their own (because lots of clones of the same universe don't produce useful data.)

            That doesn't actually disagree with what I just said.

    It wouldn't even be that bad. Coil was very concerned about that kind of scenario happening, and was very careful not to put all his eggs in the same basket in case he was forced to shut down a timeline by external events. So every "bad turn Coil" would just find themselves in a slightly shitty situation, wonder why they ended up with the most useless superpower ever and then go "Meh, I'm still rich and at the head of a massive criminal empire, so who cares".

  If anyone here can read Haskell and wants to see some neat code on the information theory of hierarchical Bayes models, yo PM me and I'll add you on github.

  Not making the repo public before I've written and submitted a paper though.

    > Why should *you* be admitted?  Really?  *You*?  Out of all the thousands of applicants we're receiving?  Of what benefit to society could you possibly be if we invest our copious resources into *you* of all people?  Can you even handle our training?  Assuming you can, what could *you* possibly plan on achieving afterwards?  Pish.  *You*.

    A pessimistic view on whom and how that question should convince.  [Here](http://www.accepted.com/medical/sample-essay/runner)'s an example that does it.  Pick a thesis of why *me*, and have that inform the piece.  If you're struggling with how to be creative, imagine telling a story of your life, focusing on all events up to now as guided by a unique aspect of your personality, a vision of a future you, or a specific past event that informs the salient question of why *you*.

  What good writing software is available? Obviously there's word, open office, libre office and stuff like that, but things specifically for creative writing?

    As far as I can tell, nothing's really that much of an improvement over the typewriter, dpeaking in terms of getting stuff written. We've had plenty of usability reforms, but creative writing hasn't really been helped by technology like art has been by pen tablets or music by digital audio workstations.

    But hey, if you find something that proves me wrong, feel free to tell me!

    I use [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php), which has a whole lot of features that I find useful. [Here's a screengrab](http://i.imgur.com/KmDR5em.png). It's not light-years ahead of Word, but I personally found it worth the money.

  How rational is the whole "person X has seen the assassin's face so they must die" trope?
  ```

  - u/electrace:
    ```
    Depends on the situation, I'd assume.

    If the time and hassle of killing the witness outweighs the cost of having the witness blab, then the witness gets to live, yay!

    Example A: A foreign assassin in ancient times who will be able to escape back to his home country before the witness is able to get help will probably let the witness live.

    Example B: The eldest prince murders his father and is found out by a guard? The guards got to die. Later, the prince claims the guard killed the father, and that he heroically avenged his father's death.

    There are a bunch of variables though. Is the witness psychotic? Probably safe to let them live because no one will believe them. Will you be convicted either way? Mine as well let them live. Is there a decent chance that the witness could kill you, if you attempted to kill them? Probably should run away.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Depends on what you're talking about. If it's just [Leave No Witnesses](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeaveNoWitnesses), then that's fairly rational; witnesses can contact the authorities, they can positively identify you later on, and they'll be called in the event of a trial.

    But the more extreme version, where the assassin expends enormous amounts of resources trying to chase down people who know his identity ... that's quite a bit harder to justify.
