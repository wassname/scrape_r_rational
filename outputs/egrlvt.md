## Sam Hughes's Writing Process

### Post:

Hey all, is there any information out there on the writing process of Sam Hughes (Ra, Fine Structure, the Antimemetics stories)? Like does he outline? Write in the morning versus the evening? Research? And so on. I'm an author and I'm looking for ways to improve my own process.

  I think this is one of those moments when it would be appropriate to ping. /u/sam512 

  Assuming that he doesn't answer, his website, [Things of Interest](https://qntm.org/) has a number of non-fiction articles about writing, which don't necessarily go over his process, but illuminate how he thinks about writing. These are usually in his blog section, which has a lot of other stuff and no tagging, but the most relevant here are the most recent three posts there:

  * [Worldbuilding](https://qntm.org/worldbuilding)
  * [Stomp on the Mystery Box](https://qntm.org/mystery)
  * [Write Like a Programmer](https://qntm.org/write)
  ```

    Thank you! I've read Stomp on the Mystery Box, and Worldbuilding, but Write Like a Programmer?? Wow! Thank you for recommending it? Should I talk about how great that essay is here or start a new thread? I'll comment on Hughes's website too ;)

  Don't forget, however, that writing advice is personal and (where people are talking about how to be a *successful* writer) subject to survivorship bias. Some people write better in the morning, other people at night, to give one example, and you shouldn't assume that one of those will be better for you just because Hughes does it. You might have different rhythms, different work schedules, different working environments, etc...

    I've lately had a lot of success looking for, not advice, but reporting by authors I like about their everyday process. Then I try out their specific practices one by one and find which ones work. I started doing this about a year ago, and the results have been very good, in the quality of the work I produce (I like it), the speed with which I produce it (two novels, a handful of essays and short stories, and good progress on other projects), and the diminishing of the negative side-effects of writing (burnout, existential crises, etc.). But there's still more I can grow :)
