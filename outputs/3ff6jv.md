## [RT]? Red Legacy

### Post:

Six months ago I posted about my first published story, which was only available in paper. I was asked to come back once it was available online. The rights have reverted to me now, so I put it up online today.

[Red Legacy](http://archiveofourown.org/works/4475975)

I *think* it counts as rationalist, but I'd like outside opinions. It features a scientific exploration of a set of alternative natural laws, factions that aren't plain good/evil, and the use of knowledge/resources to solve problems. On the other hand, it does also use violence to solve some problems, and there is no munchkin'ing of the system - it is being explored by a govt. research program rather than being exploited by the protagonist. And while the protagonist generally tries to optimize her actions to achieve her goals, desperation tends to drive her quite a bit.

So, if you have the time/inclination, where would you consider this to fall in the Rational spectrum? Thanks.

  I really love this story, and actually tear up when listening to parts of the audio version.  I'm not sure whether or not to call it "rational", but things that make me turn towards saying "yes" include:

  * what we see of world seems to be well considered, consistent, and the result of optimization processes
  * conflict is driven by the universe being awful and real differences of values
  * main character has an attitude of "wherever it takes"/heroic responsibility
  * clever things like the "self-destruct" button
  * it asks important questions about to what extent we should want to cheer for immortality research 

  The first and last are just elements of good SF, I guess, but I included them anyway.

    Well shit, awesome! As an author, there are few things that make me happier than hearing something like that, thank you! I'm sure the voice actors/actresses will be pleased too, I'll pass it on. :)

    And thank you for the feedback about rational fiction as well. I've written a little over a half-dozen stories so far, and only two of them are what I'd consider "rationalist." Turns out that as much as I love reading it, it's not a writing style that comes naturally to me.

  Very good story. I remember when you announced it had been accepted for publication and I did see it in print. It is a lot more heart wrenching than I expected from 'Soviet mad scientist'. The Lamarckian evolution is a brilliant stroke of alternate world building. A very Strossian vibe. I wish I had thought of a story like this.
  I was sure that the reactor incident would actually point to some Darwinian technique to save her child, but sadly, that didn't happen.

  Minor nitpick:
  There is no way Soviet security would be this flimsy around a national security project of this nature. Even accounting for the Lamarckian explanation, MI6 and the others seem to penetrate it far too easily. That just feels wrong, somehow. 
  I also need to sit down and think of how a Lamarckian world would actually look like. Would be wildly different or just subtly different as this story portrays ?
  But a very good story, overall.
