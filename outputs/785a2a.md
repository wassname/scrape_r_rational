  Hakram is great. He's probably Catherine's best asset, bar none.
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Looking at Scribe being a calamity and how important logistics is in any war, I tend to agree.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      It's not even so much the logistics aspect as it is him being the perfect right-hand man. He's exactly the kind of friend Catherine needs whenever she needs one, and exactly the kind of second-in-command she needs whenever she needs one. She's incredibly fortunate to have him, especially considering how the "trusted lieutenant" trope *usually* pans out.

      I hope he doesn't die. I'm pretty sure that would be the most painful story development possible.

  ```
  I really like the moments when characters sit down and actually talk about the consequences of what they do / did / choose. These are probably my favorite parts of the Practical Guide.
  ```

  Another power boost already? Well, I suppose it's going to be necessary if Cat is going to somehow survive fighting an enemy who can light the sky on fire.
  ```

  - u/JdubCT:
    ```
    Or can tap into the hells to create a super weapon that seems on par with the Dead King's achievements. Cat may end up transcending Names after this.

    Remember, she had issues dealing even with a Duke and has lost Rise as a stolen aspect. She's now facing a Princess and the Queen of Summer. Later she's going to face a GOODLY portion of the Winter court. She can't rely on Ranger a second time and she needs power to do so.
    ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  Something just feels wrong about her drawing the line at a specific kind of human sacrifice. She sacrificed thousands starting a war to move up the ranks. She personally sacrifices enemy soldiers to win a battle. She sacrifices her own soldiers to win. I feel like when she draws a line like that, it's a way of pretending that killing people in other circumstances isn't bad. That she doesn't have to worry about all the choices she makes as long as they don't cross the line.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    There are several reasons from that.

    First, on an emotional level, Catherine and Hakram both view sacrifices as "that thing Praesi do to us sometimes when they feel like it", so it makes sense they'd be extremely against it on a gut level, for the same reasons people who frequently fought Orcs are extremely against necrophagia.

    Second, human sacrifice has perverse incentives that war doesn't have. While Cat does sacrifice her soldiers, she's not happy to do it; all else being equal, she's always more likely to choose the path that leads to the least amount of her soldiers dying. As long as Cat cares about her soldiers, her incentive is to choose peace, or at least to choose the actions most likely to lead to peace on the long term.

    On the other hand, human sacrifice and treating people as commodities has the opposite incentive curve. Praesi nobles have no incentive to reduce crime, poverty and corruption, since they all produce the death row inmates their sacrifices need. Praesi even have strong incentives to engineer civil wars, since those lead to the massive amounts of prisoners and sacrifices that they need to keep their crops going.

    EDIT: Although, now that I think about it, Catherine does have perverse incentives herself, and the story hasn't talked about it yet. She started the civil war to get in a position of power. Every single time Heiress released demons, she won more power and loyalty from her followers. The Gallowborne wouldn't be nearly so loyal to her if she hadn't had Heiress to point them at.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      She's recognizing starting the war as a line that she crossed and doesn't want to cross again. Whether she'll hold that principle going forward or she'll seize all the power she can regardless of cost...
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        That's not what I meant by perverse incentives.

        The fact is, she didn't get as much power and popularity from the civil war as she did from fighting Heiress's demons. The fact is, if Heiress hadn't been around, most Callowans would still see her as a traitor.

        That means that in a way, she had an unspoken incentive to let Heiress get away with her mayhem while shaking a fist angrily at her, because the most carnage she causes, the more power Cat has.
        ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    There’s a very half-hearted attempt by Cat to respond to this in text where she acknowledges that she’s done awful things, will continue to do even worse things but she is drawing this arbitrary line anyway.

    Gaining benefits from the deaths of those already condemned to death by the state seems far and away a morally superior action to starting a war in order to gain power in the process. In any context human sacrifice is one of those things you feel the need to flinch away from and label in the BAD column without any real consideration but I expected a little more from this story which has shown its willingness to explore the utility of actions normally considered Evil.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Remember, there's a difference between "the story" and "the characters."
      ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      It seems sort of like a pre-meditated/heat of the moment distinction.  Plus, a little holdover of deontology.
      ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      Human sacrifice always goes into the BAD collumn, it's just that you have to sum the columns at the end and look at the result.
      ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      She knows it's wrong and does it anyway to achieve her goals.  She draws the line at saying "killing people to make myself more powerful is a perfectly normal and Good thing to do"
      ```

- u/None:
  ```

- u/leakycauldron:
  ```
  I suppose it makes sense that a Duke might have the power to challenge a King, it's part of the story, right? Discreet power inherent to specific ranks, but the ability to move upwards by force if necessary.
  ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  "There they go murdering again" was that a Rick and Morty reference?
  ```

  - u/Mingablo:
    ```
    I thought so. Or at least entertained the notion.
    ```
