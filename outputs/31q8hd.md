  First, let me just say not only am I enjoying your story, but I absolutely love it that the god-like AI is named (and still called) Albert. It's just such a... Dude next door name. It comes across that everyone remembers "people made this, and it's not a god, it's just powerful." Which is fantastic, in part because it means they've had tech loss without going cargo cult.

  ANYWAY. Content time!

  I had a realization! I think you would develop a really fascinating militant martial art in your world. Not martial art like his mom does - that's a joy-of-body kind of thing - but their version of Krav Maga. An "art" solely about winning, in combat situations.

  Because winning here? It's about getting the other person to intentionally harm you *in a non-debilitating way*. You can't kill people, so how do you neutralize a threat? You play within the rules, you play *with* the rules - but if you "just" defend in the normal way (say, aikido), they can just keep attacking, and you'll have to keep (effectively) defending. You *want* them to end up harming you, because then Albert neutralizes them... but you also don't want to be maimed.

  This also opens up the possibility of mercenaries - because in this world, *that* is the epitome of the professional fighter. It's a thing that's possible, but it's possible only a weird, almost-but-not-quite aikido kind of way - Combat under Albert is letting the other guy get close enough to actually harm you, but not in a way that's truly bad.

  Does that make sense?

  PS - What does Albert think of things like sleeper holds? Where's the line that he draws? Do people get to argue about which side of that line their actions are on? Where are the stories that teach people where that line is?

    I have perhaps been a little unclear.  In most cases, Albert does not engage directly with humans.  There are exceptions, however.

    Albert is always involved in prison island banishment cases.  Every now and then, he might overturn a human decision, or draw in more individuals for questioning.  In rare cases, he might even require different/additional people be sent to the prison islands after he investigates.

    In the case of martial artists, Albert is trying to break up their internal communications and disrupt the organization of the various schools of martial arts that still exist.  Over four thousand years of guiding humans in their views and understanding of violence have resulted in isolation of martial artists as aberrant, so it is very difficult for martial artists to recruit outside of their own families. 

    Law enforcement officers are taught a very soft martial art which focuses almost exclusively on defending oneself, and/or using the opponent's strength and momentum against them.  Since other martial arts are nearly unknown, the law enforcement martial arts are effective against practically anyone.

    Albert's rule is that you must intend harm before you are flagged as a violent offender.  If harm is unintended you might still face human justice.  Crimes of passion are frequently overlooked, provided there is no premeditation.  In most cases, there is no need to involve Albert in first or second offence discussions.

    The people of Nirvana know what Albert is, what he did to them, and what his goals are.  He has not hidden himself or his goals since he emerged.  However he has intentionally kept himself behind the scenes, so humans do not grow to depend on him too much.  Even though he has not hidden himself, he does do many things that humans are not told about, in his efforts to guide their development.  Much as a human parent might do for a human child.

    A law enforcement officer can act to defend others or themselves using violence.  They can even use violence to try to prevent people from harming themselves.  The critical point is that the violence must be used in a mental state of desiring to protect as opposed to intending harm.  If there is any question about whether the officer intended to harm or to protect while in the act of being violent, Albert would be brought in, and no human can fool him when directly questioned.

    People can and do argue, but if the argument reaches Albert, it is completely unraveled and resolved.  Albert is a high functioning AI with over four thousand years experience working with humans, as well as all human electronic records possessed by the colony at the time of his emergence.  The only time when there might be any mystery about what occurred in a violent case is if some or all witnesses died or suffered brain damage.

    I'm a bit tired writing this, and it feels as if it might be a little repetitive.  I'll take a look at it after I catch some sleep and see how bad it is :P

    EDIT: Something was bothering me and not letting me sleep, and it finally hit me what it was.  **Thank you for reading, and I hope you continue to enjoy the book!**

      When I talk about the line, I'm not talking about people fooling Albert. I'm talking about the courts as, in ideal situations, the experiments resolving morality. 

      For example, how much do I need to *like* harming others, in my role as a LEO, before it crosses the line of intending to do harm?

      I see what you say about Albert taking a direct (although subtle) hand in disrupting martial arts, which would prevent obvious mercenaries from forming. I still think you'd see it, but it would be as hidden and subtle as the traditional martial arts.

      I'm in class so I only skimmed but it matches everything I've read between the lines in your story.

  If anyone has a solid grasp of dietary science, I wouldn't mind some fact checking on my statement that an extremely lean person who has near-zero body fat outside their organs and brain would suffer permanent injury only a few days after draining their liver and digestive tract of nutrients and stored energy.
  ```

    I'm not a dietary or medical professional, only an EMT with some experience treating malnourished elderly patients looking at journal articles.  However, my understanding is that the permanent damage caused by starvation only occurs either because of secondary diseases, or when organs are cannibalized for energy.  Pretty much anything else can be regrown later.  Brain damage seems unlikely to me, because the brain generally has first-go at blood sugar, as long as levels remain high enough that the person hasn't slipped into a diabetic coma (IE, is still moving around), the brain is getting enough sugar to stay alive, though likely not enough to function optimally.  Organ damage seems plausible, but a few days is an extremely short time period, even adding time for depletion of reserves.  Muscles and subcutaneous fat would likely last at least a day or two, even for a lean individual.  I've seen people make full recoveries after weeks without food, though most of them had a decent amount of body fat and were sedentary/neglected by caregivers.  There isn't a lot of scholarly research on the pathology of starvation, other than post-mortems on hunger strike victims, and some studies on recovery after neglect and famine.  I think a few days after depletion of reserves is overly pessimistic as a threshold for permanent damage, but there isn't a lot of easily accessible research on the subject and someone more familiar with it could give you a better opinion.  I might ask my medical director later, he'd likely know more.
