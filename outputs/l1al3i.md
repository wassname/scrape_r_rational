## [Spoilers] In Animorphs: The Reckoning, why didn't they just...?

### Post:

>!Why didn't they just "resurrect" Elfangor? And Cassie, for that matter? Since they have learned how to use dying patients to morph into the "backup" bodies, why not just create an army of Elfangors?!<

  By the time they had figured out resurrection, I believe Cassie's morph had been lost.

  As for Elfangor...remember he was sent to earth to destroy it. An autonomous Elfangor wouldn't necessarily be on their side, and on top of that Aximili going crazy with solitude shows that it would have been risking an *insane* Elfangor.

  Plus, by the time Marco started his Marclone thing they had lost both morphs anyway.

    IIRC, they didn't lose Cassie's morph until they were resurrected, so it would have been available to them when they decided to try to get resurrected.  Maybe they just didn't want to have someone die on her account without asking her first.

      The survivors of V3's attack were Ax and Tom only.  Jake, Marco, Tobias, Garret, and Rachel all died and had to be resurrected.  Ax and Tom only realized resurrection was a possibility without the help of the Chee when Tobias (who Garret morphed into as he died) woke up on his own.

      Especially when Cassie died because she'd rather other people live, so she'd be the last person who would consent to being resurrected IMO.
      ```

- u/cae_jones:
  ```
  In the chapter where Jake first resurrects, they ask Elfangor about it, and he seems to suggest that he doesn't want to be resurrected, and that Crayak and Ellimist might even be strongly discouraging him from supporting that option

  Cassie, though, I don't know. Jake consulted MORPH!Cassie post Asteroid, and they had already discussed resurrections back when Jake first cheated death.
