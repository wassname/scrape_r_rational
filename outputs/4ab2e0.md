  The latest series of Finnemore's Souvenir Programme has some wonderful sketches: 

    - [She Sells Sea Shells by the Seashore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWRTlVzJFFY)  : Economics
    - [Pavlov's Dogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDwHh6Kn8gs) : It's munchkining if you squint really hard 
    - [You Are Not a Geek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thsRk9fuIdU) : Just for Fun
  ```

  Rationalfic as radio comedy! Somehow that makes it 100 times funnier. Thank you very much for sharing this.
