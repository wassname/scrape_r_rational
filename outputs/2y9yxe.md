  Best thing is to look at who ascended last round, in 48, and do something different. It's pretty simple: either aim to be the icon of a style, or make up your own. Patrick Eternity was basically the culmination of high fantasy. Baxter was taken even old and lame because he wrote the literature of our species. *Shadowsaurs* summed up czf. Etc.

  Try writing suburbian tribal slice-of-life. Your life'd be really interesting to those of us who grew up normally.
