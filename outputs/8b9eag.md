  I really don't care what Morey's up to.

  Guy in plot armor and tons of magic goes to a slave economy nation. I'm unfazed that this ended in slave revolts and a civil war, wooo.

  Edit// I highly doubt that this story is willing to go dark enough to make this story thread make sense, slavery in the real world was ended rather peacefully by britain, popluous upraisings on the other hand go extremely poorly, they are killing "aristocrats" sources of order and education so are there going to be mass stravation like the Soviet revolution? Will there be a reign of terror that collapses on itself like the french revolution?

  I don't see this writer doing either

    Well food prices are so low starvation will be minimized, and they've got the queens backing for setting up a functioning government, but yeah they're going to have no education and no idea how to function

    Morey has tried to limit the damage to the economy by focusing the sham trials on finding those who were abusive.  Most of the mid-level business owners who owned slaves, only had one; those guys didn't get killed.  Inequality in slave ownership is just as sharp as inequality in wealth.  

    That said, most of the government of Illastein and much of the law enforcement (who are also military here) did die.  The ISL military is trying to turn into law enforcement or go back to their lives.  Hence why the Inath Queen sent a whole bunch of bureaucrats to the country to help create a government.  

    RE economy and starvation:

    Previously, most of the territory were already farming villages and upwards of 3/4s of the population was in food or food related industries so with most of the revolting peasants returning to their farms, there is no threat of running out of food.  The villages are self-sufficient, the trading towns where the excess food is sold won't run out any time soon and cities tend to be surrounded by nearby villages (though the population fleeing the cities would have happened).  

    Do also remember that this planet has extremely mild seasons and thus crops can be planted at nearly any time.  At medieval tech levels, there's no way only 2/3s (this was the ratio in Minmay pre-Cato) of the population farming would have worked.  In general, food is a little easier to get here than on historical Earth.  Subject to water and soil of course, Illastein needs more farmers because it's a poor sandy soil and drier.  

    RE government and chaos:

    To a large extent, a republic is basically a dream of Morey's.  His reputation as ISL leader, and storybook Hero, means that any time he opens his mouth, he can overrule the entire government because the well-armed populace all listen to him.  The top is currently made of ISL faction leaders, who won't like it when he does that but they can't do anything.  It's basically a monarchy right now, with him at the top.  

    Morey is not happy about this.  

    The country won't stabilize for many years due to how bloody the revolution was and without Amarante's aid, would probably fragment into city states and ungoverned territory.  (Two cities already broke off to form their own countries)
