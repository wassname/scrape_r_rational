## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  With all the different magic systems in stories which are more or less plausible, do you think it is possible to invent a realistic one?

  I have only high-level knowledge about physics, but for everyone who has in depth knowledge and experience:

  Is it realistic that a team of physicists can come come up with a mathematical model for a magic system that is compatible with our physical model of the world. The magical model should allow for the common things you can do with magic - conjuring, altering of matter, wielding of '*energies*' like fire, electricity - and be applicable by humans.

  According to your experiences/model of how physics work, is it realistic to devise such a magical model? How many physicists would it approximately take to do it in 5, 10, 20 (take your pick) years? Are *ordinary* physicists who are good enough to do a PhD enough or would you need at least X numbers of geniuses?

  And what would the model need to entail?

  &#x200B;

  Edit & Example/Clarification:

  I am meaning an extension of the laws of nature in a ways that allows for actions where you would otherwise need technologies for that use a whole variety of physical laws and you need that technological piece (firearm, rocket, radio).

  But magic would be more like another form of 'energy', lets just call it *Magic* and some interacting force. And then you can enact this force in a certain way to transform Magic into kinetic energy to propel a projectile or transform it into an object (matter) like the aforementioned projectile, or transform the stone on the ground into the projectile...

  So magic is like the simplest physical shortcut to do everything you could do with physics. And you can perform it without technology. So there should be a mechanism which can naturally evolve. I also mentioned magical technology, but that was just, if doesn't make sense to be used by lifeforms this easily. Best just forget about it. If not, it was meant to go into the directions of wands, so where Harry Potter has wands, Star Wars has Midi-chlorians. I just cut it from the original text, otherwise it leads the discussion in a totally unintended direction.

  This is the very high-level version of how I imagine *real magic* would work like.

  If it uses our laws of nature it is technology/chemistry..., if it uses the shortcut *Magic*, it is magic. Maybe Magic also allows for otherwise impossible things, but that would depend on the possibilities of making it compatible with all existing laws.

  &#x200B;

  Abstract different example: The given laws of nature are like the game mechanic in a computer game, like how you normally play the game. Magic is more like the cheat codes you could use.

    Define realistic.

    If you want genuine "this would actually work in the real world" type of 'magic', you could write a story about an ex-machine shop worker who has become a chemical engineering major with minors in electrical engineering and materials science who then gets transported to the Roman Republic circa 220 BC, before the second Punic War. This creates opportunities for a ton of practical 'magic':

    * **Gunpowder firearms - 'Magic staves':** The sulfur-free gunpowder recipe would be relatively trivial to produce in large quantities using just urine and potash for a niter bed to get potassium nitrate ('saltpeter'), which would be combined with charcoal. Instead of making primers or using a matchlock and powder pan, several small nickle-iron or lead-acid batteries could be connected in sequence to a wire inlaid inside the firing chamber, with a narrow gap in the middle, creating a high voltage spark when the trigger is pulled. Paper cartridges which have been soaked in saltpeter should ignite readily, and should work well in a breach-loader or revolver-type designs. With a high caliber, this could be used to take down elephants when Hannibal shows up, or break through Roman shield walls if the protagonist works with Hannibal instead.

    * **Rockets - 'Fireballs'**: Gunpowder rockets could be made which carry large steel-encased gunpowder charges as the payload; basically large pipe bombs. Bundles of these could be loaded onto a wagon and fired in series like a Katyusha rocket launcher, devastating enemy formations. Alternatively, the rockets could carry narrow-tipped bottles filled with flammable liquid like distilled alcohol, with lit fuel-soaked rags protruding from the ends. Basically, rocket-propelled Molotov cocktails which could be fired into enemy formations or lobbed over walls.

    * **Radios - 'Wind whisperers'**: Simple radios could be made with copper wire as an antenna, a quartz crystal as an oscillator, a glass or ceramic vacuum tube as an amplifier, a nickle-iron or lead-acid battery as the power source, and a copper wire coil and magnetized iron as an electromagnet to create a 'click' sound when a signal is received. Morse code could be used to transmit and receive messages over distances of a mile or two. Parabolic dishes raised on towers could be used to extend the communication range, and could also be easily made into signal repeaters to allow a message to travel across the Roman empire instantaneously, day or night, using technology that enemy forces would be unable to intercept. Hot air balloons could be lofted in a battle to create mobile repeater towers with excellent range.

    Some stories I’ve seen have used either nanotechnology or simulated reality as the source of their magic. Not going to mention which, it’s a spoiler.

    Nanotechnology could possibly do a lot of things that seem like magic, especially if you allow there to be nanobots spread out everywhere in a world, including the air. The nanobots could do voice recognition for spells, although the spell effects would probably be somewhat limited. Visual effects would be relatively simple, and therefore so would divination spells and prestidigitation effects. A summoning ritual for a creature would be possible, I’d just expect it to take a very long time unless you have a source of solid nanobots (or if the whole world is made of nanobots...).

    The crux of this is assuming that nanobot-based metamaterials and self-replicating nanobots are feasible and powerful enough to do all that, which they very well may not be.

    The theoretical foundations of a nanobot system to create magic probably won’t be created within this century, so it’s hard to say how soon it could. Given that it would have to be a world spanning effect with enormous amounts of nanobots that all need to be powered, it would also take a lot of time to make a reality. Overall I think it’d take a few centuries.

The magical model should allow for the common things you can do with magic - conjuring, altering of matter, wielding of 'energies' like fire, electricity - and be applicable by humans.

    You run into two really big problems here.

    1. Scientists have observed an awful lot of the possible physical conditions out there without finding any magic. There will always be gaps where nobody has observed this particular strange configuration of matter/energy, but they're conceptually small and we don't have any reason to expect anything but what our models predict, especially on human-scale phenomena.

    2. Even if some particular strange configuration of matter/energy does something wildly unexpected and novel that breaks physics as we know it, the chances that it breaks physics in a way we'd identify as magic are tiny. Our conception of magic is human-specific or at least mind-specific (it involves intent), so for something to be magical it has to specifically interact with a specific complex phenomena in a very specific way.

    Honestly I think your best bet for physicists unlocking human-applicable magic is that they find the universe's debug menu.

    The best way I can think of to find a debug menu from the inside is to notice unexpected lag when you trigger whatever subroutine checks whether you're supposed to be activating the menu. So physicists find some unusual situation where there's a tiny bit of delay in a physical phenomena, they start experimenting with trying to maximize the delay, the trigger to make a bigger delay keeps being more and more specific, eventually they brute force their way to signing the admin password in cesium atoms, and it turns out that anyone who does that gets debug access.
    ```

  - u/AlmostNeither:
    ```
    If you're actually looking to tell a story about people applying the techniques of modern physics to investigate magic, then you have to have a pretty specific and detailed ideas of what the magic is like.  After all, when we develop mathematical models, they are in fact models that attempt to describe observed phenomena and predict future ones.  So the time/effort required to produce a model is gonna be shaped almost entirely by what sort of magical phenomena are being observed/explained.

    This seems like a lot of legwork which may not get to the payoff you're looking for, since that level of detail isn't likely to be directly relevant or apparent in any story.

    It's also true that whenever something completely novel is discovered, we rarely are so well equipped that we can jump to systematizing our understanding and testing it immediately.  We're often barely equipped to begin making measurements and scrambling to build the tools to take better measurements, if we even know what we should be trying to measure.

    There's often a long period of non-specialists poking and prodding it, and scientific publications of the form: "Uh, we saw this weird thing that doesn't make sense, here's all the stuff we did to try to make sure it wasn't one of these other things we already understand, here's a bunch of other stuff we tried that totally didn't work or did absolutely nothing, and here's some things we didn't have funding to try but we think it'd be a good idea." It takes a lot of this before we have enough data/equipment/institutional expertise to put together models that have predictive/explanatory power.  Though, granted, we've gotten better and faster at this stage of the process, especially with the assistance of computers.

    Anyway, how time/expertise/resource intensive all this is will depend on pretty fine details that are not encapsulated in "it should look like standard fantasy-novel-magic from the outside when we're done".  Those details are unlikely to be front and center, so you should just try to choose and justify an answer that will serve your story.

  Given a SciFi setting where:

  - by and large, the only technology available is relatively straightforward of our own technologies (so: fission/fusion for power, for example, and no SciFantasy shields)
  - there exist extremely cheap sublight drives of alien origin that give near-perfectly-efficient conversion of power to reactionless delta-V up to .1c [edit: in the reference frame of the local star/s]
  - there is no FTL and this is set in a multi-sun solar system with multiple inhabited planets at typical astronomical distances, each of which is a separate (or many separate) political polities

  How does conflict actually look? MAD is obvious (any ship can set up a world-ending strike, so nobody sets up world-ending strikes), but kinetic weapons seem basically useless against any non-fixed target and you'd probably get raider ships that are low-mass super-high-energy-generation that try to close and board?
  ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Including a reactionless drive in this scenario is unnecessary and a bad idea because it violates physics, and if you're including near future tech and assuming some level of space development *then it's %100 unnecessary*.

    Most of what you want to know has been though about in great detail and talked about by futurist Isaac Arthur whose videos are great and well researched (my only quibble with him is that I think he underestimates AGI in some ways) and [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIIOUpOge0LuFZG2lvL9-zbxovZabYxcy) on near term human space development will be of great interest for you. [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIIOUpOge0LvpLdGIp4xCyCVZEEUQ1Udn) on futurist weapons is also worthwhile, particularly the videos "Space Warfare" and "Interplanetary Warfare". 

    Once you've got the staggering abundance of energy and resource that comes from fusion and functioning space infrastructure and industry things become pretty post scarcity for one. You can also expect that a large portion of the population will live in satellites in orbit around a populated planet or on [cyclers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycler) between planets. This is because the resource abundance and slightly better automation means anyone may well be able to afford to buy/build a rotating O'Neil cylinder with many square miles of living space to live like a king.

    You don't even need fusion in this scenario to have abundant energy and interstellar travel, because once you have dumb automated drones mining a planet like [mercury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4aXmnQzJ0o&list=PLIIOUpOge0LsIzYlIAIRdAGJTqAW6FmCE&index=11) and manufacturing+launching satellites and [statites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statite) you can quickly begin to benefit from exponential growth in the construction of an early crude Dyson swarm. A crude Dyson swarm is extremely versatile you can:     

    * Generate powerful stellasers to accelerate relativistic craft to other systems (these craft either only carry fuel to decelerate, or you can use a series of probes which each capture solar energy as it passes by very close to the star and beams it to the probe behind it, until the line of probes slows down enough to stay in the system). Either way you'd probably then have the probes begin constructing a Dyson swarm in the new system so that you can complete an interstellar laser highway between the two systems allowing cheap relativistic travel (this also has the advantage that you can concentrate resources on clearing away space debris only along a *relatively* narrow route).

    * You can also easily collect power from the thin foil statite mirrors in a number of ways, or just bounce the light from them off more distant foil satellites and onto a target (so your space stations can receive full sunlight anywhere in the system). Once you've collected power it can easily be transmitted across the system with lasers, with masers being ideal because they can penetrate the atmosphere and deliver power to simple ground-based collectors.

    * Within a system the network of statites and satellite could allow cheap travel and reduce the need for rockets. However in this scenario rockets would also be much cheaper from the energy, resource abundance and more automated manufacturing. 

    * With such abundant energy one can deploy massive numbers of statites/satellites with powerful electromagnets around your star(s). This allows you to manipulate your stars magnetic field in control the solar wind, preventing (or causing) solar storms and letting you protect the whole system from the radiation of the solar wind. By magnetically directing all of the star's charged solar wind out of the poles you can also collect it *[for energy and resources which dwarf the systems non-star matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzuHxL5FD5U)*.

    Conflict under the scenario is firstly not going to be like most sci-fi, because the massive abundance created by space industry would greatly discourage warfare. As the economic cost of war with *any* other space-developed nation would never be worth any financial upside. Resources in space are simply so abundant that fighting over any particular asteroid doesn't make sense:    
    While stealth in space is possible within very limited contexts any large military offensive would necessarily be obvious for at least hours in advance if not far longer allowing for a devastating counteroffensive. Ignoring fusion engines (because they're all too speculative to properly assess here) for spacecraft such as military craft which want to be independent of the mirror network (so they needn't be low mass with giant sails) [nuclear saltwater rockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvZjhWE-3zM) are likely to be the preferred choice. As they have much higher specific impulse and delta v than chemical rockets and the radioactive plasma they produce spreads out quickly and isn't a concern in space.       
    The equivalent to MAD in this scenario is probably going to be based around lasers just because of their speed. With nations entering into a space race as result of the obvious financial and military benefits of having an exponentially growing network of space infrastructure using crude self replicating machines. Massive stellaser attacks while devastating aren't likely to be an existential threat though especially with people spread out beyond planets, so while any war would be economically catastrophic people at this point nothing is liable to prevent K2 civilization(s) from arising.

  Not totally sure if this should go here, or if I should take it elsewhere, but I wanted y'all's thoughts on a magic system I'm working on.

  I am creating a work of speculative fiction focusing on worldview and bias, where I am looking to use the magic system of the setting to literally represent the ways that people and society interpret the world. **Within this system, there would be three things that influence any part of interpreted reality: the personal perspective and beliefs of the individual viewing things, the general consensus of agreed upon beliefs and reality of the community or society, and the wishy-washy subjective sort-if reality that seems to exist beyond.** Each of these comes together to produce a similar yet individualized interpretation of reality for each person, massive on it's changes at a large scale, but still close to our own idea of humanity and reality at a small one - which will let me use elements of the magic to literally represent things like unspoken rules, conflicts of belief, and so on.

  The problem I run into, however, is how to balance self, society, and world without one overriding the others, or one being lost. I don't want everything to be defined by the individual, as then there is no consistency when moving between perspectives and I am unable to talk about how much of bias is inherited or societal. If I focus on the societal, with individual power being fairly weak but the consensus of a society changing the world, then the individual begins to lose agency, and I can't talk about of individuals are what make up that society. If I say that there is an objective reality that people are misinterpreting, then that invalidates the experiences and understanding people have of the world.

  To condense the problem, I want to create a system through which to use magic to literally talk about worldview in a systemic manner as so for the reader to be able to understand the bias in context and use the system themselves to figure out how other characters or themselves might use 'magic'. I also want the character's in universe to be aware (or at least some of them) of how their bias can alter how they see things, and be able to actively work to change it. To do that, I need to have a sold way through which power is exchanged and reality is determined. However, the more I systemize worldview, the more I have to reduce it to baser components, reducing the individuality and complexity.

  **What can I do in my magic system to balance the influences of the self, society, and world? How can I make the magic an actual system, without reducing the topics it focuses on? Are there examples of rules or limitations I could put in place that still preserve the core idea? Or is finding a balance here not possible due to conflicting goals, and if so, what might my options be for changing it?**

  &#x200B;

  Examples of things I would be interested to include:

  * A school with intensely divided cliques. To the students in the school, there are literal lines in the ground between groups, that shift and move but cannot be crossed without a important reason. A new student with no understanding of these lines arrives at the school and, unknowing of the divisions, literally crosses lines they didn't know were there. As a result of this, you both have the new student begin to see the lines over time, as they realize there is something there that exists for others, but also you have the others idea of the objectivity of these lines challenged, and start to chip.
  * A boxer is training for a match. They believe in their ability, believe that if they train, if they put in the work, it will have results. This comes, in part, from a society that also believes in this. This combines with the pseudo-physical nature of reality, and actually does help the boxer improve. However, the boxer enters a match with a champion renowned for their great strength - who in part has gained that strength because of that general belief. In the fight, you would have The boxer's own belief in the work they put in, the local crowd's belief in the strength and 'obvious' victory of the champion, the general societal bias towards an underdog story, and the physical nature of the fighters bodies, all at work to determine the outcome.
  * A society has a shared understanding in the existence of ghosts. When someone dies, a immaterial visage of them will remain, slowly fading until the original person fades from the memories of all those living, when it will fully dissipate. A resident of local are moved here a few years back, and instead comes from a community that believe that there is no soul, and you are nothing after you die, but they don't let this difference of belief stop them from getting involved in this new community. Then an accident happens, the newcomer dies, and they create a ghost. At the funeral, and argument breaks out between the local friends and the family of the newcomer, on if the ghost is actually the newcomer, or instead the community's shared interpretation of them.
  * A city where talking is often overlapped with a direct sharing of feelings and experiences telekinetically. Here, the government, rather than being run by people directly, is run by an All-Mind composed of the interlinked consensus of every mind in the city, along with a council of representative officials. For the citizens, they know that their thoughts and interests have a part to play in politics and tend to believe they have an impact, however small, but also tend to consider themselves disconnected from the process themselves, due to it being largely subconscious. A new bill is proposed, focused on the limitation of a new mindsharing device, and the All-Mind is unable to decide, revealing the community is split on the issue, resulting in more person to person debate.

  &#x200B;

  Also, if you have any questions about elements of the world, or thoughts on things that might exist in such a setting, please do ask. A lot of this is still in the early stages, and most any help is welcome :).

    In my opinion, making up a system for personal enjoyment and making one for a story are two completely different things. This is something people often miss, they look at the worldbuilding in a popular work and think that it could be better, that it's too simple or handwavey. The problem is that one **cannot frontload complexity in fiction.** Anything made up to go into a story has to be simple to understand, especially when first introduced. Complexity, intricacy, exploitability, these all have to be emergent aspects, gradually revealed; the system must make overall sense without the reader understanding it granularly. Why? 

    Because you're writing a story, not a worldbuilding bible. Even on dedicated worldbuilding forums or thread(hi mom) where all involved are of a subset people that are specifically interested in the subject, it's still difficult to get someone to actually read my dry as fuck musings on make-believe metaphysics. That should tell you something. 

    So my advice, for what it's worth, is to view all aspects of worldbuilding that will be delved into as being part of plot or a character's arc. Not just character, character arc. An simple example would be how Rowling writes about Harry being a parselmouth. Revealing that he can speak to snakes when he first does it(book 1 chapter 2) , describing the mechanics of it, saying that he would become a social pariah, that would not be very engaging for the audience, as all untethered exposition is basically homework. What Rowling does instead is have Harry reveal it *when it's relevant*. He does it inadvertently and *in public*, and then rowling show the immediate consequences, as well as knock-on effects, where suddenly he's a suspect for the Heir of Slytherin, he's isolated from his classmates, and so on and so on. Instead of just being copy-pasted from the writer's worldbuilding document ##cough##the-entirety-of-litrpg ##cough##, that aspect of the magic system is used to advance the entire trinity of storytelling: character, plot, and setting, and that's way better. 

    Or so I believe, anyway. To put it into words, my philosophy is that properly done, worldbuilding can be an integral part of character, plot or setting, rather than just setting as most people seem to believe.
    ```

      I would definitely agree. Worldbuilding, is best used to push forward elements of character, theme, or intention of the creator. It's something I keep in mind while writing, but I think a little context might be of help as to why this mindset specifically is a part of what I am doing in my questions above. 

      To begin with, the project I am working from has combined analytical, worldbuilding, and writing elements, for an ultimately academic purpose. To your point on the product, it \*will\* be containing a worldbible, alongside a series of short stories from a series of perspectives, and a research paper based on survey data I have been conducting alongside this project.

      I would add on to you points, by saying that worldbuilding should not just/only emphasize character arc, but be a means through which the writer brings into play the themes and intentions of their work. Especially in a collection of short stories/fiction from many perspective like I am doing, that secondary meaning often become prominently important.

      The reason I ask these questions now, and am looking to solve this complexity, is not because I want to explain it all to the readers at once, but because I want a solid system for I as a writer to use, which will allow for the elements from story to story to be consistent in a manner that readers can pick up on. I won't be saying "well let me tell you why perspective matters", but I will be having characters who share experiences or mindsets that I want to literally show through their magically altered perspective of the world. The point of the system is not to explain, but to make it so that when I do show things, it's not me as the writer making things up on the spot, but a part of a pre-existing framework that can be understood through observation, examples, and context. Going off of your Harry Potter example above, while Rowling does often introduce concepts in way that promotes the narrative, they also often feel inconsistent, or need to be explained after the fact.

      The main reason I am using worldbuilding here, is because I specifically have certain themes and views that I want to literally represent in ways that can be talked about, and I am using worldbuilding to develop a setting that facilitates that. To give an example of something similar, in Wildbow's Worm, the superpowers in some ways serve as a literal metaphor for the perpetuation of someone's trauma. A person will go through a traumatic trigger event, and that event will shape what they can do and how they think about it, often leading them back to the situations that caused the event to begin with. By making this process a literal story element, you gain the ability to address the subject in your text in a way that even those without the experience can understand, and apply to situations beyond the text. And as you said, the idea of powers is introduced first, with the actual mechanics of how people get powers slowly revealed later, but by having the system made to begin with, that reveal is one the readers could have come to on their own, and remains consistent across the whole of the text.

      The problem, as I said in my initial post, is that to make a system that supports the themes and stories I want to tell with any consistency, would also mean in some ways reducing those things it represents. And yet if I approach each character on their own, I lessen my ability to talk about themes of interconnection, and the work as a whole. 

      Does that clarify at all? I'm not trying to disregard the suggestion, just that it's something I was already taking into consideration.
      ```
