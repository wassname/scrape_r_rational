## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Interesting article about psychologyâ€™s replication crisis.

    Just learned? Hasn't that been common knowledge for years?

      I, for one, had never heard of it. Thanks u/vallar57 for sharing this.

  Is there a list of preexisting probabilities in day-to-day (or at least frequently occurring) matters? I want to get back to making predictions, and I think it'd be easier if I could say to myself, "Well, [x] is generally judged to happen 80% of the time, and [y] 90% of the time, and I think that [z] is is more likely to occur to than [x] but not quite as likely as [y], so let's say 85%." 

  An alternative method would be to make a lot of tiny predictions in my own life and generate a pool that way, but it'd be simpler to get back into this project if I didn't have a lot of minutia to work through first.

    https://www.metaculus.com is one way to do it.
