## Monthly Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the monthly thread for recommendations. I will post this on the 5th of every month. This thread does not
supersede any other recommendation thread that any other user may create of his own volition.  

Please feel free to recommend, whether rational or not, any books, movies, tv shows, anime, video games, fanfiction,
blog posts, podcasts or anything else that you think members of this subreddit would enjoy. Also please consider adding a few lines
with the reasons for your recommendation. 

This being the [first thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3quhyp/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cwij347) of its kind,
I completely understand if no one else wants it to be a regular feature and will cease posting if a sufficient
number of people say so. Subject to mod approval, and if this thread does well, I'd love it if this could become a monthly
or biweekly feature.

    [Story-only thread is here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-games-we-play-rwby-the-gamer-ryuugi.351105/), if (like me) you want to cut out the cruft that sometimes comes with space battles. (I've been reading this as well.)

      Note that the story-only thread lags a week or so behind the main thread.

      There's also an official [fanfiction.net mirror](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10571622/1/The-Games-We-Play), but it's only got about a quarter of the story.

    I like it, but I have to admit that I've started reading it more than once now and I've always gotten exhausted by the story and stopped. Only picking it up again half a year later to then kind of lapse again after a couple dozen chapters.

    It is *very* action-filled. Overly so in my opinion. Most action scenes should by shortened by half and I wouldn't complain if they were cut down to 1/4 the length they are now. Exposition and grinding scenes are also too long in my opinion. This is one of those fanfics that would really benefit from an editor going through it and cutting out half or more.

    Still, if sheer length does not bother you, it's pretty great. I'm probably going to pick up reading again in the near future and see how far I'll get this time.

        Read "Here be Dragons" then - it's a worm fic, and one of the two stories Ryuugi has actually completed.

        Premise:  Taylor triggers with Lung's power, and 95% of the story is a single fight scene that starts about two months later.

    I've been reading it but recently I've had trouble caring about what happens.

    The worldbuilding is superb and the characters are written well enough. It's just that the plot itself seems like it's not going anywhere.

    The antagonist is... well, to quote someone from higher up in the thread:

    "It's a very post-Watchmen show, where characters are not defined by their superpowers, and their problems do not come in convenient punchable-monster packages."

    This is the opposite of that. Malkuth is the very DEFINITION of 'all the problems in this story come in a conveniently punchable monster package'.

    All the problems the protagonist has stem from Malkuth and can be trivially solved if Malkuth is removed from the equation, and as a result all the glorious worldbuilding and rationality is directed pretty much only at that one goal. The protagonist HAS no issues they NEED to face because of the nature of their existence, so all the smartness is directed at external rather than internal issues.

    And even that wouldn't be so bad if Jaune NEEDED anybody else for anything, ever. Again, by virtue of his nature, he can do ANYTHING better than anybody else could. 

    Ryuugi has spent entire chapters on acknowledging and addressing these issues from Jaune's perspective, and even so it still isn't enough. Jaune has no equals save Malkuth, and that's a BIG problem from a narrative perspective.

    Anyways, that's my two cents on it. Still worth a read, but don't anticipate a story that's good on every count. TGWP is a good reference for 'how to worldbuild a sophisticated setting', but that's about it, in my opinion.
    ```

    - u/GeeJo:
      ```
      It's part of the reason that I'm more hopeful about the planned *The Lies We Tell* sequel, which is shaping up to be more of a Cold War between Malkuth and Jaune. Following the proxies and side characters to get a more human perspective on what's going on in the setting will probably help curtail the rampiness of a story that includes the Gamer power.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I stopped caring about the next set of bullshit power that Jaune pulled out.

    Then, I stopped caring about the escalation, where each new villain is more bullshit than the other.

    So, I don't read TGWP anymore.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I think the author is running a long-running experiment in serial escalation. I'm enjoying it so far, but its true you can only read about how this new attack/defense/skill is even more hilariously metaphysically superior to the last variation before it gets a bit tiresome. 

      I think Jaune's  new skills have been continually interesting, especially the flavor text and the metaphysical implications of them, but his enemies, especially the most recent one (starts with a G, I'd rather not spoil too much), are not as interesting as previous 'minibosses'.

  [*Liar Game*](http://myanimelist.net/manga/1649/Liar_Game) is a manga about game theory, deception, and individual and crowd psychology. It's very shounen about non-shounen subject matter such as auction poker and 24-shot Russian roulette.

  The Watson character with a trusting heart is given a hundred million yen in a box and told to trick someone out of their box, as the other tries to trick her out of hers. Her target tricks her in a heartbeat and she's left a hundred million yen in (completely illegal) debt. She goes to a famed con artist who is being released, the didactic Holmes character, and pleads with him to save her. They have many fun adventures trying to get to the top of the Liar Game.

  The ending is not satisfactory compared to the rest of the story, but the rest of the story is worth it. Fukunaga is top trap.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    While they never explicitly spell it out, I really like that the Watson wins many game through the power of [](#s "credible precommitments"), a rare currency in game theory. No-one less *transparently, obliviously* idealistic could pull it off. 

    Which makes up for a lot of the annoyance of having to follow a main character so *transparently, obliviously* idealistic (and frequent idiot-ball carrier).

  TV Show:  
  *Boardwalk Empire*    
  I have never seen this show being discussed on reddit and I can't figure out why. It features a Prohibition era setting loaded with period detail. Super violent and grey morals, in typical HBO fashion. Produced by Martin Scorsese and written by Terence Winter, the same combo that made the excellent *The Wolf of Wall Street*

  Book:  
  *Roadside Picnic* by Arkady Strugatsky  
  Great sci-fi which has inspired video games and even a movie from Tarkovsky. The book perfectly captures one of my favorite
  themes, how, compared to the rest of the universe, irrelevant humanity is.

  [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning) is a web serial about a mage trapped in a time loop. The main character isn't a complete optimizer, but he's pretty solid, and it's a hard fantasy with coherent rules.

  Brandon Sanderson writes some excellent hard fantasy as well. If you're not familiar with his work, I recommend [Perfect State](http://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Kindle-Single-Brandon-Sanderson-ebook/dp/B00UZSTXL4/) or [The Emperor's Soul](http://www.amazon.com/Emperors-Soul-Hugo-Award-Winner/dp/1616960922/) as good short-length introductions to his work.

  Rokka no Yuusha is an excellent hard fantasy anime/light novel series. Each arc is basically a self-contained, solvable mystery.

  Log Horizon is a solid "trapped in a MMO" style of anime/light novel series with a decent optimizer protagonist. Season 1 is much stronger than Season 2, imo, and he misses some clear game breakers, but I still consider it the pinnacle of the genre.

        It'd basically be spam. A recommendation thread essentially sorts for the best of the best, stuff that is good enough that people have heard of it and want you to have heard of it. This gives you information on how good they are.

        Self-recs sort for whatever writers happen to be online at the minute and want more readers. The only information you get from that is 'this story exists', which is less useful. As reader I'd much prefer to get only the former type of information. As a writer, I can just post stuff in the rest of the subreddit like normal.

      - u/Magodo:

        I'm going to risk sounding like a massive prick here, but if you need to self-promote something, it's not yet worth recommending.

          I don't think this is true.  Anyway, people are allowed to make posts to the subreddit linking to things they've written.  Do you think that also shouldn't be allowed?  If not, why should this thread be different?

            Why isn't it true?  

            I can't exactly stop other people from creating their own post. It's just not allowed here. For reasons already mentioned.

              Well, a demonstration is that there are many "self-promoting" posts with plenty of upvotes.  This means that people are happy that the posts exist, if not directly proving them to be "worth recommending".  Generally, I think you have to do some amount of self-promotion when you start writing, or you won't have any audience at all (and thus nobody to do the recommending for you).

  Jessica Jones!

  There is a moment in the series where some of the main characters wonder how they could utilise the villains powers for good, which is never fully explored in the series, but which would make excellent fanfiction.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Characters are frequently irrational (as in "I pick up the idiot ball", not "I am a damaged person who makes credibly bad decisions" - though there's plenty of that too), which gets pretty infuriating around the end of the season.

    I still enjoyed it a lot though. 

    It's a very post-Watchmen show, where characters are not defined by their superpowers, and their problems do not come in convenient punchable-monster packages.

  Some books:

  * *Time Braid* ([fanfiction of *Naruto*; free](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)): Sakura is trapped in a time loop, and gradually becomes more powerful to defeat an enemy who's trapped in a similar loop. Definitely my favorite book of all time--I've read it on six separate occasions since discovering it shortly before its completion in 2011. Previously discussed [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/28n846/rt_naruto_time_braid_groundhog_day_fanfiction/).

  * *Background Pony* ([fanfiction of *Friendship Is Magic*; free](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198)): Lyra Heartstrings has been cursed by Nightmare Moon to be forgotten, within minutes or hours, by all who see her. She searches for a way to break the curse, while starving for companionship. Quite tear-jerking--I've read it only twice.

  * *The Three Musketeers* ([original fiction; free](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1257)): A young Frenchman from the countryside goes to Paris to become a Musketeer in the service of King Louis XIII. Wonderful swashbuckling action (and humor!)--I've read it four times. (There are several sequels, but Project Gutenberg's free translations of them \[[1](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1259) [2](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2609) [3](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2681) [4](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2710) [5](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2759)\] aren't the best, unfortunately, and they aren't quite as interesting as the first book in any event--I've read the first sequel twice, and the others only once.)

  * *Sailor Nothing* ([original fiction; free](http://stefangagne.com/sailornothing)): A maybe-rational [magical-girl](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl) story. Previously discussed [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/37k3vf/dcrt_sailor_nothing_same_author_as_floating_point/).

  * *Atlas Shrugged* ([original fiction; not free](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662)): Unproductive people line their own pockets with the work of productive people. When the productive people start to disappear mysteriously, the country slowly crumbles into a tear-jerking apocalypse... (Even if you don't agree with the author's views [I don't], you can always just assume that it's set in an alternate universe where they're correct.)

  Some television series:

  * *Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals* ([anime; free](http://www.hulu.com/naruto-spin-off-rock-lee-and-his-ninja-pals)): This is a ludicrously-comedic spin-off of *Naruto: Shippuuden*, based on a manga not written/drawn by Kishimoto. Rock Lee is the protagonist, Tenten is the "straight man", and Neji is generally the butt of jokes. It's probably the funniest show I've ever watched--beyond even *The Three Stooges* and *Laurel and Hardy*. I haven't yet bothered to re-watch it, though.

  * *Mobile Fighter G Gundam* ([anime; not free](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MobileFighterGGundam)): Domon Kasshu is the young martial artist chosen to represent the space colony of Neo-Japan in the annual Gundam Fight tournament that decides which space colony will rule Earth for the next year. He also has a secret mission--to find the experimental Devil Gundam that has fallen to Earth, before it awakens... See also *Gundam Build Fighters* ([free for now, but maybe not in the future](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV1h9xQ7Hx-0WipavLDd3mFSLJL1r2XQ)--*G Gundam* used to be on this official Gundam channel, but was removed), which is a more recent show that runs along similar lines. *[Build Fighters Try](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV1h9xQ7Hx9RWqvcTplORDorYTHsWnEp)* isn't as good, unfortunately.

    If you enjoy The Three Musketeers, I recommend checking out Steven Brust's The Phoenix Guard (and sequels). The style of these books is very unique and I don't recommend buying them all before you've at least started the first - it's very much a divisive style of writing, and you may be best served by getting The Phoenix Guards from a library or something. Some people hate the style, I personally love it. 

    Nonetheless, Brust's five book series starting with The Phoenix Guards, continued in Five Hundred Years After, and then finished in the Viscount of Adrilankha Trilogy, is a wonderful homage to Dumas' work, within a neatly detailed fantasy universe. It's sort of "The Three Musketeers as Elves in a Fantasy World", but that doesn't really do the books justice.

      > Wait, hold on, I thought you were a sociopath.

      But it's so horribly, disgustingly *wasteful!* How *absolutely ridiculous* is it for tons upon tons of Minnesota grain to rot, causing widespread famine and riots, because corrupt politicians want to use the grain cars to transport fruit from California? It's as if these people are rage-quitting a game of  *~~Europa Universalis 4~~* *Victoria 2* by destroying the country intentionally! Who would be dumb enough to do that on purpose?! Watching idiots destroy the USA in *Atlas Shrugged* was as nausea-inducing and heart-rending as seeing `dice` used as a singular pronoun in *The Waves Arisen*.

      In any event, please remember that, though [I've *been called* sociopathic by several people](http://i.imgur.com/VCZSnwZ.png) ([including you](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3o3wv0/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cvuh4tk?context=9)), I certainly haven't been *officially diagnosed*--and have never, I think, represented myself in that light.

          But what reasons for disliking Lyra or Dagny could I even have? I could scold Lyra for wasting time in helping random townsfolk when she should be researching her curse, *maybe*--but that's a very mild aspersion.

              Liar Game's (and Fleep's) "intelligent" characters cross a line. They no longer feel like geniuses, but instead like mouthpieces of a reasonably smart author who has no time limit and full access to pen and paper and to the internet. I wouldn't be awed by them in real life because they wouldn't *exist* in real life. For all that Light Yagami may be dumber, as a character he does a better job of displaying intelligence.

              (I'm glad that the field of rationalfics is growing, as it often offers the best of both worlds.)

              - u/Transfuturist:
                ```
                I feel the exact opposite. Death Note's gambits *would not work* in real life. I find Liar Game much more plausible. If by mouthpieces you mean that they talk a lot, yeah, they kind of have to so the reader will understand what's going on. Death Note was the same way. Otherwise I'm not sure what you're talking about.

                Fleep *is* just some math problems in graphic novel format, but Demon is much less reliant on numerical trivia. I think. I don't remember exactly how he decided on the semen shiv. But I hope that just the words "semen shiv" will convince you that Demon is a worthwhile read.

                  Just putting this here for anyone who might want to read [Demon](http://www.shigabooks.com/?page=001):

                  * It's pretty gory for a cartoon-like art style and the fact that everything is in a cartoon style is the only thing saving the comic from being too disgusting to read. Instead of being creeped out, I just go okay, it's supposed to be a gross scene here.

                  * I don't actually care about Jason himself, because he's so incredibly sociopathic and the author prefers to draw about what Jason is doing to make use of his abilities rather than spend anytime on his developing psychology to make it either more interesting to read about Jason himself or to develop reader sympathy for him. As a result, I couldn't care less if Jason dies and if the story switched to another character. The comic's only saved by the fact that the real-life puzzles Jason solves are so interesting to guess at and read about, which all requires Jason to be a mass-murdering sociopath.

                  The above points aren't meant to be a list of good or bad points, but rather the way this webcomic is so uniquely different from anything else I've read before.

                  Also, as a warning, don't try to look up any information about the webcomic. It's because the story involves slow revealing fundamental rules behind the world as part of it's puzzling theme and knowing anything will ruin the experience if you want to try to figure out things. The summary on TV Tropes doesn't reveal too much, but it ruins the the very first puzzle in the story which is the hardest and most interesting puzzle IMHO.

                  Not that. It's difficult to express. Second try, apologies for the rambling:

                  The characters are seemingly able to keep track of an unlimited amount of numbers and payoff charts in their heads, and can instantly jump to the conclusion of a multi-step argument that I have to read twice (and slowly). Yet they don't explore more than one or two possibilities, usually go for the first viable idea they can come up with without probing it for flaws, take ages to figure out a simple deception, and throw good money after bad until they're broke. They will outsmart and out-outsmart and out-out-outsmart each other like racers on a track, with plans remaining perfectly predictable from the start even after so many levels of meta.

                  This is what it looks like (I feel) when an author comes up with a problem, works at it a bit with pen and paper, comes up with a solution, and then makes their characters act out the steps of that solution (and the dead ends along the way) in nice dramatic chunks.

                  (This is a generalization. There are counter-examples.)

                  In contrast, in e.g. HPMOR (or IIRC in Death Note, but it's been a while), characters think *wide* much more than *deep*. Being clever is doing the unexpected even against an opponent who tries to expect everything, and adapting quickly when an opponent does the same. Which can happen simultaneously, since everyone's racing on different tracks.

                  So yes, the characters of Liar Game are smart, because they can come up with and keep track of very complicated plans that work. But they're not smart the way real-life smart people are smart.

                  > Demon is a worthwhile read.

                  I have read Demon and quite like some of the bits (the Fleep-like parts with the scientific method, and the Meanwhile-like parts where the plot throws massive surprises and all the characters just roll with it). But it also has bits I dislike (some of the plot, most of the action scenes) and bits I *strongly* dislike (yes, most of the "semen shiv" category), so I can't find it in my heart to recommend it.

                    Xanatos Gambits are *not realistic.* That's exactly what I'm talking about when I say Death Note is unbelievable. Xanatos Gambits account for precisely the contingencies the author selects as a combinatorially simple set and no more. Depending on improbable character behavior that *just happens to occur* is *stupid,* not intelligent. Death Note plans are clairvoyant. Liar Game plans are not.

                    > The characters are seemingly able to keep track of an unlimited amount of numbers and payoff charts in their heads

                    Are they? I don't remember that being the case.

                    > Yet they don't explore more than one or two possibilities, usually go for the first viable idea they can come up with without probing it for flaws, take ages to figure out a simple deception, and throw good money after bad until they're broke.

                    You mean realistic human behavior? There are only a few smart players in Liar Game to begin with; and the winnowing process that would funnel smart and manipulative people to later levels of the game *does happen.* The asshole kid and the old cult leader show up later, not sooner, and the revival rounds weaken the selection pressure to begin with.

                    But even without any of that, beyond the simple game theory itself, actually figuring things out is *hard.* There's crowd psychology, alliances, betrayals, and private signaling. Finding out that there's something you're missing is costly. Finding out what the hell it *is* is hard. *That* is realistic.

                    You're trying to have it both ways, but they're either too smart or too stupid. Which is it?

                    At this point I would reread Death Note and Liar Game, but <too busy>.

                I was rather confused by your comment until Google helped me out: you are talking about the live-action adaptation, which apparently has some different games and resolutions than the manga. I won't claim the manga is flawless, but at least they're mostly not the flaws you listed.

    +1 for time braid, can't really comment on the rest.
