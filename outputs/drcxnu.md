  >She allowed herself to feel a sliver of pride over that, though only for a passing moment. To grow conceited over victories would signal the beginning of a swift descent. 

  &nbsp;

  *proceeds to spend half an Epilogue thinking about how everything is going well, her victory is inevitable, and how she will totally double cross the Dead King without him seeing it coming*
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    Well she is pretty safe. Dead King will never see it coming, Catherine is just an up-and-coming meddler and the only two other people against her are an old, grizzled veteran and his girlfriend with a bow with nothing else to their name.

    There realistically is nothing that can go wrong for her at this point. Right?
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      My favorite part of this epilogue is how many ways people find to phrase the situation that makes it nakedly apparent how screwed she is, Story-wise.
      ```

      - u/JanusTheDoorman:
        ```
        I was kinda maybe thinking she might weasel out of this until she said the Dead King *needed* her. 'Cause in terms of calamitous, villain-ending mistakes... I wonder what Sauron would have done to Saruman if Saruman presumed Sauron needed him.
        ```

  - u/Halinn:
    ```
    And she has the gall to dislike the Tyrant!
    ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  >“Without his Name, I could have him frozen with a word,” Malicia noted.

  Well, now we know how she's going to die. With Black saying the words "I do not kneel."

  Still, Malicia raising new lords/ladies of the Steppes  is a pleasant surprise. Especially considering we don't know whether or not the Reforms have been restored yet. Surprising, considering it gives orcs leaders to rally around. And giving Wither Foramen is unexpected too; Thalassina seemed more likely, considering Foramen's proximity to the Eyries.
  ```

  - u/TheFightingMasons:
    ```
    Was black who Tariq was thinking of when he said a name was taking shape?
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      No, that was definitely Catherine.
      ```

- u/TideofKhatanga:
  ```
  > A Name, Gods help them all.

  This is fine and all and imma let you finish, but have you heard about our Lady and Saviour Dread Empress Victorious?
  ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    With the night she's basically ageless so even with a good name she'd be able to roam the lands for a long time, while her people would consider her the true Queen of callow the one reigning would be acting queen of Callow.

    That would allow cathrine to ditch all ruling duties she hates and go exploring with Idrani & Masego to see all the miracles of the world, only gating back when someone is causing a mess in callow again.
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      Catherine has never been much of an explorer. What drives her is the need to fix things, and I'm not sure she can put that behind herself entirely in a happily-ever-after.

      I do like the idea of her being like John Uskglass from Jonathan Strange, i.e. a nigh-mythical ruler who disappeared centuries ago, but who people still take as granted as being the rightful leader of the nation.

      If I were to guess, I think that the Name that's growing around her is going to be something akin to Bard's. A hands-off enforcer who stays away for the most part, only showing up to nudge people here or there if it looks like a godling is starting to develop a bit too uppity for the common good.

      After transitioning away from Winter, she's already taken a much more advisory role with the things going on.
      ```

      - u/Mountebank:
        ```
        >A hands-off enforcer who stays away for the most part

        A...Guide, perhaps. She and Hanno could become the two Guides who enforce the limitation of the Accord.
        ```

        - u/Halinn:
          ```
          A Guide to Practical Evil (with Hanno being the corresponding guide for Good)
          ```

          - u/AurelianoTampa:
            ```

            >And so they resumed the ride forward to Lyonceau, into the jaws of the beast waiting to gobble them up.  
            >  
            >It was, for a hero, one of the most **practical** places to be.
            ```

      - u/Banarok:
        ```
        You're right Catherine have no Wanderlust, she would not Travel for the sense of wonder of seeing new sights, she'd travel to try cheap wines and enjoy good company and sometimes a good brawl escaping any responsibilities that otherwise would be layered on her.

        Since she hates being queen and her reputation means people would bother her constantly unless she disappear by traveling incognito.
        ```

      ```
      You are basically describing the Grey Pilgrim but if he had a longer lifespan.

  Hye and Black, back together again?

  All of Creation just shuddered in horror.

    I was in fact unaware, where does he post that stuff?

      First comment on the chapter on the site.

  EE, you tease. 
  Who else will be going through withdrawals?
  ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  That was a beautiful ending.

  Ime's warning and the conversation that followed it was convenient for me; it seemed clear that Amadeus had made a decision, and I had wondered from his wording if it was in fact to kneel and then stab Malicia in open court (like Cat when split into three by Akua).  Thinking back, maybe Catherine also saw that meaning and was speaking against it, and him saying he wouldn't do that.

  Once again...  a beautiful ending.  To this Book, that is, not to the whole story!  That would be incredibly frustrating!

  &#x200B;

  I am really looking forward to seeing how Amadeus fares while experiencing this *path not taken.*

  Ah, before I forget, Heroic Axiom 55 makes me curious about whether it applies to Vivienne or not, in which case Callow's position after the Liesse accords could be in trouble.  Hm, Hanno too, though arguably he still has all his own powers.

  Unrelated:  Chapter 88 goes straight to Chapter 89, but in the Table of Contents to the side the 'Rise, Rise' Interlude from much earlier is displayed between them.  


  Edit:  Ahh, and I forgot to write down how I loved the ending of the song about climbing the tower, after all those verses one by one about everything you have to sacrifice to get there.
  ```

- u/tahoebyker:
  ```
  Amadeus isn't going to kill Malicia. He is going to take Cat's signature trick and find an out of the box solution to climb out of the bucket with Malicia. He is going to tear down the foundations of the Age of Wonder (and probably the Tower, too) and serve as the vanguard for the new world.

  >For when the tower is yours to claim

  >You will have forgotten why you came.

  He's not on a murder mission. He's on a rescue mission.
  ```

  - u/vimefer:
    ```
    Interesting, and could parallel with Akua's own story.
    ```

- u/Lord_Zane:
  ```
  What ever happened to Assassin?
  ```

  - u/TheFightingMasons:
    ```
    Dude is gonna pop out somewhere unexpected. I’m still not unconvinced that it’s scribe.
    ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      I choose to interpret this as Scribe being the literal place from which Assassin pops out, Alien chest burster style.
      ```

- u/MilesSand:
  ```
  Did anyone keep track of all the stanzas if the climbing the tower song?

  For those who aren't aware, while EE is on his two-month hiatus, the APGtE Reddit/Discord community will be posting community-generated content (fanart, fanfics, poems, meme collections) to leaven the withdrawal. Wander over to the subreddit on the usual update days and enjoy!
  ```

- u/TheFightingMasons:
  ```
  Well anyone have any suggestions to read for the next two months while they’re on hiatus?
  ```

  - u/Locoleos:
    ```
    Did you read ward yet?
    ```

    - u/TheFightingMasons:
      ```
      Still making my way through worm.
      ```

      - u/Locoleos:
        ```
        OK. Personally I plan to finally read ward (I stalled quite a few arcs back) on the commutes I was doing pgte on.
        ```

        - u/aBedofSloths:
          ```
          I can't get through Ward, somehow it's way more depressing than Worm was.
          ```

          - u/MilesSand:
            ```
            It has its ups and downs.  Currently up after big V >!replaced herself with a happier and more manipulative Passenger-made mental construct!<
            ```

            - u/TrebarTilonai:
              ```
              I don't think that's quite accurate.  


              >!The mental construct was entirely within the dream world; I don't think the replacement passed through to the real world. She has, however, gotten more in tune with her Shard as a result of the experience.!<
              ```

              - u/MilesSand:
                ```
                That's the tell. The show is >!as I mentioned above.  New big V is a completely different person. Different focus, different personality, everything she might have been if the wretch had never happened,  filtered through the Passenger's views. Being "in tune" with the passenger wouldn't have that effect without also making her more like Khepri.  Or do you think that's where the manipulation aspect is coming from? I predict we'll have an interlude 20-30 chapters from now  showing that Big V is the other member of breakthrough who's out of the picture according to Contessa's prediction and she's bem trapped in shard space since that night.!<
                ```

                - u/TrebarTilonai:
                  ```
                  >!I can see an argument for that. I do think that Big V is the one who's out of the picture, but more for being benched. I think she's going to do something stupid and get on the Wardens bad side. Hell, she already has if they find out about it. I would argue the personality changes began prior to that night and she has just dropped some of the barriers allowing her to be more influenced by Waste-chan. It does seem to be accelerating though, so... you could be right. We shall see :)!<
                  ```

            - u/Locoleos:
              ```
              That really doesn't sound like "up" to me, tbh. I'll still read it tho.
              ```

            - u/aBedofSloths:
              ```
              That sounds absolutely horrifying and not up at all
              ```

    The series I've been reading as updates come out:

    [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126): (Awesome meta-story isekai based on tabletop tropes. Almost certainly you've seen it advertised here).

    [Lord of the Mysteries](http://novelfull.com/lord-of-the-mysteries.html): (Chinese, but translated. Interesting world building and magic/power system. Lots of inadvertent comedy to poke fun at for translation choices; eg lampooned).

    [Metaworld Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles): (Interesting world building isekai, with a different focus than I usually see (Australian/Chinese, not European/American)

    [The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.net/table-of-contents/) (author just started book 16)
    ```

- u/vimefer:
  ```
  >When the time came and signal was sent by the Exile Legions mages, the ritual could be initiated and the armies forced back into Creation from these ‘Twilight Ways’. Returnign exactly at the centre of fortified killing ground, manned by her more loyal armies.

  *Putatively* more loyal. I have a feeling that if Amadeus can catch up, he might disprove it spectacularly. And then Malicia will have a possibly fatal problem at arm's reach...

  Also, Kairos may be dead for several chapters now but he still scores points with me :D

  >It was a small, almost imperceptible thing. Tariq Fleetfoot saw it anyway, as did Hanno of Arwad. A flicker, a spark. When the Queen of Callow had spoken the words and meant them, something had begun to take shape.  
  >  
  >A Name, Gods help them all.

  Dread Empress Victorious confirmed.

  >Amadeus no longer had spies, or wealth or even the power of a Name. He had sent away Scribe, failed Captain and lost Warlock. Assassin was gone, if not from Creation then at least from his service.  
  >  
  >Alaya would see him kneeling, or forever gone from her sight.

  Aaaand a redemption arc just started. As everyone can see it already, Malicia is *done*.
  ```

  - u/vimefer:
    ```
    Also, it's time to review [our past predictions for Book 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aj0qtc/2019_fiction_predictions/):

    Malicia survived Book 5 - excusable as she's pretty much done now and there wasn't supposed to be a Book 6...

    Tyrant, however, did not. But he lives in my heart foravah !

    Pilgrim did survive Book 5, but he did die too. Hmmmpf. Let's call it a draw.

    I thought 2 of the Woe would die, but only one did (Archer).

    Akua did not betray the Woe... or so I think ? So I got \~8 right out of 12. The audience's vote got 9 correct out of 12.
    ```
