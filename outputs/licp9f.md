## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  "Covid coming to a post-covid state update": it's been almost two weeks since our first in-the-wild case in 10 months was out with no new cases detected (not even his housemates), so in 24 hours we'll be back to living the pre-covid life. No more mask mandate! 

  I was on board with the masks at first but they are a bit of a pain. They seem like they would obviously be a good idea in an actual active pandemic and no doubt if we had had people incubating the british strain as we feared they would have really saved our butts.

  My colleagues were *so bad at it*. People in active pandemic areas, does it get better? Like people were taking masks off to talk, to make phone  calls, or just to sit at their desks. I understand that these are all very bad??????

    It gets... a little better, maybe, if you're in a geographical area that's vaguely pro-reality? Honestly, the best you get in the USA is work-from-home semi-mandates with no teeth and largely-unenforced restaurant closures, and the fatigue is very real. Even as deaths continue to climb, people shift further away from a sensible posture.

    At least in San Francisco it's only about 1 in 10 people on the street who are nosedicking or chin-strapping their masks, and mostly they manage to shift it back onto their plaguespreader before they get within six feet of you.
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      ah, i would say the rate of non-compliance is much lower than that during our mandate. I went on a run this morning and everyone I went past (okay, 3 or 4 people) were masked up appropriately - and this is after 2 weeks of 0 new cases, with the mask mandate ending at midnight tonight, so I wouldn't altogether blame someone from "rounding up" and not wearing it walking their dog in their neighbourhood. 

      So, I guess, the answer is that the fact we only have been doing this a week or two means we've got higher compliance. Yikes.

      In terms of geographics/demographics, our premier (=governor) has an 88% approval rating - and that's *after* it dipped several points because of our current "outbreak". His facebook announcements are full of people fawning over him for protecting us from covid (and, you know, he did listen to health advice and as a result it's been more than 10 months since community transmission). He's up for re-election in mid-march and the opposition party is struggling to campaign against him. 

      But yeah more pragmatically our state's population is more than 30% of people born in other countries, so many of us have family in other countries, especially England. So we all know exactly how lucky we are to have had a normal life this past year and that makes us more willing to do it. Even the people whining about  masks will about 30% of the time follow up with "...and I feel sorry for people  in other countries having to wear them for like a year now". 

      We had a lockdown in march/april/may that was definitely largely followed which is how we managed to prevent community transmission taking hold. But we benefit from our extreme isolation (one major airport in the entire state, and only two paved roads in, both of which aren't anywhere near somewhere you'd want to go).

    [](/kmoonlightmask) It gets worse as people get fatigued.

    Over on this end of the world, it's currently *illegal* to not wear a mask when you're in any sort of public area. (I understand that you can only actually get arrested if you *continue* to refuse a mask after a policeman has told you to wear one - and given you one if you do not have one). And most shops are not allowed to permit entry to maskless customers, so it's hard to get groceries without a mask on. Unfortunately, there are so many people who are simply ignoring the rules - or are wearing it improperly, such as around their chin.

    So, yeah, you get idiots dropping their masks on the *flimsiest* of excuses - or even on no excuse at all.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      I'm kind of puzzled at the obligation to wear it *outside*. Like... what's the point? That's the one circumstance where it's unlikely you'll spread it anyway, unless you're going to stand in a crowd. I think it would be easier to get these various rules obeyed if they had more consistency and focused on really avoiding certain scenarios while conceding more freedom in reasonably safe ones. Of course, as long as the rule is simple - complicated rules with lots of exceptions beg to be ignored.
      ```

        >unless you stand too close 

        My city has had unusally heavy snowfall. In the one hilly area in town today I watched as hundreds of people were basically cuddling, so crowded was the improvised snowboard and sledding area. Yeah, people don't distance for shit!
        ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        You could be walking by a dozen strangers, any one of whom might spread it to you. Sure, the odds might be low - but this virus *specialises* in overcoming low odds.

        The mask rule here is very consistent; it is: wear a mask if you are in a *public space*. Indoors, outdoors, no difference - if you are in a public space, where a mask.
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          I think there's pretty solid evidence at this point that outdoor transmission is pretty much non existent. The virus can't overcome the sheer diluting effect of all the air and wind currents and so on. I guess droplets might be a bit of a bigger worry if you get close to people. I agree it might happen, but again, masks aren't a 100% sure protection either. The objective is always to abate transmission statistically, so the question is, if demanding compliance outdoors too tires people more to the point of reducing compliance *indoors*, where it most matters, is it worth it?
          ```

          - u/CCC_037:
            ```
            Droplets when you get close to people are the small chance that I'd alluded to, yeah. As long as you're a long way from anyone else, it shouldn't make a difference if you wear a mask or not outdoors - but if you go walking down the side of the road, then sooner or later you're probably going to meet some guy walking in the other direction, and pass each other, and there's a droplet danger for, oh, couple of seconds, maybe.

            Sure, you can say that you can go without the mask as long as you're say, at least five metres from everyone else, but that sort of condition is going to make actual *enforcement* a pain.
            ```

            - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
              ```
              Enforcement is pretty much impossible either way, you can't have cops everywhere. Either people willingly comply en masse or you're screwed.
              ```

              - u/CCC_037:
                ```
                Well, there's a limit to en masse enforcement, yeah. But when a policeman comes across someone who's not wearing a mask, he can just say "Oi! You! Put a mask on!" - and give him a mask if necessary. But if the other guy can then say "But look! I'm more than <mandated distance> away from everyone else!" then you have an argument, that just wastes everyone's time for no good reason.
                ```

      That was the case here, too! We had a couple of arrests reported but it's always, like you said, the people who refuse to accept masks from the police. 

      We have had two weeks with no cases so we're re-opening back to the "covid normal". I'm going to spend 6 hours watching UFC in a crowded sports bar in a casino with no masks, ha :)
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Our COVID normal *is* the masks. When things get *really* bad, we might always go back to Lockdown (short version: don't leave the house without a good reason - grocery shopping counts as a good reason but social visits do not - and no selling of alcohol, which apparently does *wonders* for keeping the hospital trauma units empty and ready for a flood of COVID patients)
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          Yeah. Our COVID normal is "normal life but you can't enter or leave the state without good reason, unless you are going to a state which hasn't had a local covid case in 28 days".  We're... very lucky.

              Don't we know it. 

              How's the vaccine situation going in South Africa? I hope you all get it soon :(. 

              Australia's just today had its first shipment of vaccine land, it needs to be tested and apparently first needle in arm is next Monday. We've got ~80,000 doses, and hopefully they can get to our quarantine workers which should insulate us from even the tiny trickle of covid that escapes quarantine. 

              But apparently the whole country will be vaccinated by the end of the year?
              ```

              - u/CCC_037:
                ```
                We have a three-phase vaccine rollout. Phase one is health workers - doctors and nurses et. al. People who, by nature of their profession, are on the front lines.

                Phase two is people who are vulnerable to the disease. Elderly, people with comorbidities, and so on.

                Phase three is everybody else.

                The first Phase One injections are apparently going to be administered starting from this week Wednesday. (I'm Phase Three. It might take a while).

                --------------

                We *did* have one major problem, though. We started out buying a whole heap of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine; only by the time it arrived, we had the results of a study showing that it was really not *that* effective against a mutation of the virus that's cropped up here. (We fortunately also had another study showing that the Johnson&Johnson vaccine *is* effective against that selfsame mutation, so that's the one that will be administered from Wednesday onwards - I understand there was a *lot* of frantic scrambling behind the scenes to get that here fast enough).

                Mind you, the Astra-Zeneca vaccine apparently *is* good against the baseline virus. Just not so much our local version.
                ```

                - u/MagicWeasel:
                  ```
                  Your phasing seems similar to ours only we have phase 1a 1b etc numbering... our first 1.5m doses (=750,000 of a 25m population) go to:

                  Quarantine and border workers


                  Frontline health care worker sub-groups for prioritisation


                  Aged care and disability care staff


                  Aged care and disability care residents

                  In the next phases we have things like Indigenous people getting a little higher up in the queue (which is good, very disparate healthcare outcomes) and it going by age and comorbidities too. 

                  I'm in the second last phase - children under 16 are very last.
                  ```

                  - u/CCC_037:
                    ```
                    I'm not exactly sure how things are being ordered *within* the phases here; what I do know is that there was a bit of a speech earlier about no-one being *forced* to take the vaccine but there are also a lot of politicians pretty much saying "well, I'm taking the vaccine, so you should too!" - which tells me that various anti-vaccine conspiracy theories have snaked their way around here.

                    As I understand it, each phase will allow anyone who wants the vaccine to sign up for it. How it will be sorted into order once signups are complete, I do not know; it's definitely plausible that there are some sort of subcategories that are ordered in a specific order. The *aim* is supposed to be to get two-thirds of the country vaccinated by the end of the year, which should be enough to stop this thing spreading anywhere near so easily and therefore will hopefully allow us to join you in the COVID-free country category.

  **I have some idle thoughts about how to Munchkin real life.**  


  What would be the goal of real life munchkinism?  
  IMHO:


  \- to achieve maximum power over self 

  \- to achieve maximum power over others/universe

  \- to achieve maximum possible lifespan

  \- to achieve maximum possible life satisfaction.  


  Basically, as you would want to become, as Tony Stark had it: " **Genius**, **billionaire**, **playboy**, **philanthropist"**

  If you set a goals like that, it is easy to break down your life-plan into topics:  


  1. **Power over self.** In the absence of magic and super science, you are bound to use chemistry, regular technology and memetic techniques:  
  \- Learn and memorise the basic Methods of Rationality  
  \- Learn advanced mnemonic techniques, speed reading, speed learning and luminosity techniques.  
  \- Learn to meditate to achieve better emotional self-control  
  \- Use biofeedback devices to achieve better body control  
  \- use nootropics, steroids, and mild amphetamines to achieve mental and physical peak.  

  2. **Power over others/universe.** In the absence of magic, the two options here are power via politics or money. Aside from some rare circumstance I would ignore politics, as it is a rather slow and laborious route, not fit for a Munchkin. Lets focus on the money then.  
  The two ways to make money fast and exponentially, in a ridiculously OP way fit for a true Munchkin, are:  
  \- the stock exchange (and related issues like currency exchange, FoRex and bitcoin)   
  \- and software startups. everything else is too slow to make you a billionaire.  
  Rationally then, the only route that makes sense for a Munchkin is to create a startup company that sells, admins and troubleshoots  software used for stock exchange/bitcoin sale. Everything else is too small potatoes.  

  3. **Maximum possible lifespan**. This requires a two-pronged approach:  
  \- slowing down ageing  
  \- defeating the two main killers: cancer and heart disease.  
  Slowing down ageing requires both research and investment in various medical and experimental procedures, the main ones being: stem-cell infusions, CRISPR genetic therapies, blood transfusions, oxygen therapies, simulated calorie restriction, and finally, lifestyle adjustment. These options combined should keep you alive easily until your 120s, when more advanced technologies emerge (like brain uploading or cryonics).  
  However, either cancer OR heart disease is going to kill you prior to that. Your no.1 priority then is to monitor your health and investing in experimental therapies to keep both at bay, or if possible find a permanent cure. Bonus points in that being the billionaire that funded the cure for cancer and for heart diseases will also give you more social power. So, fixing cancer+heart disease+ ageing is your goal.  

  4. **Maximum possible life satisfaction.** With the maxed out brain, body and income you are already very close to it, but there is still room for improvement. First of all, lets focus on "life satisfaction" which is long term and long goal happiness, not just momentary pleasure (which is nice and important as well, in moderation). You won't be binging on heroin to be super happy for a while, you want a solid century or more of Good Life.  
  Statistically, what things make a person long term happy? Lets tackle them in logical order:  
  \- job satisfaction: well, your goal is to be a near-immortal self-made billionaire that heroically fights cancer, so this one is covered  
  \- relationship satisfaction: studies show that greatest relationship satisfaction comes from good partner choice, lots of sex, low amount of drama (especially jealousy), and good relationship with your family/kids. Good partner choice can be solved by applying yourself to Pick Up Artistry and Seduction Techniques early on, until you can reliably seduce whatever partner you want.   
  Statistically, marriage , divorce, cheating, financial trouble and child rearing make you most miserable in a relationship, so your plan should be to *not get married* and live in a jealousy/drama free open relationship with a person(s) you meet late in life when you have the money and time to rear children in peace. The latter will allow you to rise your kids in a rich, positive, and low-drama environment which is good for their happiness and your relationship with them.  
  Note: unwanted pregnancy is one of the greatest sources of relationship drama. If you are a guy, consider vasectomy early on, that you will reverse once you are a billionaire tired with the playboy lifestyle. Munchkin women might want to research semi-permanent hormone implants for that purpose.  
  \- spiritual satisfaction. This one is complex: you do not want to engage in religion, since most forms of it will prevent you from achieving other forms of satisfaction. IMHO, the form of spirituality most compatible with Munchkinism is Dark Buddhism, as it combines practical self-empowerment with satisfying spirituality.   
  \- Social satisfaction: studies show that engaging in friendships, social events, and group activities actively umps your happiness by a significant factor, and also is good for your health. Especially if said activities include nature, being outdoors, displays of empathy, gratitude, meditation, sunlight and physical exertion - all of which increase happiness and health as well. Solution: regularly go hiking, boating or do team sports with your friends.  
  \- stress evasion: the most common sources of stress are: death of a loved one, divorce, marriage, major injury or illness, jail and job loss. All of those are already covered by your other preparations, except injury and jail: so be sure to lawyer up and wear a seatbelt!  


  Now, not all of the above might be to your liking, but all of the above options tips and goals are statistically most practical, optimal, likely to work, and achievable in the real world. You might pick a different path, but then it is likely you will achieve sub-optimal results, especially when it comes to happiness. Even if you think that the lifestyle described above is something you do not want, you are more statistically likely to be wrong about your own preferences, than the statistics being wrong.


  **So, to recap:** You want to become a *Genius playboy billionaire philanthropist*, by first upgrading your brain and body within realistic options, then starting up in the financial software industry, then setting up to beat cancer, ageing, and heart disease, become a world-class seducer, starting a low stress happiness-focused friend group, relationship and family, and finally achieving a close approximation of immortality. Everything else that actively wastes your time or detracts from that goals is reducing your life happiness or shortening your lifespan.

    Hehe, how old are you ? You sound like me when I was in my late teens ;P

    &#x200B;

    Becoming a billionaire is immensely difficult, aiming for it is bad for many reasons, it's unlikely it'd be like expecting to win the lottery, the overhaul benefit of it is negligible compared to getting to 8-9 figures and exponentially more difficult.

    &#x200B;

    You're also ignoring basic evolutionary tendencies. We change as we age, our interests shift, our goals change, our biological imperatives change. Those should be accounted for. 

    &#x200B;

    For instance as a male while you're younger you're more inclined to take risks, in your 30s your brain changes into fatherhood mode, your testosterones levels drop, your risk tolerance falls, going out chasing skirts becomes too much of a chore, your body naturally shifts it's focus into childrearing.

    &#x200B;

    Yes optimizing is optimal, yes you should aim high and all, but your goals should be more reasonable than relying on something less likely than winning the lottery. Maybe take inspiration from real people rather than fictional characters, you're not going to become a billionaire in your 30s unless you inherit the money like that character did.

    &#x200B;

    Remember evolution optimized you to live long enough to breed and raise children, not happiness, not self actualization, not minimizing your pain and suffering or anything else, take that into account, our default state is stress and suffering, trying to avoid it is like trying to run from your shadow. What you should do is optimize the types and the nature of the stress and suffering you face. 

    &#x200B;

    Read biographies, look for mentors, productivity books, habit formation books, self help in general that's grounded and not based on silly stuff like 'energy' or other such nonsense. 

    &#x200B;

    PS. Stock market is arguable long term sure, but FX is just bs, nobody actually makes money on that, same thing with daytrade, just think about it for a second, if you could actually have positive returns daily by trading, where are all the billionaires? Surely with the exponential growth expected there'd be at least some, but alas they don't exist, also why would they need to sell courses? They could use their time and get better returns by 'studying the market' or actively trading.
