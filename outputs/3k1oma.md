  It's interesting that on some level what's going on here is a legitimate worldwide revolution. The magic system in SotL is cool, but by nature it causes concentration of power. A democratic or semi-democratic system won't really work, not when a small number of heroes or a single ruler could seize power and control it to make themselves more powerful. Although there are the same forces for a new government in this world, they're fighting greater enemies than our intellectuals did. With an artifact, though, one like that, there's hope for something better.

  The Iron King, for all his horrors, at least created an urban-seeming society, with towers and elevators and maybe a better life for some of his citizens. How rare that must be! How much more common it must be for people to be effectively rule by fear and for fear and power to feed upon themselves, fame breeding fame for a ruler of a kingdom. With the artefacts, perhaps a new world is possible. The conspiracy may not be all bad, though they do not seem particularly morally virtuous. 

  Welexi also seems a little villainous for what he did to Dominic, but if his goal is to preserve what he views as the only way to have a stable society, he did what was necessary, ugly though it was.

    I broadly agree. But kindness too is an effective way to improve one's standing. Illustrati who go around bettering their community (in obvious and memorable ways, of course) may not be as rare as you think.

    Also, while the artifacts have the potential to create a better society, they also have the potential to concentrate even more power in the hands of an even smaller group of people, who couldn't even be challenged by other illustrati if they go too far.

    (Welexi has gone power-mad - or, quite possibly, has been replaced by a shapeshifter a while back - and is barely even trying to hide it any more. I wouldn't put much hope in whatever his goal is.)

  "I was a mortal man when I killed Zerstor," said Welexi -> said Dominic
  ```

- u/Elementoid:
  ```
  I wonder if Welexi's uncharacteristic descent into madness is related to whatever he loses during his transformation into pure light? It would fit, seeing as he was so reluctant to use that power just a day before everything went down.

    I like the theory, but I feel it's unnecessary. Welexi's personality in this direction has been hinted at many times, the only factor we were missing is how big his delusions can be...
    ```

  ```
  Just read through everything...  I'm really interested in how the power transferrence works.  

  Does Welexi gain shadow powers in line with Dominic's fame?  
  Does Welexi gain shadow powers off of his own fame now?   
  Can Dominic ever get back the shadow powers through natural regrowth (if he becomes famous for deeds post power theft?)
