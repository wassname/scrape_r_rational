## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

    How do you feel about Worth the Candle fanfic? Not promising anything, but I miiiiight have something specifically for the challenge that's WtC fanfic and I don't know how comfortable you'd be with fanfic.

      I'd be fine with it. (Just make sure you mark it and tag spoilers, which applies for most fanfic.)

  Part of what sucks about ff.net is that communities are nearly exclusively focused on the work they're centered around. This is, in the vast majority of cases, pretty sensible, but compared to the system /r/rational (or SB/SV) have, it makes writing a story in a relatively inactive fandom daunting. Even if your potential audience is pretty large as a share of the people on the website interested in what you're writing, the vast majority of this audience simply isn't going to be continuously checking a mostly dead section. For example, I have no doubt that there group "people who check the Re:zero section" is only a very small fraction of the group "people on ff.net who would enjoy reading a Re:zero fanfic."

  Having a large amount of people who follow you as an author is a way around that. Those people will see what you write, and while they won't necessarily want to follow it, it's still a signficant amount of additional traffic.

  **So lets say I wanted to get as many author-follows on ff.net as possible. how would I do that?**

  With the caveat that author-follows are only useful insofar as they get people who'd read what I *actually* want to write to see those works when they otherwise wouldn't.

    1. Write a really good story in a really unpopular fandom.
    2. Write a really good story in a really popular fandom.
    3. At the end of the popular fandom story, link to the story in the unpopular fandom, citing similarities in them, and subtly or not-so-subtly nudging people to go check that other story out, or explain that you don't write for fandoms, you write for the story.
    4. Post in places like /r/rational that are less concerned with individual fandoms.

    I'm not actually sure that would work though, needs testing.

      > Write a really good story in a really popular fandom.

      I'm really thinking more along the lines of, "write a really pandering story in a really popular fandom."

      My one chapter, half-assed worm/naruto crossover oneshot has almost as many favorites as the story I put effort into for an unpopular fandom. I'm not *that* bitter about it, because I did know going in that the fandom I wanted to write for wasn't hugely active, but I am a little bitter.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        The problem with pandering is that people only come for the pandering, and if they're not pandered to, there's no reason for them to read anything else. Whereas if they come for the quality, themes, characterization, etc., then they might go seeking out other stuff. Fandom gets them introduced to you, other stuff keeps them reading. In theory, at least.

  I'm going to be in San Francisco for grad school again, come late August, and a conversation earlier this week made me realize that I could ask around on the thread here to see if anyone knows someone who might be interested in renting out a (very small) space. 

  Almost everything that I own is in self-storage, and it'll stay that way, so all that I really need is a couch (or, to be honest, a floor: I can sleep fine on that too). I'll be on campus for most of the day and will be entirely absent (e.g. won't even be back wherever I'm staying) at least three nights out of the week. 

  A place to put some clothes and the opportunity to shower in the morning would each be a plus, but are not necessary: there are showers and lockers on campus, which is how I managed to get by last semester (when I didn't have a place at all). 

  Doing something similar with AirBnB would cost me $600/month but that obviously comes with additional amenities that I'm not looking for, so I'm hoping to find someone who'd be interested in making some extra cash for the minimalist setup that I described above. ~$400/month would be optimal, and is in line with what I've found by plugging in average SF rents into couchsurfing calculators.

    Wish I could, but while I'm moving to the area I both have a very small area and a rental agreement that wouldn't allow it.   


    What are you doing for school though? Honestly there is very little that would convince me to go to San Francisco after looking for housing here for the past week. Everything's just so expensive. Especially compared to Ohio where I'm from.

  Recently I've been thinking about the way thoughts are formed and expressed. I haven't gone into much detail because I am not very knowledgeable about neuroscience or anything related to that. So you can stop reading this if you're expecting something informative instead of just some dude rambling.

  But more specifically, I was thinking about how my thoughts are almost always expressed in my head as words. And not just words, but complete sentences. I don't know how common or uncommon that is, but I have heard anecdotal accounts that some people don't think this way. That instead they just think more in line with abstract concepts and images, rather than constantly forcing their thoughts into the structure of words.

  It occurred to me, that maybe fully forming my thoughts into words was actually holding me back in some respects. Because I have a tendency to repeat the same lines of thought over and over again, sometimes looking for mistakes in grammar or searching for the perfect words to express the meaning I'm looking for. But since these thoughts are completely internal that seems like a complete waste of time.

  So as an (informal) experiment I decided to try my best to stop myself from thinking with words and instead just try to use concepts to express my thoughts.

  That didn't really work. I think thinking in words is too far ingrained into my consciousness to complete do away with. But I was able to stop myself from constantly repeating and trying to perfect my internal dialogue. It takes a bit of concentration (almost like a meditative thing) but I'm able to stop the repetition and sort of cut myself off from finishing sentences when I already know how they're going to end. (Note: sorry if that makes no sense. It's kind of like... there's this louder voice in my head that repeats my thoughts after they've been focused into complete sentences. And this smaller voice that is actually forming those sentences. I've kinda figured out how to shut up the louder voice before it's done, so long as the smaller voice understands the meaning of what that sentence was going to end up being... hopefully this note didn't make it more confusing)

  As a result of this, my thoughts tend to be faster. I'm quicker to switch away from subjects, instead of dwelling on them after all relevant information has already been considered. And the most surprising result has been that my breathing seems to flow a lot more naturally when I'm not constantly replaying my thoughts in my head in order to form them into full sentences.

  It seems as if normally I have been subconciously linking my breathing up to the internal dialogue in my head. I take breaths at the moments when I would usually be taking breaths while talking. But when doing this experiment, I've found that I just breathe at regular intervals without any conscious thought. And it's surprisingly quite relaxing. I didn't even realize I was doing it... but apparently thinking about your breathing is kind of stressful in comparison.

  There are downsides to me thinking like this as well though. The main one being that I don't seem to be able to remember things as well. For example if I try to read while doing this my recall of what I'm reading takes a hit. I seem rely on that instinctual repetition to remember things. Also, my mind naturally slips back into its old pattern of thinking if I don't pay enough attention to my thoughts, so it takes constant reminders to continue thinking this way.

  My overall take away is that I'm wasting a lot of "mental energy" with the way that I normally think. And to some degree I'm probably stressing myself out trying to make sure my thoughts are full sentences before they're fully formed.

  So if you read all this, I'm curious: do you also think in complete sentences, or are your thoughts more abstract? And if you do think in complete sentences do you also find yourself repeating words and phrases over and over in your mind trying to "perfect" them?

  If you don't think in complete sentences, could you try and describe what your thought process is like? I'd be interested in knowing how other people's thoughts differ from my own. Though I imagine it would be hard to put into words.

    My speculation is that our conscious mind *is* linguistics... that it evolved as the compression algorithm required to turn reality into stories in order to communicate complex experience and become the profoundly social beings we are today.

    So yes, when I'm consciously thinking it tends to be in complete sentences because I'm essentially rehearsing what I'd say if I tried to explain my thoughts to someone else. When I'm working on something complex with my hands - playing the piano, say, or practicing sleight of hand - my thoughts aren't verbal. They're frequently spatial or structural. They're also very difficult to communicate without doing some dedicated, verbal thinking: maybe if I used this finger, maybe if the wrist bent that way, maybe if my hand tilted so. The actual experience isn't verbal at all.

    I wouldn't call those behaviors and efforts "unconscious" exactly, but it's really an entirely different system which I can choose to consciously analyze but don't strictly *need* to in order to get better at those tasks. In fact, it's usually slower and less fun to interrupt it with linguistic processing.

    But I'm limited in how much I can teach, learn from, or collaborate with someone else unless I do.

    > But more specifically, I was thinking about how my thoughts are almost always expressed in my head as words. And not just words, but complete sentences.

    Yep. My thoughts are the same. Stream-of-consciousness narration, mostly (with *very* occasional image as illustrations).

    Incidentally, I tried an experiment once that you might be interested in hearing about. Now, the narration in my head is in English, this being my first language - but I can speak another language (Afrikaans). For purposes of this experiment, there are two important things to bear in mind: (1) My Afrikaans is passable but not great; and (2) Afrikaans and English have a different word order (specifically, Afrikaans is a subject-object-verb language as opposed to English's subject-verb-object).

    So, I tried thinking *only* in Afrikaans for a while. It was... odd. My mind was still preparing the thoughts in subject-verb-object order, even as I was forcing my internal voice to use subject-object-verb order - there was a distinct sensation of some parts of the thought getting prepared in advance and then having to wait until their part of the sentence came around. (Also, having to continually stop and remember the word for X slowed my thoughts down quite a bit).

      I wonder if after a while your brain would adjust and it would be just as natural for you as speaking in English.

      I also wonder if you were completely immersed in the Afrikaans languange where it was all you used to talk to other people and you became fluent, would your brain naturally switch to thinking in Afrikaans without you deliberately forcing it? Or would you always have that slight translation lag regardless? 

      Interesting stuff.

        I'm a Frenchman who's been living in the UK for a while, and my thought processes have almost entirely shifted to English. Granted, the difference between the two languages is a lot smaller.

        I do a lot of internal thinking in the form of "communication", me trying to explain a thought to an imaginary (and usually silent) person. So I complete sentences, and sometimes even repeat myself to try and find a more elegant phrasing. I don't think I want to drop the habit anyway; I find it aesthetically pleasing.

        Speed reading is using a tool that forces you to read faster than your inner voice can keep up with, thus presumably saving time. [(Try various speeds here.)](http://spritzinc.com/) It is indeed possible to vastly outpace your inner voice and still process ideas (though not as well, says research).

          That's fun when it happens.

          Something I notice: most of the English I hear and read is American TV shows, action movies and web fiction, often medieval-fantasy or superhero stories; and most of the French I hear and speak is for social activity.

          So now, when I think about social things I tend to think in French, but when I'm pissed or when I think about action movie stuff I tend to think in English.

        The impression I get is that my brain would adjust over time - and with increased fluency in Afrikaans. I suspect that, if I were for some reason completely prevented from thinking in English and forced to use Afrikaans, then I'd probably be able to think almost as swiftly in Afrikaans as I currently can in English within a week - simply due to learning to reorder my thoughts into the right order (though there would still be a vocabulary lag until my Afrikaans vocabulary catches up). Mind you, I haven't actually tested this.

        If I was immersed in Afrikaans completely, then I'd start out with a translation lag on both my hearing and my speaking - I think I'd soon start thinking in Afrikaans once I became sufficiently fluent simply because when I talk, I'm thinking about what I'm saying, so if I talk in Afrikaans a lot then the option will be there and if I hear a lot of Afrikaans then there will be a point at which it's just easier to reply without ever translating it out of Afrikaans in my head.

        What I found more interesting, though, was how it gave me a glimpse of a layer *underneath* the internal voice. There were *unvoiced* thoughts in my head - it was like pulling up the corner of a tapestry and seeing the clockwork behind it. There's something going on in there, under/below/behind the conscious level, and that 'something' is somehow an integral part of how my mind works... and until I tried this experiment, I didn't even realise it was there. It's a bit like what you said about the louder voice and the smaller voice, except without the smaller voice; there *are* raw concepts in there, they're just not (directly) available at the user level.

    It sounds like you've stumbled upon classical meditation, really.  The art of getting your ego to shut up and let the rest of your brain speak.

    [Maybe give this book a try?](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/18/book-review-mastering-the-core-teachings-of-the-buddha/)  Sort of sounds like it would be up your alley.

    I know exactly what you mean with continuing a sentence even though the idea is already complete in my head. I tried to stop myself from thinking in words when meditating, but the process seemed to go deeper and deeper and I felt I was far from the root of the issue. I haven't spent too long on it, so I won't be much help, but it's nice to hear that someone else also thinks the same way!
    ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    I totally know what you mean :) I think this is a skill that can be developed with practice, and that this is some of what's going on with some kinds of meditation.

    I think it's relaxing to deliberately be nonverbal sometimes - like how sometimes I lay down and close my eyes for a few minutes after being awake for most of the day, and at first I'll feel like my visual system is still wound tight with activity, amping up the contrast on minor variations in the shade of black. But then after a few minutes that feeling goes away, and I can get up and feel a lot more refreshed.

    The time it's easiest for me to act on the "pre-full-sentence thoughts" is simply when I'm busy with something else, but usually that's not quite what I mean.

  "Yes, but I cannot subject another to something I wouldn't be willing to try, myself."

  "Okay, so you're willing to try it, so let's find some other people who are also willing to try it."

  So two updates from me. First I'm in the process of moving to San Francisco. I'll have to see how that goes and report back. While on planes and hiking around the city I've also been listening to *Enlightenment Now* by Steven Pinker and really enjoying it. Once I get more settled I'd like to read it in addition to listening. What have others thought about the book? I think he under states the potential for catastrophic danger. In particular, he argues that since modern technology takes a great number of people to develop the potential for dooms day weapons is small. I think that while this might be true about developing this type of technology it's getting easier and easier to do extreme damage with just information and information is really hard to contain especially when it took a large group of people to develop. The reason the Russians were able to build a nuke so quickly was because American scientists gave them the info they needed.

    Designer diseases seem to be a potent threat. Trump has also demonstrated the relative ease with which one nutcase can take control of already-existing doomsday weapons (I'm not saying that a nuclear war is *probable*, but it sure didn't become *less* likely since the election).

  Is it unreasonable to ask for for all your undergrad course material(?) so you can study outside of class, review it by yourself, have it handy instead of tediously going to class, copying it and the such.

  I've asked for it and was denied. I was even told that in the 10 years with about 950 undergrads yearly nobody even asked for that, which in retrospect seems unlikely. Why wouldn't any student want to have the whole material nice and orderly? Maybe it's a better question to ask why the teachers don't want to teach?

  Do note that I have some gripes with education coming from my own experiences, so maybe I'm not being reasonable here.. but.. can anyone tell me why not? I've asked around in my class, and was told that it's in order to get you to pay money, but my best counter to that was "brand dilution". I guess there's also the whole capitalistic competition too, but mentioning that feels like going to a party at a minefield.

  Other possibilities are that I've chosen a bad school (my algorithm was basically "closest thing to home") or that I just suck. Admittedly I do have little enthusiasm for this course. I'm also feeling a bit cranky/ranty while writing this, and kind of feel lonely in having this opinion, while simultaneously feeling like everything I say is a (silly/unreasonable) complaint.

  EDIT: it's a math course, if it matters.
