  So what do you reckon, is Akuas character actually developing, or is she still the same old murderous monster whos getting ready for some back-stabbing?
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    I kinda hoped by the middle of the third book that she'd get killed by the fae and the series would outgrow her, but now I only wish for her to at least get a last moment like William's, where she *almost* understands what the world looks like beyond her blinders, and dies pitifully. I know her banter is funny, but it's more because she's had more time with the Woe and learned to mimic them, since there's no solid reason for her to have a change of heart at the point she did.
    ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      I've been seeing her change of heart as character consistent from when she got offered redemption (back in the game baby) by grey pilgrim.  Where do you see her "change of heart"
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        I'm talking less about what her apparent objective is and more about attitudes and worldview that would accompany that change. She's still behaving pretty much the same until the assassination attempt in Keter - pet names, milti-layered deception in the dialogues she has time to think through, perceiving achieving "greatness" as the measure of success.

        Somewhere in the middle of the "plan" sequence Catherine begins to notice how Akua starts picking up their habits, and after that fiasco she finally manages to get a good enough read on Cat's priorities that [chapter 55](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/09/12/chapter-55-outskirts/) is more or less a close retelling of a less patient reader's arguments, just one more step of escalation offered instead of "do not think, ascend" of [chapter 35](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/07/25/chapter-35-stroll/).

        From my point of view, neither the idea nor the form it takes by the time of trip to Everdark doesn't originate from the Grey Pilgrim: Akua's been thinking about wiggling her way into a "redemption" since her [plan of escape failed](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/05/30/interlude-kaleidoscope-iv/), and ironed the kinks out at some point before [chapter 66](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/10/22/chapter-66-tremors/). By then it was clear that Cat wasn't going to fight the crusaders head on and would rather coopt the Grand Alliance for the puropses of enforcing the Liesse Agreements, in which Akua's usual modus operandi wouldn't fit.
        ```

  - u/tavitavarus:
    ```
    Why not both?
    ```

  - u/Allian42:
    ```
    Unless something changed from chapter 66 onwards (when Cat commands her to reveal her plans), I am of the opinion she is still the same prideful monster. Being pleasant, flirting with and growing on Catherine, being helpful and working towards her goals are all stated parts of her plan to survive. She almost screwed Catherine over when she tried advocating for her against the sisters to the point that Cat had to maneuver both.

    A few times now she has mentioned stories of her past. On one she mentions she should have killed her mother herself, "mother to daughter". And now she tells the tale of her grand uncle being tortured and killed by blood *sweating* for a year by his brother in an effort to prove Praes/Sahelians are not beyond kindness and can be redeemed. I have no words.

    I don't get why she is still here. Time and time again it was mentioned how you shouldn't rely on a trick or tool, least it fails you when you need the most, like Cat is relying on Akua. She is a bloody nuclear disaster waiting to happen *again*. A smart political advisor is not worth this much risk.
    ```

- u/JustLookingToHelp:
  ```
  I think I see a parallel in the arc of Cat's story and of Black's.  


  Black avoided many of the potential pitfalls of Evil by siding with Malicia; advising her and letting her climb the Tower was not what even some of the other Calamities expected or wanted from him.  


  Cat's story replaces the Tower with Apotheosis.  She took many of the steps along that road, and handed it off to another, who she remains an advisor to.  The power that the other wields can still advance her goals, if imperfectly.

    Huh, Ward is in a real lull. I'm waiting for it to complete, but does anybody know, what exactly is happening over there right now?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Body horror, emotional horror, existential horror and more body horror. Wildbow has been outdoing himself.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Also, in a marked departure from his previous works, rape triggers. Not literal human-on-human rape, but anyone who has that kind of experience should be forewarned.
        ```

      - u/soonnanandnaanssoon:
        ```
        That is a perfect description of Ward the past few chapters.
        ```

      - u/BlackKnightG93M:
        ```
        My cup of tea. Gonna start with that now.
        ```

        Sounds like a wildbow Novel alright, though honestly it got a little stale towards the end of [Worm,](/s"it was great as the horror stared to peak through with the leviathan fight and then blossom into full body horror and existential terror in the Slaughterhouse 9 arc, but after that it just felt like it was pushing it, especially when the "9" came back, I still think work is one of the best written down right best series I have read, but sometimes the protagonist just needs to *win*, instead of the pyrrhic victories in Worm.")
        ```

    - u/SirEvilMoustache:
      ```
      Probably a lot of people like me that wait for the story to be finished before reading it. Wildbow's novels work much, *much* better when binged.
      ```

      - u/MimicSquid:
        ```
        Oof, not for me. The two months I spent reading the entirety of Worm (literally finished it one post before it finished) in every spare moment were hell on my mental health. In my experience, reading them in segments is better, because the dread and emotional wear is SO unrelenting otherwise.
        ```

        - u/SirEvilMoustache:
          ```
          Mh. I suppose it depends on how affected you are by stuff like that. I liked how it alwas kept me a bit scraped up and looking forward to the next reading session.
          ```

          - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
            ```
            Yeah, apparently there are a lot of people who feel super strong emotions reading stuff. I get amused and maybe a little sick to the stomach if it's a bad but that's frankly rare and nothing I felt in Worm. I just liked it.
            ```

- u/BlackKnightG93M:
  ```
  Huh, is it just me or is this book starting out very, very slowly?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Its only 3 chapters in out of like 50ish.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Why would you want Cat to do boring things like talk to Hakram, negotiate with Cordelia or wrestle control of Black's legions when she could instead spend that time thinking about snow fights and talking with the distinguished people of Mudhole #147?
    ```

  - u/MimicSquid:
    ```
    It's definitely starting slower, and with shorter chapters. I'm ok with that, though. Some slow times make the excitement all the more exciting when it happens.
    ```

  - u/Locoleos:
    ```
    The last one had a slow start too, I remember feeling just like this when they were mucking about in Laure for the first few chapters.
    ```

    - u/BlackKnightG93M:
      ```
      Not as slow as this one. The prologue was awesome. Chapter 1 was boring with the ruling stuff. Chapter two was also boring initially (banter notwithstanding) then BOOM "Cat you're being invaded. And those jacked up Scripture slinging choir-kissing assholes be brandishing a giant, throbbing, spinning pillar of mountainfucking holy fya. What we gone do?" 

      But let's hope shit hits the fan tomorrow.
      ```

      - u/Locoleos:
        ```
        Okay *now* I'm willing to agree that it's been a slow start.
        Edit: Honestly the last 3 chapters could've easily been rolled into a single one.
        ```
