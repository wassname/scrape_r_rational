## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I went out to investigate crashes at some faraway places in the nice, pretty, photogenic, lush, part of the state I live in.

  As promised, here's some photos I took. I lost the ability to put captions on the pictures, so the ones that don't have captions are assorted road sections, wildflowers, and a few photos of kangaroos running in front of our car. They're similar to deer in the USA in that they are often hit by cars and damage the car. We probably had about 5 run in front of us, and I caught two of them with the camera. They are generally only active at dawn and dusk, but on the second morning we left the hotel at 6am, so that's why we saw so many.

    Might be worth thinking about cutting off a few branches from the tree. With fewer branches and leaves to catch the wind, it should have better odds of making it through the storm, surely?

        > I think the tree'll be fine, it's old enough to have gone through this level of weather more than a few times.

        Ah? That's good, at least.

        I hope your power loss is either for a comfortably short amount of time or, better yet, avoided completely.

  What [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) do you have set up? [Specific](http://www.googleguide.com/quote_operator.html) niche titles getting mentioned, perhaps? Or terms of interest, or unique word combinations, etc.

    My name (duh), and "fatal crash [my city]", because I investigate fatal crashes and want to know where I might need to be driving to in the next few weeks.

    I have alerts set up for all the titles of works I've written, plus my pseudonyms; usually I check Googlability prior to picking a title, which means relatively few false positives. Generally speaking, I use Google Alerts for things that should have rare hits, but which I wouldn't want to miss when they did hit.

    [`"Time Braid"`](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)

    Relevant results so far comprise one brief forum discussion (I didn't bother to save a link to it) and one imitation story (with Sasuke as the protagonist; deleted after a single chapter, which I downloaded), IIRC.

    I also have one for `"ShaperV"`, but it's returned no results, IIRC.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      If you want to follow the author of Time Braid, his name is E William Brown and he is publishing books on amazon.

      Also has some NSFW quests on the site Questionable Questing under the ShaperV username.

        I haven't found any of his non-*Naruto* works very interesting. (See also [this comment](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/44b6st/d_friday_offtopic_thread/czouy5q/).) These alerts are meant to catch stories inspired by, and discussions of, *Time Braid* and ShaperV.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Understood, that is a good alert to setup, then. I would also like to see stories inspired by that, my own searching is limited to checking the tvtropes page for groundhog peggy sue every once in a while.
