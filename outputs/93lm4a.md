  I am so wonderfully confused.

  Classic self-mindwipe to avoid oracular bullshit. But whose plan is this anyway? Did they really trust *Diabolist* with their memory runes!?
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Catherine can just curse her to an eternity of horrific torture if she betrays them, and right now Diabolist needs to be in the Woe's good books (in as much as that's possible) in order to have a hope at gaining more agency.

      >Catherine can just curse her to an eternity of horrific torture if she betrays them

      She's such a wasteland villain she'd probably be offended if that wasn't on the table.

      >Diabolist needs to be in the Woe's good books (in as much as that's possible) in order to have a hope at gaining more agency

      That could work though. More likely she'll do what she's asked and some sneaky shenanigans on the side.
      ```

      - u/Iconochasm:
        ```
        She'll do it just because her murder-waifu asked her to do something *fun*.
        ```

        - u/ATRDCI:
          ```
          Exactly, she's been asked to scheme against Malicia herself in order to kill her whilst getting around The Dead King and an oracle themed Name. What  better and more thrilling battlefield and challenge could there be than that?
          ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  Ah, starting fire. The good old Foundling Gambit.
  ```

  - u/Neverwant:
    ```
    I feel like it's only the Foundling Gambit when its goblinfire though.
    ```

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      Crossing my fingers that the Dead Kind stockpiled some for juuuuust this occasion.
      ```

      - u/ATRDCI:
        ```
        Hell, The Dead King has the magical brilliance and timescale needed to perhaps have figured out some of the secrets behind goblonfire by this point
        ```

  ```
  I've been wondering, does it matter that Thief and Archer have such simple Names? I understand that it's probably just a relic of when they were introduced into the story, but nearly every other Name since the start of Part 3 is at least *Adjective Noun* or *Noun of Noun* in construction. Like *Thief of Stars* in this chapter, for example. Meanwhile, Vivienne is just "Thief" and Indrani is just "Archer".
  ```

  - u/jpet:
    ```
    I imagine it's like online names. There can be only one Thief or Archer or Ranger, so late arrivals have to pick from things like "Archer241" or "Thief of Stars".
    ```

    - u/Mountebank:
      ```
      So would that make "Thief" a stronger name since it came first, or maybe it's a more flexible Name since it lacks qualifiers?
      ```

      - u/DeliciousDelicious:
        ```
        I’d say the power is largely the same but it’s a matter of some being more focused and others more generalist. Kinda like demons being equal to angels overall but individual angels are more powerful. Cosmically equal but not practically.
        ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    Thief of Stars is a title, not a Name. I took Catherine's first card to imply that her Name is Spellblade. That Vivienne and Indrani aren't legendary yet is their own fault for underplaying their influence. Even Masego is *just* "Heirophant". They're all young yet.

    Give them as many years as the Grey Pilgrim has and nobody will know which of their storied titles was original.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      I think the exact opposite: that the one-word Names are less specific, and so can draw on all related stories, while the Names with epithets have a story attached that narrows their scope. In [chapter 15 of book one](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/chapter-15-company/) Black mentions Champion derivatives in early Praes, and Akua thinks about the common traits of the Bard family tree in [interlude Coup de Théatre](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/villainous-interlude-coup-de-theatre/) (even if she's wrong about the "tree" part). That seems to point that the core nown in the Name is a rough description of the Role, and the epithets get added if there's need to remove possible overlap with, say, other potential Champions around.

      I wonder whether or not Names can be called the same words but in different languages, or in cultures isolated from each other.
      ```

    - u/Taborask:
      ```
      Thief of Stars is definitely a Name. it was one of Names **Recalled** by the White Knight during his first fight with Black.
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        I find it somewhat puzzling that he can Recall heroes whose souls are still bound on Creation. Dead King's whole deal with becoming a lich rests on an implication that a soul is this immaterial "object" that keeps the body moving, without any functional difference between natural connection and a binding. This, though, implies there's a fundamental divide.

        Is that why the undead are less capable of learning? Is the afterlife just a point behind "now" on a temporal axis of a graph depicting a trajectory of a being, making the soul not able to evolve because the only way to progress is to be in Creation, in the "now"? In that case the necromancy is binding a corpse by magical puppet strigs to the past, and any development goes only as fa as the spell itself develops.

        I'm coming up with all this four-dimensional bullshit because Pilgrim mentioned that any memories of the afterlife are sealed, which is strange given that classic mythology has its Heracles and Orpheus, but in the Guideverse anything regarding the afterlife is a matter of faith. My hypothesis is that the reason for it is that the afterlife doesn't exacly *happen* here: from a dead person's perspective, their time ends with their death. The dead people are more or less fossils of their lifetimes beneath the surface of the Creation (or, at the very least, fossils with a Choice).
        ```

        - u/Taborask:
          ```
          It could have been a different Thief of Stars than the one the Dead King bound
          ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    Could be a language thing.

    "Thief of Stars" might be a single word in the language the story comes from. And "Ranger" might translate to "Wandering Huntress" in some language(s) on Creation. 

    But, it's probably more that since there can be only one instance of any name at a time, and many names have overlapping concepts you get cases where the more general name is unavailable, or the individual fits a more specific name too precisely to be any otehr variation. I doubt there's a strong correlation between power, or even versatility of the Name itself, but there probably is a variance in how similar different holders of the same name are with the less specific names having more variance between individuals.

- u/TideofKhatanga:
  ```
  As a reminder, "All according to" is the title of the first chapter of the Grand Melee in the first book. Now, will the next chapters follow the initial naming scheme and go "[X]'s plan"? And if so, how many people have a plan? I'm see the base bet of "the Dead King, Malicia and Catherine" and raise you Akua.
  ```

  - u/Malek_Deneith:
    ```
    Final one should be 'Archer's plan', and consist of a drawn-out description of Indrani sitting on a roof, drinking *all* the booze while watching the fireworks, and finally shooting a single arrow at Malicia, while the later is fleeing rest of the Woe
    ```

    - u/Neverwant:
      ```
      You forgot how Indrani has been drinking *all* the booze while chomping on popcorn.
      ```

      - u/Malek_Deneith:
        ```
        Why do I get the feeling that making said popcorn somehow involved Zeze's missing eye?
        ```

        - u/Neverwant:
          ```
          Ah yes, the good ole, cosmic prediction that the moment Archer needs the correct memory is when she accidentally bites into Zeze's eye as she grabs popcorn without looking at it. Brilliant.
          ```

  ```
  Past Cat is a salty bitch.
  ```

  - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
    ```
    Future cat isn't much better
    ```

- u/over_who:
  ```
  I'm glad that someone else in the world is that much of an ass to their future selves on paper.
