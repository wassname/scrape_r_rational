## Out of curiosity, does anyone know of any music written for/based on/inspired by any serials or works here in the community?

### Post:

Just curious, since I think having soundtracks to things as small as rational/rationalist books is kinda dope. The only things I know of are [Annexias' Worm fansongs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzhX5N0pWQM&t=6s) and that time during a live reading of one of the last UNSONG chapters where [a choir came and performed Scott Alexander's joke version of Hallelujah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXOH1a1h_IA&t=10s) (it's a banger and the lyrics are actually really good ok?).

So yeah, anyone know anything? Also, the comments sections of those Worm songs 100% contain spoilers if you haven't read all of Worm yet.

  Other than Annexias the only other music creations I'm aware of is the Hamilton inspired "Wormilton: the Musical" by u/professor_crispy (Spoilers for Worm):

  1. [Wormilton Opening Track](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/9byote/the_opening_number_from_wormilton_working_title/)
  2. [Armsmaster, Sir](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/bhtm9t/wormilton_track_2_armsmaster_sir/)
  3. [The Bank Robbery](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/gy7hg3/its_wormilton_3_the_bank_robbery_enjoy/)

  I think there are two Ward songs on their SoundCloud too but I haven't read Ward yet so haven't checked those out.

  Still waiting on the r!Animorphs rock opera.

  You would probably appreciate the soundtrack to [Scott Alexander's Dungeons & Discourse campaign](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/08/17/fermats-last-stand-soundtrack-and-adventure-log/).

  The oldest songs on that channel are from so long ago he's credited under his real name- and now he's cycled back to using it, so no harm sharing it.
  ```

  - u/Auroch-:
    ```
    "Back to using it" is putting it too strongly. ACX has the byline as Alexander, not his legal name. He is no longer maintaining the strict firewall between his legal and pen names, but he's still overwhelmingly sticking to the pen name.
    ```

  PGTE has some of the songs from the book sung by fans on the discord

    I found a version of this song/poem with music: https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/brighter-than-today

  I've written songs for Worm/Parahumans over the years that can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/user-371879520/sets/worm

  They're instrumental, so no spoilers. 

  I also write my own serial, Conquest of Avalon, where I sometimes post official soundtrack songs as well.

  I find it hilarious that here’s someone talking about Worm on r/rational when just yesterday I was reading a series of essays I entirely agreed with about how Worm isn’t rational fiction at all, namely because of Wildbow’s major doylist streak that he’s long been open about.
  ```

  - u/damaged-file:
    ```
    Yeah I forgot to say that technically it's like rationalist or whatever
    ```

- u/Lumbering_Oaf:
  ```
  Currently rereading WtC and on hearing https://youtu.be/aBsTGOyexNs I found myself unable to stop thinking about the fic.  Something about the tone/lyrics/gestalt of the song resonates irrationally strongly for me.
