## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  You know the "x, but with y instead of z" game? 

  What do you think of feudalism, but with bureaucrats and managers instead of knights and men-at-arms?

  Or Christianity, but with actual cannibalism instead of ritualized pseudo-cannibalism?

  Or litrpg, but people get xp only from roleplaying instead of only from killing shit.

    * Sounds very capitalism
    * Whose blood do they drink? Whose flesh do they eat? Does it turn into literal (or even metaphorical) wine and bread in some sort of inverse transubstantiation?
    * What role are they playing? Their own? Does that mean you can only level up by being true to yourself?

      That sounds a bit like the mechanics of gaining power in Forge of Destiny, in that the result is deeply personal. It's the one good spin of the typical Xianxia setting, in the sense that it's a kind of story it would be hard to tell elsewhere.

    Second one is basically Aztecan Mezoamerica.
