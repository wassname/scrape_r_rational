  Cat will not be happy with Warlock at the end of this battle - assuming he survives. Considering he's totally drained by redirecting the Greater Breach it strikes me as a perfect opportunity for a slight case of assassination. 

  Will the thousand soldiers trapped in Hell become relevant in the future? Would be cool if Cat managed to get them back somehow.
  ```

    ```
    Killing Warlock would severely piss off Masego and Black, assuming they are both around by the end of the battle. I can't imagine the Empress would be too happy about losing her most powerful mage either. - Of course obvious negative consequences have never stopped Cat before. 

    the moment with Warlock leaving the soldiers behind was an interesting reminder of what Villany looks like in practice. He probably did the strategically right thing, but the fact he cared so little about it was chilling. If Squire had to make a similar decision she would agonise about it hugely. I can't see them coming back given that when they were left they were surrounded by devils, they'll likely die very quickly. But their loss will have an impact

  ```
  The Empire's forces are getting absolutely gutted here. Even with no super weapons, no replacement Calamities rising, and no real pretext, I'm pretty sure Procer would leap at this opportunity. Cat's probably going to spend the entire next book running the Fifteenth ragged just protecting their borders, let alone actually invading Procer in return.
  ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    Procer is going to have the free cities on its other border from teh looks of it so not so sure. Procer also doesn't have many named running around, for the moment at least. Though I guess the White Knights band might join up. Seeing the First Prince and Bard interact would be amazing

    Sixteenth, at this rate.

  This battle was a shitshow before and it is somehow getting worse with every chapter. From a storytelling point of view, I'm kind of glad to see that the Woe's bullshit still has consequences. But from the characters' PoV, those are going to sting. And Catherine Foundling, Supreme-Fucker-Of-Things-Multiple-And-Varied-In-Forms, *hasn't even done anything bad yet*.

  Also, it's nice to see that EE got funding for three chapters a week but I hope it won't lessen their quality too much. Proofreading has never been the strong point of this work and this week's chapters are slightly but noticeably worse on that front.

    We also haven't seen Akua in person yet. everything she has used so far has been based on premade runic arrays and stuff. So she has't had to call on her own reserves of power or her aspects, and you know she must have a bunch of tricks up her sleeve for the confrontation with Cat.

  ```
  Damnit Masego!  You couldn't have turned off the corruption *before* coming back???
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    I think the point of him folding the space when he took the demons with himself was taking the piece of Creation they affected and spill corruption all over it. By that logic, dismissing the ritual would bring the corruption back.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      But he did dismiss the ritual?  That's why he's back?  He corrupted the demon controllers into dismissing them and then came back
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        He dismissed his own demon, obviously, but I don't think corruption is something you can just "turn off".
        ```

        - u/akaltyn:
          ```
          I think of it as a bit like nuclear fallout. You can try and contain it but its always going to leak out. This is probably the most limited way he could do it.
          ```

- u/Nihilvin:
  ```
  This kills the revolution
  ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  "Like most goblin sayings, it had a completely different meaning in matrontongue."

  Wonderful.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Whoooo, extra chapter!

  But Ranker, I really hope you didn't just make the wrong decision.
  ```
