  We don't really see a lot of utopia literature, which has been grinding on me as of late. Everyone and their mother is writing about dystopia, which is all well and good, but its getting rather old.

    It would be difficult to form a conflict without it devolving into a dystopia at some point.

      Frankly, I think that if you can't come up with an interesting conflict that doesn't put your characters and/or world in existential danger, that speaks more to your sense of conflict than to the actual possibilities inherent in literature and/or real life.

      You should check out The Culture novels by the late great Iain M. Banks.

    Economics in general, really. *Especially* any kind of information aggregation. I think proper world building for any unfamiliar land (especially magic/scifi) needs to go over interest rates, industry, derivatives, and etc. at least somewhat.

      You may enjoy the anime series *Spice & Wolf*, as well as its spiritual successor (whose name I can't remember), in which a (rather busty, be warned of fanservice) demon queen undergoes an arranged marriage to a JRPG hero in order to bring an end to the war between demons and humans... by forging political alliances, spreading education, improving technology, and helping the economy in ways that act to shut down the sociopolitical interests benefiting from war.

      EDIT: To clarify, their basically both, "THEY DID THEIR RESEARCH!  The series!"

        You're thinking of Maouyuu Maou Yuusha. Spice and Wolf is about a merchant and a pagan wolf goddess who travel together and along the way they get into various mishaps involving merchanting and economics.

  Realistic Kerbal-esque space travel, but since I haven't studied enough high-level math for that the story I've been writing uses higher-order dimensional magic instead. As I've said before in this sub, sword fights in a hypercube are really weird.
  ```

  - u/Newfur:
    ```
    Wait, you have? Why are sword fights particularly weird in 4D? I'd assume you'd need to wield thin 3-spaces with sharp 2-edges, but that's just standard for 4D.
    ```

    - u/AmeteurOpinions:
      ```
      The magic doesn't quite work like that. Every person is sheathed in an Array which is basically just a "hands-off, no instakillz" plot device, so the 4D fights are about movement and positioning in 4D. The battlefield is 4D, not the characters. Don't worry, Arrays break down in extremely high levels of power, so there are fights like the one you described as well.
      ```

      - u/Newfur:
        ```
        Meh, that's not even slightly as weird as it could be, then. Where is this from, though? It sounds like it would be from an interesting book, one that Greg Egan would have written in an alternate universe.
        ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    *Rendevous with Rama* complies with basic physics [last chapter](#s "except the alien reactionless drive") and Clarke is generally pretty good about stuff like delta-v and the rocket equation.  

    But I agree, I don't know of any recent *really really hard* space SF, and I want it so much!
    ```

      >*really really hard* space SF

      Yep, definitely Greg Egan, from what I've heard. *Orthogonal* has been on my list for a while, but I haven't started it. The chief concept behind the universe there is that spacetime has a (1,1,1,1) metric instead of (-1,1,1,1). Check out the website [here](http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/ORTHOGONAL/ORTHOGONAL.html). There, Egan basically re-derives all of undergraduate physics in this new system to lay out what the universe is like. 

      Some highlights:

      * If you actualize the same setup for the Twin Paradox in our universe, the traveling "twin" ages more quickly, not more slowly. [Slight premise spoilers I've gleaned from Egan's site:](#s "The people on the focused planet use this to launch a ship full of researchers to figure out how to stop a planetary collision in time.")
      * Two charged particles (regardless of sign) have multiple (countably infinitely many) points of equilibrium at nonzero distances. And these equilibria are *stable*. Contrast with our universe, in which two particles either repel forever or attract forever (well, until they collide). This seems to make for interesting electron lattice structures in electronics, though of course I'm fuzzing on the details.
      * The speed of light is not A) a universal speed limit or B) constant for different frequencies of light. Because of B), stars look like rainbow smears instead of white pinpricks: When the star moves from point A to B, the slower frequencies emitted at point A reach us simultaneously with faster frequencies emitted from point B.

      Basically, the world sounds cool as fuck. It's on my reading list for this summer.

        **Woah**.

        I am reading this *so fast* once I've finished exams.

  - u/zajhein:
    ```
    I'm curious what you think would be interesting to read about that. Is it the description of space travel, how they prepare and talk about it working, how they deal with and predict potential problems, or something else entirely?

    To me, it seems unlikely to make a story more interesting unless it was simple mentioning the ideas worked into the plot somehow to make it more realistic, rather than tons of detail someone might need to know if they were actually involved in it. But then again, I'm not hugely into the technical details of things like that.
    ```

    - u/AmeteurOpinions:
      ```
      I'm a sucker for tactics and planning in fiction. Most starship fights are just "Target their engines / Hull integrity at 80% / Use the macguffin now!" and they don't do anything with velocities or rotations or even countermeasures and counter-countermeasures, etc.
      ```

      - u/zajhein:
        ```
        That makes sense, as many details like that are usually badly written. I would rather less of it because of that, but I could appreciate it if it was done better like you suggest.

    I think there is a roleplaying game about that. I wish I could remember the name. I used to see stories about it all the time on r/gametales before that sub got eaten by serials.

  Actual complex messed of truly convoluted decision theory and related concepts, but just bite-size scenarios illustrating specific problems, and with experts-by-repeated-experience exploiting the hell out of it, not highly intelligent amateurs discovering it and trying to isolate the mess in order to be able to use it. 

  If you've read it, something that is to newcomb's problem and the "do not mess with time" incident as David Brin's "kiln people" is to the generic single teleporter non-deletion plot. Except rationalist. 

  Or; time travel as complex as in Homestuck, but it's all very strictly realistic timelike curves, and everyone actually makes good munchkinn-y use of it.

          No, but I meant for real life, in which avoiding a Total Planet Kill via mass extinction among the planet's food webs is a serious issue.

            I actually think this is usually an overblown assertion - most ecological disasters could be catastrophic (like, reset the past ~20,000 years of human progress), but they're not an existential threat on the level of grey goo or UFAI.  

            This is the kind of threat that I spend my life thinking about, and the best options are (1) avert disaster; (2) see 1 as it will continue to get worse; (3) resilience; or (4) run away.  The problem is that as you go along each option loses more of what's valuable, so best is to have dealt with environmental problems as we learn about them.  If not, at least avoid irreversible tipping points.  Or at least try to have a resilient system of, say, Von Neuman repraps so you can restart from 1990 instead of 20K BCE.  Failing that, hope that the problems are limited to earth and we have self-sufficient colonies elsewhere (not really an option).  

            Luckily there's nothing standing in the way of option #1 but most governments and the richest industries in history!  With such feeble opposition, we actually stand a chance...
            ```

              > This is the kind of threat that I spend my life thinking about

              Are you Nick Bostrom?

              >Luckily there's nothing standing in the way of option #1 but most governments and the richest industries in history! With such feeble opposition, we actually stand a chance...

              Ah. Ha. Ha.

              I mean, on the *upside*, we *can* beat the industries and governments into at least *partially* pricing ecological hazards into the markets, just by getting *subsidies* to damaging activities *stopped*, and even doing that has, in a lot of places, led to rapid adoption of Earth-friendlier things like renewable energy, efficiency measures, etc.

              But yeah, this kind of consideration is why I'm clandestinely studying stuff off the MIRI curriculum in hope of helping to hurry the fuck up and make an FAI *before* the nasty consequences of the status-up hit the fan, let alone grey goo or UFAI.

              Because goddamnit, I have had *quite enough* of hearing from all the Very Serious People that the world is going to end within my lifetime, all the real decisions were made before I was born, and there's jack-shit I can do about it.  Oh, and that even if I *wanted* to do something, there's no jobs.

              Disregard collapse; acquire utopia.

                ```
                I don't *think* I'm Nick Bostrom, and by my understanding of identity that's good enough.  

                Yep, yep, yep; the 'true (ie idealised) economics' are pretty clear once we get the status quo biases out of the way.  I've essentially focussed on more concrete resilience and sustainability policy stuff - fossil fuel divestment campaigns are (IMO) particularly interesting in that they may actually achieve something in time for the UNFCCC meeting after Paris 2015.

                >Because goddamnit, I have had quite enough of hearing from all the Very Serious People that the world is going to end within my lifetime, all the real decisions were made before I was born, and there's jack-shit I can do about it. 

                This deserves not a quiet 'amen', but a *HEAVEN-PIERCING DRILL POWER* of agreement.

We'll stop the Spiral Nemesis too!
