## [Challenge Companion] Uplift

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread to [the weekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/93wi0c/biweekly_challenge_uplift/), post ideas, recommendations, or general discussion here.**

Apologies for this being a week late, I was on vacation in San Francisco and my wireless card apparently wasn't up to the task of continuing to function.
