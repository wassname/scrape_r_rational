This chapter was written in collaboration with u/MMK_II. Also, there is another mystery QM.

Time-wise, this update takes place the next day from the previous chapter. See comments below for prompts and VP ledger.

  ```
  >And the River Hylia was running backwards.

  That is a very bad problem. Were going to run out of fresh water soon. And if its running backward all the way from the ocean, thats a worse problem, because its going to salt the riverbed.

  Wait... *how* is it running backwards? does it seem to be explicitly defying gravity, or does it look like someone dug a massive hole somewhere upstream, or a massive swell downstream, causing it to flow backwards temporarily? All of these options are unbelievably bad, but there bad in different ways.

    That was, uh... metaphorical. From her dreams in the first chapter. I did not consider it might be taken literally.

  ~~**Voting time!**~~ Voting is closed.


  Zelda has just been informed that there was apparently an attack of some kind on the Zora's Domain. Limited information is available and the details are still unfolding, but the Zora are claiming it was the work of a malevolent entity called "Ja'bu." Desperate Zora refugees are flooding into Hyrule by the thousands, and no one knows what to do about them. A priority message was sent to Last Bastion and a rider there was dispatched to contact the queen before she ventured too far away. It has been approximately four hours since the news first reached Castletown.

  Zelda and Link are now with the caravan the better part of a days' ride west of Last Bastion, and the messenger has just revealed this news. It is about three hours before sundown.


  **What do you do?**

  How should Hyrule handle the refugee crisis? Are there any messages you want to relay back to Castletown? What are Zelda and Link's plans from here? Who goes back to manage the crisis, if anyone?

  * The whole party; the Lynx can wait.
  * No one. Instruct Wymar and the Council on how to handle this for now and continue as planned.
  * Send Link by himself to manage the situation and act as Zelda's proxy. Recently awakened ancient evils? He's the man for the job!
  * Zelda, her guards, and some number of the Sheikah go back, leaving Link and a small group to continue traveling with Naibi.
  * Zelda and the rest of the party except for Link head back. Link continues onward with Naibi to meet the Lynx by himself.
  * Some other arrangement? (Write-in)

  **Note:** Naibi will accept Link going in Zelda's stead if you are willing to reveal to her that he is also marked by Hylia.

  Your previous Void Power total was 2421.

  Fi spent a total of 14 VP for telepathic communications.

  This update spanned 1 day and you have earned 24 VP from Zelda and 32 VP from Link during that time.

  You have earned 165 additional VP per day (out of a possible 250) from the planning and discussion incentive bonus.

  **You currently have 2628 Void Power.**

  Hmm, a couple thoughts to get the discussion going.

  Fi's now seen an ~~N64 rumble pak~~ 'detect magic' device in action. We could have her spend some VP to see if she can recreate its effects. With a working example hopefully it will be cheap in VP. Cariyaga gets partial credit for this idea :).

  I don't think Zelda should go back to Castletown. It will take at least a week for her to get back and that's much to long to wait to make decisions about this new crisis.

  Taetus is already working on Hylian refugees so it might be best to dump helping the Zora refugees with him as well. The only reason I wouldn't give him that responsibility is if we're concerned he'll get even more political power. If we do have him do that we probably shouldn't try to micromanage it. He'd probably ignore the micromanaging anyways.

  Speaking of Taetus, has Zelda actually done what Lensa suggested and assigned some advisors to oversee his efforts? Maybe we should assign one of them as a Zora point-person to make sure the Zora aren't getting screwed over.

  We should definitely tell Wymar that the Lynx has promised 2,505 soldiers and have him tell us where he wants them deployed. Another thing to check might be if there are any Zora soldiers/warriors willing to fight. 

  Zora domain falling probably means Hylia's Watch needs to be reinforced, but Wymar won't have the troops to spare.

  The Gorons are totally having their own ancient evil waking up thing happening too.

    > We should definitely tell Wymar that the Lynx has promised 2,505 soldiers and have him tell us where he wants them deployed.

    Zelda has informed Wymar of the 2,505 Sunseekers who will be joining the front under his command. It was briefly alluded to in Zelda's journal entry (though it seems through editing that became less explicit). These soldiers have not yet left FYI and are still awaiting Naibi's return.
    ```

- u/Salaris:
  ```
  Okay, some basic plan formulation, to be edited later. Other people are welcome to put forth plans: I'm throwing something basic out here because we haven't seen one yet.

  **Plan: Critical Path**

  * Maintain SOP, including time-sensitive uses of VP for old magic. (Do we need an updated SOP post?)
  * Send messages back to castle town to appraise them of your situation, but do not turn back. Finish the mission with the Lynx with your party intact.
  * If you happen to have any zora specialists with you, you can send them, but do not send Link or Zelda.
  * Delegate someone appropriate back at home to deal with the zora situation. If anyone is an expert at Zora culture or language, try to loop them in.
  * By default, choose **Vestele** to handle the zora matter, unless we have a relevant ambassador or zora specialist. We know she's probably on our team and already very well aware of our whole situation. Make sure she's well-protected, too. (Is Vestele still with us? I assume she isn't, but I'm not 100% certain.)
  * There was a mention early in the story about asking Sages Rutilo or Vulas about "evils long thought dormant". If we have not already done this explicitly (I can't recall), see if we can contact them for information.
  * Zelda's dream came true. Link is also getting nightmares. Let's look into this further. Ask Link if he's comfortable sharing his dreams. See if you can figure out any recurring details that may be usable to avoid the fate.
  * If viable, have Fi teach Link and Zelda techniques that may be useful for exploring their dreams (e.g. lucid dreaming techniques). Given the prophetic nature of the dreams, this may be iffy, but it may be worth investigating.
  * Have Link describe his vision of the mountains surrounded by a desert locale to Naibi and see if she has any idea what the location is or what the significance of it might be. It may be worth researching and/or visiting that location before we leave this region.
  * Encourage Link to rest and work on his mental health. Explain that as a hero, he needs to be in top shape, and that rest and recovery from his tasks are extremely important factors to ensuring that he's in the best shape for major confrontations. Encourage him to learn Soothe to cast on himself to help him sleep more easily. Have Fi use Invigorate to help him rest and recover more easily if needed.
  * Ask Naibi about this Gandondorf's demonstrated capabilities in terms of magic and combat, as well as the known size of his forces.
  * Magic Research: Spend up to 100 VP on researching the old magic detection device to see if its effect can be duplicated without the device or if other magics (e.g. an "identify old magic" rather than a "detect old magic") could be potentially explored.
  * Questions for Fi: What qualifies as "heroic" for the purposes of generating Divine Power? What are the expectations of heroism for a Champion of Hylia? Did you observe a spike in Divine Power earnings when Link fought the Kodongo?

  I intend to edit this if other suggestions come in or we get some answers through role-playing with the messenger.

  Edit: Added questions for Fi after some of the discussion about generating VP/Divine Power based on heroism.

    In general, I don't think we should be too shy on separating Zelda and Link. It may seem risky, but:

    1. We're severely limiting the advantadges of having multiple marked if they are always together.
    2. We need to take some risks. The situation is apparently so bad that if we're too conservative it's unlikely we'll win.

    I'm not sure this situation merits sending Zelda or Link, though: If we send either of them it shouldn't be to deal with the refugee crisis but to se wtf happened in the zora domain and if a party needs to be sent to deal with it, or if it gives important or time-sensitive information that complements what the Lynx tells us.
    ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      > We're severely limiting the advantadges of having multiple marked if they are always together.

      That's a fair point; having viewpoints in two locations and being able to communicate that information between them is useful. I don't think we're necessarily ready for doing that, though. 

      If we discover the location of the place that Link was envisioning - say, one of the Temples or something - it might be reasonable to split the party and send him there while Zelda deals with the Lynx, for example, once we feel comfortable that this is not a trap.

      I would be more comfortable splitting the party if we had someone close to Link-tier as a replacement bodyguard - say, a Lightsworn sheikah, or maybe a powerful gerudo buddy, etc.

      > We need to take some risks. The situation is apparently so bad that if we're too conservative it's unlikely we'll win.

      Going to the Lynx directly rather than trying to turtle at home was already a pretty considerable early game risk. It's a route that was fed to us to some degree, but I wouldn't call this anything close to risk-free. The gerudo are actively working against Ganondorf himself here. From both an in-character standpoint and an out-of-character one, we have reason to believe he is one of our main antagonists - I think keeping Zelda safe at this point in time is very reasonable. (And I also think keeping the two of them together might be better for Link's shaky mental health, but that's iffier.)

      If we want a Mark in another location, we could consider marking a sheikah soon and sending them to scout. It's a big investment, but given that we can deactivate those marks and continue to gain VP over time from them, it may be a good long-term plan to mark several people for long-term VP income anyway.

      The cost of marking Link was 3498. It may be worth trying to figure out if marking a sheikah would cost something similar - we're not all that far from that VP range.

        ```
        Hrm yeah, you've convinced me. I was apprehensive because Vecht explicitly gave several options and this was only one of them, but I do agree it is what makes most sense. (Also: "Recently awakened ancient evils". That's spooky.)  


        It's also a good idea to think about having a third marked as soon as possible, although it will be at least an in-game week before we can do it.

          These are mostly intended just to provoke discussion. As ever, you are free to do as you wish.

        - u/Cariyaga:
          ```
          I'd definitely like a mark on the Lynx -- or preferably, one on a well placed member of each surrounding nation, including Zora, Gerudo, and mushroom parasite I mean Koroks.
          ```

        - u/Salaris:
          ```
          If we (and other players) generally agree that we want a third marked to be one of our next priorities, we'll want to figure out who our best candidates are. Vestile, various sheikah, the Lynx...Ganondorf?...
          ```

          - u/Mathematicae:
            ```
            This is speculative, but VP production seems to increase when the Marked individual does 'heroic stuff' or maybe 'notable stuff' which is a point against Vestele and sheikah doing bodyguard duty (unless Zelda gets lots more assasination attempts). I'm definitely in favor of marking more people.

            I'm fine with the plan btw.
            ```

            - u/eltegid:
              ```
              I mean, the point would be to send the third marked to do stuff, right? As long as they stay relevant I guess we're probably fine. (In any case, we should find out about this.)
              ```

              - u/Salaris:
                ```
                Yeah, that's the idea - we'd just need to find a good candidate and see how much the mark would cost.
                ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    Link's kind of losing it a little. We need to address his mental health.

  - u/AnOrnateToilet:
    ```
    I vote for this plan, except we send Zelda back. Zelda had visions of the river while Link had visions of mountains and desert, so if we assume that the thing granting the visions has our best interests (i.e. fragments of the gods that created Hylia, who empowered us and our champions), putting our champions where the visions say they should be is a good bet.  


    FYI: I'm an existing player; I'll let you know in the discord who to award Vecht points towards if and when I continue commenting

      That's an interesting interpretation and potentially valid. It's possible that we may have already missed the window for Zelda to address the threat from her own vision, however, even if that idea is true.

      I do think the dreams themselves warrant further investigation, but personally, I think we should try to do one at a time, at least for now.

  Here's some vague guesswork on the nature of magical exhaustion:

  We have been told that magic comes from Farore, Din, and Nayru, and that the triforce is the physical representation of magic within the world. Not sure about that last one, but it's not super relevant. What all this amounts to, is that native magic is channeling divine energies, and one's magical affinity dictates how much they can channel, but not how much they can withstand the effects of it -- thus, those with stronger affinities tend to get magical exhaustion a lot more easily.

  What does this tell us? Not too much. Still working on ways to test this, and utilize it. Perhaps it might be possible for Fi to learn to forcefully channel native magic through others?

    On this topic, I have updated the [player points ledger](https://chaossnek.com/PlayerLog) to include bonuses from discussion for the last two chapters.

    In response to /u/eaglejarl in the previous thread's discussion:

    > My understanding is that they actually do have value, because you can trade them with other players and spend them in-game.

    They don't have a use in-game at present but they can indeed be traded with other players at any time for any reason.

    I keep trying to entice people to bet with them but so far no one has taken me up on that. (This despite the fact that I have given out multiple bonuses such as 50 points to the first person to actually make use of the point system by trading them...)

    People seem to want to horde them and not use them. I don't know what's up with that! Maybe they should have some in-game use to spur spending and trading. I'm not sure what though.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      They probably need to have some practical use before you'll see a lot of movement. The problem is that if you create something very powerful but expensive like "for 10,000 points you can arrange a massive stroke of luck sufficient to turn the tide of a battle" then the players will club up to make it happen, everyone donating their points to one person.

  This post is intended to give standard operating procedures for our character, Fi, in the Legacy of the Goddess quest by  [u/-Vecht-](https://www.reddit.com/user/-Vecht-/) . The first chapter of the quest can be found [here](https://chaossnek.com/Story?chapter=A1).

  Credit goes to [Kurkistan](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/members/kurkistan.14149/)  on Sufficient Velocity for writing the original post. I've moved it  here since Sufficient Velocity is no longer being used for the quest.  I've added one bullet point (" Spend up to one tenth of our current VP  on time-sensitive research related to old magic or Link's essence  changes. ") based on previous discussions on Sufficient Velocity.  Further edits may be made as players discuss them.

  **Standard Operating Procedure for Fi:**

  Marked Interaction:

  * Respond to questions by using Telepathy or Intangible Avatar, whichever is more energy efficient.
     * Ex.  If it's a complex question or one that's  likely to have enough  follow-ups that it's a lengthy discussion just use  Intangible Avatar.
  * Abide by reasonable requests/commands for use of Fi's abilities or channeled Old Magic.
     * Abide by *all* requests/commands when a Marked's or Marked-candidate's life is in danger.

  Energy Use:​

  * Convert \~470.5VP to get about 400 MP stored in MP form. Between chapters, convert VP to MP to refill your reserve pool unless stated otherwise.
  * By default spend no more than \~50 VP per day per Marked on answering queries.
  * Don't spend more than **half** of VP reserves at Markeds' behest over the course of any given update
     * Override this if a Marked's or Marked-candidate's life is in danger.
  * Magic Power reserves can be spent up to their entirety.
  * Spend up to one tenth of our current VP on time-sensitive research related to old magic or Link's essence changes.

  Fi-nitiative:

  * Spend MP reserves at at your discretion to prevent Marked from falling into magical exhaustion.
  * Fi-detector: Have Fi offer aid, advice, and insights to help navigate social interactions.
  * Warn  Marked individuals if you perceive or  anticipate some imminent  calamity to which they are ignorant. Do this  only if they're capable of  taking action to prevent, ameliorate, or  evade said calamity.

  Specific directives within any given plan override these procedures as appropriate.

  Definitions: *Marked-candidate*: Someone who we've recently expressed an intent to Mark as soon as Void Power is available to do so.
  ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    We should definitely increase how much MP she stores up, given that that it takes time to make. I'd suggest something like trying to stay at 200-ish. It's one of the more meaningful things we can do to improve both Link and Zelda's abilities.
    ```

- u/Kylinger:
  ```
  From the discord:
  > We are tossing around the idea of letting players purchase (for a hefty sum) PoV chapters from characters other than Link and Zelda. This would be restricted to characters close nearby to a marked character.

  Would be a good way to vet potential allies- getting a chapter from Naibi or Taetus's (or the Lynx!) perspective would help us get a measure of their character, and in the Lynx's case a buttload of forbidden lore.

  The initial meeting of Zelda and the Lynx from the the Lynx's PoV could be immensely valuable.
  ```

- u/Cariyaga:
