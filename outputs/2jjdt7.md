  I read this a while back. My primary criticisms:

  - Too much of a Mary Sue MC with relatively little justification
  - Plot advances fairly slowly (word count almost as long as Harry Potter and the PS, but very little has happened of any note or importance). Doesn't really feel like it gets anywhere.

  Things I liked:

  - Reasonably interesting/nuanced portrayal of Wizarding and Pureblood Wizarding World.
  - Writing was mechanically OK.

  Overall, not a great fic but certainly there are far worse out there. Given the glacially slow update rate since the initial flurry of posting on ff.net and spacebattles, and the lack of story progress so far, I feel it's gonna take a *very* long time in realtime before it gets really going.

  Have read through ~Ch 5 of the rewrite. I agree with the other commenters who have said that the plot advances slowly, and that the author seems interested in portraying pureblood society over plot. But I'm actually enjoying these elements--it's nice to see some (at least superficially) well-thought-out worldbuilding, and we all know roughly how the plot is going to go anyway. I'm sure I'll be annoyed when I get to the end of the story and not much has happened, but for now I'm enjoying it. Thanks for the link, rilianus!

    I enjoy it and I wish there were more. I disagree over the question of Mary Sueness; there certainly isn't any more than is in Methods of Rationality.

  My first thought was that it would be a Rational!Hellsing fic, but this is pretty cool too.
