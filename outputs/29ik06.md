## [Q] Rational fanfiction Most Wanted?

### Post:

If you could see a treatment of a particular book/movie/franchise, what would it be?

  I'd really like to see Star Wars done properly, with an explanation of what the Force really is, and eventually its exploitation. I have no real interest in writing it myself, but the Thrawn trilogy opened up my eyes to what the setting could be like in the hands of someone who takes the time to think, and I'd like more of that.

    A couple of thoughts on the Force in Star Wars:

    1. Dark side users are almost always stronger than light side users.

    2. If you do not constantly control yourself and your emotions you end up on the dark side.

    3. All dark side users basically end up with the same goals (conquering the universe / becoming "evil"), no matter what personality they originally had.

    4. Dark side users have no concept of self-preservation beyond furthering their new goals, they literally train the person meant to kill them (their apprentice).

    My conclusion: The dark side is the only side of the Force. "Light side users" are just those people mentally strong enough to tap into this power source without succumbing to its corrupting effects.

    It's rare for me to disagree with you, but...

    I am familiar with very little of the EU material - mostly, I just saw the movies. From those, I wouldn't actually be super interested in the background of the Force. Pretty much everything about the films' depiction of the Force worked really well and was great when it was Yoda talking in pseudo-mystic gibberish in a swamp about it being some magical power in everything as some sort of pantheism, and the canonical explanation of midichlorians/microorganisms in Phantom Menace is completely missing the point of what made the original trilogy's depiction of the force cool. Making everything more rational and understandable (like in Phantom Menace) and less mystical gibberish (like in the films that weren't terrible) seems like a bad decision. Even if you don't go for midichlorians, I don't think anything good would be added by having the Jedi discussing what particles allow for the apparant action-at-a-distance of the Force and trying to work out if Telekinesis followed an inverse square law, or why they couldn't just use their TK to sever nerves in their opponent's spinal column and instantly incapacitate or kill them. 

    The setting conceits of Star wars are nonsense all the way down, and by the time you've ripped up or explained away enough of them to have something that 'made sense' you've bored the reader and discarded the vast majority of setting material. Fundamentally, Star Wars was amazing when it was essentially a fairy tale of wizard/monk/knights and princesses in space with a whole bunch of nonsensical conceits and people using laser swords because laser swords are cool, and became steadily worse when it was trying to draw the viewer to follow a complex (and nonsensical) plot about trade disputes and senatorial politics.

      Midichlorians were a [fake explanation](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ip/fake_explanations/), that's why they sucked. But I agree that it'd be really difficult to come up with a simple, coherent set of rules that predicted the way the force is depicted as working in Star Wars.
      ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      We definitely come at it from different angles, which I can understand. For me, it's a case of playing the Star Wars RPG and reading the EU novels. In the RPG especially there are strict definitions of what the mystical wizards can actually do (mostly for reasons of balance). They never really explain the how of it, but it's much better defined than in the movies, which makes it seem more "real" to me.

      I think, if I were enough of a Star Wars nerd to do it, I would write a Star Wars fanfic that never gives a full and complete explanation of the Force, only defines some of its limits and offers reasonable exploitations of it based on what's shown in its various levels of canon. There are some wonderful conflicts within the Star Wars universe that I think I would like touching - the conflict between Sith and Jedi as an actual difference in values rather than just "right" and "wrong", the routine memory wipes of the pretty-much-sentient droids, the fact that the Emperor had a pretty legit reason to try to unify the galaxy (the imminent invasion by an immensely powerful alien race).

      But I totally get where you're coming from, and largely agree with what makes Star Wars compelling to so many people, and why the prequels sucked.

        Hmm... that actually sounds like a really interesting rabbit hole to go down.  How *does* a post-scarcity communistic society *actually work*?  And I mean *actually work*, optimizing for making it work as shown in the show rather than waving your hands and saying, "Well it actually doesn't work so they have a very capitalist/proprietarian system and futarchy instead like Good Rationalists Who Read Robin Hanson!"

        On slightly further thought, I support this project very wholeheartedly, on grounds that making people believe in futuristic communist utopias is much easier when you can point to a fleshed-out thought-experiment and intuition pump in how one *really, actually works*.

        Here's a start to get people thinking: after a severely damaging war caused by biologically-focused initial forays into transhumanism, first contact with the Vulcans was made.  They showed humanity how to build FAI.  FAI thus worked, and the associated kinds of "godvomit"-level technology thus worked, but [the AI decided to take a hands-off approach](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xb/free_to_optimize/).  Keeping society running thus remains a *human* problem, and the story explores the human solution space for that problem.

      How about a take on Star Trek where the universe-changing sci/tech discoveries every fifth episode are actually allowed to change the universe in all subsequent episodes?  It's a little hard to take seriously transhumanism, post-scarcity, human replication, etc., all the way up to time travel and interacting multiverses, in the context of a serial episodic format that tries to preserve a relatively static status quo by each episode's end.

    But there *is* no "What the Force really is."  If you want to explain magic with a non-nitwit explanation, you have to start from the non-nitwit explanation of magic and then figure out what the effects and behaviors look like, so that there's something coherent to explain, with a compact explanation that isn't forced.  See e.g. _Ra_.

  Merlin. Holy fuck, it's about a guy with magic powers who lives at the royal court and directly interacts with the crown prince on a regular basis--there's so much potential for munchkinry and world optimization, but the characters are all idiots. Examples of idiocy: Merlin can cast a sleep spell, but still relies on force-blasting people into walls in combat; Merlin can heal the sick, but usually doesn't because it's not his "destiny;" Merlin does a thing that directly and predictably results in the deaths of hundreds of innocents because "he promised."

  **Game Theory of Thrones.** For the obvious route to a HPEV/Bella-style protagonist, have Jon head off to become a Maester instead of joining the Night's Watch. After focusing on Jon for a while, switch over to Dany's story, which has proceeded in the background as per canon right up until the flames,  and then is derailed heavily once the dragons start whispering in her ear. 

  Have dragons be dangerous not because they're big and breathe fire but because they're *smart* and naturally evil - they were the true power behind the Valyrian Freehold (and later the Targaryen throne) and the "Doom of Valyria" was actually a deliberate last-ditch attempt to wipe them out. Make the Maester's Conspiracy a more explicit plot point (you've already got Jon in place to hear about it). You'd probably have to have some handwaved reason why dragons that are just hatched are *already* dangerous - maybe there's some sort of Qwisatz Haderach-style Lamarckian inheritance of gained knowledge, so they start out knowing everything that their parents did at the point of conception, as well as everything *their* parents did up to *their* conception, etc.

    I like the dangerousness of dragons in that way, but I think I'd much rather go with *alien* instead of evil. "The dragons do not hate you, nor do they love you, but you have opposable thumbs which they can use for something else." or some such :P

  I am a bit curious to see a rational supernatural or another rational "monster hunting in modern times" style fanfic. I would want to know how they survive in modern times undetected. My answer would be that anything that survived that long was either ridiculously clever, literally no one lived to tell the tale, or a reality warper. The only response is truly brilliant monster hunting where each fight is against something that has been dealing with monster hunters for centuries and yet is still here, or its ancestors have, or it is so stealthy that finding it is an epic effort in itself. I might be writing this. No promises as my time constraints are high and it isn't the most helpful use of my time.

  - u/Laborbuch:

    I know Worm is considered something of an superhuman story with a strong rational streak, and in that vein you might consider [Pact](http://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/) something worthwhile. The characters at least talked about supernatural creatures that still were around and what that said about these creatures. If they haven't been bound yet, if they are around, they *need* to have some quality that prevented previous practitioners (monster hunters, so to speak) from tackling them successfully.

      I read pact so far. When I read that part I was really happy because someone was finally doing it but that didn't really pan out. I love pact but it isn't what I am describing. Even the cleverest so far are pushovers to a degree. Everyone seems to be able to take down everyone else with enough luck and fudging. I do really enjoy pact though.

      To me, any individual monster battle should be an incredibly grueling thing, especially if the monster is 500 years old. Anyone who can take out double digits worth of monsters would have to be practically inhumanly clever about it. I would go into it in specific detail and give examples but I don't want to tempt myself to write it while I am working two and a half jobs and doing law school.

      I've only watched the series once, but don't the anti-spirals repress life because of their fear that spiral energy spirals out of control and destroys everything?

      If I remember correctly, at one point they almost directly imply that somehow, angular momentum increases over time when left on its own. Can you imagine how incredibly dangerous a mechanical drill-arm is in such a universe? Applied consistently though, stars could never exist in such a universe. But with just a minor correction, like saying that only one element or one specific material (artificial or natural) has this property, you can make it work.

      Antispirals would be placed in the role of Mass Effect Reapers as they were intended in ME1 and ME2: not dumb life-haters like you would think at first, but custodians of the galaxy/universe which (pretty immorally) try to preserve the universe for future life. A race which has given up hope in the possibility that the crisis can be worked around, and instead prevents anyone from getting near the point of triggering it.

  I always thought a rational!Batman or a real rational!Superman would be neat. You're skirting about the edges of rational!Superman with The Metropolitan Man, but one where Superman is explicitly rational would also be fun - as long as some suitably exciting conflicts can be thought up.

  If I have to say any one thing in particular, though, a large and well-done rational take on Star Wars is probably one of the things I'd want most. However, that entire universe makes so little sense in terms of tech capabilities possessed vs tech capabilities actually used properly, how all the tech would change society, what the hell the Force is and so on, that you really would need to do some extensive work before you could make a truly sensible world and story out of it (edit: and retain the original feel and flavor).

  Incidentally, I've been procrastinating horribly about writing reviews for Metropolitan Man. I'll get around to fixing that - promise.

    I've been thinking about how you'd do Superman as a rationalist for awhile now. I think you'd almost have to do it with him as Superboy, having recently come into his powers. Then the plot would follow him as he discovers what he's capable of and comes into his own as a different kind of hero. The big problem with Superman in general is that he's ridiculously powerful, and if you have him as a protagonist it's hard to give him some credible threat. (For a while I was planning to launch into something like that as soon as Metropolitan Man was finished as a sort of counterpoint to it, but I could never get the plotting right.)
    ```

    - u/omgimpwned:

      I thought there were several variations on his power-level in canon - yours seems to be one of the higher ones, though not remotely near the ridiculous levels I've heard of (stuff like dragging planets around with ease, and chilling out inside of stars to *regenerate*). You could do a less strong interpretation or somehow contrive to debuff him, but maybe it wouldn't feel like a proper Superman then.

      Alternatively, you're right, it would have to be the story of how he gets started. I can see a few ways you might go about that, but generally the conflict has to be moral in nature - as you say it's hard to establish any credible physical threats to him. Meanwhile, I think watching him tie himself up in knots and angst over things where physical power can't help would actually be interesting if done well.

  A lot of the light novels that go on to become rather popular would do quite well /w a rational rewrite.

  Infinite Stratos would have been interesting if it analyzed how a world dominated by females in super magic powered armor with males as second or third class citizens looked like, but it was a harem comedy.

  Code Geass and/or Death Note would have been better if the author was remotely as intelligent as the lead characters, and used more brain and less ass pull.

  Accel World would have been quite different if Haruyuki was a tad further along the smart protagonist line, instead of just being the bullied kid who is fawned over by half a dozen attractive women.

  Highschool DxD has a rather interesting setting, but it's ruined by the lead character's obsession with boobs and his lack-a-brain perversity. You want boobs? More arachnocentauroid female monsters that shoot death beams from their nipples while trying to stab you and feed you into what was basically vagina dentata, less "and then their clothes magically exploded hahaha buy my ~~porn~~ books."

You'd need to do some de-powering or just outright have Lelouch do his thing *without* Geass powers.

      Maybe, your spoiler became possible after geass levelup?

      Also, I was thinking that Ive never seen Lelouch use the same geass twice, maybe thats the limitation.

    If we're talking about light novels and anime, *No Game No Life* is already halfway to *being* a rationalfic, aside from the fundamental absurdity of its premise and setting.  You really just need to cut down on the ecchi portions and further play up the portion of the show spent demonstrating material from undergrad introductory AI courses.

    [Seriously, here's a screenshot from that time Sora explained Bayesian inference to Steph.](http://i.imgur.com/8FPgNEH.jpg)  It literally has the contents of a first course in probability in the background.

    Oh, I don't know why I didn't think of Code Geass - I think it has the potential for an absolutely amazing rationalist rewrite. If it wasn't so much work and I wasn't already busy with my Naruto fic, I'd actually consider taking this one on. As it is, no go for me. Somebody do this.

      Too easy.

      First, Geass the security guards of a major corporation (but not too major, or one with a minimal media presence) for access to the CEOs, etc. then Geass them to think they are your employees. 

      Use their wealth and influence to get a personal meeting with the heads of whatever religons are being followed. Geass them to believe that you are their respective gods own earth. Mght as well seize the news networks now as welll.

      Next time young nobles are getting married, attend and Gaess the happy couple, and use them to get close to their parents. Geass them, throw a big party and Gaess the rest of the local nobilty.

      Now that you control everything of any significance in the entire provcince without harming anyone or attracting any attention of any kind, you may now begin plotting your takeover.

  I really want to see a rational fanfiction of Bleach.

  It's an ideal setting for such a thing. There's magic to work with that is interesting but not so easy to abuse. The characters and plot in general are so nonsensical that I'd love to see them become more intelligently reorganized.

  Most importantly, the world of Bleach is seriously messed up. It is so ridiculously and needlessly cruel...and the canon characters seem to be blind to this fact or just not care. It's a world that I'd want to see a character go about trying to fix with their intelligence.

    > Most importantly, the world of Bleach is seriously messed up. It is so ridiculously and needlessly cruel...

    Well it's less cruel than *ours*. At least the dead there go to an aferlife. And then if they die in the afterlife they come back.

    Though of course that's just "souls" nonsense, since the identity/memories/personality *isn't* preserved.

    (That's a huge peeve of mine with reincarnation-based religions: if a person "comes back" but has no memories, nothing of that identity, then it's *not the same person!!!*)

      As you yourself have just said, their afterlife only marginally improves things since you basically die for real if you die in the afterlife. Plus standard of living for people in the afterlife is really low.

      But really, the reason it's such a prime target isn't because of how good or bad their world is compared to ours. It's because a large part of the suffering in that world is caused by Soul Society's negligence, foolishness and callousness.

        No no, if you die in the afterlife you come back to the real world. That's what the shinigami are all about, "balance of souls" and stuff. There's a cycle of souls, they go from real world to soul society to real world to soul society... And it's why Quincy are *bad* because *they* destroy souls forever and break the balance.

        > But really, the reason it's such a prime target isn't because of how good or bad their world is compared to ours. It's because a large part of the suffering in that world is caused by Soul Society's negligence, foolishness and callousness.

        Indeed.

          As you said, if all your memories are erased you're effectively dead. The person you were before ceases to exist. People seem to keep their memories in transit from earth to the afterlife, but not the other way around. So death in the afterlife is effectively permanent death.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Oh. Yeah indeed. Though I'm not sure that people actually keep their memories when they go from the earth to the afterlife? I mean, other than the occasional ghost in real world, everyone we're shown in the Soul Society seems to be a "native" so I kinda expected that Soul Society babies are born when reality's people die and vice-versa.

            (Which does leave the unexplained growth in population on earth a mystery.)
            ```

              It's clear that the amount of thought Kubo has given to his world is...not very much.

              If people in the afterlife live indefinitely until they're killed, and people on earth keep being born and dying, there's no reason why the afterlife portion hasn't totally outbalanced the living portion by now.

              And that's putting aside the number of hollows, which, can actually be estimated into the billions if we go by Adjuchas being made up hundreds of Gillians with hundreds of regular hollows making up each Gillian.

              In any case, that boy who was sealed into the Parakeet apparently came into Soul Society with the same physical age as when he died, and was able to recognize Ichigo and Co. So yes, it's only when dying in the afterlife that people lose their memories.

    QUOTE: I don't want full on rational. Gets a little too preachy for me. I just want smarter characters. END QUOTE.

    How do you think people get smart in the first place? Randomly assigning intelligence points to people without prior cause is just author inserting plot. If you have a character that makes good decisions based on forewarning or plot then all you learn is situation based knowledge, like a trivia quiz. But if you add rationality lessons and principles then you can learn methods that are applicable in more situations and are consistent with a predetermined cause.

  I've been hoping for a while now, that someone will write a rationalist Doctor Who fanfic. It will need less tweaking of the main character's personality, has many possible directions you can go in, and you can use [a steelmanned version of] the excuses as to why you can't massively exploit TIme Travel (because that would be too boring).

  Bit late to the party, but I just had a *startling* realization about what'd make a great fic that's not very obvious until you see it: http://www.egscomics.com/newreaders.php

  Main characters already includes ones doing science to magic, and one slightly superhumanly intelligent one that's surprisingly well depicted given there are no other hints of the author knowing about LW or the like. Also, the magic system is quite different from many of the ones that's been tried so far.

  The television series Charmed (about three witches in modern-day San Fran), because boy does that EVER need fixing. The guys in charge of the good guys are creepy and controlling, feel faintly misogynistic somehow, and insist on no use of powers for "personal gain". The three witches (as a result of the aforementioned?) are practically never seen practising their powers and come at every monster-of-the-week situation cold. It's a fun, relatively mindless series, but a rational rewrite would be *wonderful*.

  I'd like to see a rational take on the Inheritance Cycle. Basically, dragons are thought to have been all but exterminated, until the boy Eragon finds a dragon egg. When it hatches, Eragon unlocks latent magical abilities and gains a psychic link to the dragon, which has human level intelligence and memories passed down from ancestors.

  The real exploitable part though is the magic system. Basically, as long as you know the ancient language of magic, you pretty much just describe what you'd like to happen and it happens. Magic works as intended by the caster, so for example a skilled magician saying the word "water" can mean anything from "move this water" to "freeze this water" or even "create a hovering ball of water over my hand by collecting the moisture from the atmosphere". I'd like to see a rational take on that, especially exploring what would happen if both the protagonists and antagonist were straight up *smarter* about it.
