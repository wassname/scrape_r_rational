## Is my take on killing more or less rational for a progressive fantasy.

  Honestly? It makes sense for it to take sometime for one to truly adjust to a world where violence and bloodshed is the norm. Progression Fantasy has a heavy power fantasy edge to it, so the MCs have weaknesses like not being a murder on a dime psychopath can detract from the appeal for some.

  But in the end, it's often a matter of taste. And I for one enjoy watching a MC harden up from their experiences.

    Yeah I think it was mainly that I wanted to have a character grow and change. I thought adapting to the new world would make for an interesting read. My inexperience may make the journey rough. I just think it is easy to dismiss how hard it would actually be to stab a living creature to death.
    ```

    - u/PresentCompanyExcl:
      ```
      Does you charecter admit it, but struggle to change. Or are they in denial?

      I imagine denial might be more frustrating for the reader?
      ```

      - u/mcmchris:
        ```
        He has a good deal of self loathing over it. I also tried to make it clear he understands that he needs to change. I have a scene where he comes to terms with it, but still admits that he hates the system that forces the reality too.
        ```

        - u/PresentCompanyExcl:
          ```
          Sounds like a good approach, as a reader, I can't think of a better one - if you are indeed going to include the adjustment period. And you can't change that, because you have to stick to your overall plan as a writer.
          ```

    - u/charredcoal:

      Make sure that the characters reluctance for violence makes sense in the context of the world and the story. Sometimes its frustrating as a reader to read about a character whose skills are exceptional but artificially gimped by his morality to give everyone else a chance. 

      This is especially frustrating when it doesnt make sense in the context of the story. If your character grew up in a rough and merciless environment, he shouldnt have any problems with violence as a general rule. On the other hand, if you explain that he grew in a peaceful, out of the way village, or in the nobility, etc, his reluctance then makes more sense.
      ```

      - u/mcmchris:
        ```
        I believe it makes sense. It plays out initially like a common iseakai. Later you find out more about that, but he is coming from a place where he never even had to kill for his own food.
        ```

- u/DXStarr:
  ```
  "I don't like this violence" is realistic. Police and military studies will tell you that many (not all) people have great difficulty with killing, especially early on.

  Unfortunately, simple doubt and suffering isn't very interesting to read. It doesn't go anywhere, it doesn't change anything, it's pain without meaning.

  You can fix that, though. You just have to make it pain *with* meaning. Show the *change* it drives. Show the *useful impact* of the doubt and turmoil.

  Show how the turmoil leads to a more effective or unexpected path.

  How are your hero's doubts and turmoil interesting? How do they lead to distinctive progress?

  Examples:

  (1) Troubled by killing, the hero discovers a coworker who also hates it, and they become tight friends in this uncaring world.

  (2) Troubled by killing, the hero discovers a way to become a surgeon instead of a soldier.

  (3) Troubled by killing, the hero finds someone who can reveal the secret history of how this world went violent.

  (4) Troubled by killing, the hero with his questions earns an invitation to a secret spiritual order among the warriors.

  (5) Troubled by killing, the hero resolves to win a rank that will let him insist on more mercy and less cruelty in his new people's wars.

  If all you've got is, "no, he does what you'd expect, he's just sad about it," then I think you should summarize his sadness the same way you'd summarize his eating, sleeping, and brushing his teeth.

  In real life, turmoil happens, and we suffer whether it's interesting or not. In fiction, when turmoil is more than a summary, it should not just be realistic -- it should be interesting.

    I excellent tips thank you! I will revisit my beginning chapters with this in mind. I believe I will likely go the route that an increase in power will allow him to have the freedom to choose.
    ```

- u/Watchful1:
  ```
  Rationality isn't a specific course of action, it's explaining what the character is thinking and why they are making the choices they are. You could have a character that is happy to kill all the time and it would be perfectly rational if you explained why (somehow, not necessarily by writing down every thought).

  I don't know anything about your particular story, but maybe the problem is that you're not explaining it in a way your readers can emphasize with?
  ```

  - u/mcmchris:
    ```
    Most of my readers have no complaints. I just have had a few people whine about his emotional turmoil and call it childish. Possibly serial killers in the making? Who knows. My execution is likely lacking either way. I do try to explain the though process he goes though, and the fact that kill or be killed is reinforced several times. You may be correct though. If I could think of some reason why he wants to be a pacifist, or make it easier to understand where he is coming from. Thank you for the input!
    ```

    - u/Viperions:
      ```
      A bit of a weird way to turn it about, but look at Evangelion: a deconstruction showing what happens in relying on emotionally broken children to put themselves in harms way to save the world. 

      A whole lot of people took from it “Why won’t he just get in the cool robot and kill stuff!”

      There is always going to be people who want it to be a straight power fantasy, or are not particularly interested in an exploration of topics. Or there’s a certain genre savviness that comes from imagining dealing with the situation (and awareness of outcomes) versus *actually being in that situation*. It’s easier for someone to go “Yeah gotta murder that dude because I might get caught / betrayed later” versus *literally having to murder someone*.
      ```

    - u/immortal_lurker:
      ```
      SpaceBattles? SufficientVelocity maybe?

      Yeah, ignore them and write what you want. If you are concerned that the MCs turmoil is a poor simulation of reality, I don't think you have too many worries there. If you had 100 characters, 95% of whom were in similar turmoil, you would probably still be on defensible simulationist grounds.

      Also, from the perspective of simulationism, the MC being "Childish" is a non-sequitur.

      Lastly, if you want your MC to be rational about this, the important thing is how they respond to it. If they freeze up at a critical moment, do they take that into account when strategizing? If an ally horrifies them by killing someone defenseless, does the MC make sure to never leave them alone with a defenseless person again?

      If they view it as a liability, do they try to desensitize themselves? If they view it as important, do they try to prevent desensitization? If they are confused, do they notice their confusion?

    - u/RandomChance:

      Please don't cater to the lowest common denominator - we have plenty of that trash on RR. Please aspire to be better, and inspire better. Don't help normalize the idea that avoiding killing is weakness - it is strength,  just like if it ends up necessary and is the least wrong choice, admitting and expressing the trauma and dehumanization it causes is a sign of strength.  Lack of empathy / lack of sensitivity to violence are signs of damage and weakness, not weakness and definitely not rational, nor do they have a place in RationalLit unless it is to illustrate the problem.  You might find this book iteresting as it debunks a lot of the myths about how "evil" humans are.

        I plan an arc for my character to question that exactly. I agree with you. Have you heard of the Stanford experiments? I believe in real life people are generally good, but the world and outside factors can twist us into monsters. Finding who he was before through what he has been bent into conforming to will be an important part of my characters journey to who he wants to be.
        ```

        - u/RandomChance:
          ```
          Definitely read Humankind - Stanford Experiment is examine in detail, and basically debunked. It was staged basically.  This has come out a few times over the years - but there is just no appetite in the media or even academics to a lesser extent for the updated info because "people are nice" is just not sexy enough to sell papers / grant applications.

  "Rational" does not mean an inherently better approach. Also, again, you can argue both ways- maybe it makes more sense for someone to be unable to flip a switch, but maybe someone who puts thought into it struggles with their first kill and gets over it quickly. Plenty of popular stories here have some highly utilitarian protagonists. Sometimes the killing doesn't get addressed and sometimes it's addressed post-hoc. And even then, even assuming it's written and presented well and is engaging (which it might not be), people are going to react to it different based on how it's presented. You also have to say something interesting about it, because both "I don't want to kill" and "murderhobo time" are both takes that have been done to death before.

  Most of the most popular stories here don't just have it as a flipped switch. Mother of Learning takes a while to build up to it, desensitize Zorian over several time loops and his own deaths, and still has him reflect on his actions afterwards. Worth the Candle swings around- Joon's thoughts on it definitely start out reasonably freaked out before swinging around to the DnD adventurer mentality, but it's pretty explicitly in the "hey, this may be a TTRPG standard and is sometimes needed, but maybe don't murderhobo your way out of every situation as your first reaction." Based on how you count them, something like half of the conflicts are resolved by diplomacy checks. Not a rational fic, but Tales of the Abyss does a fantastic job dealing with it early on and has the character development part with regards to killing be more than just flipping a switch, without letting the issue overstay its welcome from a narrative or character development perspective.
  ```

    I have been contemplating adding mother of learning to my list. Someone else said something similar about rational fiction and I think now I have a clearer view of what it really is. Thank you!

- u/Kachajal:
  ```
  Can't really give a proper critique without reading the story in question, but here's some ideas anyway.

  Consider the audience. Royal Road is focused on power fantasy stories on a reason - that's what the audience there wants. If the MC feels weak at any point for any reason then a portion of the readers will dislike it on general principles - that sort of thing is simply not what they go there for. There's nothing you can really do about that.

  A more thorny situation is where the MC complains about having to kill in ludicrously justified circumstances - say, him being directly threatened by several opponents about to kill him. 

  Now, this is obviously a realistic emotional reaction. I don't believe anyone but a legitimate sociopath would be completely unaffected by killing another human being after a relatively peaceful life. But it can still be annoying to read yet another character angst about it, especially when the "correct" answer to the dilemma is *glaringly obvious*. 

  The best way I can think of to handle this sort of thing is to simply make the character acknowledge to the reader that this is an emotional reaction they have little control over, not an issue of beliefs. It's kind of similar to anyone in the modern world eating meat but balking at killing animals themselves. You *know* you're being a hypocrite, but you can't really help it - so at least acknowledge it. You'd be surprised how much that helps.
  ```

  - u/mcmchris:
    ```
    I never thought about that acknowledgment, but looking back on things I have read you are absolutely right. Thank you, your response was very helpful
    ```

- u/Dragonheart91:

  I think it depends a lot on the presentation. If the main character is irrationally against killing to the point that they endanger their friends and loved ones, I get very turned off. If they try very hard not to kill but end up doing what they have to and suffer emotionally, that sounds like great character development. Many people in real life would struggle to kill in a life or death situation, but I don’t want to read stories about them and they would probably end up dead themselves. Having a protagonist like that who succeeds feels like deus ex Machina in a highly lethal setting.
  ```

  - u/mcmchris:
    ```
    Yes! My only goal was character development. I have some instances of dues ex machina that are unavoidable because of the fantasy setting I chose, but I do want them done in the most rational way possible. The initial surviving is helped by a character that has no such aversion to killing. Who knows I may rewrite the entire beginning in a few months.
    ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    >If the main character is irrationally against killing to the point that they endanger their friends and loved ones, I get very turned off.

    So much this. I watched the first *The Purge* movie a few weeks back, and I still get angry when I'm reminded of it. The whole main family is so actively stupid they deserved to die, except the father who argues for all the sane decisions -  and is naturally the only one to die, after being told over and over again how he's a terrible person for wanting to sacrifice one kidnapper and would be murderer to save four innocent people. And the film ends with the survivors/idiot family members choosing to let a bunch of actual killers-for-pleasure go free without prison time because they want to 'do the right thing'.

    Everyone who had significant input on the writing on that movie is a bad person and should never be allowed to create ever again.

  When writing fiction, you have to juggle two forces:  


  1. Your story must make rational sense and the characters must act in a coherent manner.
  2. Story must be digestible and entertaining, which means you have to somehow bend reality and use expected tropes even when they make no sense.

  A perfectly rational story would be dry and boring as a pile of sawdust. We read stories to enjoy adventures and escapist themes by proxy, and the appeal of escapist adventure is that it is different from reality.  


  If your character takes a long time to adjust to killing, then either you have to rewrite the setting and plot so that killing is a rare and big deal, to everyone, not just the protagonist, or write the protagonist in a way that allows him to solve the problems without killing (like the Doctor, usually).  


  Havign a character that takes a long time tro adjust to killing is not only boring to the reader (especially if the protag monologues about the suffering of being a killer) but also not realistic. IRL, people in war/combat situations kill very easily and adjust to a reality of killing frighteningly fast. THey do not mope or bemoan their fate prior or during the killing, but AFTER, when they get PTSD, often months and years after the fact.  


  Ask yourself:  


  1. WHY are you writing progression? What is the appeal of that? Can you write a story that touches the same feelings as progression fic without falling into its pitfalls?
  2. WHY KILL? Why is killing necessary at all in the story? Can it be circumvented?
  3. WHY WRITE A PACIFIST? If somehow you need to have deaths in story, why insist on a non-psycho protagonist?

  " I always read stories in which a character will flip a switch and absolve themselves of all the emotional ramifications of such actions. "  


  Because that is how it happens IRL. Read some stories on the Vietnam War, WW2, or people being recruited into gangs and terrorist organisations. Violent circumstances sneak up on you, and then you just pull the trigger not emotionally comprehending that you are destroying a life. Adrenaline (and often, brainwashing) shields you from the moral implications for a while...except on that one night, 3 years after when you wake up screaming and put a gun in your mouth, because the moral weight have finally reached you.
  ```

- u/GWJYonder:
  ```
  I don't think it's a bad thing at all, one of the things I like a lot about Delve is the fact that the MC responded naturally and realistically to his life in the new world and the trauma he suffered. That said him acting "weak" is probably the most common criticism about the work. I really think that's mostly because the overall genre of rational/adjacent/related works has so many much more violent characters, and that that's the sorry of wish fulfillment a lot of readers are hoping for. Because of that for many a character like that send strange and unrealistic, in the same way that coconuts sound more natural than real hoofbeats in a movie 

  Personally I strongly think that this is one of those "don't listen to the fans, chasing after them will pull you away from the story and people you want to write in a worse direction" and not a "listen to your fans they have valuable insights in a more productive and rewarding oath for the story to take".

  If you'd like someone that is more predisposed to the sort of story you are writing to take a look is be happy to take a look, you can PM me, it's certainly possible to go too far in the other direction... But in a genre filled with murder hobos you'll start getting criticism long before you actually go to far in that direction, so I find it unlikely.
  ```

- u/alphanumericsprawl:
  ```
  My personal theory is that this isn't a rationality issue, it's just a tired trope where readers are bored of hearing about protagonists struggle with killing people. Is there anything interesting you can do with the idea, create some novelty?

  What if you reverse it, have someone who thought they would be deeply affected but just aren't? What if they get worried about the fact that they don't care? 

  What if they're ashamed that they aren't hard-hearted enough, that they're not like the Berserker on Stanford Bridge, mowing down Englishmen? What if they've idolized a fantasy warrior culture that never actually existed?

  Obviously you can't switch back now but that's something to think about.

    Spoilers for the system in my book below. 

    My take is going to be that:
     >!Death is used to essentially punish “evil” people who have had their minds placed into he bodies of monsters. Forcing them to be in an endless cycle of pain. Adventurers are pawns in this scheme. As they fight through dungeons they do not even realize they are a part of this cycle of agony.!<

  You can read some war memories, especially memories of modern local/civil wars (you probably would have to use google translate, all of them are in local languages). From war memories it seems modern people mostly treat killing in the war like frag in deathmatch, even if then they are *not* dehumanizing enemy. Of cause it could be sampling bias, may be people traumatized by killing in the war don't write about their experience.  On the gripping hand people who can be traumatized by killing are not likely continue participate in the war, modern civil  wars are elective for combatant.
  ```

  - u/Heterozizekual:
    ```
    From the books about war I’ve read, it seems like a common reaction in the adrenaline rush of combat is that soldiers feel elated about killing the enemy, but later they may start to feel remorse, get flashbacks about things they did, etc

    Of course this applies to soldiers who have been trained to kill, so maybe civilians will have a very different reaction.

  What makes you think it's rational to take a long time to adjust to a world of killing? Just from the little bit you have written, you sound like someone who thinks that all killing is wrong.

  In any case, you need to differentiate between your own ideals vs. your character's ideals, unless your story is a self-insert.

  Who is doing the killing? Who or what is being killed? Why? These are just 3 of the questions that can change a person's feelings about killing.
  ```

  - u/mcmchris:
    ```
    The reason I think I am struggling with the character and writing their experience is because I do not believe that would be my experience. It is almost the exact opposite of a self insert. 

    I actually do address your questions later on in the story. The real problem was making it as rational as possible. With all of the comments here I believe I may be able to achieve that. My understanding of rational fiction was severely lacking. The motivation and thought process of my character are what I need to work on.

  everyone talking about the “psychological trauma of taking another life” ignores all the times throughout human history where non-martial people acclimated to killing with extreme, even sudden, rapidity.

  i think it is slightly more realistic in the modern era, so it could partially depend on your setting. 

  that said, the only thing that matters is good writing.

  I disagree. When you are in "a world of killing", there is a lot of adaptation pressure, from everywhere around you. Humans are usually quick to adapt and to adjust to new environments. Want to fit in. When in Rome ...

  It would be way more traumatizing / abhorrent to have e.g. a night elf appear bound in your current living room, and be told "kill it or else!". That would not be in tune with your environment, with the moral framework around you!

  However, when you are surrounded by people killing, in "a world of killing", I think going with the flow would be easier than you'd evidently think. When you're totally immersed in a different culture, it's hard to cling to your old one, especially if your old one would also go counter to your survival instinct.

- u/Izeinwinter:

  Honestly, if the character does not like killing, it is better to show that by said character putting effort into finding ways to not have to. 

  Angst is not interesting. Effort put into finding non-lethal ways out of situations can be. Deranged chemistry (there are not-very-hard-to-make compounds that smell just *incredibly* badly.) magi-tech restraining devices, or the ever green standard, an extreme focus on mobility.

  Pardon my late contribution, but I think that it's worth mentioning that in modern combat, only one in four men will fire their guns. So if you're going to make killing a more common thing in your world, you'll need to show why.

  * Is there a pervasive xenophobia throughout the world? If so, why? 
  * Is the value of a human life in your world less than in our own? Why/ Why not, and how does this change other things? 
  * Has the world been so desensitized to violence that killing is less traumatizing? Why/Why not/How does this influence other things?

  A good example of something similar is Sanderson's Mistborn series. Why didn't the people rise up to fight the Lord Ruler? Well, in part it was because he had Soothers and Rioters spread throughout the capitol, suppressing passionate emotions and encouraging depression/apathy. It wasn't perfect, but it helped to serve as an explanation to why these people didn't do what would come naturally to us: revolution.

  Yeah. Killing someone was traumatic. We evolved not to kill other humans. It takes something to cross that gap in a person.

  Prior trauma will do it, desperation, lots of training.

  However it is still traumatic untill a person has adapted to it. The tbings a person has to do to adapt are largely not healthy.


  There was a book series not to long ago, no land for heros and a big plot point was dealing with the ptsd after a fantasy war.
  ```

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    I would slightly disagree. I think that it is actually very easy to Justify to yourself that you need to kill, especially when there is some social pressure or brainwashing involved. Soldiers, gangbangers or terrorist recruits often pull the trigger on someone without thinking, they are temporarily shielded from the ramifications of their action by the adrenaline of the moment.   


    AFTER that, they get tremendous PTSD, but the first kill is often easy, especially if the "enemy" is sufficiently dehumanised.

    > We evolved not to kill other humans. 

    We absolutelly did not, that's why there are so many murderers out there despite the massive socialization efforts to discourage murder. In fact, we are no different than other primates where males kill each other in dominance fights on regular basis. It takes growing up in a very protective environment to be shocked by murder as adult.

    - u/RandomChance:

      That is propaganda that has been pummeled into our minds for generations but with little to no basis in truth. Humans evolutionary success is specifically because we evolved away from violence and individualism and into a species that is remarkably good at collaboration and non-competitive success.
      This is an excellent book on the subject:
      https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54775543-humankind

      It goes through and reviews a lot of the experiments and anecdotes that make up the "proof" of humans as a callous murderous species and by meticulous research of original source materials and later studies debunks most all of them. 

      Humans thrive not because we are "Homo Murderous" but because we are "Homo Puppy" the primate locked in permanent adolescence.

          ```
          And we are *not* naturally murderous - it is the aberration and exception to human relations, not the norm.  Read the book I suggested elsewhere in this thread.  Most of what we think we know about "human nature" is wrong.

            Isn't that book still just one of several opinions?

            I'm pretty sure that killing members of the outgroup isn't naturally hard for humans.

      Not Vape, but while "no land for heroes" doesn’t provide useful results, my guess is they meant *A Land Fit for Heroes* by Richard P. Morgan of *Takeshi Kovacs* / *Altered Carbon* fame. While the descriptions on WP or TVT don’t mention PTSD, context (cynical/gritty post-war fantasy) at least implies that it’s likely a theme.

        Nah, you got me I remembered it wrong. I dont think there is ever a discussion specifically about PTSD but the theme is woven heavily through the narrative

  A story can be well-executed either way, or it could be poorly executed either way. Without having read the story in question, the only thing I can say is: The story is about whatever the text is about. If you advertised a story about violence and wrote a story about moral ambiguity, the readers you attract will be frustrated by the lack of violence. Meanwhile, the kinds of readers who would like your story won't pick it up because they aren't interested in reading about the kinds of violence you advertised but didn't include.

  If the draw of the story is creative violence in a fantasy universe, you may want to consider skipping ahead to the part your readers are actually reading for. Contrariwise, if the story is about someone coming to terms with moral ambiguity, that's what the story is about; when the protagonist undergoes a change (loss of innocence, or preservation of innocence and loss of something else), that story is over, and there will be no more space left to tell a story about creative violence in a fantasy universe.

  In other words, if you intend for the story to be mainly about violence, don't waste your audience's time with 50k words of buildup that isn't about violence. If your story is about morality, don't waste your audience's time with 50k words about violence.

  It makes sense for someone to have a hard time adjusting to constant death and killing. However, from a literary standpoint, it could very easily become dull and repetitive. Having the MC take his time to change his entire worldview is fine - harping on and on about how murder is bad is not engaging or interesting to read. If I were you I would stick to the vision of the story, but take the reaction and opinions of your audience into account. This is one of the greatest advantages of writing serially: being able to shake up your writing style on the fly. Take advantage of it.

    I wouldn’t say I harp. One review compares stabbing a rat to death with a sharp rock to “kicking a rat” as if it is not a brutal act to put to a living being. I think in a life or death situation most people could justify brutality that is needed to come out the other side. My MC is not one of those people initially. I would say the greater percentage of people would freak out if they actually needed to bloody their hands, specifically when the adrenaline faded and the blood was still there.

  >Any thoughts?

  Angst is almost always boring. If I read a fantasy book I expect to read about orcs, not angst. Include it if you need to, but keep in mind that it's blocking the path to the next paragraph on orcs.

  Also, if it's realistic and *expected* then, well, it's expected. I know how this ends so I'm not looking forward to any twist on how the angst progresses - again, angst is boring. Maybe it's not *fundamentally* boring, but in practice it it's written boringly.

  So IMO keep it to a minimum - allude to it if you need to, maybe even have a throwaway line or two in between the killing of orcs.

  One interesting subversion: Have a protagonist who comes from a place where violence is unnecessary and slightly taboo (eg most parts of most 21st real-world wealthy nations) and is a prosocial member of society who has never been in a fight since grade school. Have them show up in this new world where violence is expected...and they find that not only are they good at it, they enjoy it.  There's all kinds of character development to be had there, as your protagonist first thinks of theirself as a monster and fears that they might go too far...and then they slowly come to accept the new reality and adjust.

  Personally, I think "forever" is a reasonable amount of time to take to become inured to killing.

  There's a comment later by /u/DXStarr about military and police becoming inured to killing that makes me react with "that's how we get war crimes".

    I remember reading a statistic that said something like 70% of soldiers shot above the heads of the other side to avoid killing. Maybe it was about Vietnam? I may be butchering the data.

  >I believe it is far more rational for someone to take a long time to adjust to a world of killing

  It makes sense for it to take a long time for someone who wasn't comfortable with violence to spend a long time getting comfortable with it, but I think there's a couple important caveats to that

  1. If violence is extremely adaptive in that world, you can't cheat by having the main character engage in prolonged hesitation and vacilitation, where the logic of events would have normally killed him for such weakness, but he gets away with it because the world stands by conveniently on pause? Someone who is poorly attuned to their new circumstances taking a long time to adjust is normal, but if they are so poorly attuned that they are only surviving thanks to plot armour, that's unconvincing. If a pacifist gets dropped into a hellworld, they may naturally maintain their pacifist sensibilities, but they will need something like a silver tongue, or very fast legs, or an intense and proactive risk aversion (or a strong ability to go against their inclinations) if they want to survive. -- It needs to add up, it needs to make sense.

  2. "heroes" are expected by default to be fluent with violence (not neccesarilly "comfortable", I suppose). Departing from isn't a big deal or renegement but should come with a bit of lampshading explanation just so readers can get their bearings: Why are they uncomfortable with violence? Are all earth humans constituted so? Or is it more a matter of time and place, upbringing, experience, values, etc? -Don't take the default assumption (the assumption that is normal here on richer parts of planet earth circa 20XX) and privilege it as a shared assumption between yourself and the reader. If they're all killing each other like flies over there, it's because of some circumstance about the make up of that world. If the hero, by contrast, was lucky enough to to live in a world where a prediliction for violence isn't a necessity, that is a circumstance too, highly interesting in itself (including for the way it goes against genre convention) and deserves firstly a nod and hopefully some investigation and exploration.

  In short, just make sure that you are treating it as a character trait which exists in the character (who exists in the world) rather than a divine impetus which the world warps itself to make room for and accommodate.

  edit: I'll add a "this is just my take" disclaimer (that was it right there) because it looks like lots of other people have said similar things and I feel obligated to make such a disclaimer when speaking with a crowd.

  - u/mcmchris:
    ```
    Yeah that’s my story! I just love dark and gritty characters. My goal going into writing the MC was more of a question of how could someone who is naturally gentle and somewhat against violence turn into someone who was. That transformation is something I am going to really focus on when I do my next round of edits. I have the bones there I really just need to build it all up more.
