  The Tyrant manages to steal the show even when he isn't featured as more than a letter.
  ```

    ```
    I'm half convinced at this point he's actually totally, 100% serious about this and plans to survive his fated death via the power of friendship. Maybe it'll even let him stop the dead king, because someone has to at this point.
    ```

    - u/notagiantdolphin:
      ```
      Maybe the eternal friendship part is the important bit instead of the surviving part. I mean, the dead king isn't alive and does a pretty good impression of eternal. If he starts talking about 'always being in their hearts' around the hour of his death people should be really worried.

  On the one hand, im always excited for a Black POV, but on the other hand the man is continually accruing death flags to the point i spend half the chapter worrying for his life.

    [I still hope that by the end of the Uncivil Wars he should make himself a Mantle of Calamity with all the avoided death flags stitched onto it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvQqBk12EIA)

  The Tyrant just wants everyone to be his friend! :(

  I have a feeling that Cordelia will let Iserre burn... but what will they gain out of it? The chapter title implies that Cordelia is the one offering the gambit, since Cat is too far away right now and in too deep of a shit to be able to influence things here. Black is pretty weak from enhancing his army continuously... where is the White Knight at? And where'd the Pilgrim go after escaping Callow?

  I concur with Grem, I *really* don't like the shape of this.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Regarding heroes - I don't think any of them would be allowed to pursue the Praesi when there's Dead King on the march. The whole reason Black isn't saving up his Aspects for a battle is because this stretch of the war is about armies and strategical objectives, not narrative wrangling.

    Is there anyone reading who's good enough at chess to analyze the parallels? We know from the beginning of the chapter that Hasenbach needs for someone to catch up with Black, and that Queen's Gambit is an offering of a pawn for furthered control of the centre, but I don't think Black would actually march to Iserre. His biggest advantage is superior marching speed that lets him avoid serious confrontations.

    Still, if the Monday chapter's title isn't "Queen’s Gambit, Accepted", then my guess would be that he'd let Cordelia scorch the earth and would march on Orne instead, so he can dig himself a pass back, but I don't know how that corresponds to the chess theme. Any other ideas?

  ```
  >“Mobility is how they have survived, Your Most Serene Highness,” General Altraste said.

  The gambit is that Black will take Iserre, and then they will somehow trap his army.
  ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  > “Your Highness,” General Altraste said, “may I be frank?” 

  "No," Cordelia replied instantly, "you're really more of a Fantasy Spaniard. I'm the Frank." 

   *ba-dum-tss!*  

  > There are also known proponents of the extermination of all humans  within Imperial borders in the Dominion’s upper ranks, though they  remain a loud minority for now. 

  This struck me as an odd fact about Levantine politics. The Dominion is a Good-aligned human nation, so I'm wondering why they want to exterminate all humans in Praes. Should this have been "all non-humans"? Or are they pushing to literally extinguish Praesi culture down to the last person?
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    They mention the latter in a previous Cordelia POV
    ```

- u/xland44:
  ```
  I don't understand. Didn't the entire first portion of this series focus on Black *not* relying on luck because luck always fails villains eventually? So what's this about rolling the dice?
  ```

  - u/18scsc:
    ```
    Rock. Hard place. He needs food to feed his army.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I really need to know how the fuck the principate functions, beyond “quite well when offscreen.” The fuck is going on there? (also heroes, but that’s a related and less important point).
  ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  Daaamn.

  Cordelia watched her mother sacrifice whole villages to the ratlings to preserve the rest of the Principality.

  No wonder she wouldn't give an inch to Cat, if that's the upbringing she received.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Hopefully Juniper will send Larat.  Black really should fey gate out after they burn Iserre, whether or not Cordelia's trap is any good.  At that point, mission achieved.  Unless Black wants to empower Catherine with a vengeance narrative against a whole country....
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The narrative wouldn't even work, since Black raided Procer for weeks.

    Like he said, it's a dice roll, and he's probably aware what's happening, which is why he dismissed Grem. If it was new to him, he would consider it, like he did the info about the north.
    ```
