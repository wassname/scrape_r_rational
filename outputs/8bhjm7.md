## The influence of random chance or uncontrolled factors?

### Post:

My question is, just how often does rationalist fiction account for or depict unforeseen random events? Especially ones that upset the plans they lay? I ask this as someone relatively new to rational fiction, and thinking of the saying "no plan survives contact with the enemy/reality" (which I've found to be somewhat useful, though not strictly true)

  I would say sometimes, though probably not quite as much as it would happen in real life. It's hard to make entertaining stories about masterminds and intricate plans if you have to be fully realistic about just *how many* things can go wrong with such plans. I'm thinking of alexanderwales' "The Metropolitan Man", for example, and there's at least *one* thing that goes wrong because of an unforeseen weather event - and that has vast repercussions on the plot. Of course "chance" events are a good way to slip in your own hand to direct the plot in one direction or another, but of course it shouldn't be anything too straightforward and unlikely (like "the hero wins this otherwise unwinnable battle because a meteor falls on the enemy's head") because that will break suspension of disbelief.

  Have you heard of quests? There are authors who literally roll die to determine the outcomes of actions chosen by the protagonist (by popular vote). E.g. if they roll 1 out of 100, the protagonist gets a crit fail, which is effectively an unforeseen random event that screws them over. You can find them on sites like sufficientvelocity or spacebattles. (They aren't exactly rationalist though, since the "rationality" of the protagonist is determined by the voters.)

  On the plus side, it adds some level of realism to have the protagonist actually fail unpredictably, just like in real life. On the minus side, it's hard to construct elaborate plots when random die rolls can utterly derail it. E.g. maybe you want a plot where the protagonist's best friend turns out to be a spy for the enemy all along, then suddenly crit fail comes along and the best friend just dies. So now your convoluted schemes for how the best friend will betray the protagonist at the worst possible moment goes straight to the trash.

    This reminds me of The Man in The High Castle, where every time the character reads the I Ching in the novel, Philip K Dick read the I Ching in real life in order to determine where the story would go.

  There do exist (though I haven't delved in to deep), those... I believe they're known as questing websites? Essentially RP type fiction, and I've seen a little on there that's rational. These sorts of stories generally have some random element, being how poorly the MC does in actions and such. Not exactly what you're looking for, but it's a similar idea. Writing around chaos. 

  A true realist fiction could utilise a vast database of the odds of each of their characters, for example, dying in a car crash on any one day. Sounds like a terrible story, but it might be fun.
