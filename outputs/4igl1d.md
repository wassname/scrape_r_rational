  Best part of the chapter, for me.

  ----

  The Vanishing Name chose the situation as "Inside a secure government facility, and about to be found by a woman".

  The second phone call in *The Cracks in the Sky* was in Enochian, which is why it sounded like 16th century capital cities.

  She says "Call me Jane," not "My name is Jane."  

  The numbers for the location of the book translate as follows:  Volume 112 = EFG, Shelf 2270 = BCDEGHL, level 36 = CF.  This doesn't look significant to me, but it might be in Enochian.
  ```

    Volume 112 = EFG = ged-??-pa

    Shelf 2270 = BCDEGHL = un-or-gal-ged-pa-drux-na

    Level 36 = CF = or-??

    From [this clearly reputable defunct Geocities site](http://www.oocities.org/peripsol/Enoch/5EnochianLanguage.htm):

    > Their names and phonetic pronunciations, as written-right to left, are: Pa (B), Veh (C/K), Ged (G/J), Gal (D), Or (F), Un (A), Graph (E), Tal (M), Gon (I/Y), Na (H), Ur (L), Mals (P), Ger (Q), Drux (N), Pal (X), Med (O), Don (R), Ceph (Z), Van (U/V), Fam (S), Gisg (T).

    So ... 2270 = AFDGBNH ... which doesn't seem terribly significant on its own, even if reversed (since Enochian is right to left). It's also entirely possible that a different form of Enochian is being used.

    112 = 7x2^4

    7 I think means "godly". I don't remember any meanings for multiplicative combinations of 4 2s (though 2 itself might have been "evil"?).

    2270 = 10x227

    I think 227 is prime, so that probably has no kabbalistic meaning (unless it's "evil evil godly").

    36 = 3x12

    12 is the number of the tribes of Israel. 3 is probably something important.

    All in all, doesn't seem terribly likely to be a factorisation thing. That's about the limit of my ideas.

  So is "Jane" Sohu? Or did she steal a skyak from an innocent 8 - year-old girl? Or is the one of the Cometspawn and get it loaned to her by Uriel's BFF?
  ```

    ```
    I have no idea, but uniting the Sohu/Comet King storyline with Aaron's is the best idea

    She got up there using a flying kayak. Now, that could be a different flying kayak, but nothing is a coincidence. Also, she's really fast, and is capable of memorizing Names after just two repetitions.

    She also said "Call me Jane" rather than "My name is Jane", which means it's not her name (because of narrative reasons), but she prefers not to lie (probably for religious reasons, or because it's a rational fiction trope to never lie unless the reader knows it's a lie), and her name is important in some way (could be because religious reasons of names having power, because she's someone he would know, or just because while in a government monitored facility you shouldn't use your real name anyways).

    Possible reasons against: she's not 8, and the daughter of the Comet King could probably have easier access without having to break in.

    The last time we saw Sohu being 8 was in 2001, so if she started aging again right after that she would be around 24, so the right age to be Jane. I guess we'll have more information to figure out if it is Sohu the next time we see either Jane or Sohu.

    If she's not Sohu, I'm not sure who she is. That's definitely the greatest possibility, at the moment.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      I'm thinking it's gotta be the same skyak for narrative reasons. The answer to the question "How do you break into a joint government/angelic facility protected from all comers on pain of death?" is a fantastic time to introduce some new and powerful magic unknown or unusable to other actors. The fact that something already known to us (if not to Aaron) was used means that it is important to the story that we be wondering what happened to Sohu (and her skyak).

    Jane and Sohu have the same simplified gematria value of thirty, though not the same traditional gematria value, which is the kind taught in this chapter.

  ```
  I found this story on Tumblr rather than here. And now I see the next update here. I'm not sure if that's the thing where you see a thing in multiple places all at once, or if I'm just really unobservant.

    ```
    You must now find every new chapter through a different method, for kabbalistic reasons. RSS and googling the work ought to count, after that you're on your own.

    Nothing is ever a coincidence.

    - u/Paimon:
      ```
      Of course, how foolish of me to forget.
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        You also encountered the Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, which is named after a German terrorist group in the 1990s.  Aaron Smith-Teller has `aa` and a `-` in his name, and was also born in the 1990s.

        The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon asserts that noticing things repeatedly is not a coincidence, as does Aaron Smith-Teller.

        This is not a coincidence - they both agree on that - which is also not a coincidence.

        Nothing is ever a coincidence, humans just don't notice most of the time.

  I really really expected this chapter to be about Nick Land.
