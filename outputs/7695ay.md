## [D][BST] National Novel Writing Month

### Post:

November is [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/). Does anyone have any plans to do it this year? October has always been my "National Novel *Planning* Month" so that I'm ready to go for when November rolls around.

Here's my advice for anyone in the planning stages:

* Figure out your characters. If you're having trouble with this, just steal from somewhere and strip off the serial numbers. No one is ever going to call you on your main character acting just like Monica from *Friends* so long as you fudge the life details.
* Figuring out characters means asking questions. You don't actually know a character until you know what motivates them, what they fear, etc. For all your principle characters, imagine them in either some stressful situation or faced with a difficult choice, then imagine the resolution.
* Figure out your plot. Dan Harmon's [story circle method](http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_101:_Super_Basic_Shit) is a more basic, more prescriptivist version of [Campbell's monomyth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth). It's very easy to structure plots around it.
* Figuring out your plot means trying your best to link the story beats with "therefore" or "but", not "and". Events which are disconnected from each other are *realistic* but don't tend to make for great writing (this bit of advice is one commonly given by [Matt Stone and Trey Parker](http://www.mtvu.com/video/?vid=689002)).
* Write a single sentence description of each chapter. Then write a single sentence description of each scene within the chapter. It's easier to write a novel (and write a novel *fast*) if you're spending less time stuck looking at the page wondering what happens next (though some of that is unavoidable).

As for making all this *rational*, that's just a matter of what direction you take the story and how hard you can hammer on your worldbuilding and plot, looking for ways that you're failing, then trying to shore them up. A good way to do that is talking to other people to get a different perspective. (Making it *rationalist* is an extra level of difficulty that I wouldn't attempt if I wanted to hit 50,000 words in a month.)

**tl:dr;** So is anyone doing NaNo this year? Any plans you need help with or plots that need a second set of eyes? Any questions of rationality that need to be addressed? [See the wiki page for past discussions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/nanowrimo)

  I have an idea that's been stewing for a couple months, but I keep having false starts on it. The closer we get to November 1st, the closer I get to deciding to just write it then instead of now. Sometimes I wonder if providing writers an excuse to not write is the worst part of NaNoWriMo

  I am plotting a story for NaNoWriMo, in which a alternate version of myself crash lands into a world with magic and decides that now would be a good time to build a plane.

  I have plans for November that aren't exactly NaNoWriMo, but probably close enough for the purposes of this thread. I've been working on a novel for a long time; last year, I finished the fourth first draft of it¹. I'll be trying to rewrite at least the first of three parts of this story for good this November. Once I'm done with that first part, I'd like to try to recruit proofreaders from this subreddit, mostly because I've gotten some very good critiques here in the past.² 

  As for the story: the first part is going to be half clockpunk dystopia and half board game gambling. If anyone is interested in proofreading, reply to this comment or send me a PM, and I'll notify you when the need for proofreading arises, though I also intend to make a post about it at that time.

  You're also welcome to contact me if you want to talk about clockpunk or board game design! Only one of the five games that will be featured in the first part has fully functioning rules at this point, and I'd love to increase that number.

  ***

  ¹: Yes, the fourth first draft is still a first draft.

  ²: Stories I've previously posted to this subreddit include *The Library Unpublished*, *On the Continuity of Consciousness* and a number of short stories for the biweekly challenges.

  Is there going to be a sticky thread or normal thread where everyone can post their respective stories. 

  Might be a good idea to help us all keep track of each other. Give everyone the opportunity to be held accountable, to a certain degree, if they would like. I know stuff like that usually helps me.

    I will probably do a weekly thread, but it won't be sticky this time as it has been in past years, because we already have two. The plan will be to post one every week for check-ins.
