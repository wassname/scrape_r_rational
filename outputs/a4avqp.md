## How can I get an alert when a new Chapter drops?

### Post:

I'm all caught up with mother of learning, been checking every day for the next Chapter.

Is there a way of just getting a notification?

  Get him on patreon, 1$ per chapter
  ```

    Correct answer right here. Cheap AND Supports the author.

  ```
  If you create an account on Fictionpress, you can follow a story or author to get email notifications.
  ```

- u/silver7017:
  ```
  the author posts when the next chapter will drop in his bio, and he tends to warn ahead of time if a chapter will be late on his patreon. no need to check every day.
  ```

  I have a IFTTT applet that says: if on reddit there's a new post from search: "subreddit: rational title: mother of learning" than send me a notification. Sometimes I get a false positive but it works for me. [Example image.](https://i.imgur.com/fOuLbRH.jpg)

  I have one of those also for Worth the Candle, Ward, One Punch Man, The Tutorial is Too Hard, etc.

  Click the author's profile and he has expected release dates.

  Additionally, get an RSS feed reader.

  There are also browser add-ons that monitor a page for changes periodically and notify you. Use google.
