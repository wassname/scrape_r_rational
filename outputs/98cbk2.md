## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

    You have a free GPS system, while other people need to pay for it. Except their GPS doesn't need them to see the sky, while yours does. Not exactly useful unless GPS systems crash.

    On the other hand, if your power works on pictures that is a whole other thing. You can become an awesome detective, since any picture that includes a bit of sky immediately lets you know where the picture was taken. For example, if a kidnapper sends a photo of his victim and there's a window behind him where you can see the sky? You instantly know his location. You can also check for frauds and false alibis, comparing the location of photos that your ability tells you versus your suspects' claims of where they were.

    There's another question here: does your ability only work on Earth? If you see the martian sky through a robot's visual feed, can you tell the exact location of a mars robot? You can get a job at NASA and remotely control robots on other planets to map them out.

    What about generated pictures? Do you know where a 5-year-old girl thought her house is by looking at her painting of it?

    How detailed do the pictures need to be? If someone reduces a number of images of the sky to a pixel each, sends them to you, and you look at it, can you deduce a secret message containing more information than was sent over the wire?

    Well the ability to tell where pictures/video were taken if they include sky is likely going to let you make a good deal of money by working with intelligence organizations and the like.          
    However your best bet is probably to just make your ability known and then make money off the fame of being the only known person to have superpowers. That would likely compromise your ability to use your power to stop criminals/terrorists, however you would be making vastly more money this way and could probably do more good with the money than you could actually doing anything with your power directly.

  You are given the opportunity to permanently change how much sleep you need, with the following catch: time dilates so the quantity of subjective experience available to you as a result of this decision does not change. Which is to say that for however much more or less sleep you now require of yourself, your previous amount of waking awareness gets spread out over the time during which you are awake. So if you normally need 8h of sleep per 24h and alter yourself to need 4h of sleep, your newfound 20h of wakefulness gets spread out over 16h of experience, and you move through the world as if 20% slower in all respects. Conversely, if you require of yourself extra sleep and go from needing, say, 8h to 16h, you perceive the remaining 8h/24h of wakefulness twice as fast, so as to still "experience" 16h. Both your thoughts and your movements, reactions, and other physical processes are accelerated or deaccelerated accordingly. The gained or lost wakeful time is compensated by an opposite effect applied to your sleeping body. Should technology be developed to reduce the need for sleep by over 50% and you use it, you return to your prior, undilated sleep schedule (so something like melatonin would be fine, but any scifi brain-rejuvenators would not. This does not apply to behavioral change available to you now, e.g. short-polyphasic sleep schedules). You can also willingly cancel the effect  -- but will never be able to reinstate it upon doing so. You still get sleepy after a normal amount of wakeful experience, and feel rejuvenated after a normal amount of dormant experience. The effect is applied on a cellular basis, and any matter incorporated into your cells sees the effect take place. You interact with external objects as if they had proportionally higher or lower energy.

  Would there be any benefit to accepting this effect, and in which direction? Would you change anything, or do you currently occupy a global optimum? I think I'd be tempted to require of myself an extra hour of sleep, and thereby give myself a slight edge in any for of competition. The change in pitch and information transfer from others wouldn't be too noticeable, either, and I imagine I'd quickly acclimate. More extreme amounts (e.g. 2x-5x waking speedup) would let me dominate at sport but I think the impact on day-to-day life would be too burdensome. I guess in all cases you could donate or sell your services to Scienceâ„¢ to see if the effect could be better understood.

  Also, is there any exotic, physics-y munchkinry to be had with the power as described (or interpreted)? The time dilation effect seems like it could result in some wonkiness at the extremes -- if you compress 8h of sleep into a second, it seems any minute, dreamy fidget would find you thrumming with vast energies. Even more if you compress your wakeful time into a second, and zip around like Quicksilver (but without any required secondary powers). If these sorts of considerations dominate your response, consider also the alternate scenario where the main effects of the power are the same, but they're accomplished by more mundane means -- your metabolism slows or accelerates biochemically, your nerve conduction velocity increases or decreases through improved myelination or whatever, your muscle fibers restructure to expand or contract more or less forcefully, etc. So that the lived experience is ultimately the same, but doesn't require reality warping, just hyperadvanced alien surgery.

      Won't living with a slower reaction time kind of suck though? Any sort of competitive sport, or competitive gaming would become so much harder.

    The problem with slowing yourself down and eliminating the need for sleep is if  you have a job that requires brainpower, you won't be as good as it as you used to be, so you might get fired or demoted if you started working 30% slower.

    Actually even if you have a job flipping burgers, doing it 30% slower would be cause for a firing, too.

    Then again, most offices have the proverbial person who works 30% slower than everyone else and seems not to be fired. But I'd still worry about maintaining friendships with intelligent people: all of a sudden I'd be thinking and talking etc 30% slower than everyone else, and I feel like if one of my friends got THIRTY PERCENT SLOWER they'd seem to change personality a lot: no longer with quick witty rejoinders, stuff like that.

    As someone else pointed out, it'd make a lot of everyday situations better (getting places faster when you drive, lectures are sped up a bit, etc), but I think the stuff that I actually value - like friendship - would go slower.

    Not to mention that you'd all of a sudden be 30% slower at writing and thinking and all of a sudden a 3 hour exam would require 4 hours to do. You'd have to see if you could get diagnosed with some learning disability (probably not hard if you're 30% slower!) and then get special consideration that way to have more time for the exam.

      I think you can train to do a lot of things faster though, like talking, walking, driving, etc., things you don't normally go as fast as you can because it would bother other people if you collided with them at full speed or talked so fast no one understands what you are saying. If you get 33.3% slower, you can just train to do things 50% faster in your subjective time. It will take a while to retrain all your skills to be 50% faster, but I suspect it is easier than it sounds.

        I already talk too quickly so talking 30% slower might benefit me. 

        I don't think I'll be able to think 50% faster, which means I'll be 30% slower than all my friends, and not to sound elitist or anything but my friends tend to be smart people, and while I'm sure they'd still love me just the same, I probably would become less fun to be around and would have trouble making new friends of the same calibre.

    I would probably change it so I need no sleep at all. 16 hours stretched over 24 hours means my brain moves at 2/3rd of the speed, sure, but I don't particularly have any time-stressful situations in my daily life that I need to think fast for. At best, there are tasks to complete by  a certain day, but 2/3rd speed over 24 hours gets the same amount of work done as normal speed over 16 hours anyway (if not more work done since there are other time consuming things involved with work that don't depend on my mind/body).

    I mean, you can go the other extreme and need 23hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds of sleep to go stupidly fast whenever you're awake, but that's a really shitty superpower when you can only use it for 1 second a day and spend the rest of the time comatose and vulnerable.

    I don't know about ordinary life, but you could become a super-hero/soldier/agent if you compressed your wake time down by a factor of 2 or 3, or more.  They could shuttle you around in a helicopter while you're asleep, and then take you to places where you're needed, then you wake up and go obliterating people so fast they couldn't keep up or realize what's going on.

    This would require you to basically devote your life to this super combat thing, and it'd still be dangerous even if you're really fast, but perhaps you could broker a deal with the government to do this for a fixed amount of years with an extremely high salary and then disable it and retire afterwards.

    Well I'm assuming that if you sleep extra to speed up your perception that your lifespan remains the same despite the sped up metabolism, after all if you don't assume this then your waking lifespan would likely end up being subjectively shorter. Similarly it seems like you need to assume slowing down your experience actually extends your lifespan otherwise your lifespan is also subjectively shortened. 

    Anyway if it were just a metabolic effect then speeding yourself up by sleeping extra could let you make a lot of money by either being the only known human with superpowers (at the extreme end) or just become very wealthy as a professional athlete.           
    However because your body is actually defying physics I think the best bet is getting rid of sleep entirely. You'd perceive everything as being 33% faster however that's manageable. Additionally picking the maximum amount of time dilation is in your best interest, because while it in theory doesn't increase your subjective lifespan, in practice it does increase the chance you live long enough to see anti-aging tech developed. Also notable is that since your body is blatantly in violation of physics (I suspect you might be able to use it to violate thermodynamics, but can't figure out how) you can probably become pretty rich off of the fame of being the only known supernatural phenomenon.
