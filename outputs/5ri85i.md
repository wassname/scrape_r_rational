  Then, just twelve minutes after the last person with knowledge of the deceit died, scientists figured out how to convert non-mages into mages.

    Self-deception is a black swan bet, whether as an individual or a group - and even if only a few members of the group get to choose whether to deceive or not.

      What's a black swan bet?

        It's a bet that has a very low chance of going wrong, but if/when it does, it wipes out all the gains you make plus a bit more (so the expected utility of it is negative, even if the odds of the bad part happening are super low).

        It's like if you used the statement 'all swans are white' as an example of a certainty, and then someone discovered an entire new continent you had no way of knowing even existed and it had black swans on it (i.e. Australia). It's a pretty convincing deathblow to the notion of certainty.

    The deceit is in the code itself which apparently isn't completely hidden in the time of the story (Fentwick discovered it by looking at  code then asked Gavin).

    The story doesn't go into it, and isn't part of any continuity, but some of the base was [this post](http://alexanderwales.com/world-building-minorities/), originally an entry into the weekly challenge for /r/worldbuilding (prompt "Minorities"). Also the basis for a half-completed book sitting in my drafts folder.

  I like it, but I feel like there's something missing. Maybe it's just because I've seen this kind of reveal done before in other rational fiction that it feels like a cliche at this point. The story has some interesting ideas and I do like how it explores the relationship between scientists/engineers and the people who use their creations, but the direction it goes just seems rote and uninspired. I shouldn't be too hard on this thing since it does exactly what it's supposed to and does it perfectly well, I just found the reveal and ending a bit underwhelming.
