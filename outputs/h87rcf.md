  To be accountable for something, you must have had the ability to stop it. And while the Foundation might like to pretend that it could have stopped SCP-3125, the reality is that there would be little more sense in holding the Foundation responsible than there would be a child. They fought, to the best of their ability, intelligently and ceaselessly, and they lost anyway. How could they have not?

  But I'm still glad to see an O-5 at least thinking about the question of how to do better.

      This is not at all obvious to me. I can think of more, and more specific ways that 3125 is different from Covid than similar (and no I don't count "one is fiction, the other real" in that).
      ```

          None of these point to Covid with any sort of specificity. They are quite generic post disaster observations that could apply to every disaster, and so can't really point to any of them specifically. 

          Well, except the 100 years thing. That is an awfully optimistic timeline for the O5 to have about most sorts of disasters. As for epidemics specifically, Ebola was a thing 4 years ago, H1N1 was only 10 years ago. 

          To put it another way, do you think a reader 20 years from now would read this epilogue and immediately jump to "2020 Covid" or would something more recent come more readily to mind?
          ```

          - u/ThatEeveeGuy:
            ```
            100 years would be a reference to the Spanish Flu pandemic in the COVID-19 context. I agree the rest is broadly applicable, but I take that more as general commentary on disaster response with a nod to current events thrown in (that, yes, readers in the future may well simply miss)
            ```

            - u/JJReeve:
              ```
              100 years gets you back to Spanish flu sure, or it might just be a nice round number. It would also be very ironic if it were a deliberate reference to pandemic in that sense, since you skip over a few epidemics to get there. 
              Consider,
              "Are we going to have to do this again in 100 years?"
              "Nah, this sort of thing happens every 10 years or so... you forgot about a few of those didn't you?"

              As for future readers missing things; the thing about references, or at least obvious references, is that they tend to be hard to miss and date the work they appear in.
              ```

  ```
  So, questions never answered:

  How did Michael Li get compromised? The __The Fuller Memorandum__ approach doesn't make sense here.

  How did he get a gun into the Vegas Room?

  What was up with Grey, Clay, Red, etc.? How were they connected to 3125?

  Ditto for the spiders?
  ```

  - u/HA2HA2:
    ```
    Red: he was a useful pawn for 3125. He thought he was "in control" and letting the thing in. He was not; he was a figurehead, a mascot, who pretended that he was more. 

    Clay, Grey: they're antimemetic anomalies. As far as I can tell they aren't directly connected to 3125 except in the sense that they're all antimemes; you could make the case that the reason all these antimemetic anomalies are cropping up is because they're all "facets" of 3125 in a form, or 3125 is making it easier for antimemes to appear, or something. 

    No idea on how or why Li got compromised. 

    Getting a gun into the vegas room - probably less important than understanding how he got compromised, I'm personally ok with handwaving that as "yeah, it's possible to break the security if you're an insider". 

    No idea on the spiders. O5-8 even asks about them in wild light.
    ```

    - u/VorpalAuroch:
      ```
      I couldn't find them/him named, but the humanoids riding the spiders in *Unforgettable* and *Immemorial* are very similar to Gray and Clay, so they're connected to 3125 in a stronger sense than that. I believe there was a third __ay name but I couldn't find it. Given that they're also 3125 vectors, it would be very unusual for there to be two types of humanoid, embodied, deliberate 3125 vectors which weren't the same type, if not quite the same 'breed'.
      ```

      - u/pleasedothenerdful:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure the human who rides the spiders is Red, the cult leader from [Ojai](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ojai). I believe he was wounded by Marion's gunshots in [Unforgettable, That's What You Are](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unforgettable-that-s-what-you-are). This is alluded to in [Immemorial](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/immemorial). Red also appeared briefly at the end of [Unthreaded](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unthreaded). That body was killed by Adam Wheeler at the end of [Blood-Brain](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/blood-brain).
        ```

        - u/VorpalAuroch:
          ```
          Re-reading the end of Blood-Brain, I'm mostly convinced. The first two appearances seem much more similar to Gray/Clay than to Red, but the Blood-Brain description makes it very clear he's been the same entity all three times and identifies with humanity much more than Gray/Clay did.
          ```

      - u/UnderTheHole:
        ```
        4 days late (trying to understand the entire canon post-epilogue here), but the third humanoid antimeme is Elizabeth Day in the SCP-SCP-033 tale. In the comments, she is described as "de-aging people so that, from their perspective, certain memories never even formed." What's interesting, though, is that Liz actually defected over to the Foundation.
        ```

  - u/SansFinalGuardian:
    ```
    first two weren't, for the third reread ojai.
    ```

    - u/VorpalAuroch:
      ```
      Barsin thinks the human invited 3125 in, but Barsin is way out of his depth and should be assumed to be totally misunderstanding the situation.
      ```

      - u/SansFinalGuardian:
        ```
        eh. fairly sure it's implied he perceived the truth.
        ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  "We failed orders of magnitude harder than we've ever failed before."

  SCP-2000 suggests (or more to the point, has already suggested) not.  >.>
  ```

  - u/JJReeve:
    ```
    Part of this depends on how you measure the order of magnitude of the failure. SCP-2000 indicates previous extinction level events that it was then used to fix. It would have been powerless to help against 3125 however, even assuming it wasn't compromised when the SCP manifested fully any clone army it tried to make to fight back would have been the moment they left. An argument could be made that this means 3125 is worse than the threats that 2000 has already helped correct.
    ```

- u/fljared:
  ```
  I really like the ending here. After all this, after killing a god-thing, there real terror is that you'll never know what or why or how.

  And you'll never know how many times its happened before or how to stop it again.
  ```
