## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  How do you set up identity confirmation?

  Here's the story so far: someone has stolen the emperor's soul, leaving him in a vegetative state. After some hard work, the soul has been recovered. However, because all souls look alike, it's impossible to know whether it's actually the emperor's soul without having some method of identity confirmation. Obviously it would be a disaster if someone else's soul was put into the emperor's body and they began to rule in his stead.

  Ideally, this method of identity confirmation would not be possible to circumvent or subvert.

    Did they consider this possibility in advance?  Are there mind-reading spells?  If yes and no: plain old spell-out-the-password?  (E.g. I say E, you say Q, I say F, you say R, etc.)
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      The idea has been considered in advance, and there are no ways of reading minds. (Speaking to a soul itself is impossible; you can only speak to a soul-body pair, as a body without a soul is vegetative, while a soul without a body is inert.)

      The problem I have with call-response pairs is that you place a whole lot of power into the hands of the questioner, who can simply say "no, this is not the emperor" to get rid of the emperor, or can give the answers to some third party to take over the emperor's seat (or, if the answers aren't written down anywhere, simply pretend that the correct answers were given). Worse, there's a possibility that the emperor could be coerced into giving up his half of the pair if he's left alone for long enough (because souls can be taken out and put into different bodies, there are quite a few forms of torture available).
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        The simplest solution would be a password stored in a sealed box kept in a secure enough place. You have the emperor write down his password, then you break the box, and anyone can check whether the emperor gave the right password. Add in a second coercion-specific password just in case, and you have a secure-ish system, especially if the emperor writes and seals the password himself.

        Inventive solution, a bit more costly: recover the Emperor's journal. Have a trusted aide read through the journal, and designate a random event of the Emperor's life that he would undoubtedly remember upon prompting, but potential torturers probably wouldn't think to ask. The process should be done in a way that lets everyone confirm that the event does come from the journal, but doesn't let anyone but the aide actually access the rest of the journal. This one is less reliable than it sounds since memory isn't as accurate as we tend to think.
        ```

        ```
        If everyone is untrusted all of the time, there doesn't seem to be any possible process that "confirms" the Emperor, because everyone could just be like 'lolnope' at the conclusion.  Can I have 5 people of whom it is assumed that at most 2 are untrustworthy?  Can I have a complex artifact that's stored where it can't be taken out without the Senate knowing about it?
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          The solution that I'm currently planning on using is a council of 7 with at least 5 having to agree that it's actually the emperor. Didn't want to poison discussion by saying that outright though, and I think it's got its own problems to be thought through (such as whether you need to confirm the identities of the identity confirmers).

          You can have a complex artifact stored securely somewhere, though the technology level I'm using is pre-computers. (If you have a post-computer artifact in mind, I'd still like to hear it.)
          ```

            > The solution that I'm currently planning on using is a council of 7 with at least 5 having to agree that it's actually the emperor

            Wait, wouldn't the emperor just execute the two councilmen who lie about his identity? (it might not be a lie if the verification is through personality tests instead of reciting passwords, but you know what I mean)

            > (such as whether you need to confirm the identities of the identity confirmers).

            If stealing someone's soul and replacing it with another one without anyone noticing is possible, then organized governments would probably have routine identity checks, so the vetters probably have to be vetted as well at some point.

            > You can have a complex artifact stored securely somewhere, though the technology level I'm using is pre-computers. (If you have a post-computer artifact in mind, I'd still like to hear it.)

            What stops them from using written, sealed passwords? As long as the seal is easy to authenticate (for instance, a complex, unmovable, publicly visible piece of masonry inside the palace), no one will doubt the results no matter how untrustworthy the councilmen are.
            ```

              The emperor would have to be pretty short-sighted to do that. If everyone is going to vote "yes" out of fear of execution, then the verification council doesn't actually work. The council needs to be able to vote what they actually believe to be true.

              > If stealing someone's soul and replacing it with another one without anyone noticing is possible, then organized governments would probably have routine identity checks, so the vetters probably have to be vetted as well at some point.

              I'm sort of on the fence about how often routine identity checks need to be done. Taking over a person's entire life seems like it would be quite difficult, since if you're the imposter, you need to know virtually everything about the person whose life you're taking over. That means a gathering a huge amount of intelligence. So maybe for people high up in the government, but I think it would be kept fairly simple, unless there's a strong insurgency that has a history of trying to take over bodies. There's a trade-off of security and inconvenience, not to mention that a culture of paranoia comes with its own costs (like false positives).

              > What stops them from using written, sealed passwords? As long as the seal is easy to authenticate (for instance, a complex, unmovable, publicly visible piece of masonry inside the palace), no one will doubt the results no matter how untrustworthy the councilmen are.

              Sealed passwords work. There is a fairly significant problem of them only working *once* though. For example, if the emperor's soul is taken and a soul is recovered that's believed to be his, once the authentication fails, the password is now known to several people and you're back in the same position of needing trust (beyond the trust you need to place in your guards and whoever is doing the verification to ensure that they won't make a new password with a new seal under cover of nightfall). Sending in a sacrificial lamb has a lot of costs for whatever conspiracy you suspect might happen, and you can mitigate the possibility somewhat by sealing in multiple passwords ... I don't know. It depends on how many levels of play and counter-play are expected, and which direction the conspiracy is expected to come from. (You don't just worry about those who would try to replace the emperor, you worry about those who would use an opportunity to get rid of him.)

                >The emperor would have to be pretty short-sighted to do that.

                If a councilman thinks it's an imposter, he doesn't know that he won't be executed if he says it's an imposter, because the imposter, not the emperor, is the one with executive power.

                >There is a fairly significant problem of them only working once though.

                Keep a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptex (vinegar-sealed miniature vault containing, say, a signature from each councilman) on the emperor's person. Whoever can destroy the Cryptex can destroy the emperor's body.

    Further data about that world is needed to know how to confirm a soul.  Are souls the vital spark that provides motivation to move?  Do they hold memories?  Are they an interface between the brain, magic, and the body?  Without knowing what they do in your setting we can't know how to identify them.
    ```

      Things you get from your body:

      * Physical strength

      * Muscle memory

      * Looks

      * Some amount of attraction (pheromones)

      * Some varieties of mental problems

      * Most instinctual responses

      * Sex

      Things you get from your soul:

      * Most emotions

      * Rational thought

      * Memories

      * Some amount of attraction (intellectual)

      * Some varieties of mental problems

      * Gender

      Souls by themselves experience nothing (since senses are biological) and cannot communicate (because they cannot experience or move).
      ```

      - u/Sparkwitch:
        ```
        If emotions are only partially in the soul, you could implement something like the [Voight-Kampff test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner#Voight-Kampff_machine) to compare autonomic reactions (breathing, heartrate, blood pressure, sweating, eye-movement) to somatic ones (words, gestures, facial expressions). Instead of focusing on empathy to find vat-grown brains, the test would probably include emotional moments from the emperor's life and could be compared to his known soul's previous results on a similar test.

        There is some risk a significantly traumatized emperor could fail his own test, so it might be best to include other methods as well.

  I'm in the process of practicing a lot of futurism for the city of Pittsburgh, PA.

  As such I've been digging into the available city planning, exploring the city via street view, poking at blogs about how they hate the city. poking at blogs of people that love the city.

  And just spending a lot of time thinking about my own (nearly twenty years out of date) impressions of that part of the country.

  Anyone have their own suggestions or resources or anecdotes about Pennsylvania/Pittsburgh that would be useful to build a more accurate projection of the next thirty years of history for that part of the world?

  Once again, building on a yet-to-be-revised badly written [plot summary](https://github.com/kiba/Writings/blob/master/gaia/plot.md) for a trans-dimensional story...

  I am considering options to resolve the sheer coincidence of our protagonist encountering his doppelganger mother. 

  The best resolution I can think of is that it's actually peculiar to our traveler's method of travel. 

  When he jumped to that particular reality, he didn't jump into another Earth, but literally a different planet. That means he didn't travel into another universe that happens to just branch five second ago(or really just nanoseconds). That would be 'closest' if we take closest to mean the most similar realities. 

  Trans-dimensional bullshit handwavium rules doesn't do traveling to branching timeline. That is impossible. In that sense, for all intent and purpose, there is no other 'version' of our protagonist from a different timeline taking a different path resulting in a slightly different outcome. 

  It is technically possible to travel to an adjacent reality that doesn't branch off from ours, though it is very difficult to do so.

  Most realities resembling ours have a difficulty rating of 10 out of 10. You would need extremely advanced capability in order to travel to ours...or there is somehow a process or a unique ability to bypass that restriction.

  Our protagonist have that unique one-of-a-kind ability to navigate to worlds. He acquired a trans-d shard that allowed him to travel all the other shards, more importantly understanding the physics of how trans-d work, which allowed him to engineer the trans-d drive to allow him to jump in the first place. It is also one of very few shards that's actually in any working condition. Most shard are broken, sometime even driving their host to madness, or to the point of causing a failure cascade in a particular reality on a fundamental level. (No, there is no maliciousness or any sort of agencies. So you don't have to worry about evil space whales, but there is a need for a story of sort to explain where the shards come from)

  Therefore: 

  * There are many versions of him across realities with basically the same base personality and DNA. The shards fuzzy match all instances of our protagonist. 
  * It isn't strange for him to repeatedly encounter his mother across realities as that where the shards are. Details can change, sometime dramatically.
  * Travel will take him to places far and wide across trans-reality, and close to his reality as well as the shards, finite in numbers, are spread across reality.

  Other than that, I don't have any concept for the background story of the trans-reality shard, or if different shards has different mechanics. I don't try to dwell too much because my stories tend to be limited to a few worlds at most, but I do feel that should be some kind of background.

  One proposal in my mind is that the shard are created by a form of magic by wizard instance of our character as a form of 'fuck you' or a final desperation move. Or maybe he could have done it to gather power, reasoning that instances of individuals like him will eventually meet up and work to build an empire? I guess if the shard are broken, the process for making it is either flawed or rushed.

  Anyway, I hope my justification for the sheer coincidence of our protagonist meeting his mother works good enough.

  P.S. It appears that it took me thirty minutes to write this post? That's work, I guess.

  Anyone have any serious experience with higher dimensional math? I am looking to more formally settle an idea regarding spirits/souls simply being being material in higher dimensional space.

  The issue is determining how many degrees of freedom are needed above the three spacial dimensions (and one temporal).
  Ideally they would be Euclidean as I understand the rules for that but I may have to change that based on how things work out.
  ```

  - u/Pwrong:
    ```
    I'm not entirely sure what you're asking, but dimensions are pretty much synonymous with degrees of freedom. A 3-dimensional space has three degrees of freedom, a 4-dimensional space has four degrees of freedom. A simple way to define the dimension of a space is "how many numbers do I need to find a point in the space?"

    Euclidean space has many symmetries and no absolute axes, scale or origin. You can't point in some direction and say "that's the 2nd dimension". Minkowski space (3 space + 1 time) has different symmetries, there is a clear difference between space and time.

    If you have a sort of 5D (3 space + 1 time + 1 spirit) spirit world, such that the physical world we see is a 3+1-dimensional cross section of that (technically, probably a submanifold) then you're introducing an asymmetry. Either (A) that asymmetry is a fundamental aspect of how space-time-spirit works, or (B) the asymmetry is simply a consequence of the fact that this physical world submanifold happens to be sitting there. If it's (A) then your space is not going to be Euclidean or Minkowski space, it'll be something fundamentally different because of the new asymmetry. 

    If it's (B), then you could make things work like simple 4+1 (or higher) Minkowski space if you want to. So at least you'd know how light works in the spirit world. Then you'd just have to figure out the nature of the physical world submanifold. How does matter in the higher space interact with the physical world in such a way that it *seems* like spirits and souls, and how does all the regular matter stick to the physical world instead of floating away? It'd be really cool to see good answers to those questions.
