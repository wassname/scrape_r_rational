## [Biweekly Challenge] Happy Stories

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4qie80/biweekly_challenge_reverse_portal_fantasy/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Reverse Portal Fantasy". The winner was /u/Sailor_Vulcan with their story, [5000 PE](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4qie80/biweekly_challenge_reverse_portal_fantasy/d4vvzq6). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/Sailor_Vulcan!

##### This Time

This time, we'll be doing "Happy Stories". Any genre, any subject, so long as it's happy (and, obviously, rational). I'm issuing this challenge partly because a lot of rational fiction deals with darker themes and subjects, and partly because I'm personally incapable of writing anything optimistic or light. (I try my best to make sure that multiple ideas can be easily generated for these challenges, and my immediate thought for this one was the existential horror of wireheading. Please don't write something like that.) Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, July 27th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, we'll be doing "Superheroes". Pick your favorite universe or franchise to riff on, or make up a hero of your own. This is a great time to write some fanfic.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 7/27.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4sq0v8/challenge_companion_happy_stories/).

    (Non-humans not dreaming breaks the suspension of disbelief (given what is already observed), and I wonder about the ability of the Dreamers to cope with each waking day without neglecting their health and daytime activities, but otherwise an interesting idea.)
