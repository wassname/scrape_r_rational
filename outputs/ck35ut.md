  >Itâ€™d taken hours to father fifty thousand drown

  That's some stamina.

  Edit: well, one of these two typos was fixed. Still concerned about the 50k drowning victims.

    Come to think of it, given how old he is compared to the average drow Rumena is probably a great ^ x grandfather of most of the modern drow population
    ```

      ```
      But Drow don't like to smash, unless it involves death. So maybe Great^x Uncle(?) Rumena. Did we ever get a gender confirmation on this guy?

        ```
        I'm pretty sure Rumena still goes by he, given that he was around before Night fell.
        ```

  ```
  I just realized.

  The Drow are going to kill Death.

  God damn it, I don't know if this is going to end well or not, seeing as this is what they were trying to do anyways.

  I love how the only person Cat can really outplay in the social sphere is her own Marshal. I wonder what The First Prince feels about forcing the issue of no Named in the lead of nations when the Procer nation is basically the one major player without a tradition of Named leadership. Minus the Ashur so far at least.
