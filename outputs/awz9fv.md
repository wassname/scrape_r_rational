  I like this nic. Being proactive instead of reacting to stuff. Maybe soon we’ll start reading about how much of a badass he’s becoming.
  ```

    Is it proactive?  The initial suggestion for the training regime came from Hewt.
    ```

  I thought the demons couldn't lie? Though I suppose the Librarian is not technically a demon, which could explain how she can pose as different people.

  Interesting that Nic is attempting to take a firm grasp of the direction he moves in rather than continuing the trend of being swept up in the plans of others. However, he seems to have failed immediately as it turns out him taking this active role was actually the plan of the Librarian the whole time.

    I'm not sure we've had a proper hint to what the Librarian is yet. Sure, vaguely similar to demons. Maybe one of them post whatever change it is they seek? A time travelling Nic? Dizzy in a long coat sitting on Simole's shoulders?
    ```

    - u/Riyonak:
      ```
      The only hint we've gotten, I believe is from the Librarian herself in Book One Chapter 49

      >“Because,” said the Librarian, “I am not a demon.”

      >Dizzy seemed to buckle, the words causing her discomfort. “Then what are you?”

      >To Davo, the Librarian seemed to shrink. “I am a failure. I failed to protect those in my charge. I lost everything to a world full of pettiness and greed, of small minds and narrow thought. And yet it was enough to defeat me.” Her sadness grew to fill the small dome they were in.

      >“You work for them,” said Dizzy. “You are one of them.”

      >“Yes, and no. I am nothing like them. This body is real. Once it is destroyed, so am I. I would appreciate if you didn’t try to break it again. The repairs are exhausting. The only magic I can affect comes from these.” She held up the small box again. The gem glinted. “Without it, I am no more powerful than you.”

      So someone whose cause was defeated in the past, not a mage (or at least not a conventional one since non demon magic has already essentially been confirmed), and someone with a tenuous connection to the demons. This points to her ACTUALLY being Davo in a trenchcoat standing on Fanny's shoulders.
      ```

  ```
  So not only did Hewt (or whoever he really is) fool Nic, he also fooled Davo, Fanny, and even Brill into thinking he was Brill's younger brother? That's some weird magic.
  ```

  ```
  >The back door to the library was open. He went in and made his >way up to the top floor. The hatch was open and the ladder had >been lowered for him. He climbed up into the mirrored room. Mr >Periwinkle was waiting for him.

  >“Hello, Nic,” **she** said.

  Heck!
  ```

- u/Rice_22:
  ```
  Where did it say before that Brill was an only child?
  ```

  - u/FluffyLittleOwl:
    ```
    It was probably first mentioned before chapter 35 where it seems to be a fact known to the group

    > Brill picked up his fork and began eating his pasta again, aggressively.

    > “He seems upset,” said Fanny. “Abandonment issues due to being an only child, I expect. The pompous whining is a dead give away.”

    > “I’m also an only child,” said Davo.

    > “I know,” said Fanny.

  Low key enjoying Deeper Darker more atm. Feel like there's a void in Sci-Fi ever since TheGam3 ended.
