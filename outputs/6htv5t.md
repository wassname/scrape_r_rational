## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  [This Pathfinder spell](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/spells/bestowCurse.html). My character in that campaign has acquired the ability to cast it, but the means of doing so makes it useless offensively. However, I can place curses on *myself* without issues, which is where I need ideas for technically-harmful-but-circumstantially-beneficial curses, like "You cannot lie" -> "Your magically enforced honesty is a boon to negotiation."

    There was a really clever moment in Gargoyles:

    > "All right, big guy. I'm holding the spell. That means you have to do what I say. I order you to act for the rest of your life exactly as you would if you were not under a spell." 

    Tweak the wording and you could do something similar.  You'd technically be under a curse to obey someone.  That sucks.

    But since you're obeying yourself, it doesn't have much practical effect beyond blocking any lesser mind-control spells.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      Step 1: "I curse myself to act exactly as if I was not mind controlled at all times."

      Step 2: you meet Heartbreaker (or story equivalent).

      Now you're screaming inside forever... because you want to obey Heartbreaker but your curse keeps you from doing it.
      ```

      - u/entropizer:
        ```
        If you're acting exactly as if you're not mind controlled, you would still choose to avoid situations which are likely to bring you into contact with mind controllers. A lot of the advantage of the defense is nullified by the stipulation that you must act as if the defense does not exist.
        ```

        - u/ArgentStonecutter:
          ```
          That's what everyone says before they meet a mind controller.

    A regular curse triggered by a command word, to be used by an ally when you are charmed. On the other hand, this makes you vulnerable to enemy spies and diviners.

    Have you consulted your DM about the permissibility of such shenanigans?

    Are you sure it's useless offensively? Consider [Spectral Hand](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spectral-hand/) when you have time for buffs.

  You have the power to instantly 'reflect' yourself. Anything that happens to the right side of your body (injuries, muscle fatigue) can be switched to the left and vice versa.

  This includes your body position, including internal organs, as though you just swapped places with the person in the mirror.

  Also applies to things you are wearing or holding* (*if you are physically capable of lifting them yourself)

        It tastes the same as normal, right-handed sugar, but the body doesn't absorb it. Diabetics can have it, it has all the same properties as far as baking, browning, etc. go, and it doesn't cause or exacerbate tooth decay. It's 0 calories, obviously.

        It's also really expensive to produce, which is why it's not currently commercially viable. Of course, your ability to make money is limited by how many pounds you can do in a day.

          I'm fighting an urge not to look stupid by just coming out and asking... is this a joke-answer I don't understand, or does this refer to something specific?

            This is a real thing. [Chirality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry\)) is a chemical property of some molecules; using the same building blocks, and the same basic arrangement of bonds and atoms, you can build a molecule that's *almost*, but not quite, the same as the mirror version.

            Pretty much all sugars derive from natural sources, and pretty much all of those sources produce D-sucrose, the sugar that we all know and love. However, if you do a lot of stuff in the lab, you can produce L-sucrose, which is the same as D-sucrose except with the bonds mirrored. To your taste buds, it's the same, but to the bacteria in your mouth and to your stomach, it's unprocessable. Everything that makes sugar makes D-sucrose, so we haven't evolved to deal with L-sucrose since it's not found in nature.

            (I was on a drug called Celexa for awhile; the process that makes it makes a left-handed and right-handed version of the molecule, where only one of those actually does the proper SSRI thing it's supposed to and the other is basically useless/detrimental. Lexapro has the useless part removed, but it costs more, so they only prescribe it if you have symptoms. You need half as much Lexapro as you need Celexa, because it's removing the half that doesn't do anything.)

              Yeah, I vaguely remember hearing about this before, and was mostly curious as to why "mirroring" it would have that effect, like whether it literally resulted from a shift in the molecules to their mirrored positions. Is that the joke, or is that holy grail of sugars actually called "left handed sugar?"
              ```

              - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:

                >  why "mirroring" it would have that effect

                Think of it this way, you body needs to know what it's eating so it knows what to do with it. In order to tell what all this food stuff is, the most common way is shape. Your body creates relatively large molecules that are like gloves or shoes, and the stuff you eat fits into different shoes depending on what it is. So there are shoes for different sugars, shoes for different vitamins, etc.

                Right-handed sugar and left-handed sugar are like your right and left feet. Sure they look the same, but your right foot doesn't fit in your left shoe (at least, it shouldn't. Unifoot shoes are weird). The same thing happens here: your body only has shoes for right-handed sugar. The right-handed sugar you eat fits in the shoes your body makes, so your body can tell "oh hey this is sugar" and then use it. The left-handed sugar just bounces around without properly fitting into anything, so your body doesn't know what it is and doesn't do anything with it.
                ```

              - u/alexanderwales:
                ```
                It's actually called left-handed sugar, and does result from left-right mirroring on the chiral center. The "L-" notation actually comes from the Latin *laevus*, meaning "on the left".
                ```

        - u/Gurkenglas:
          ```
          > Of course, your ability to make money is limited by how many pounds you can do in a day.

          Buy sugar cane/beet seeds, flip them, sell left-handed seeds, get really rich once.
          ```

            ```
            Can the left-handed seed grow in ordinary soil?

            - u/kuilin:
              ```
              Flip the soil too! Fully enclosed hydroponic greenhouses exist right? Just flip it all, part by part. All required inputs would be water and sunlight, both of which are non chiral.
              ```

              - u/CCC_037:
                ```
                [](/hmmm) But then your specially prepared greenhouse is the only one that can grow it. And you'd end up flipping a lot of molecules for a very little left-handed sugar. It seems it would be a good deal more efficient to simply flip the sugar directly...
                ```

                - u/kuilin:
                  ```
                  More efficient in the short run, true. But building capital will let you set up infrastructure that allows for much more sugar production in the long run. Then again I guess it doesn't matter, because, until the next scientific breakthrough on creating left handed sugar, you'll control the entire supply and thus the price of it anyways. 

                  I wonder how antitrust legislation would interplay with this...
                  ```

                  - u/CCC_037:
                    ```
                    Normally the infrastructure would work out better in the long run, yes, but in this case you have to manually invert all of your soils and fertilisers - everything that has chiral molecules that goes into the system. Which means that pretty near every atom of carbon in your left-handed sugar will come from a flipped molecule in any case. And there will be a fair amount of wastage, as well.

                    It seems less trouble to just flip the sugar.
                    ```

                    - u/kuilin:
                      ```
                      I was under the impression that a completely closed greenhouse doesn't require any inputs like fertilizer, but I guess you're correct. 

                      Hm, what about charging to flip people themselves? They can buy an amount of flipped food for themselves from you regularly to actually eat for nourishment, and then all other food they eat will be correct but not metabolisable.
                      ```

                      - u/CCC_037:
                        ```
                        Much simpler and more nefarious - flip people for free and then charge them heavily for the flipped food.
                        ```

    You could get some mild energy gains by lying on your side and holding a mass and swapping sides. This really could only gain small amounts of energy (a fair amount less than 1000 Joules at a time) and there wouldn't be an easy way to harness it.

    What happens if someone were performing surgery on one half of your body, with the scalpel inside of you, when you switched sides? If it moves the scalpel, you could have some giant mass that has a bit inside of you and switch sides.

    I know that some molecules have left/right isomers, but I'm not sure what effect switching them would have.
    ```

    - u/Nickoalas:
      ```
      Any mass you switch has to be something you can carry. The scalpel could switch sides out of the doctors hand, or it could end up bonded to your skin as the space it was occupying no longer becomes empty. 

      I'm not sure what that would do to the structural integrity of the scalpel. It could become incredibly brittle (gallium absorbed into aluminum scenario) or it could stay solid and, even though one side of it is sharp, still need to be cut out with another scalpel to avoid ripping and tearing from the bonded flesh.

      I only just learned about left/right handed isomers from these comments. I'm curious now if that simple switch would result in the person gasping for breath as their body no longer interacts with their environment the way it's supposed to. 
      Might make a good murder plot if there's a delay until the negative effects add up.

    Question, can I cut off parts of my body and still use this? Because it basically allows teleportation from place A to place B.

    Cut off my left hand and leave it in place A. Go to place B, pick up stuff with my right hand (use plastic bags to make it easier to hold), and activate ability. Boom, stuff now disappears from my right hand in place B and reappears on my left hand in place A. 

    You could use fingers instead of hands if you like your hands. I suggest the left pinkie. 

    Or alternatively, you could grow out your hair! Grow twin tails! Then you can cut off your left twintail and pick up stuff with your right to teleport them to your left!

    You're an Engineer who can debug existing with no ramp-up or documentation.  You'd make a ton of money in various vanilla consulting jobs.

    You could have an even bigger impact by detecting intentional deception.

    Pull out your laptop, look at the chip, and discover if the manufacturer [intended there to be a backdoor](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/demonically-clever-backdoor-hides-inside-computer-chip/).

    Your ability to certify systems as non-compromised would be an absurd intelligence coup.

    Taking that in a more abstract system: treaties, contracts and financial reports are things made or organized by humans.

    You know if a company's annual report is designed to conceal financial difficulties, or if it's designed to draw attention to a legitimate success.  So you can win at the stock market.

    Even bigger, you can look at corporate contracts and treaties and know if the writer designed them to take advantage of some loophole, or to promote a mutually-beneficial partnership.

    Define "everything made". Can I look at a crime scene, which is made by a criminal, and understand exactly the intentions behind it? And so become the greatest detective ever?

    Can I look at the stock market, an artificial construct of humanity, and understand the intentions of all shareholders? And thus use it to become obscenely rich?

    Can I look at a child, and understand the intentions of the biological parents when they made it? And so be able to find out all kinds of things like adoption and adultery?

    Can I look at an election result, and understand the intentions of every single voter (including who they voted for)? And so be able to selectively target and suppress people who vote for people I don't like?

    Can I exploit this by compressing lots of information into a single bit, and just read this bit to understand everyone's intentions? For example, I could build Internet bots that just go around collecting statistics from every website, including forum/twitter/reddit posts, youtube/facebook comments, etc., and every few minutes it would convert all of the data collected into a binary number and output the first bit on my screen. Whether this bit is a 0 or a 1 clearly depends on all of the data collected, so in a sense, this bit was made by EVERYONE whose data was collected. Thus by looking at this bit, could I understand the intentions of EVERYONE my bots gathered data on? And so perform mind reading on a global scale?
