## Any recommendations for Rational Time Travel? | Historically educational Ratfics involving time travel (involvement of magic is a bonus perk) | If not, make this into a weekly story contest.

### Post:

Something related to Harry Potter being able to somehow travel earlier in time than the limitations enforced by the time turner would be a neat suggestion.

I'm however more interested in Ratfics which are traveling even further back in time. Say to a different period. Mainly to understand the preparations involved in packing and planning for events. For instance, going to say Europe near about the time when the Bubonic Plague happened and considering things like people burning suspected witches, or further back around the time of the birth of Jesus Christ, or the purge of Rome or the Byzantine emperor.

**I guess what I'm looking for is historically educational Ratfics involving time travel. Any involvement of magic from the Potterverse is a plus.**

Please let me know if you have any recommendations.

PS: I started thinking about it after watching this: [Unlimited Rice Pudding - Exurb1a](https://youtu.be/wPODghAr3Vc).

  Timeline by Michael Crichton sounds like exactly what you're looking for minus the magic. It's about a group of history students who travel back to 14th century France to rescue their professor. 

  Crichton, best known for Jurassic Park, is also well known for investing heavy research into his works and it really shows in his construction of the historical setting. From the language, to the customs and combat, it's so realistic that I was able to choose this book from a pre-approved list of books to write a report on back in high school history class. 

  It's not like the ratfics usually recommended on this sub as it's a traditional Sci-fi novel with no magic. However, it's definitely rational-adjacent and educational with a compelling plot.

    The movie is really, really bad though.

  I'm probably beating an undead horse here, since it gets recommended so often on this sub, but I just started reading it myself: [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning), 823k words long.

  I'm on chapter 8 currently and really liking it so far. The main character is a wizard student who is stuck in a month long time loop and he doesn't know why.

    I like MoL but I believe the OP here is looking specifically for *historically educational*, as in, “teaches the reader about actual Earth history”

  I'm going to recommend a classic:

  [A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/86/86-h/86-h.htm)

  It's more based on the Morte D'Arthur than on real history, but it looks at some realities of medieval life that often get romanticized away.
  ```

- u/FireCire7:
  ```
  The End of Eternity (Asimov) is classic.  It’s not the most rational but I enjoyed it. It involves traveling to various different time periods with some prep. It’s all far future to future time travel, so nothing historically relevant. It involves atemporal scheming and some unexpected twists.

    You neglected to mention its Stephen Baxter's *authorized* sequel to H. G. Wells' The Time Machine.
    ```

    - u/MereInterest:
      ```
      That it is by Stephen Baxter and is a sequel to The Time Machine is a good point.  Out of curiosity, why emphasize that it is an authorized sequel?  They feels to me to be the least useful part of the recommendation, typically having to do merely with legal formalities, and not about the quality of the work itself.  (And is doubly irrelevant in this case, as The Time Machine is in the public domain.)

  The Xeelee Sequence features heavy use of internally consistant time travel, and the author is a physicist, but is very hard to get into and is all over the place.  For example, one book is about a secret society in ancient rome, and then another is about tiny people inside a neutron star, and then a massive alien war, and then a mission to proxima centauri across a multiverse.  I genuinely do not understand what is going on anymore.

    Orson Scott Card... yikes....

    So much wasted talent on a bigot. Ngl, after reading the wikipedia summary of The Redemption of Christopher Columbus, I'm more upset over what this book could have been.

    The time travelers come up with the following ideas >!on how to strengthen the Native Americans:!<

    > >!They use genetically-engineered viruses to spread immunity to Old World diseases...!<

    ...yes, yes good..

    > >!and work to strengthen Indian society for the coming European contact, including by spreading a pseudo-Christian religion among them...!<

    BIG FUCKING YIKES

    > >!and outlawing human sacrifice.!<

    >!Love the implication here that all native Americans are inherently obsessed with human sacrifice.!<

    You could write this off as it "being a book off it's time" with it being written in the ancient time of 1996 /s but seeing as the author is OSC I very much doubt it.

    >!Columbus also seems to regret the monster he would inevitably turn into but may I ask why would you want to redeem Columbus to begin with? Like if we wanted to redeem baby Hitler, I doubt many people would enjoy reading it besides people who already *want* to forgive Hitler aka nazi apologists. Columbus is viciously hated for a reason by native Americans. Proselytizing is bad actually.!<

    >!I also have to acknowledge that while this is an alternative timeline story, it pretends as if everything pre Columbus going to America is fact and not revisionist. Like no, Columbus was always a huge fucking asshole and everyone at the Portuguese court hated him.!<

      Card has this seeming obsession in shoehorning his Mormon beliefs into his work. It's so annoying, as once you start to see it you can't really ignore it, and it really ruins the story, at least for me. The spreading of religion among the American natives was such a dumb idea that it undermines the entire rest of the story. It's obviously there just there because his religion hypes the idea of Jesus having come to the Americas.
      ```

    - u/blindsight:
      ```
      That's a pretty strong opinion there, considering you haven't read the book.

      The Aztecs did have a lot of human sacrifice, didn't they? I thought they've found tens of thousands of skulls in some places. So what's wrong with outlawing that?

      The religion thing made total sense in the context of the book; they had very limited "levers" they could use to gain influence as complete outsiders, so using religion seems like an obvious choice. It did not come off as preachy, and I say this as an anti-theist.

      I read the book before I knew anything about OSC's personal views, so maybe I'd read it differently now, but from what I remember it's a *fantastic* example of what OP is asking for.
