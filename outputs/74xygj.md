      So much this

    ```
    Not quite, Wildbow tends to have an epilogue arc with multiple such chapters.
    ```

    - u/AmeteurOpinions:
      ```
      Well, yes, but I wasn't going to post individual epilogue chapters, just the epilogue as a whole. Those who read every post are already on /r/parahumans; these have been for the readers who prefer to read each arc in its entirety.

  How long is Twig? And does anyone have a feel for how good it is when binged as opposed to week by week?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Pact is around 950,000 words; Worm is a little less than 1,700,000 words; and Twig is a bit less than 1,600,000 words (now, but I imagine there's enough left that it'll break that number). Unless the epilogue arc is really long, it won't surpass Worm, but it's definitely a lot closer than Pact is.

    I binged it up until 19.4, and then read it as it was published for the 34 chapters since that (so, 17 weeks). It was fantastic both ways, but I preferred reading it as it was published, because it meant I could take part in the discussion threads on r/parahumans. I'm not sure if the same would be true for something like Worm 2, though, since Twig has a lot more mysteries for the reader to solve than Wildbow's other works did.

    Twig is probably my favorite of Wildbow's works. The other two do certain things better, but I didn't get as attached to the characters in Worm or Pact as I did in Twig, and I've seen a lot of people voice a similar sentiment.

    Twig is fairly long, but I'm not sure how it compares to Worm or Pact. I *think* it would have an excellent binge factor; knowing how it ends, I'm very excited for a re-read. The story spans nearly a decade, but the spans of time shown are filled with events and character moments.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Twig is excellent, but because it is a little more episodic, it's hard to just pick it up and read through all of it. I'm pretty sure its ending length is somewhere above 1 million words long, longer than *Pact*.

  ```
  Allright, nice. I've been waiting for Twig to be finished to try reading it. 

  What were people's general impression on the story?
  ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    Excellent, but very different from Worm and Pact. Focuses more on character arcs and interactions than complex battles, but is still has endless creative monsters and awful ways to die.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Still depressing, but less depressing than Worm and Pact.

    The writing is some of Wildbow's best.
    ```

    - u/Overmind_Slab:
      ```
      We've still got a few more chapters of epilogue for it to become super depressing.
      ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Eveuh?

  Wall-E!

  Eveuh!
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  It's not finished. This is the first chapter of epilogue arc
  ```
