  Looks my theory was right. The Hierarch will sentence the Tribunal to death, and they will forever be destroyed, rather than remain fixed. 

  I wonder who tried to strangle him. Mercy? Feel bad for the Pilgrim if they get executed too.

  Edit:

  >“- and in the attempt claimed to hold the authority to pass judgement over King Kairos Theodosian of Helike,” Anaxares continued unflinchingly.

  >“That is incorrect,” the White Knight said.

  >Someone in the benches loudly cursed, but the Hierarch paid it no mind.

  Lmao Cat.

  Edit: Oh, the grip is gone. Did Tyrant use Wish to make sure this goes smoothly? Doubt that would end Mercy, but it would give Hierarch the chance to do it.

    Strangulation is kinda Tariq's thing. I like that interpretation.

    I think Mercy attempted to kill a judge performing a perfectly justified action, which when done literally under the nose of Judgement was unable to be ignored, and forced them fae-style to catfight it out.
    ```

    - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
      ```
      I mean, Judgement repeatedly attempted to kill that same judge.

      Depends on if Judgement and Justice are the same thing; I haven't seen it called Justice in the last few books. It might've just an early name that was changed later, like how Traitorous was called Treacherous once.

  >“If the Heavens seek to impose their will, they will be made to stand before a tribunal of the People,” the Hierarch serenely said.

  >“Your own fucking Gods will bleed you like a pig,” the Wandering Bard hissed.

  >“Then they, too, will be hanged,” Anaxares noted. “As honorary citizens of the Republic, they are subject to its laws.”

  >“You-“

  >“Aoede of Nicae, I charge you with treason,” he said, rising to his feet. “Collaboration with foreign oligarchs and agitation in the name of wretched tyrants.”

  I am pretty sure it sets the order of events in the next several chapters. We have just observed the Heavens Tribunal, so the Below should be judged next - hence , the hand belongs to Tyrant(sudden, yet inevitable betrayal!). 

  Can't wait till Friday to check if I am right

    ```
    below don't pass judgement in the same way above does, Below pretty much give people a big cash check and tell them "don't do something i would not do" and wink, and it's up to the person to use the money responsibly...something we as human seldom do if we come into money suddenly.

    Above try to guide their heroes and have a much more hands on approach, telling their heroes to do this or that for the greater good, meaning they have a more direct influence.

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  Has it ever been shown how Bellerphon was formed? They assign jobs by lottery and transfer the requisite knowledge using magic, right? And because of their specific beliefs, they have no Named, but where did the magic come from?
  ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    I believe they were formed by former slaves.

    Chances are some of them were mages. I'd guess such mages are now the kanenas.
    ```

  - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
    ```
    Sorcery doesn't come from Named. I don't think it's been mentioned which theory is used there, but I know Helike uses Trismegistan.
    ```

  ```
  The Hierarch's form of madness is a delight to read
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I think Kairos trapped the Choir of Mercy in a logical paradox.  Assuming they can only have their attention on one entity at a time (strong assumption, but not completely unmerited): if they don't attack them, he's lying so they have to attack him.  If they do attack him, he wins, and they're attacking him for telling the truth.  He's trapped a whole Choir in a no-win situation.

- u/NZPIEFACE:
  ```
  Now that I think about it, has Cat actually broken any laws which Hierarch can legally judge her over?
  ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    And will she (or Cordelia) be able to judge the Hierarch himself over his organizing trials of Proceran civilians on Proceran soil ?
    ```

    - u/NZPIEFACE:
      ```
      I think he gets out of that through "The People are the Judge, Jury, and Executioner."
      ```

  - u/RidesThe7:
    ```
    Well, she did have a run in with Helike's cavalry that might give the Tyrant cause for complaint.  I'm not sure how league law treats actions taken by a non-league force against a league force in that sort of situation
    ```

    - u/NZPIEFACE:
      ```
      That's basically prosecuting someone for fighting back in a war.
      ```

      - u/RidesThe7:
        ```
        Which, I take it, you think would be considered beyond reasonable by the Hierarch or the legal system of, say, the Glorious Republic of Bellerophon, greatest of free cities?  Though maybe only Helikean law or inter-league law would apply if no one from Bellerophon was involved, I don't know.
        ```

        - u/Brell4Evar:
          ```
          This would boil down to Might Makes Right (which isn't a far cry from Justifications Only Matter to the Just).  Cat's power comes in large part from the Sisters and the entire drow species.  Hierarch derives his from belief of the people he represents.  Cat may well be in a position to do something here, if she has cause to do so.

          She may well be one of Tyrant's targets, too.  If the trial's outcome is somehow relevant to the Accords, the Black Queen may be compelled to act in a downright heroic fashion.
          ```

- u/Sarkavonsy:
  ```
  i really like one theory I saw in the comments of the chapter:

  The grip was the Choir of Mercy, trying to save Judgement by stopping Hierarch from finishing the sentence. This was all according to Tyrant's keikaku: the Tribunal literally HAVE to be Just, its in their nature. And the Choir of Mercy just did something objectively unjust right in front of them - they tried to stop Hierarch from sentencing Judgement, in the process effectively confirming his verdict as valid (if it weren't valid, they'd have had no reason to stop him).

  Judgement is now compelled by its nature to destroy Mercy. *That's* why the grip is gone.
  ```

  - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
    ```
    ...I mean, Judgement tried to stop Hierarch a few times. It's a decent theory, I could see it going that way, but I don't think Judgement is terribly concerned with mortal laws and courts, considering their refusal to stand trial and repeated attempts to murder a judge. It's more "judging to see if it's a net positive or negative" rather than actual justice. Although they have been called Justice a couple times, so who knows?
    ```

- u/fortycakes:
  ```
  Anyone know why the latest chapters have been marked interludes? They seem to be the main plot.
  ```

  - u/bpgbcg:
    ```
    In PGtE, "Interlude" refers to any chapter not from Cat's perspective.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      Any non-bonus chapter, anyway.
      ```
