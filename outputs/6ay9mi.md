## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are Donald J. Trump in the present day of the current year. How do you usurp the republic, assume dictatorial power, establish a European ethno-state on the territories currently governed by the US, and install your family into hereditary rule in the following scenarios:

  1.) Assuming the Russia collusion allegations are false and you can prove it

  2.) Assuming they're true and you have wide leeway to use Russia's subversive capabilities

  3.) Assuming they're either true or can't be disproved, but they're being used against you from both sides

  Your objective function includes some combination of maintaining territorial integrity, low dissent, long-term stability and ethnic/religious homogeneity.
  ```

    This seems impossible. Most dictators ride on a wave of initial popularity and antiestablishment resentment. Trump only has the latter. The first move would be to become a lot more popular. Presidential approval ratings are strongly predictive of midterm success, and Trump will need strong Republican majorities to enact any such plan. Assuming that by 2018 he has managed GOP majorities over filibuster who have decided to support him, and that he has >50% approval, this seems the way forward. This is for option number 1.

    1. Gerrymandering, court packing, and other methods of securing electoral advantages for the ruling party. Make it even more difficult for third parties to succeed.
    2. Destroy the press. Remake PBS as a populist mouthpiece, cut off private donations and give public media increasing advantages over private media. Give the FCC more leeway.
    3. Pack the bureaucracies. Most bureaucrats are liberal, at least more than Trump. Fire them and hire directly from the universities. To retain stability this will take a long time.
    4. Create a no-tolerance policy for intra-party dissent. If you don't vote with the pack you get the boot next cycle. Don't even let them run.
    5. Wait for SCOTUS judges to die, and replace them with lapdogs. This is of course business as usual.
    6. Challenge and repeal the 17th amendment. This will be exceptionally difficult and is more of a long-term goal.
    7. Create federal laws that give electors more freedom. Proceed to choose lapdogs.
    8. Amend the constitution to weaken the House as much as possible under some pretext.
    9. Amend the constitution to allow a 3/4 majority in both houses, as well as Judicial and executive support to pass amendments. At this point dictatorship could not be more blatant. Hopefully popular support will survive this storm.
    10. Get rid of state-level military forces. Nationalize police control.
    11. Abolish the House and "simplify" state legislatures.
    12. Pull back all international aid and military support. Withdraw from NATO.
    13. Invade and sack the northern Mexican states under some pretext. Reparations time! All the African-Americans get their 40 acres and a cow in scenic  Chihuahua. Begin organizing territories as states, wait for inevitable partisan movement, and then declare them unmanageable and Presidential Protectorates.
    14. Have Jared run in an empty GOP field with the backing of the whole media.
    15. Push all racial minorities to the newly annexed Northern Mexican territories. Enact strict immigration laws and quotas. Bring back segregation.
    16. Populism, populism. Keep the whites happy with huge benefits and progressive taxation. Indoctrinate the children accordingly.
    17. Repeal the 22nd amendment. Around the 4th term have Jared declare himself president for life. Dare anyone to disagree.
    18. Surprise! President for life is now a hereditary position.
    19. Dissolve the Supreme Court and combine the executive and judicial branches.
    20. Ban all parties except the Great America Party.

    Note - This is obviously absurd, but the best I can do.

    1. Quit the goddamn cocaine and see a neurologist.  If there is no cocaine, *still* see a neurologist.

    2. Manage to sound like a rational adult who can keep a goddamn secret.

    3. Start building chokehold material on Congressional Republicans.  Blackmail, extortion, threats to their families -- whatever.  You're Donald Trump, you have ties with the mob and with ideological fanatics.  You can summon death threats over Twitter.  Do it.  Make sure the "cuckservatives" fear for their careers and their lives whenever they go against you.

    4. Start using the Republican stranglehold over Congress to build Presidential power with impunity.  Don't just fire Comey: get more and more brazen.  Since you've already got your own private security people integrated with the Secret Service (that already happened partially IRL), start folding any paramilitaries you can find, make, or sponsor into the existing US military.

    5. Make sure to start provoking riots among your opponents.  Make absolutely sure that they get more and more militant, *particularly* people of color.  Use the preexisting prejudice and the existing Republican efforts to criminalize protest to start locking up people of color, leftists, and other dissenters.  Intensify the use of prison labor, and share part of the spoils of that exploitation with the white "silent majority" and "working class".

    6. Start expanding the prejudice and partisanship to include a *cultural* stigma and hate towards blue states and their citizens *in general*.  Make it clear they are un-American.

    7. Help the Republican Party to covertly rig or gerrymander a few more state-level elections, enough to get a Constitutional Convention going.

    8. Hold a Republican-sponsored Constitutional Convention.  Use your leverage on Republican elected officials and party functionaries to staff that Convention with all your own people.  Use the phobia you've whipped up towards blue states and your existing leverage on Congress and state legislatures to make sure that blue states have next to zero input into the Convention -- certainly nothing they can use to resist the next step.

    9. Use the Constitutional Convention to go full Erdogan.  Don't just pass arbitrary Presidential powers under grounds of "national security".  Pass a retroactive *jus sanguini* undoing the 14th Amendment, and rendering anyone who can't be "grandfathered in" an "undocumented immigrant" -- again, retroactively.  Integrate something like the USA PATRIOT Act into the new Constitution.  Make the Presidential position permanent, with new elections being held only the death of the old President.  "Grandfather clauses" have been done before for voting rights in the United States, and will be recognizable here.  People will call bullshit at or before this point, so you *need* to have your leverage tightened by this point.

    10. If necessary, intensify the populist rhetoric and newly-xeno-phobia against blue-staters to have the Constitutional convention basically disenfranchise any heavily-populated states, or redraw state boundaries to make everything possible red-dominated.

    11. Begin rounding up "undocumented immigrants".  If necessary, begin the process of separating the impure Blue America away from your increasingly racially pure Red America as a separate, "sovereign" country -- which will inherit none of the United States' military, diplomatic, or economic assets aside from the people you don't want.

    I think some steps here might be more difficult than I'm giving them credit for, but if you're competent enough, everything you need is basically there.

  Something that I'm trying to figure out for a possible setting, which seems in line with the "puzzle" aspect of SMT: 

  **tl;dr** There was a "nuclear war" and now you have to figure out how to prevent another one from ever being possible, while suffering from various constraints. IN SPACE. 

  ---

  The principle behind relativistic kill vehicles (RKVs) is both simple and terrifying: accelerate a large enough rock to a fraction of the speed of light, and you have a weapon that could kill worlds. Gwern wrote an interesting article on the matter, but suffice it to say that any defensive plan that relies on intercepting an RKV is not a very good plan. 

  Cue an interstellar Cuban Missile Crisis with giant rocks, set to launch if they stopped getting signals from home, and...interstellar civilization. There are, thankfully, enough self-sufficient space stations and minor colonies that humanity is not in danger of going extinct. 

  Still, everyone is in agreement that this can never be allowed to happen again, and the trauma is deep enough that the people who have been put in charge of figuring out a solution can count on being listened to. 

  How do you reliably prevent this from happening again? 

  Relevant constraints: 

  * FTL is not possible, but ships can accelerate to a high enough percentage of c that things get weird and both time dilation and length contraction are noticeable. The average travel time between two habitable star systems is 3.5 years (as viewed by the travelers) and 25.25 years (as viewed from the point of origin). 
  Interstellar civilization is therefore possible, but interstellar government is difficult and has thus far not been successfully attempted. 
  * You can't fix this with a superintelligent AI: Another, alien civilization already built one and it ate them. Maybe. Nobody's sure what went on there. What's happening now, though, is plain as day: the AI is content to stay in a relatively small bubble of space doing who-knows-what, but first contact with an extraplanetary intelligence was made when one of its drones landed on Earth, informed us that we were getting close to building an AI like itself, and said that we either needed to cut that shit out or we were going to be pelted with rocks from Heaven. Any AI that can teach or otherwise improve itself is verboten. 

  Edit: typo
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Get everyone onto space stations and have them move unpredictably. Planets are only used for remotely operated mining operations.

    The AI seems sure that there isn't going to be a competitor to itself, unless it was carefully constructed to not want to be sure of that. Rocks sent from its home domain are not feasible to react to an AI project after it spawns, because the project will have at least as long as light takes to get to the AIs domain and back, assuming FTL is also impossible to it. Also moving space stations. I would rather expect the AI to have nanomachines everywhere, avoiding detection and planning to eat anyone trying to launch an AI.

    They could ask the AI if it's okay to make brain backups of everyone, with that the entire problem is void.
    ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    Decentralized randomly-moving civilization as proposed by u/Gurkenglas is indeed the best solution. Maybe upload everyone into virtual reality to make it more robust, if the technology allows.

    If people want to stay in gravity wells... Making their orbits unpredictable would take stupid amounts of energy, so I don't see a way to prevent *a war*. Civilian casualities, though, could be prevented by effective evacuation protocols.

    If the technology allows, give everyone brain implants and have constantly-updating backups of everyone stored in randomly-moving space stations. Make instant destructive uploads if the planet is targeted. If it's impossible, maybe extremely-deep bunkers that could be accessed from every building? Patrol a few light-hours around the planet to ensure there's enough time to evacuate. (May be unviable if the techology allows to accelerate RKVs to 0.99+ *c*.)

    Wait. Active defense is impossible, but what about a passive one? Asteroids burn in the atmospheres of planets: saturate the empty space in your system with [dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust)^(1), or build a [Dyson Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere#Dyson_shell) and fill it with gas, creating atmosphere^(2). In this environment, the faster a RKV is moving, the faster will it cease to be. Or use anti-particles if you're feeling bold and have the means of mass-producing them. 

    Yes, the last idea would make ordinary 'friendly' space travel way harder as well. Perhaps there's some way of arranging the specks' orbits so that you have windows sometimes? Not an astrophysicist, not sure if possible. Or use intelligent dust that would move out of the way or destroy itself on command when you want to pass?

    ___

    ^(1. That one may not work; I'm not sure how much damage collisions with them would inflict as opposed to gas pressure in ordinary atmospheres;) ^[that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry) ^(article may help.)

    ^(2. Would take a lot of gas.)
    ```

      > Perhaps there's some way of arranging the specks' orbits so that you have windows sometimes?

      Relativistic kill rocks all have paths that are very straight lines ending at the planets. Having multiple layers of antiparticles, arranged such that one has to either substantially change vector or stop and wait ten minutes between layers, will allow friendly (slow) traffic to pass while still getting in the way of RKVs. (Of course, then you have to deal with anti-asteroids - that is, antiparticle RKVs - for which you'd need the occasional shield of normal matter, perhaps in alternating layers)

      You're going to need a *lot* of matter and antimatter.

  You have a nearly indestructible  magic sword that can change its mass and it's balance , the sword  needs one millisecond to change its mass and your commands travel at light speed.Also it spends  " magic energy" to work  and   it will run out of it in a few millions of years so it can't be used to avoid the heat death of the universe. The minimum mass the sword can have  is 0.1g .
  What uses does this have without advanced technology, and what uses does it have whith it if the maximum mass is: 

  1) 10kg

  2) 100000kg

  3) the  mass of the sword if it had the density of the densest material that it has been in contact with.

  4)1g

  Edit: new rule , to avoid black holes  now the densest point of the sword can only have a density of  the maximum mass of the sword / 0.001 cubic millimeters(which still  lets you do gravity tricks in 2 and 3)    .
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    2) You can run through the air/"multijump" with this: Strap it to your soles, give it mass whenever your shoe needs to push on it and take it away whenever you need to move the shoe. By concentrating mass on a point, you can rotate the sword around that point easily. Should feel kinda like running up a downwards escalator? Depending on how good you are at throwing, you might also try roping it to a body harness, throwing it up when it's light and making it heavy as the rope goes taut, lightening it when it runs out of momentum, reeling it in and repeating. Obviously, advanced technology can use this for a spaceship, possibly even with the lower maximum masses.
    ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    You have a source of free energy. Throw it up in the air at minimum weight, increase weight to maximum at peak of arc, and harvest energy as it falls. Repeat for more energy.
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      I don't think that's particularly useful. You still need to maintain constant attention to keep it producing energy, and ultimately what good is it for? Creating a system which can handle 100-ton spot loads isn't a trivial thing especially without modern technology, and even so a hydroelectric plant is likely a better option.
      ```

    What happens to conservation of mass? If I'm swinging a 10kg sword at 10m/s and increase the mass to 20kg, is the sword still traveling 10m/s or does it slow down? (I would vote that velocity remains constant, as that's a more interesting property for a *sword* to have.)

    **First, with conservation:** your fighting style mostly revolves around "dropping" the sword onto the enemy. A 10,000kg sword falling for a tenth of a second translates to roughly 1/4 the momentum of a car moving at 60 mph. Interestingly, because momentum is conserved, your sword doesn't need to have a lot of mass when it hits, because it will have the same momentum either way. However, if you reduce your 10,000kg sword down to 1kg when it's going 1m/s, then you end up with a 1kg sword going 10,000m/s (which is fairly close to Earth's escape velocity). Either way, it packs a punch, but there's probably a balance to be had in properly keeping control. On the defensive side, flash-mass can make the sword put up a really strong parry, but you have to deal with the momentum somehow, unless the plan is to just not have it stay high mass for long enough to matter (in which case you need insanely good reaction times to actually make the parry).

    **Second, with no conservation:** your fighting style mostly revolves around swinging a light sword in for extremely heavy hits, then making it light again to pull back. Same defensive technique as above, but it's a lot easier because you just need to catch the sword and make it light. If range on commanding the sword is long enough, then you can use it as a siege weapon if the mass limit is high enough - even going from 0.1g to 10kg gives you a huge return on energy input. That aspect only really works because the sword is *also* indestructible - I'd like to stick the sword on the end of a polearm, or rotating around an axle, but those parts *aren't* indestructible and so present points of failure.

    I actually gave one of my D&D players something like this; the Anyblade can take the form of any conceivable bladed weapon, allowing all sorts of neat tricks (though it also changes shape, material, etc.).
