  Well, it's definitly bible-bashing... Which is good, the god of the bible deserves to be bashed.
  Very nice read.

  Holy shit. I never considered how horrifying a world with a nearly omnipotent being who cares very much about how you live your life would be. How could anyone even oppose that?

  The only thing I can think of is biding your time and gathering information on what this god can do secretly. If he can't read your mind, that is.
