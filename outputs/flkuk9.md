## Rational Anime Recommendations?

### Post:

Any recommendations for rational or near-rational anime? I tried to search through the subreddit but no consolidated post or comment thread seems to exist.

Edit: a recent comment thread was this https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fjmd7a/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/fkso4mk/

Edit 2: Thanks for the recommendations! I don't normally comment/reply to my posts so take your free upvotes!

  There's Death Note with its cat-and-mouse games, but I think that's more a study in what it looks like to pretend you're rational and succumb to hubris and egomania.

  Anime that focuses around a game (as opposed to a sport) tends to be more cerebral and hinge on clever exploitation of rules and the opponent's psychology. In that category there's Akagi (game: Mahjong) and Kaiji (general gambling, using unorthodox games and rulesets). I understand that No Game No Life also fits this category of unorthodox games won by cleverness, but I haven't watched it.
  ```

  - u/Draykon:
    ```
    No Game No Life is in a similar category to Kaiji, but far more shameless wish-fulfillment and blatant fanservice- of the sort that can get pretty uncomfortable if you don't have a tolerance for it.

    Seconding all this thread's recommendations for Kaiji though, manga and anime. Every game gets explored from tons of angles, psychological and otherwise, and it does an excellent job of making the stakes feel real. 

    I'd also say Jojo's Bizarre Adventure actually has a lot more in common with this subreddit's tastes than you might think at first. It's basically the case study for battle anime that treats battles like puzzles to be solved, centered around deciphering your enemy's weird abilities, and figuring out how to leverage your own. At the very least I'd call it about as rational as Worm.
    ```

    - u/EmceeEsher:
      ```
      Don't get me wrong, I love me some Jojo, but it's definitely not thought through on the same level as Worm. Granted, they do have a lot in common, like unique powers and rules of combat, but Worm does these far better than Jojo.

      The main thing is consistency. In Worm, characters almost always maintain the same abilities throughout, and if they get a new ability or figure out a new exploit (like coating bugs in chemicals), they continue using it and building on it. In Jojo, characters regularly show a cool new move and then forget about it forever, even in situations where it could save their life.
      ```

  - u/IV-TheEmperor:
    ```
    I'm really enjoying Kaiji's current arc. Unlike the usual gambling, it has more laid back feel to it even though the stakes are still high.

    No Game No Life is similar to Jojo in their cleverness. They *are* clever and hype, but really farfetched or not something that would work in real life. Not rational material, but enjoyable nonetheless.
    ```

    - u/BoojumG:
      ```
      >I'm really enjoying Kaiji's current arc. 

      In the manga? I've only watched the anime.

      I was also going to mention Jojo but decided not to for the same reason. There's always a puzzle of the week but you couldn't really figure it out yourself - the protagonist pulls a solution out of their hat.
      ```

      - u/IV-TheEmperor:
        ```
        Yes, in the manga. Manga maintains the quality of the first two parts, so I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the anime. 4th and the current part is different as in there is no real gambling, but the psychological battle is still there. 3rd part is mahjong and 5th part is a poker variant. 5th part actually seems to be regarded as the best part from those who caught up with the manga, but I really enjoy the different approaches of 4th and 6th part.

        > I was also going to mention Jojo but decided not to for the same reason. There's always a puzzle of the week but you couldn't really figure it out yourself - the protagonist pulls a solution out of their hat.

        Yes. I absolutely love Jojo but I don't have the heart to recommend it to this subreddit with a straight face haha.
        ```

        - u/GeneralExtension:
          ```
          >I absolutely love Jojo but I don't have the heart to recommend it to this subreddit with a straight face haha.

          If you like it, recommend it.

          Does it have good character development?
          ```

          - u/IV-TheEmperor:
            ```
            Hmm... I would say it has good character development (especially in the later parts) but all in all it is not that important to Jojo.

            Its main selling point was always its puzzle-like approach to battles. Doing things others could not see, out-of-the-box thinking and trickery are fundamental. Though it can get too silly and outlandish at times, hence my slow-recommendation.
            ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    Several *Ghost in the Shell* story arcs have very rationalist viewpoints. I don't know if the series at large can be called "Rational" - but it definitely scratches that itch for me.

    Also, 100% agreed on *Death Note*. That story had a great premise that it took basically nowhere.

    [Hikaru no Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_no_Go) is a fun story along this vein that I haven't seen anyone mention yet...
    ```

- u/Amargosamountain:
  ```
  I asked this question in an open thread and got some good suggestions: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/faw0dx/comment/fj177oe?context=1

  Erased, Promised Neverland, and Death Note are the strongest examples I've seen.

  My feelings on Log Horizon have changed since that thread. The show got a lot better in literally the next episode after I wrote that comment. It's still not the best example of a rational anime, but it has rational elements to it and it's been engaging overall.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I'd have to disagree with Erased.  The MC is an adult who goes back to his childhood. Yet does not display any rational or logical thinking you would expect of someone that age.  The whole villain thing was exceedingly transparent and should have been seen through as well as other decisions made by MC.  Ugh that show frustrated me on how stupid the MC acted.

    People like it, yet not a fan.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Agreed. It had a lot of potential, but was overall a disappointment. You can easily find better in terms of rationality and just general writing quality.
      ```

  - u/D0TheMath:
    ```
    Promised never land was *amazing*! I will wholeheartedly second that recommendation.
    ```

    - u/cimbalino:
      ```
      The setting is sooooo good, but for most of the first season they are just playing hide and seek...
      ```

      - u/D0TheMath:
        ```
        Wait... there's more than one season?!?! Also I liked those parts of the first season. They were appropriate.
        ```

        - u/cimbalino:
          ```
          The manga continues, so there might be more seasons in the future
          ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Thirding The Promised Neverland. I'd actually call the first season rational without any reservations.
    ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    I don't know about the others but Light Yagami is someone who doesn't understand science and logic pretending to be scientific. I couldn't keep up, it was so infuriating watching him Dunning-Kruger his way through.
    ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    Un-recommending *Promised Neverland*. Anime's first (and currently only) season is great for sure, and it definitely fits the bill, but I've read the manga, and let's just say it slowly went in a very, *very* wrong direction. The content for the next season is also going to be fun, but after that, it's going to be one major disappointment after another if anime remains as faithful to manga as it currently is.
    ```

    - u/arbitrarycharacters:
      ```
      Without spoiling anything if possible, can you give reasons why? Is it a tonal shift, or the writing quality decreasing, or the use of a deus ex machina?
      ```

      - u/NTaya:
        ```
        I'd say it's the decrease in the writing quality first and foremost. There are much fewer mind games after the third arc (out of six or so that currently exist), and the whole story becomes significantly less tightly plotted. I can't remember any points where the story jumped the shark or even employed a really bad deus ex machina, but overall, it slowly became less and less enjoyable with each chapter.
        ```

- u/GreenGriffin8:
  ```
  It seems the battle of wits genre is the closest thing to rational anime.  If you've seen all of the usual recommendations (Death Note, Code Geass, Kaiji) can I recommend Liar Game?  It's a manga, and never got an anime adaptation, but if shows like Death Note and Kaiji interest you for the battles of wits, this will be right up your alley.

  That said, I couldn't answer an anime recommendation post without mentioning Legend of the Galactic Heroes.  The original, not the remake.

  It's a pretty old series from 1988 about an ongoing galactic war between the autocratic Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance.  The two "main" protagonists (There are dozens of named characters, and most of them are developed heavily) are Reinhard von Lohengramm, an Admiral whose sister is concubine to the Kaiser, and Yang Wen-li, a Commodore in the Alliance's fleet.  The story follows the two men on opposite sides of the war as they rise through the ranks in pursuit of their goals.

  As far as being rational, it's pretty solid.  Everything that happens has a cause and effect relationship with the rest of the plot.  Most characters have agency and use it to try to achieve their goals.  Some characters early on hold the Idiot Ball, but it's acknowledged and justified, and the incompetent are weeded out of the story by the end of the first quarter (it's 110 25-minute episodes).

  Its only big flaw is its length.  110 episodes might seem like a lot, but it's so tightly plotted that by the end of it you're left feeling it was too short.
  ```

  - u/cimbalino:
    ```
    Don't forget One Outs!, the Death Note of sports anime
    ```

    - u/GreenGriffin8:
      ```
      I tried reading One Outs, but I don't know enough about baseball to understand it.
      ```

      - u/cimbalino:
        ```
        I also didnt know much about it, just "strike 3 out" and "home run". I felt the series explained basic rules for beginners as well as some less known rules/strategies when they were the focus of the episode
        ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    I will second Liar Game. It's all about mind games and clever tactics against a backdrop of relatively simple game rules. It's very enjoyable.
    ```

  - u/CaseyAshford:
    ```
    An excellent update of Legend of the the Galactic Heroes has been relatively recently produced in the form of the series "***Legend of the Galactic Heroes: The New Thesis".***

    This series does a fantastic job of staying true to the themes of the original while updating the content with the best elements of modern technology. It is a really fantastic series and I would recommend it for newcomers or old fans of the original series.
    ```

    - u/GreenGriffin8:
      ```
      Personally I can't recommend Die Neue These, unless you're already a fan of the series.  It's not a bad series on its own, but the original has a timeless quality that no modern adaptation is going to be able to match.

      Let me first say that I actually watched Die Neue These first, and switched to the original after the first season.

      The remake does stay true to the *themes* of the original, however due to its length, so much is stripped from the series to fit the runtime of modern anime that it's more of a cliff's notes summary of the plot.  As I've said, the grand sweeping story of an entire galactic war, from almost every conceivable perspective, barely fits into 110 episodes as it is.  The remake focuses more on the major plays by the main characters, and while that doesn't make for a bad series, it can't compare to the sheer scope and depth of the original's portrayal of such a vast conflict.

      I also feel that much of the timeless feel of the original is lost in the remake.  There's a reason that people can still get into a 32-year old series even today, because of the meticulously hand-drawn art and the soundtrack which is almost exclusively classical music.  It makes the setting seem almost historical, despite being set over a thousand years in the future.  It may seem daunting, but within a few episodes, once you're immersed in it, it's truly unmatched anywhere.  The remake has a much more standard sci-fi look and feel to it that makes it much safer to release today, but with its generic feel and overuse (in my opinion, of course) of CGI, in 5 years or so people will be once again pointed back to the original when they ask how to get into the series.

      By all means watch whichever version you want, but even as someone who watched Die Neue These first, I really can't recommend it compared to the original.

  ```
  If you're open to manga, I recommend [Qualia the Purple](https://myanimelist.net/manga/51493/Murasakiiro_no_Qualia). MC's power gets munchinked all the way through and maybe even some more.

  I don't see this recommendation in this subreddit often, but HunterxHunter's current arc is great. It's a political thriller with various plans and strategies going around from various sides and they are all competent. For example, a person that was first seen as grappling with a lion is actually a brilliant commander and has a strategic mind. It also helps that this arc focuses on the MC that constantly thinks.
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    I anti-recommend *Qualia the Purple*. All the munchkinry hinges on egregious quantum mechanics misinterpretations; the powers' rules are not clear or predictable, the exploits rely on ad-hoc technobabble.

    The emotional part of the plot wasn't compelling enough to make up for it, for me, either.

  It dismays me that no good examples come to mind for me.  Reading through the comments, only two series immediately come to mind as worthy of (further) mention, though in both cases they're 'bonus points for...' around a few scenes rather than having opposing sides be satisfying.  


  Fate/Zero:  Though sorely little of note, the clash between Kiritsugu and Lord El-Melloi in episode 6 has a fond place in my heart.  Perhaps further of note in regards to Kiritsugu's approach to the world (episodes 18 and 19 Kiritsugu's coming-of-age, episode 24 Kiritsugu and the Holy Grail's intended implementation of his wish following his thought process).

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      >Content warning for Overlord

      Ehhh... I don't think that's really true. In the light novel and manga it's clear that the protagonist thinks of the people in that world the same way your average gamer thinks of NPCs, which makes sense because he's been playing in the VR version of that world for a very long time when all the inhabitants truly were mindless NPCs. It's not too surprising that he retained some peculiar mental habits as a result.

      When a gamer >!kills a battlefield full of NPCs, the act doesn't even register for him/her as morally abhorrent because the NPCs are nowhere close to being actually alive in the first place. In fact, a gamer would probably feel less conflicted killing a horde of NPCs than they would killing an insect in the real world.!< So extrapolating that to the behavior of the protagonist, I think it would be more accurate to say that >!he is amoral rather than evil.!<
      ```

      - u/archpawn:
        ```
        I don't think there's much point in distinguishing amoral and evil. Most "evil" characters do bad stuff because it benefits them, not because they actively like causing harm. Either wa, the main character did stuff that I am not comfortable with the main character doing, and I'd rather have not had to find that out the hard way.
        ```

        - u/chiruochiba:
          ```
          This is a good illustration of why some philosophers have said that the concept of 'evil' is useless because it lacks explanatory power.

  - u/Jakkubus:
    ```
    I think that you are mistaking Ainz being game-savvy and unprincipled for actual wits and rationality. Overlord is your generic run of the mill power fantasy.
    ```

    - u/Kheldarson:
      ```
      No, I'm looking at how his actions (whether reasoned or not) have a rational chain of effects that the other characters respond to in rational ways. Ainz is also *learning* how to be properly clever and rational as the story goes.
      ```

      - u/Jakkubus:
        ```
        AFAIK Ainz never really gets clever or rational though. While I cannot say much about more recent volumes, for at least half of the series he is the same immature bully that he was at the start. Basically all of his successes are achieved due to overwhelming power and ass-pulled abilities rather than him actually thinking rationally. 

        As for other characters, they can be generally divided into three categories: 

        a) worshippers of Ainz that always interpret his actions in the most favourable way,

        b) caricatures of villains that stand in his way and invariably look down on him

        c) and relatively normal bystanders, who in most cases either die early or just passively observe. 

        Only the last ones exhibit any sort of somewhat realistic responses, but they have little to no impact on the plot.

  I recently read a manga called 'Battle 5 seconds after meeting' which was alright:

  https://helveticascans.com/r/series/battle-after-meeting/

  The setup is relatively generic shonen:  A bunch of people are kidnapped,  they're forced to fight in a tournament (at first), each is given 1 special power, for example  'turn your arm into a cannon equivalent to an anti-materiel rifle'.  There's various different ones with greater or lesser combat utility.  (Listing specific powers with all limitations and capabilities would be a spoiler, but they run the gamut from teleportation to super-strength, some mental ones, some meta-powers, etc.)  Characters tend to use their powers quite rationally, I find.

  The protagonist gets, verbatim, 'your power is whatever the other person person thinks your power is'.  The story is about him trying to figure out exactly what that means/how it works, and then mindgame everyone around him.  Pretty fun.

  I will once again recomend the manga Ajin. There's an anime, but I haven't finished, and I know the two deviate from each other, so I will only recomend manga, but if any one can vouch for the anime, feel free.

  I feel like Ajin is among one of the most rational manga out there. It's not perfect and it has that Rationality = Spock thing going on but it's downplayed and you might not even notice if one character didn't explicitly stated it.

  The whole concept is: A very small number of people called Ajins (Demi-humans) can't die of anything but old age. If they die, they reset, all injuries vanish, limbs re-attach and if they are too far away, grow back. Dying is also the only way to find out one is an Ajin. As there are very few of them, governments around the world want to seize them for experiments and also to use them as test subjects to drugs, automobiles, etc. The Stories follow Kei Nagai, a student, who is found to be an Ajin after an accident. He's shown to be a *very* rational character, as is the villain. Characters make mistakes, but the story is pretty much devoid of stupid decisions I really think people should give it a go.

  I'd recommend the manga [Kusuriya no Hitorigoto.](https://mangadex.org/title/21562/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto/chapters/)

  Expanding on the list I posted on the linked comment thread:

  Transhuman and sci fi detective stories:

  * Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex: Old classic sci fi anime everyone loves. Cyborgs. A handful of really nice episodic mysteries centering around some transhuman concept or another. Eventually settles into a longer mystery that I didn't find as engaging. The rest of the franchise is good too, though I think GITS:SAC is the best.

  * Psycho-Pass: Very similar to GITS, usually considered an "almost as good" substitute. About utility functions I guess? I think Psycho-Pass's one-off mystery episodes are weaker, but its multi-episode plotlines are stronger than in GITS. Also everyone says the second season is terrible but it's like 80% as good as the first.

  People having quiet adventures:

  * Spice & Wolf: Economics and romance in a fantasy world. All the drama is in few-episode-long economics/markets plots, while the romance story takes the entire season to slowly go places. The fact that it's a fantasy world doesn't matter. The microeconomics occasionally went faster than I could keep track of, but I got the impression it was all correct.

  * Kino's Journey: Kino goes from town to town and sees how people live their lives. The towns are all philosophical or science fiction thought experiments, with completely different tech levels and ways of life in each. Don't think too hard about how they're all sitting in the same world; they're all well-realized and thought provoking separately. Kino doesn't give an opinion on the places, so you're stuck with your own thoughts on these things.

  * Mushishi: Similar to Kino's Journey, a traveling medicine man helps people with problems with spirits. Spirits are like... magical intangible versions of tiny animals? More hydras and corals than dogs and cats, I mean. They get places they shouldn't be and our protagonist helps people out with them. Not really rational, but it does have a protagonist that solves weird problems with knowledge. I liked the dub.

  Something else:

  * Shinsekai Yori: Life in a remote village of psychics. Really cohesive, careful worldbuilding, even when (especially when) it seems like people are acting weird or the authors forgot something. Hard to say much about it without spoiling it though, it completely thrashes the status quo every few episodes. Also really dark, watch out for that.

  * The Devil Is A Part Timer: The dark lord of a fantasy universe gets sucked into a magical portal, stuck in Tokyo, and gets a part time job at a McDonalds. The premise gets stranger, but everyone handles it like sensible adults. Makes people handling things well funny.

  * Madoka: Deconstruction and reconstruction of magical girl anime. It's good if you like those or deconstruction/reconstructions.

  Not rational, still recommending:

  * The Eccentric Family: A thoughtful, nuanced look at what it's like to be a magical talking raccoon in modern day Japan.

  * Dumbbell Nan Kilo Moteru?: Not rational, but it might make you want to work out, which means watching it is rational.

  Hero and Demon King is a good example. Basically the Hero goes alone to confront the ruler of the demons, rather than fighting she asks him to help put an end to the war with minimal loss of life. The romance subplot is shoehorned in but that's not a biggie. I particularly like how the hero sometimes feels useless despite his immense power because destruction isn't useful in this situation, the Demon King introduction of potatoes is portrayed as, and is, more significant than the time the Hero blew up a mountain.

    If  you enjoy this sort of story you might have already read [A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero?!](https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Corrupted-Internet-Summoned-Hero-ebook/dp/B01B2BP726), but if you haven't it's on sale right now and is a fun little read from Yudkowsky.

  If you are into shounen I would say hunter x hunter nen power system is the most rational compared to naruto, bleach, and one piece. The show is also so damn good.
  ```

- u/SecondTriggerEvent:
  ```
  Hunter X Hunter has a fleshed out battle system and relies as much on psychology as it does pew pew lasers for the fight scenes.  


  I don't think they're particularly rational, but the Evangelion, Utena, Monogatari series are all stylish and have decent depth to their stories.

  No game no life - A pair of superhuman shut-in gamers get transported to a fantasy world where violence is supernaturallly banned and all conflict is resolved through games. The show revolves around them overcoming impossible games through wits and social manipulation on their path to world domination 

  Log Horizon - The entire playerbase of a popular MMO gets transported to a fantasy world based on that game. The show focuses on a group of influential players attempting to form a proper society.

  Dr. Stone - The entire population of the earth gets petrified by an unknown force. 3000 years later, a teenager who's really into science awakens from his petrified state and attempts to rebuild modern society. The show focuses on him climbing the tech tree while fighting against various different antagonists (I won't spoil who). Technology is portrayed fairly accurately (lots of chemistry and mechanical engineering).
  ```

    ```
    Dr. Stone is not rational. It's science wank.

      ```
      Specifically Dr. Stone ignores "The Secret of Our Success" and assumes that you could just recreate all of human advances and technology really easily.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        That too. But mostly the people act like Shonen characters where science has replaced whatever supernatural powers exist usually. Multiple personalities are written primarily to be funny and create drama and entertainment, with little regard given to realism.

        Rational story telling isn't just about how the world works, it's also about how people work. And personally I probably care even more about the latter than the former.
        ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    No Game No Life has a great premise for a rationalist story (though possibly a bit anvilicious) but it messes it up by having the main characters be terribly irrational. Winning that consistently shouldn't be possible, especially since many of those games depend on an element of chance.

    While I do recommend Dr. Stone, I feel like it falls someone short of rational when it's revealed just how long the people in the nearby village have been around. They should have had plenty of time to repopulate the earth and rebuild civilization. Especially given that there's the ruins of the old civilization and >!they're descended from astronauts, who would have done what they could to get them started!<. What's especially bad is that >!one of the astronauts is Senku's dad, and he put a lot of effort into sending messages to Senku on the assumption that he'd somehow turn back from being stone. He was right, but there's no way he could have guessed that.!<

    > The show revolves around them overcoming impossible games through wits and social manipulation on their path to world domination

    Well, kinda. Most of the victories really feel like asspulls, and some of the sexualization that happens is _deeply_ uncomfortable. The show is fun, but I don't know if it holds up to intellectual rigor
    ```

    - u/Massim0g:
      ```
      Yup, should probably have mentioned that the show is extremely celebratory of otaku culture (and the idea of escapist fantasy in general), including some of the aspects that are very off-putting (if not outright disgusting) to some. And yeah, it's not the most rigorous story out there, but I still feel like rational fiction readers would find it fun in general rather than annoying, like, they're asspulls but at least they're inventive/funny.
      ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      The endings are super duper asspulls. Shiro is a living supercomputer and Sora is a god-tier social manipulator and plotter. It's great fun but it ain't ratfic.

    ```
    The science in dr stone is *mostly* accurate, it's about the level where they've heard about these things in high school/university, but don't really understand how they work. 

    For example, in the first few episodes he mixes nitric acid with ethanol to produce nital because it's an industrial solvent. But in industry, they add ethanol because nitric acid is *too strong* for their purposes, and they need to dilute it. There's no reason why senku would want to *dilute* his acid.

    And don't get me started on the katanas. Literally everything outside of the science is highly irrational.

- u/EdenicFaithful:
  ```
  The Irregular at Magic High School. *A school that discriminates based on innate magical power between the elite Blooms and the reserve Weeds, with the main character, Tatsuya (a driven and prudent man) being an apparent Weed.*
  Spends some time laying out the magic system and explains how battles are won in a way I think will be somewhat appreciated here. The first arc (Enrollment, 5~ episodes?) was honestly great anime.

  Parasyte. *Brain-invading aliens who impersonate and eat (other) humans. One alien, Migi, fails and merges with Shinichi's right hand only. Migi turns out to be a cold-blooded survivor who decides that the best course for him is to work together with his still-sentient human host.*
  Can't remember if the fighting was particularly rational but Migi thinks and speaks clearly. One of the classics.

  Utawarerumono has a fairly interesting skeptic and strategist-type main character.
  ```

  - u/Jakkubus:
    ```
    While the magic system of The Irregular at Magic High School is indeed very interesting, in the end Tatsuya is anything but weak. He usually wins not due to his smarts, but because of being a special snowflake outside of the rules applying to everyone else.
    ```

    - u/EdenicFaithful:
      ```
      Yes everything after Enrollment ruins it. Still, for the beginning he cuts a convincing underdog with a few advantages of genius and luck used well.
      ```

- u/Predictablicious:
  ```
  Baby Steps where the protagonist uses logic and thinking to become a bettee Tennis Player. Has some common shounen/sport tropes (e.g. waxh opponent has a special move), but it's mostly super realistic. The MC loses a lot because he's not skilled enough and need to train harder, instead of being super talented.
  ```

- u/sl236:
  ```
  No-one's mentioned "Moribito: guardian of the spirit" yet. It's a surprisingly well-told fantasy in which people often act rationally to further their goals, and has some nice depictions of people doing actual research.

  Also, 12 Kingdoms - while characters often act irrationally, the intricacy of the worldbuilding is very pleasing. On that note, Centaur's Life is another surprising one for worldbuilding - the overall impression is that although the author is paid to draw soft porn, what they *really* want to be writing about is the evolutionary biology of fantasy monsters. (This comes through even more strongly in the manga)
