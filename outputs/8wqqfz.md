## What's up with the name Juniper?

### Post:

I've never met or heard of a Juniper in real life, but it seems like the name shows up in every web serial. Is the name that popular? Is this some kind of in joke?

  Doesn't seem too rare

  > In 2011, Juniper entered the top 1000 list of given names in the United States for the first time and is quickly becoming a popular girls name likely due to the popularity of a wide assortment of well-known fictional works (...)

    It's likely a fad-name. Here's the[ US baby-name data](http://www.babynamewizard.com/voyager#prefix=juniper&sw=both&exact=false) on it. The most recent data has it as the 352nd most popular girls name in the US.

  Hm, now that you mention it:

  * Main character's name in Worth the Candle.

  * Name of a dryad in The Gods Are Bastards.

  * Name of an Orc in A Practical Guide To Evil.

  Edit: Also the name of a pokemon trainer in Origin of Species.

  Am I missing any?

    Name of the old rebel leader in the The Dark Wizard of Donkerk

      Isn't that by the same author as Worth the Candle though?
      ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        So that makes it count less?
        ```

          I'd say so. If a bunch of stories from the same author use a name a lot it doesn't show that the name is weirdly popular in a certain kind of fiction, it shows that a single person has a (conscious or unconscious) fixation on it. In that case the only person who can be asked for the source of the trend is the author.

          Of course there are only two stories sharing an author, making that not the case. On the other hand there seem to be only four stories showing the Juniper trend, so there's not much of a trend in the first place.

            And one of them is the dryad, who is explicitly named after the tree. She has sisters named Apple and Mimosa, for example.
            ```

      Juniper is the name of an ocean in The Dark Wizard of Donkerk. 'The Juniper rebellion' was probably named after the ocean but I don't think it says so anywhere

      (you know... just sayin)
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:

        This is correct, the Juniper Rebellion is named after the Juniper Ocean. IIRC, it was named the Juniper Rebellion because it happened while the king was abroad, and there was a period of time where he ruled from the waters, but I don't think any of that is explained in the text.
        ```

      - u/tjhance:
        ```
        or maybe it's the name of an ocean and a person and therefore it should count TWICE
        ```

      I'd also argue that since Pokemon Professors all have tree names, Juniper should only half-count from Pokemon: The Origin of Species

        Yeah, and juniper is an official canon professor, not from OoS.

  My kid is going to named Juniper and I will introduce you to her. Then you will have known someone named Juniper.

  Names heavily depend on where you live. It's not too rare a name.

    Where at?

    I also have never once run into someone with that name, but know several serials that use it.

      I know one Juniper, although my friend has mentioned another one whom i've never met. It's a berry, it's not that outlandish for a persons name to be based off of a plant: Lily, Rosemary, Daisy etc, are all names that are derived from plants.

      It's a tree. IIRC the most common tree name I know Rowan.

  nah i think it's just the kind of name that's normal and different at the same time. to me it sounds like a girl that's not too girly but not tomboyish, so i can see why rational writers might like it.

  though it is pretty weird that you're noticing it a lot.

  I am just glad that its not a really generic Caucasian name like bobby. Joe, Mitch, john. If your MC's name is generic I subconscious ly think your story is generic. Compare a name like Gary to a name like Randidly Ghosthound. Which story will you get invested in more? (Too bad randidly ghosthound is still a terrible webnovel but the name got my foot in the door)

    Actually as someone who reads a lot of fanfiction I stated to associate nonstandard names with Mary Sues and bad writing. I'm not sure if such a correlation exists, but from the works I remember most of the badly written author avatars had some extravagant name.

    If you would like, can you share why you dislike Ghosthound? I read it, and I enjoy it. I am not sure I would call it great, and I don't mean to, like, accost you, but I am curious if you have the time and inclination.

    - u/Ih8Otakus:

      The side characters are the problem with ghosthound. They have no motivations for themselves and are just there for being there.

- u/DismalWard77:

  Pretty sure its the name of a plant ~~and a planet~~ so that could attribute to its popularity

    like... Jupiter ? <\^__\^;
