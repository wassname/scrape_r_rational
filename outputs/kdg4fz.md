  Regarding it being rational fiction, I enjoyed this exchange (currently reading).

  “Short of allowing me to heal your uncle, I do not think there is a simple way for me to convince you,” Liu Jianguo explained. “It is not wrong for you to be suspicious of me. I am, after all, a cripple. For me to have knowledge beyond the greatest doctors of this city is a laughable thought. It should be far easier for you to believe that I’m merely a charlatan that wishes to avoid death.”

  “You know,” Xiao Nan said, his left eye twitching. “You aren’t supposed to just admit something like that. You’re supposed to grovel and beg for the opportunity to prove yourself to me.”

  “If I begged and groveled, you’d see me as too desperate to be trusted,” the doctor pointed out calmly. “Make no mistake. I do not wish to die, and I believe earning your trust would help me stay alive. However, I don’t think there is a simple way for you to suddenly trust me. I can heal your uncle. That much is true, but to you, I might as well be saying I am the general of a great army or the prince of a foreign country.”

  It's written better and with more forethought then the most XianXia but I am still not sure if it qualify for "rational".

  Hero is no murderhobo and world isn't ridiculous - yes. Characters are not clichés - yes. Reading is enjoyable - yes. However, whether it's rational or not is yet to be seen IMHO.

    I think it's one of the most rational xanxia available. Whether it fits the bill like you said is to be seen. But it's very promissing so far.

      Maybe I'm just failing to understand xanxia but the characters always feel utterly alien to me. Their emotions, reactions, thought patterns, and sometimes goals are so far removed from my models of the people around me that they feel more like caricatures than real people. Is the cultural difference between western and asian just this big or is it something else?

        Xanxia novels in China have roughly the same problem as Young Adult novels do in the United States - a glut of product, most of which is trashy lowest common denominator stuff packed with wish fulfillment and cliches. Only the stuff that sells really well gets translated and for the most part that's not the same as thing as stuff that readers would necessarily want to read.

    Chapter 90 and "to be seen" means no, doesn't it?  What relevant detail could possibly still be hidden?

    Edit: guess I'll find out

  It's a bit unbalanced, 12yo kids are breaking the sound barrier while sparring by jumping fast. If that's the case every punch should break the sound barrier. 

  &#x200B;

  I think it's kind of dumb, breaking the sound barrier is generally high tier power level in most stories. Look at Delve, when people break the sound barrier it's f\*ing awesome and it means they are incredibly powerful. Here it's something average 12yo kids can do without even trying hard.

  Ave Xia Ren seemed good when it was just him in his home studying to become a doctor because it seemed like a parody, but now that we know that was only a prelude, something that would have happened in a normal story in less than 5 chapters, and everything seems like it's going to follow what the author promised in the tittle.

  &#x200B;

  A generic harem xianxia story I've been quite disappointed with it. It seemed like it was a silly tittle with a story that differed wildly from it, but now that we know it's not the case and it has become a cliche fest a lot of the charm is gone.
