## Query: Would you all consider Neal Stephenson a "rational fiction" author, in addition to being a speculative fiction author?

### Post:

I just learned of this community, so I may be misunderstanding, but after reading the description, the first thing that came to mind were Neal Stephenson novels, in which the narrator and characters discuss and contemplate problem solving, categorizing, analyzing, and philosophizing about the natural, social, and technological worlds. 

Am I off-base, or am I beating a horse that was dead before I got here? 

Thanks and sorry if this post is inappropriate for the sub. I didn't bother lurking first; sometimes that's a problem.

  Maybe in some of his earlier works, particularly the Diamond Age, he was fairly successful at presenting rational characters in a well-designed world.

  More recently, Stephenson fakes "rational" characters by putting anachronistic 20th/21st century people into past or future contexts. That was kind of the whole schtick of the Baroque cycle, I forget where I dropped that one mid-book because I couldn't deal wit the Swiss Family Robinson-ness of it all. But SevenEves was kind of the bottom for me. The first part was entertaining Kerbal Space Program fanfic, but everything after the landing in the gap was completely plot driven impossible fantasy.

  There is no way any of the groups of "survivors" would have survived.

  * Thermodynamics would doom the Earthbound groups (for example, you can't extract power from geothermal sources when the atmosphere is as hot as the upper mantle).
  * And the lunar colony? There is no way they could have bootstrapped to the point of building new chips for their magic robots with seven people, none of whom have the background knowledge, and an already declining stock of robots.

  And then the new society, thousands of years in the future, is basically 2000s Earth, except with a financial center in probably the most dangerous location in their society, but somehow nobody has thought of colonizing the rest of the solar system outside cislunar space. Perhaps the genetic engineering broke something in them, and froze them in a perpetual New England.

    His action-oriented novels are better in that respects, such as [Reamde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reamde).
    ```

      Honestly, I found Reamde to be utterly forgettable. As in, when I got a copy of Fall from my sister, I had literally forgotten everything about the plot of Reamde. I had to read the Wikipedia synopsis to refresh me.

      I thoroughly enjoy watching Stephenson's thought processes play out on a page when he goes on rambling. But for a spy / hostage thriller? Meh. I'll just pick up the nearest book with Tom Clancy's name on it.

      I think you're just seeing characters that aren't dragged in higgledy-piggledy from another milieu, because it's set in a contemporary period.

      Admittedly, I was unimpressed with REAMDE.

        Right, that's his only recent novel I bothered with because the premises of the others felt off.

  I’m a huge fan of Anathem — but the Concent is built on Rationalist principles and the main character is just a passive observer who follows the rationalist characters around as they deliver their speeches.

  In many ways it’s good — because Lio is the “dumb innocent jock” who is unafraid to ask world building or plot driving questions. He does work well with others and the text is philosophical and touches on different forms of thought as an explicit plot-device to win... so that’s pretty cool too.

    I really enjoyed Anathem. The fact that it was a YA novel strapped to the side of a Spec Fic novel enhanced my enjoyment rather than took away from it. 

    It was pretty much a throwaway line, but I found the Technie Sammann's dialogue on "Bogons" to be very insightful and applicable to the modern internet and disinformation.

    >“Early in the Reticulum—thousands of years ago—it became almost useless because it was cluttered with faulty, obsolete, or downright misleading information,” Sammann said.

    >“Crap, you once called it,” I reminded him.

    >“Yes—a technical term. So crap filtering became important. Businesses were built around it. Some of those businesses came up with a clever plan to make more money: they poisoned the well. They began to put crap on the Reticulum deliberately, forcing people to use their products to filter that crap back out. They created syndevs whose sole purpose was to spew crap into the Reticulum. But it had to be good crap.”

    >“What is good crap?” Arsibalt asked in a politely incredulous tone.

    >“Well, bad crap would be an unformatted document consisting of random letters. Good crap would be a beautifully typeset, well-written document that contained a hundred correct, verifiable sentences and one that was subtly false. It’s a lot harder to generate good crap. At first they had to hire humans to churn it out. They mostly did it by taking legitimate documents and inserting errors—swapping one name for another, say. But it didn’t really take off until the military got interested.”

    >“As a tactic for planting misinformation in the enemy’s reticules, you mean,” Osa said. “This I know about. You are referring to the Artificial Inanity programs of the mid–First Millennium A.R.”

    >“Exactly!” Sammann said. “Artificial Inanity systems of enormous sophistication and power were built for exactly the purpose Fraa Osa has mentioned. In no time at all, the praxis leaked to the commercial sector and spread to the Rampant Orphan Botnet Ecologies. Never mind. The point is that there was a sort of Dark Age on the Reticulum that lasted until my Ita forerunners were able to bring matters in hand.”

    >“So, are Artificial Inanity systems still active in the Rampant Orphan Botnet Ecologies?” asked Arsibalt, utterly fascinated.

    >“The ROBE evolved into something totally different early in the Second Millennium,” Sammann said dismissively.

    >“What did it evolve into?” Jesry asked.

    >“No one is sure,” Sammann said. “We only get hints when it finds ways to physically instantiate itself, which, fortunately, does not happen that often. But we digress. The functionality of Artificial Inanity still exists. You might say that those Ita who brought the Ret out of the Dark Age could only defeat it by co-opting it. So, to make a long story short, for every legitimate document floating around on the Reticulum, there are hundreds or thousands of bogus versions—bogons, as we call them.”

    >“The only way to preserve the integrity of the defenses is to subject them to unceasing assault,” Osa said, and any idiot could guess he was quoting some old Vale aphorism.

    >“Yes,” Sammann said, “and it works so well that, most of the time, the users of the Reticulum don’t know it’s there. Just as you are not aware of the millions of germs trying and failing to attack your body every moment of every day. However, the recent events, and the stresses posed by the Antiswarm, appear to have introduced the low-level bug that I spoke of.”

  I'd say (conditionally) yes:

   - Stephenson frequently writes highly intelligent characters and does it well (arguably his greatest strength next to prose). That's not to say they never make mistakes or never make irrational decisions, but those decisions and mistakes they make are in line with the character, so it makes sense
   - Stephenson's worldbuilding is thought out and the implications of the fictional elements are considered in a wider scope. 
   - There are very few instances where I can point to a decision a character makes and say "this happened because of plot purposes, not character motivation"

  While I wouldn't call Stephenson a "rationalist" author first, he definitely embodies many "rational" principles in his writing.

  Hell no. I've read a fair amount of Neal Stephenson and while there are some entertaining aspects, there are some infuriating ones.He's got generally good ideas then just blows them to shreds. Read Cryptonomicon and Anathem then stop there.

  Fall; or, Dodge in Hell (kind of sequel to Reamde) had a couple great elements, but 3/4 was just so boring. I would have read a whole book about the road trip through Red country and the Purdah system, but instead all those trees wasted.

  Most fiction relies on zero or one weird things (aka coincidences) to happen to be entertaining.  The more you get than one, the more it's clearly the author putting his thumb on the scale. Oh, random droid escape with the plans to the great weapon just seconds ahead of the evil lord? OK, cool story. Oh, those droid are salvaged by the hidden son of the evil lord on this random planet? That's a stretch. Oh, those droids were built by the evil lord when he was a child? Oh, that son was never found by his evil lord father despite having the same last name and living with his immediate relatives? For fuck's sake, that doesn't make any sense.

  SevenEves was just absurd...They never address who destroyed the moon. If it was a highly unlikely random event, ok, weird coincidence that that happens now when the world has just enough capacity to survive. Then Part Three of Seveneves made me throw up in my mouth. The evolution was dumb of all three groups was just dumb. That they remembered each other's ancestors from 5,000 years ago? GTFO.

  Reamde was pretty dumb. Oh, you do some shady stuff and get wrapped up in a Russian mob's mission to find the hackers? Ok, cool reason for a story. Oh, your mission to find the evil hackers means you choose a random door that accidentally results in you attacking Muslim terrorists? Dumb plot turns galore.

  The only one of his books I'd call approaching rationalist/rational fiction is Diamond Age.

    I don't follow this. The book opens up with a guy getting a gun implanted into his cranium (a premise so ludicrous that I almost set the book down then and there) and it only got more absurd as it went on. Who exactly are we supposed to be looking toward as a rational character?

    Finkle-McGraw, who admits that his high status is the result of mere epistemic luck, and whose 'solution' to a perceived lack of pluck and grit in his society is to proliferate dangerous and untested forms of nanotechnology in the hopes that the resulting chaos will be character building?

    Nell, who is literally raised by a book, one which tells her how to use martial arts and program Turing machines, but which raises her to consider all authority figures so useless that she'd rather attack a grown man several times her size with a knife than try telling an adult who could help her?

    John, who was a nanotech engineer instrumental to the implementation of both of the above schemes, but who decided all the same that he could get away with stealing from his boss, since the only security nanotech worth considering is clearly the stuff he personally implemented. Nobody else can be clever!

    Dr. X, who strives toward a noble goal and never does anything directly foolish, but whose entire MO is to wait for useful tools to come to him, rather than applying his skills to seeking them out or developing them directly? Fang, who follows largely the same arc, simply with moral causes instead?

    Miranda, Moore and Carl, respectively Nell's mother, father and cool uncle figures, who collectively love her and want her to grow into a healthy young woman, but who see no reason to consider the appropriateness of the seemingly unique superstimulus media which she religiously consumes?

    Everyone in this book seems tailor-made to embody some stereotypical vice of rationalists, rather than being a role model directly.

      > Finkle-McGraw, who admits that his high status is the result of mere epistemic luck, and whose 'solution' to a perceived lack of pluck and grit in his society is to proliferate **dangerous and untested forms of nanotechnology** in the hopes that the resulting chaos will be character building?

      Are you talking about the Primer, or the Seed?

      I don't think the Seed is Finkle-McGraw's idea.  It's presented, in-universe, as being the Celestial Kingdom's hypothetical counterpart to the Feed.  It shows up in the Primer because that's what Hackworth is working with among the Dreamers.

      The Primer isn't a "dangerous and untested form of nanotechnology."  It's a storybook.  One with an agenda, which can intelligently and reactively change its plot, and which is acted out by actual people, but a book.

      >Nell, who is literally raised by a book,

      If you think that Nell was raised by a book, I think you missed the point.  Nell was raised by Miranda, **via** the book.

      > which raises her to consider all authority figures so useless that she'd rather attack a grown man several times her size with a knife than try telling an adult who could help her

      I think the "consider authority figures untrustworthy/useless" is more an artefact of her biological mother than the Primer.  Although I suppose that the Primer was designed to teach them to be subversive, so, maybe?

      > John, who was a nanotech engineer instrumental to the implementation of both of the above schemes, but who decided all the same that he could get away with stealing from his boss, since the only security nanotech worth considering is clearly the stuff he personally implemented.

      The wellbeing of your children is a hell of a motivator.  He was given a (to his mind) once-in-a-lifetime chance to make his daughter's life better than it otherwise would have been, to give her an education that rivalled only one other person in the world.  It's not irrational to take what would otherwise be a stupid risk, if the payoff to that risk is a huge furtherance towards achieving your goals.

      >Miranda, Moore and Carl, respectively Nell's mother, father and cool uncle figures, who collectively love her and want her to grow into a healthy young woman, but who see no reason to consider the appropriateness of the seemingly unique superstimulus media which she religiously consumes?

      There are a whole lot of people who communicate via Facebook, despite [most people thinking social media has too much power and has a mostly-negative impact on the US](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/12/10/fast-facts-on-americans-views-about-social-media-as-facebook-faces-legal-challenge/), because it's [how they stay connected with the people they love](https://www.consumerreports.org/social-media/what-do-you-think-of-facebook-now-survey/).

      The Primer is the **only** way that Miranda can stay in touch with the girl she's been raising as a daughter for years.  Carl isn't really much of a character in Nell's story, so I don't know why you're bringing him up.  Constable Moore, you maybe have a point about (especially given that he's part of the Dovetail community).

      I'm not going to dispute your characterizations of X and Fang, because I can't remember them all that well.

      Because the world, the polities, and the motivations are so wildly ludicrous that it undercuts it, I guess? Don't get me wrong, I love the book with all my heart, but it's very much an art piece intended to make a statement.

  Only having read Seveneves, tentatively no, not really. I found Seveneves to be great as a \[Science\] fiction novel, in the sense that countless little bits of scientific phenomena are brought up and are actually grippingly plot-relevant (ex. painful death by radiation sickness and how to somewhat survive it, comet mass sacrifice, delta-v considerations, etc.), but few of the characters explore the depth of thought normally seen in rational fiction, and at times there were definitely railroads of sorts (ex. everything to do with Julia's evil behavior).

  Rational fiction, as far as I've read it, is very much focused on the personal experience of each character and their thought processes. Seveneves doesn't do it very much justice, and when it does it's usually focused on the powerful emotional moments, much like traditional literary fiction rather than the gripping thought processes of rational fiction. Which is also why it's a crying shame that Neal's writing in Seveneves is terribly bland. His ideas in the book were amazing, many scenes were poignant and poetic to the point of bringing me to tears, but most of the characters were cardboard and it feels almost like Orion's Arm in how great ideas are horribly restrained by mediocre writing.

  Edit: Let's analyze it with the definition:

  * Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
     * This is partially true. Some characters do this, and do it very well. But there doesn't feel like there's a focus on this - the focus is on the overarching epic of humanity's struggle for survival, and our incredible ability to both come together and accept our fate... and fall apart and ruin each other. It does this to some degree, but not at all in the way rational fiction tends to do it.
  * Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
     * If anyone can really explain Julia/the American president for me, then please do so. As a background character, and a hard woman making hard decisions, nuking Venezuela made sense. In the last half of the book, however, she became mostly an unrepentant monster, and a caricature of politicians in general. Overall, I'd say that the book fails to convey this point very well.
  * Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
     * First half, getting off Earth and Earth's end: Yes. Ish. This can be disputed; I think the poetry of humanity's civilized end may be clouding my judgement.
     * Middle part, civil war in all but name: God no.
     * Finale with the future society: Not in the slightest.
  * Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of **rationalist fiction**, a subcategory of rational fiction.
     * On character's thinking - some characters yes, mostly no.
     * Improving their reasoning abilities: Not in the slightest.
     * So not rationalist.
  * Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
     * It's conveyed terribly, but overall it is reasonable worldbuilding, if not necessarily the most plausible outcome.
  ```
