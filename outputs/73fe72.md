## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I made [another CYOA](https://i.redd.it/kmkfakiic9pz.png) (you can see the first one I made [here](http://i.imgur.com/H9olbZM.jpg)). Would be interested to hear what y'all would make of it! Feel free to munchkin any or all of the powers, or just the one *you'd* choose IRL, or the one someone looking to maximize their cred as a historian would choose, etc. 

  Tried to strike a balance between clarifying the nature and extent of each power in-text and not being overly long, and it still ended up simultaneously too wordy and ambiguous in places. Feel free to ask for clarifications or just death of the author that shit, but ideally state explicitly any assumptions or interpretations you're making :]

  This is from a school play I had to perform a long time ago. The story itself was sadly more interested in beating us over the head with the moral than in exploring the societal/metaphysical impacts of the power in question, but I think it makes a good optimization target. 

  You have access to a very powerful magic artifact: a crown that when placed on a persons head turns every human in existence into an exact copy of that person until the crown is removed. You do not have direct control over your copies; they are exact duplicates of you at the moment the spell takes hold, but start diverging immediately after. 

  **Notes**:

  * The copies do not gain the skills or knowledge of the people whose body they are inhabiting.

  * You do not have a psychic link or other special method of communicating with the copies and the memories of the copies are not merged back into yours when the spell ends.

  * People retain no memory of what happened while the copies were inhabiting their body, no subjective time passes for anyone but the bearer of the crown.

  * There is no time limit on the use of the crown, nor is there a limit to how often it can be used. 

  * Your clothing, including the crown itself, is not copied along. Note that this will make it difficult to conceal your identity afterwards as your face will be on every security camera on the planet.

  * When the spell ends everyone turns back into their original body as it was when the crown was used (including wounds, diseases etc), but they are not teleported back to their original location. 

  * If a copy dies while the spell is active they remain dead until the spell ends, after which the original body is restored in the location of the corpse (or the nearest empty space to its centre of mass if the body is no longer in one piece).

  * If the person wearing the crown dies, the spell ends immediately.

  * There is a speed of light delay to the effect of the crown, so you can't use it for FTL signalling.

  Considering the power of the crown I'm having trouble coming up with good exploits for it. Anything that requires passwords or biometric identification is out, so you can't just wire a bunch of money to an account of your choice (and this would likely be detected and reversed as soon as the spell ends anyway). I suppose you could assassinate a bunch of people if your copies can somehow identify the person whose body they are inhabiting, but I'm a little sceptical about how much good you could really do by just killing a bunch of specific people, especially if it is going to be very obvious afterwards that it was murder.

  Also worth noting is that, depending on your definition of such things, you may be committing suicide approximately seven billion times every time you use the crown.

    I don't remember ever reading a power here and going "*What? What???*" over and over like this. Well done.

    Study up on critical skills like doing the job of a pilot or power plant operator in medias res. Strive to understand warning signs in any language.

    Do pregnant women turn into a copy of me with another full-grown copy of me bursting out of their stomach?

    Using it for longer than a few minutes the first time might break whoknowswhat system that was not designed to handle me. A minute might be enough for most versions of me realizing that this was a terrible mistake to shout that message to whomever nearby has a smartphone so they can post it to twitter or something. Study up on *swift* error reporting and switching keyboard languages. Some of those pitiable, soon amnesiac versions of me might be able to cobble together some writing-based cooperation with those pitiable critical people they just bestowed narcolepsy upon.

    Taking it off immediately pits the world against me. Giving them less than a few minutes at a time *might* be able to stop knowledge of my identity propagating too far. I suspect some military or clique of hackers would be able to improvise some protocol I don't understand.

    Sleep deprivation is a thing. Taking 8 hours of continued control after 16 hours for the world to intermittently prepare for that might be okay, but it would be easier to have a copilot to swap shifts with me.

    In fact, this crown might be better suited to some other person. Knowing that FAI is critical is well and good, but maybe this is important enough to find someone who *also* speaks all the languages and has all the worldkeeping skills and whose face is known to none and who doesn't burst all the clothing every time he appears. Time to raise a prince?

      ```
      Ooh, raising someone specifically for the purpose of wearing the crown is an interesting idea. I had considered finding someone else to wear the crown, but figured it would be difficult to find someone who shares my exact ethics, believes me when I explain the rules of the crown and is both willing to use it and more suitable for using it than me. 

      My thoughts were mostly along the lines of wearing the crown once, doing what needs to be done and then hiding it away never to be used again. Repeat use is just too risky, I think (plus all the collateral damage happens again every time you use it). Sleeping could indeed be a problem, though I imagine you could always just ducttape the crown to your head.
      ```

    ```
    You can't wire money, but you can steal physical goods/money.  Set up a number of specific points located across the world, either based on GPS coordinates or landmarks or something.  Then put on the crown.  Every copy of you figures out where they are, where the nearest location is, and where the nearest valuable goods/money are.  Maybe it's just whatever's in their wallet, maybe it's a nearby store with now unguarded goods, maybe they work in a bank and have access to some money not under combination lock.  They take all their stuff, and go put it in the location (bury it or place it in a P.O. box or storage shed that you've prepared ahead of time).  The idea here is they can walk/drive to the location relatively quickly, then return to their original location after a preset amount of time, when you take the crown off.  Then you can go around gradually collecting your loot from all of the locations.

    If you want to be moral, you could do the same thing but only stealing from previously designated people/places that do unethical things and then use the money for good things.

    Alternatively, if you wanted to be more subtle, you could set up a website ahead of time and have your copies go and type in their credit/debit card numbers, personal information, usernames/passwords, or any other information that they can find written down either in physical folders or on their computer (if it's not password protected, or they're already logged in).  This way nothing would be missing until you steal their identities potentially months/years later.

    Also, I think the assassination could be good if you have a way of identifying, say, members of ISIS even after the switch.

    Security footage could be a problem.  You could try to have everyone cover their face immediately and try to look around for cameras that caught the change, but I doubt every single one of them would get caught.  It would be obvious to everyone that something had occurred given that everyone in the world lost time, and they would only need a few cameras that you didn't notice in order to get a good look at your face.  The best solution would be to find a way of temporarily altering your face as much as possible in a way that would be copied.  If you grow out your hair and then tie it around your face as a mask, would the copies come into existence with their hair in the same hairstyle?  If so, that's probably your best bet, then cut/dye your hair afterwards.  Otherwise, you could try to make your face swell up from bee-stings or some sort of chemical, such that the copy people look nothing like you will after you heal.
    ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      If you are trying to be moral about it (which I was indeed), I am a little sceptical that you can do enough good with the wealth redistribution of what amounts to 7 billion cases of petty theft to offset the massive amounts of property damage caused by each use of the crown.

      That said, this:

      > If you grow out your hair and then tie it around your face as a mask, would the copies come into existence with their hair in the same hairstyle? If so, that's probably your best bet, then cut/dye your hair afterwards.

      is a brilliant idea. Just to be safe you'd want to conceal from the world that you are growing your hair out in the months before you put on the crown, but that can be achieved.
      ```

      - u/zarraha:
        ```
        Lots of people have long hair, so I suppose you could just perpetually have long hair, avoid the property damage, and you'd only be as much suspect as the other tens of thousands of people with long hair and similar hair color and body structure as you.

        You'd stand a better chance at a net positive if you scouted out unethical rich people ahead of time and only stole from them, having the other clones sit around idly, but, unless you can complete your theft incredibly quickly, I think you'd still come out negative given the sheer amount of man-hours that would be lost around the world during the time you're wasting multiplied by 7 billion, possible causing disasters as important infrastructure goes untended and airplanes aren't properly piloted, and workers in poor countries lose daylight hours and leave tasks unfinished that your clones wouldn't know how to do or that they need to be done in the first place.

        I don't think you could make up for that by Robin-Hooding a few rich jerks, so I guess the most ethical thing to do would be to destroy the crown if possible.

    >  when placed on a persons head turns every human in existence into an exact copy of that person until the crown is removed. 

    So... If I have a bunch of embryos in a petri dish, and I put on the crown, they all magically become copies of me, magicking up the extra body mass from nowhere? Mass = Energy so... this is a massive power source.

    Of course, there are some dangers here, you don't want to convert all humans into copies of you, because that would make them really mad and quite likely kill several of them (including the pregnant). 

    Luckily, we may be saved by:

    > There is a speed of light delay to the effect of the crown, so you can't use it for FTL signalling.

    This might mean you can control who gets turned into a copy of you and who doesn't, depending on how it works. Let's say I put on the crown for a second and then take it off. Would that only convert humans within a lightsecond of me into copies? Since the rest of humanity would be further away than the FTL speed of the crown's spell.

    If so, move far away from the rest of humanity, bringing only your target converts with you (like a bunch of embryos in a test tube). Put the test tube in a power plant of some kind, and put on the crown for just long enough to convert the embryos into copies of you to generate power from their extra mass, while not long enough to convert far away humans. 

    (People might still be pissed off by your mass murdering of embryos though.)
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      No FTL signaling, so taking the crown off must send a lightspeed liberation wave chasing the control wave. Jumping into a large black hole with the crown on should make your rule eternal.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        Gah! Ok, that makes the problem much harder, since now you need to gain the consent of all of humanity in order to use the crown. And you will need to use the crown since it is the only known way to combat the heat death of the universe. 

        Perhaps once a decade, get all of humanity to move to safe locations while you use the crown to generate mass energy? 

        For privacy, you could give people boxes that lock from the inside with a password required to open from either side, so they lock themselves inside the boxes before you put on the crown, and the fact that copies don't gain information from their hosts ensures the copies can't get out of the box and so people have peace of mind knowing their replacement copies didn't do anything.

          - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
            ```
            But if you do that, where would you get human embryos to convert into copies using your crown? You need live humans to have a reliable supply of human embryos.

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      I deliberately didn't specify what constitutes human in the original post, because I couldn't come up with a good definition (shockingly, the story didn't delve into the specifics of whether embryo's are effected by the crown), but I feel that if an embryo is developed enough to qualify as human for the crown then it is probably developed enough that mass harvesting them is unethical. /u/Gurkenglas's homo potatus could work though.

    Every use is going to cause a lot of accidental death. Pilots, surgeons, drivers, extreme sports fans would all die in droves. The only permissable use would have to save more lives than it cost, which basically boils down to war (counterintuitively). War is declared, the crown is used, one side now has no ammo and all their advanced tech is destroyed.
    ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Honestly the odds of this going well for you seem ~0 since at the moment you put on the crown the odds of you being the person wearing the crown will be one in 7 billion, otherwise you suddenly find yourself somewhere else and realize that you will die pretty soon once the crown is taken off.        

    So basically using the crown is a terrible idea because in addition to probably getting caught once you take it off, you are also obliterating so many iterations of your own mind that your odds of survival are slim.
    ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      That's what the disclaimer about committing seven billion counts of suicide was about. It does pretty strongly depend on your definition of identity, though. I can imagine an argument that because one instance of you is guaranteed to survive it is more like getting a whole bunch of new memories and then having them taken away from you again rather than you having a 1:7 billion chance to survive. 

      This is not necessarily the argument I would make (my own intuitions on this topic are failing to come up with a good answer), but I feel it is a reasonable position to take.
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        Right I always seem to forget how many people actually consider that a reasonable position or even actually _believe_ it. It always strikes me as a position that totally misses the point of actually predicting future experience in favor of being overly caught up in unanswerable question about identity.

        Still it strikes me as bizarre how many people assume that the parts of your mind responsible for a poorly defined "self" would be the same as those that are responsible for subjective experiences.

      >  the odds of you being the person wearing the crown will be one in 7 billion

      That's a fascinating view of identity.  I can see how it would create interesting, and very different, reactions to an upload or simulation problem. Hm. 

      The crown wearer would have perfect continuity, while other instances of myself might be startled by the transition, perhaps from the transition from "having my arms raised just above my head holding the weight of the crown" to being whereever I am.   I don't think that this new "I" would go into an existential crisis on realizing that, though, I'd continue on whatever goal the mind-state that was me a few seconds ago and perhaps a thousand miles away intended to do.  If that was "Try to keep doing whatever your previous self was doing and avoid catastrophes. And if you find yourself staring at an open Bitcoin wallet, wire some to this address, so that original us can have some funds to continue working on the plan" I'd go about it. I don't see why I'd suddenly become jealous of the crown-wearer, or fearful of my imminent cessation.

      Well, the moral of the story was "it's ok to be different" not "please don't mind rape every human on the planet", but yeah you'd need to do something pretty big with the crown in order to do enough good to warrant it's use. 

      I would argue that preventing sufficiently large disasters (the already mentioned thermonuclear armageddon for instance) or assuring something very good happens (FAI is the first thing that comes to mind, but effecting some large and lasting political changes might also suffice I think).

  ```
  You have a one in a hundred million genetic brain anomaly. It is dormant until a bad car accident puts you in a coma. You wake up faster than the doctors expected, and it turns out that not only did your brain heal itself, but it also grew new connections between your prefrontal cortex and parts of your brain that are normally beneath consciousness. You discover that you now have significant conscious control over your autonomic nervous system. Specifically, you can

  1. Exercise a lot of control over your heart rate.

  2. Exert your muscles past their normal brain-imposed limitations.

  3. Turn any of your senses on or off at will, including pain.

  4. Cause yourself to fall asleep instantly, or alternatively keep yourself awake and focused much longer than normal (though the effects of sleep deprivation would still slowly set in and reduce your performance; you just wouldn't consciously notice for a long time).

  5. Focus your full attention on anything you choose, and be able to instantly change focus to something else of your choice, without any significant mental break.

  6. Control your emotions very precisely. For example, your could suppress stage fright and make yourself feel extremely happy about being in front of people. You could change how you feel about particular people and things, even change your basic disgust response.

  7. Alter your sexuality at will. You could make yourself asexual for a period of time, and then later make yourself attracted to very specific people or things.

  Is this ability a blessing or a curse? How would you use it to make yourself wealthy and powerful? I came up with this when trying to think of the absolute minimal changes needed to make someone a superhero, changes that are very close to plausible. If you're wondering how it could be a curse, note that more conscious control is not always a good thing. There would be the constant temptation to just turn off all pain signals, but this is a terrible idea, since you could seriously hurt yourself without knowing it. Similarly, there would be the temptation to turn off all negative emotions, but that may not be good for your mental health in the long run.
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    .. It is a blessing, but not a very munchkin-able one, because if you munchkin it, it is a curse. Almost everyone would use this to make themselves a bit better version of themselves. 

    It can do rather a lot more than that, but.. if you go for that, you will warp yourself into whatever you consider the ideal person to be in very short order. For story purposes, I think this is actually a lot better if it is no way shape or form unique - that is, this is the background story that lead to a pharma giant to to start selling a 3 week course of injections that gives *anybody* this package
    ```

  - u/LieGroupE8:
    ```
    So far, people don't seem to think you can do much with this power. I disagree. Things I came up with after a couple of minutes of thinking:

    1. Make lots of easy money being a lab rat for neuroscientists and psychologists. Become semi-famous in this way.

    2. Use my focus and emotional control to bootstrap myself up to an Elon-Musk-level work-ethic.

    3. Learn the basics of magic and stuntwork, and become rich and famous by performing David-Blaine-esque feats of endurance. Whether or not this works depends on how much your body can adapt to doing impressive feats. Maybe even with total control and lots of practice, you just aren't cut out for David Blaine's line of work. In which case, focus on 4, 5, or 6.

    4. Exploit the market of lonely people by starting a lucrative friend-for-rent business, with your comparative advantage being that during your time with a client you *genuinely* care deeply about them. If you're not good-looking, maybe use some of the money you made being a semi-famous labrat and/or stuntperson to invest in cosmetic surgery. If you're up for it, you could even make loads of cash being the world's most sought-after prostitute (there would definitely be people into it even if you're only average looking).

    5. You're basically the perfect romantic partner for the same reason - no matter who you're with, you can genuinely think of them as the sexiest person on earth. Use this and your previous fame to marry a rich person, if you can.

    6. Use your focus and emotional control to try and develop the world's best memory, using standard mind-palace techniques. Win 
    the world memory competition every year and collect the cash prize. Combine your memory with your Elon-Musk level work ethic and become a super entrepreneur. 

    7. Or, avoid all the above and instead use your complete self-control to become the world's greatest spy. You would be the world's best liar, and also deceptively strong.

    If absolutely none of this works for you, then yes, you can just go on and continue being a slightly better version of yourself.

      This seems extremely dangerous. Modifying your own utility function has a tendency to be permanent. In this example, once you modify your utility function to include genuine care for someone, there is a very real chance that you would no longer want to modify your utility function back to uncaring, since you do care about them and modifying your function to not care could hurt them.
      ```

      - u/LieGroupE8:
        ```
        Yeah, it's dangerous, but maybe you could train yourself in advance to overcome the feelings. Or maybe never let the feelings go entirely; just be polyamorous and make room for caring about lots of people. It's definitely not the first thing I would try, though.

    So yeah, curse. If you leave out 6 (and possibly 7) it does seem interesting, not very munchkinable though. Probably just find some extremely demanding job that pays really well and after a few years start SpaceX from the money you made.

  - u/PreFollower:
    ```
    That's not really all that well as it looks like at the first glance. It is kinda cool, sure, but pretty dangerous in the long run.

    Muscle control leads to strains and heavy joint stress all the time. You need to be very precise with muscular groups to not dislocate something. It may be better if you get familiar with how limbs move (I mean we usually move them subconsciously, not controlling every strand by one), build some mass, keep joints in good health, all that. Though if you do not overuse it, there are some benefits, and overall tone is much better.

    Turning off pain turns into habit, and combined with previous one, it is not a good thing. Luckily, in modern society there are not many situations where you need to clench teeth and keep going, if you're not a soldier or boxer or something. Though thinking of it, you can be pretty good martial sportsman with pain tolerance and trained overcharged strikes. Bonuses for keeping calm all the time or going into primal rage at will.

    Emotion control is very nice, though the main problem is (as I think) that emotions are just reactions of your personality to external stimuli. You can suppress them constantly, but that leads to a whole lot of bad stuff, starting with neuroses. 

    Changing your personality helps with that, but it goes pretty deep and you got to be very knowledgeably about yourself. To change how you feel about particular person, for example, requires you to understand what do you like and don't like about them, where this likes and dislikes come from, how they interact with each other and so on. Sure, you can just hardwire the feeling of euphoria to this person, so you will be exctatic all the time while interacting with them, but if you had any negative responses to start with, it will backfire pretty much the same as the suppressed emotions.

    Speaking of euphoria, luckily it is not exactly possible to accidentally slip into nirvana, because there are some limiters on amount of happiness hormones produced and then brain recalibrates itself so experiences lie in some range, so after a while it evens out. But I bet with some amount of effort you can make yourself into an eternally happy vegetable. Not really a good use of those abilities, sure.

    Some may say that changing you personality so that you have completely different reactions (and nice, stable change requires altering a solid part of network) is turning into another person entirely, like you die as yourself and all that stuff. I prefer to think that if I have continuous memories, I remain the same person, and even more, that many possible versions of personality constitute some "meta-ego", and current personality is just one of the configurations. Well, it really helps to have self-imposed utility function that you keep constant through changes, so you don't lose track completely. Memory altering is a thing too, you'll be at least changing emotions associated with said memories to help with personality editing, but I don't need to point at dangers of this.

    Full attention focusing looks promising, if you can forcefully induce state of inspiration when you don't see anything else and work on problem with your maximum potential, you can achieve a lot, but I think it depends on your talent and skills and such, so it will be more or less useful for different people. But I bet this mode is very taxing and mentioned sleep deprivation won't really help with keeping you healthy.

    I'd probably continue doing exactly what I'm doing, just more efficiently, and try not to kill myself by forgetting a decimal when experimenting with important systems. I guess it would be a blessing insofar as I could just ignore my newfound control and leave everything on autopilot until I *really* need it, and I could still e.g. dull pain to the point of a good painkiller without all the harmful side-effects and not remove it completely (like, I have a few niggling injuries but not really what you'd describe as chronic pain, and acute pains I can dull for a time until they'd fade on their own). I guess there'd be a temptation to self-wirehead or disappear up my own ass in to some transcendental, nirvana-lite state, so I'd stay away from exploring those options. But anyway, even with perfect mind-muscle connection I'd still be far inferior to extremely dedicated, drug-enhanced athletes (and a lot more likely to injure myself); even with no stage fright I'd be far below the world's most charismatic orators; even with super concentration ability I'd still lack the raw talent, experience, and dedication to match the best of the best at their chosen fields, etc.

  You are stuck in a (deterministic) time loop. The loop lasts 7 days, after which everything resets, *including* your memories. However, you may send one bit of information per loop back to yourself (a 0 or a 1). 

  At the end of every loop, or when you die, you have 1 minute to choose what to send back. This information goes to a simple table listing each bit for each loop iteration. At the beginning of the every loop, you are told these rules and are given a laptop with access to the table. This access is magical and until you turn on the laptop, there is no effect on the physical world. The laptop is otherwise just a laptop.

    I expect that the strategy I would end up with after the first week would take into account the following:

      - Tactics like above allow arbitrary communication out of a loop iteration.
      - Experiments on the laptop are in order. Can table contents be queried other than one bit at a time without influencing the world other than through query outputs? How large/infinite is the table adress space?
      - Breaking the laptop turns the loop infinite. Checking the 10^ludicroust bit early in each iteration prevents this, but might stop other strategies from working past that mark.
      - Every second that has not been exactly replicated in a previous iteration is one in which some idiot might hook up a random number generator to a CPU and spawn an AGI that takes over the loop. Try not to bring about exponential amounts of original time.
      - As always, the endgame is to bring about an FAI. Contact everyone who has a potato code and organize a Mother of Learning.

    I'm assuming that by "deterministic" you mean that everyone starts in the same initial conditions and will propagate in the same direction, so everyone and everything will do the same things every week except as altered by your actions.  Without the extra information, you would always make the exact same decisions and get the exact same result, but since every week gives you a different code, your behavior will be different, if only chaotically.  This should mean that any decisions you make before seeing the bits should be identical in every loop, only deviating after you've looked.  Thus, you can plan and create a protocol for sending and receiving messages in binary and be confident that every other version of you has come up with an identical plan.

    My first plan is simple to implement, but has only monetary payout.  Pick a lottery where you can pick numbers that resolves in less than a week, and create a 1-1 function that maps integers to lottery tickets.  Each week, you buy lottery tickets based the length of the string, and if you win the lottery you exit the loop and are rich, if you lose you restart the loop and pick a 0, making the string one digit longer so in the next loop you will buy a different lottery ticket.     You are guaranteed to win eventually since you'll go through every possible list of numbers, and the winning ticket should be the same every time.

    If you want, you could do this with multiple lotteries, buying one ticket from each, and not exit the loop until you win all of them simultaneously, so long as you think you can you'll actually get paid despite an inevitable investigation that will occur.

    Alternatively, you could use this as a protocol for trying any chanced event such as gambling at a casino, or spending a week in a random town trying to discover the love of your life, as long as you have well-defined criteria for how to vary your behavior based on the string length, and what counts as a success so you won't loop forever.

    Alternatively, you could be more sophisticated and actually attempt to send messages to yourself.  If you commit to a method for converting between text and binary, you could write questions for future yous to investigate, and then have them investigate and write an answer.  If you spend N iterations writing out "What are the winning lottery numbers for PowerBall on [DATE]" then the next few people write out the answer since they'll know the answer at the end of the week.  Even though every version of you would know the answer at the end of the week, even the ones asking the question, the question allows the you at the beginning of the week to know precisely what the numbers are referring to, and allows you to ask a second question after the first answer, and a third question, and so on.  You'd probably want to include some form of error correcting in your binary encoding in case some version of you dies before learning the answer, or accidentally and chaotically changes the answer, but is forced to leave a 0 or 1 anyway.

    Once you have an method of sending arbitrary messages back in time a week (so long as the messages are about reliable results that multiple versions of you can get consistent answers about) you can shortcut answers to any sort of scientific or social experiment, or stock market data, or prediction of events that resolve in a week.  Find which stock has the biggest upswing (or downswing), find a method to convince a bank or investing company to commit to that stock (or shorting it) and giving you a cut, add that to your to do list for your final run.  etc.

    Over and over and over again. Probably take a week off each time and go on a fun vacation.

    But hmmm, does the laptop have limitless storage and search capabilities? Are there any limits to how many loops I can go through?

    So the loop is deterministic barring the information I access on the laptop, eh. I could try using the current values as a seed to perturb my actions enough, and try to cooperate across iterations to dowse for buried treasure and stuff (maybe including treasure buried in e.g. scratch-off tickets in gas stations, etc.). I think I might probably be able to establish some sort of schelling point code in the first few iterations of the loop which subsequent loopers would follow (e.g. have each 1 represents a square meter, starting at the south pole and spiraling clockwise up to the north; 000s represent places to investigate upon exiting the loop), and a week should be enough to get myself somewhere and start digging. I reckon stuff like lottery tickets would be too sensitive to initial conditions if they're the draw-balls-out-of-a-container sort (when I choose to exit do I play through one more final loop, or just continue on as I was from my exit time? If the latter, I could precommit to exiting only after I've had a really, really, *really* good week, using that aforementioned seed as perturbation, though I'd probably be convinced to exit far before then, and trying to make use of seeds corresponding to however many bytes worth of data would eventually get my computer bogged down to the point of worthlessness).


     Actually, my first moves would be to pay some smart people to brainstorm with me on how to exploit the loop -- some $$ could grease their palms enough to seriously entertain my crazy thought experiment. Then I'd take their advice into consideration and change my plans accordingly.

  Within the pact universe, someone posted ebooks of the thornburn library online on a fairly dark part of the web encrypted with a cicada 3031 like puzzle, you get a copy, how do you do anything useful with this information on how to make contracts with demons?

    The correct answer is *I don't*. I become a Practitioner, because that's the sort of thing that interests me, and then I work on building positive karma by magically tracing whoever posted the information and putting them down before they introduce more demons into the universe.

        *Pact* works on story logic. People who behave in ways the spirits approve of get ahead, and I have neutral karma instead of Blake's horrifically negative amounts. It's risky, and possibly a long-term project, but in a universe where existence is slowly being drained away by demons, not fighting demons would nag at me way too much - and making contracts with them is less smart by virtue of the short term (personal karma loss) and long term (universal degradation) consequences.

          Its a distinctly dark story book logic, foolish children are not going to be cut out of the wolf because it had the kindness to shallow them whole and then by pure chance a woodsmen comes along.

          Bowing to the old gods who believe antiqued ideas such as debts carried over generations or the "noble" houses keeping the vast majority of humans in the dark, may not be truly best and by their logic your success is evil as its form tainted source.

          Furthermore, the thronburn line, while massively in debt, is able to pay off the debt in some way.
