  I wonder if they actually have to worry about Silverlake. I mean, she's a totally selfish person who would betray anyone and hurt innocents if it ends in her favor, so I can easily see her trying to defeat the real Silverlake first to get all her stuff back. And she would be able to do it quite easily too, since she knows everything about her real self while her real self doesn't even know her loop self exists. Then, since she has to defeat her real self anyway, she could very well erase Silverlake's mind and transfer her own mind over to her body, the same way evil simulacrums try to take over the real mage's body. Then, since she would be back in her own body rather than Paxaneth's puppet body, she wouldn't have to worry about the death pact and have no incentive to release it.
  ```

  - u/AngryEdgelord:
    ```
    Good point. Necromancers should be able to get around having a kill-switch in their bodies by body-hopping. As long as the kill-switch isn't put on their souls at least.
    ```

    - u/Arno_Nymus:
      ```
      Even if it is on their souls. I guess as an immortal soul magician she already knows her own soul well enough to remove everything that does not belong there. I guess there is some risk involved in tinkering with your own soul even for most expert soul magicians, but that should be negligible. At least for someone with her skills.
      ```

      - u/AngryEdgelord:
        ```
        I think the best explanation here is that since PX is best at flesh and mind magic, he plans on making some mechanism that binds the soul to the flesh more thoroughly than normal bodies so a soul mage can't easily escape. It doesn't have to be an unbreakable bond after all, it just needs to last a month.
        ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        Depends.  Can Panaxeth recreate bits of the Marker?

        We already know that stuff can be triggered by tampering with the Marked soul, or by the Marked soul leaving the body, so it's just a matter of copying those mechanisms, and having the result be death instead of restarting the loop.
        ```

  - u/Gr_Cheese:
    ```
    Have we confirmed that a straight up mind transfer or body hopping is possible? As in Person A(Mind A) => Person B(Mind A), Person A(Mind Null)? I feel like Zorian would have gone body-hopping already if it were that simple.

    Otherwise Silverlake runs into her simulacrum problem, with Person A(Mind A) & Person B(Mind A) and an expiration date on Person A as her final outcome. Silverlake A(A) wouldn't allow for the destruction of herself, Silverlake B(A) would know that, and they'd probably end up fighting until one or the other is dead since Panaxeth rampaging is a massive negative for B(A) with no upside and A(A) needs Panaxeth free.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Ah, poor prime!Silverlake, we barely knew ye...
    ```

    - u/notagiantdolphin:
      ```
      Well, if they emerge they have a quick (if underdeveloped) ally. "HEY WITCH. AN OLDER MORE POWERFUL YOU WANTS YOU DEAD. WANNA HELP US NECK HER?".

       Bam. Alliance made. Silverlake knows any old version of her would come for her eventually - she's a terrible person.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        >WANNA HELP US NECK HER?

        Not before she completes her youth potion, at any rate.
        ```

- u/FriendlyAnnatar:
  ```
  In Zorian's place, what would you do with Panaxeth's deal? Barely any time before the loop ends and you die, with its assertions that Zach is ultimately your enemy (or at least your successes are mutually exclusive) hanging over your head. 

  The thing is, obviously there're still a great deal of Knightian unknowns remaining and Zorian is essentially being prodded by a probable superintelligent being. Those random phrases and off-topic discussions Panaxeth was saying to some loopers? I'm fairly certain it was throwing low effort stimuli at them to improve its mental model of them, which implies it probably already has a good one of Zorian (having been through many more unique loops means a larger dataset). Combined with its superior knowledge and processing power, if it wasn't for narrative reasons I would assume this was a guaranteed losing situation. 

  Personally,

  >! I feel like there's really no point in agreeing to Panaxeth's deal because ultimately you're disabling the Controller for what might be nothing; Panaxeth isn't obligated to follow through on his end of the deal.

  >!Broader analysis notwithstanding, I feel like at this point I would need to somehow disable Zach and take a look at his mind with an aranean guide to verify Panaxeth's claims. There are risks, but it's worth it.
  ```

  - u/abnotwhmoanny:
    ```
    Panaxeth doesn't actually SEEM to be a superintelligence though. It seems to have vast capabilities, but while it can record things with perfect clarity (supposedly) it has an admittedly limited capability to process information. It also fails spectacularly to convince most of the group. What we can say with relative certainty is that Zach's magical capacity is superhuman, that someone or something divine has allowed him the single largest power known to ever be given to a mortal (the Sovereign Gate), and that Panaxeth is more than willing to manipulate and lie (his accounts to multiple different people disagree with each other).  


    He's willing to use a portion of his remaining power, which he's stated is limited, in order to get rid of Zach. That would imply that if you actually wanted to beat Panaxeth, Zach is useful. Also there's no reason to trust that Panaxeth would ever ACTUALLY release you. He has to use the power he is clearly cautious of using in order to pay you for a service you've already rendered. I doubt he would be troubled by not keeping a deal with a mere human.  


    No. I wouldn't take the deal. I would consider taking the original deal that let's me out for the death bond, if only to help stop his resurrection, but that would only be a very last resort. Tricking Panaxeth into letting you do that doesn't seem too incredibly difficult. Even after extensively researching Zorian, it thinks it's wise to mention that it views destroying an entire city as an unfortunate side-effect of getting out. It seems to have a bit of trouble actually understanding human motivations and thought processes.
    ```

    - u/rtsynk:
      ```
      > It also fails spectacularly to convince most of the group. 

      or Silverlake was just the quickest to turn

      (not to mention it didn't even bother to try to convince some of the others)
      ```

      - u/abnotwhmoanny:
        ```
        That's a fair point, but the only conversation we get to see actually happen is the one with Zorian, where it fails miserably. That's on top of the fact that it used it's conversation with Zorian's brother entirely to help get information to convince Zorian. So it managed to convince Silverlake to betray people. That seems like something a subhuman could accomplish given you could actually save her, let alone a superintelligence.
        ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        The hell does "quickest" mean while under time dilation?
        ```

        - u/HeroOfOldIron:
          ```
          Least effort invested maybe?
          ```

    - u/FriendlyAnnatar:
      ```
      I definitely agree that it's performance appeared subpar for a superintelligence, but that's probably what it wants you to think. /s

      I was assuming that since it got Silverlake so easily it was just feeling the others out. Especially given its time dilation powers, that seems like an easy strategy to prepare for the next conversation if there is one and leave the best chance of convincing ZZ it's safe to try again without Silverlake.

      And overall I still think it displays good intelligence--Zorian is strongly hostile to Panaxeth so he didn't waste much time on him initially, but by his second encounter Panaxeth has a very tempting offer in place and is playing mind games. 

      But it's possible there's some other reason- maybe it has limited processing power so it didn't waste any on members of the group with limit usefulness (Taiven, Nora). Maybe you're right and it's performance was underwhelming because it's just a weak AI with tremendous resources (e.g. the Chimp in Peter Watt's Sunflower setting).

      P. S. : Actually, on a re-reading Xvim asks why it wasn't more effective at tempting them, and the speculation was  that the primordial didn't have total awareness of individuals in the loop / sees them as alien.

        I agree, but to be fair, if you are a super-intelligence and \*sub-super-intelligent\* beings have a viable threat/risk, then playing at sub-super-intelligence is a viable, nay even smart, play.
        ```

    - u/DismalWard77:
      ```
      Thing is the original deal is off the table since the gate is barred and he has enough people. He seems to want Zach gone permanently and would be stupid to let Zorian go out at all since Zorian has a time limit where he dies regardless so Panaxeth has no reason to help him at all even if he does something to Zach.
      ```

      - u/abnotwhmoanny:
        ```
        The gate can be unbarred at any time with the key, and while the original deal was SUPPOSEDLY off the table, Panaxeth seems to be more than willing to go back on his word if he thinks it will help him. He might not be worried enough to help Zorian escape now, but if Zach used his key to waltz out he might be a bit more desperate.
        ```

        - u/MagicwaffIez:
          ```
          The gate no longer thinks of zorian as a controller... If zach leaves then the loop will be destroyed immediately...
          ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    Rooting through Zach's mind at this point in the story has basically become unavoidable and inevitable. But I agree that it's most likely not going to be with the purpose of shattering it, but rather with the intent of discovering how it was tampered and what exactly Zach had been told about the loop by the angels before his memory was erased by Red Robe.

        - u/abnotwhmoanny:
          ```
          Or how the hell they became a looper. Assuming it is Veyers, I'd guess that Panathex intervened somehow, but one would expect the Sovereign Gate to prevent that kind of thing. I mean, that's pretty obviously something one of the primordials would want to do, so it would have happened in the past uses of the gate if it was that simple. Right? Unless there's something special about Panathex specifically.
          ```

          - u/Angelbaka:
            ```
            Judging on what just happened and what we know of Zach's character, I would bet that pre-memory edit Zach brought RR into the gate, where the primordial had one of his little "talks" with him, agreed to a deal, and altered his marker as part of the payment.  This would explain motivation, timing and abilities and is utterly consistent with post-edit Zach's actions as a Looper.
            ```

            - u/Mr-Mister:
              ```
              > and altered his marker as part of the payment

              That, or read and overwrote his mind each time (since it can "remember" things prefectly).
              ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I'd suggest that retrieving lost memories should be Zorian's stated reason for getting into his mind, but once in, they should be able to talk telepathically without Panaxeth overhearing, which presents its own possibilities.
      ```

  - u/DismalWard77:
    ```
    They've been needing to check inside Zach's mind a long time ago. Still Zach is his only best bet to getting out at all though its unsure whether Zach would be cooperative after Zorian looks into his mind if he can't undo whatever the angels and/or red robe did to him.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    if I were Zorian? I'd take the deal and try to dump as much of my mind into the non-loop version of me, then die at the end of the month. It's the safest, least-dead form of death in that situation, imo.
    ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      Dead-bound deal is no longer offered. Current deal offered is to disable Zach from leaving, effectively killing him. [This comment] (https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9id2fb/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_90_change_of/e6iuhf6/) explore the trapping of such deal.
      ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    >Barely any time before the loop ends and you die, 

    Is there a reason Zorian can't get a temporary marker like the others have used for the past couple resets? It doesn't get him through indefinitely, but it does give several months margin.

    Assuming he's even at risk, since the controller could well have been compromised when it claimed it was going to reset Zorian at the end of the month. Not something to stake your existence on, granted, but a possibility all the same.
    ```

    - u/FriendlyAnnatar:
      ```
      I was assuming that the Guardian was not compromised during that part because it does make sense that interactions between the Guardian and Controller would have built-in protections from the Maker, and the explanation about the Key triggering a full analysis was extremely logical.

      But I agree that's not confirmed, and the Guardian was vague about how it was going to resolve the situation so its possible the temporary marker could tide Zorian over... Personally I would be surprised if that was permitted, something like specifically wiping the "anomaly" is my default assumption.
      ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  Hmm, Panaxeth said that there's no point in isolating Zach because it doesn't care if he hears what it has to say to Zorian, but then it tell Zorian to betray Zach as its only price for getting out of the time loop. This doesn't add up, obviously, so sowing discord between the two is probably the goal. Zorian has been much more instrumental in stopping the invasion in the past than Zach, so maybe it is trying to get Zach to kill Zorian now, which implies that Zorian is actually closer to getting out on his own than he realizes and Panaxeth needs to stop that.
  ```

  - u/FriendlyAnnatar:
    ```
    It's a bit of a win-win, isn't it? Either Zorian takes him up on his offer (Panaxeth wins), they both distrust each other more (Panaxeth wins at least a little, more if they actually fight), and worst case they ignore it (no downside).
    ```

    - u/eroticas:
      ```
      It's a potential downside that neither of them will trust Panaxeth now as a result of its behavior
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Um...are you saying that before this happened, they *did* trust the eldritch abomination?

        This has always been negotiation over a barrel - "obliterated at loop end" vs "*might* get backstabbed and obliterated by primordial", people take the possibility of destruction over the certainty - not based on real trust.
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I have a theory: Panaxeth realises that if ZZ keep working together, then Zorian can *reversibly* lock away Zach's memories, while leaving a compulsion to exit the loop after Zorian leaves. Then Zorian claims his ticket, meets Zach in the real world, and fixes him. Panaxeth can't actually read minds, so if Zorian made it look convincing, Panaxeth couldn't tell the difference. And once Zorian is out, Zach doesn't need Panaxeth's help any more.

    So, it deliberately sowed distrust to ensure that Zorian can only enter Zach's mind by force and as an enemy.
    ```

    - u/trobertson:
      ```
      This could potentially also allow for a tunnel out for everyone else.

      1. Zorian makes a simulacrum.

      2. Zorian "scrambles" Zach's mind.

      3. Zorian gets out.

      4. Zorian and simulacrum make a Gate (from inside to outside), everyone gets out.

      5. Zach gets out the normal way.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Nice idea, but no. Step 3.5 is, "All the remaining loop iterations take place in a fraction of a real-world millisecond, and the loop collapses before step 4."
        ```

        - u/trobertson:
          ```
          Oh yeah, forgot about that.
          ```

          - u/CrystalineAxiom:
            ```
            Also simulacrums get dispelled if they're on the other side of a time dilation field. That's why Zorian had to rely on Damien to create a gate after using the black room.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              Good point, but that part is actually less of a big deal. Simulacra isolated from the caster don't instantly vanish, they just lose their mana source and degrade over time until they break down completely. So that obstacle is not insurmountable.
              ```

  - u/Croktopus:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure that the "Guardian" they were talking to when they just went in was Panaxeth manipulating them. Z&Z are some suckahs.
    ```

    - u/Seyt77:
      ```
      Tbh everything the guardian said since the very begining is suspect since Panaxeth has been able to possess it. Only thing I would trust is the markers they have on themselves as that would be farfetched to think Panaxeth has been manipulating that information as well.
      ```

      - u/Croktopus:
        ```
        yeah i think that distrusting *all* perception in the sovereign gate is going a bit far - i think its more likely that panaxeth is just able to manipulate his own appearance

        that being said, it is definitely plausible that there was never a guardian (other than panaxeth). it taking over the guardian without the need for them to unbar the gate is fairly strong evidence. could be that zach and zorian have always been *able* to leave, but just didnt know *how*, and were trusting the guardian to be honest.
        ```

        - u/Seyt77:
          ```
          It's entirely possible the person that Zach trusted and was betrayed by wasn't rr initially but the guardian. Panaxeth could be tricked Zach by imitating as the guardian and had Zach spell his own doom by saying he needed specific things to work or get out. Kinda farfetch but possible
          ```

- u/WilyCoyotee:
  ```
  Zorian needs to get into zach's head, yesterday.
  ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    Yes. It's a definite point of suspicion, and one they can no longer afford to ignore.

    I think there is a distinct possibility that Zach knocked Silver lake out of the loop personally.
    ```

    - u/WilyCoyotee:
      ```
      I dunno, seems like taking the primordial up on his offer would be something silverlake would do. Then again there is the loop blacklist, so it's not like zach COULDN'T do it, but we really don't know his motivations right now.
      ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    The problem is that Zach wasn't too keen on that idea before (possibly due to some kind of compulsion placed on him) and will certainly not be more willing to allow it now. 

    Which, come to think of it, might very well be the whole point of Panaxeths offer.
    ```

- u/Yes_This_Is_God:
  ```
  Wow.

  They're definitely in the end-game now. The presentation of this problem was really well done. Can't wait for the next few chapters.
  ```

  - u/Watchful1:
    ```
    My prediction, when they went back in the gate, it was Panaxeth talking to them the whole time, he just pretended he needed to do the whole body thing to confuse them. Nothing has changed about Zorian's marker, it was just Panaxeth saying that to force him into making a premature choice.

    He's going to side with Zach, they are going to try to tunnel out at the end of the loop and fail, but Zorian wakes up again in the next loop.
    ```

    - u/abnotwhmoanny:
      ```
      That would be a fun twist. I honestly never considered the possibility that Panaxeth is pretending to be the guardian at the end. It's certainly within it's shown capabilities, and makes sense as a way to help convince Zorian.
      ```

    - u/earzo7:
      ```
      Honestly, the Guardian seemed a bit *different* from his other appearance, didn't he? He was more eloquent than he should have been capable of being.
      ```

      - u/Watchful1:
        ```
        Yeah, the line that really stood out to me was "Of course a thorough check of everything is in order". The guardian has never tried to justify anything like that before.
        ```

        - u/Arno_Nymus:
          ```
          I noticed that too, but I thought that the previous version of the guardian was simply broken. Like if your computer has a virus and you start it in safe mode all its capabilities are limited, but if you install your OS freshly again and thus remove the virus the computer works as it is supposed to.
          ```

    - u/Croktopus:
      ```
      i honestly kind of feel like this was too well telegraphed :\ my first thought when they went back in was "wait do they actually believe that this *isnt* panaxeth?"
      ```

    - u/addmoreice:
      ```
      I definitely agree as well.

      The fact that when they return from the conversation \*the Guardian isn't there\* hints at this as well. My guess? Panaxy-boy fundamentally broke the guardian in order to pull off his conversation. The guardian not being there when the conversation was over highly suggests \*something\* is wrong there. When they came back, it doesn't seem to match up exactly to its previous behaviors.

      I'm betting it's just Panaxeth from there out pretending to be the Guardian and now is trying for a quick scam to cause discord between Z&Z. No loss if it fails, but even a disagreement which offers no harm between the two results in reduced effectiveness in the long run. The fact that a real disagreement between the two could result in mind wipes or soul destruction or just complete disillusionment of their work against Panaxeth...it's a cheap and worthwhile scam even if it fails. Better, it also removes a source of information, the Guardian, from the board \*and\* even if it fails, it still offers a possible source of disinformation in the future. win win win!
      ```

- u/valeskas:
  ```
  I feel that somebody should have asked what was the disagreement between the gods and primordials exactly. I mean Panaxeth says that he is not actively malicious, he could elaborate a bit.

    ```
    From chapter 20:

    >According to Ikosians, the world was originally a swirling, shapeless chaos, inhabited only by the 7 primordial dragons. One day, the gods descended from the higher planes of existence and killed all of them save one. This last one they refashioned into the material world that humans now inhabit, turning her body into dirt and stone, her blood into water, her breath into air and her fire into magic. The vast networks of tunnels stretching beneath the surface of the world are dragon veins, now empty of blood that had been turned into the seas but still flooded with magic emanating from the Heart of the World – the fiery, still-beating heart of the primordial dragon that rests somewhere deep underground. Far from being content with her fate, the Dragon Below still rages against her bounds, giving birth to natural disasters like volcanoes and earthquakes. Unable to strike back against the gods themselves, the dragon takes her anger out on their favored creations – humans – by utilizing her heart, the one thing the gods have not seen fit to take away from her. Pieces of it continually flake off from the main mass, giving birth to horrifying monsters whenever they hit the ground, at which point said monsters begin their ascent to the surface to terrorize mankind…

    I'm fairly certain the primordials are another creation of the dragon below, and they mainly want to get revenge on the gods (by killing their creations.)

        ```
        The gods' creations include humans. Given that the primordials likely want to wipe the world clean of most living beings, working against them makes sense.

        That said, the gods do seem like they were fairly dickish.

        - u/RMcD94:

            I tend to think Zorian's portrayal of the gods as jerks is pretty accurate, and I think the primordials are likely worse.

              What's wrong with QI getting a blessing? He's actually a great guy and decent human being. Most of his "faults" stem from the fact that his country is at war with the MC's country, so he looks like a monster that's willing to slaughter countless innocents unprovoked. But you have to remember that he is positively ancient. He was probably around when the Ikosians attacked his countrymen and forced them to flee into the wilderness to survive. In his mind, the Ikosians struck first, and QI is just retaliating for the sake of his country.

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    I thought of the same thing, and mentioned doing so in one of my comments. I guess it's a privacy thing? Zach, not being a psychic, would have virtually no control or possibly even awareness of what Zorian was doing inside his head if his mental barriers are down. Having it be done on a simulacrum makes compulsions and stuff impossible, but that's still a huge level of trust to show someone. How many people would you allow to look through your memories and thoughts without restriction? Zach trusts Zorian, but he also knows that Zorian has done worse things to people than Zach is even capable of in order to train his abilities. Can Zach really guarantee that Zorian would never take advantage of the information he gets from Zach's head?

    Zorian also isn't able to respond in kind to that level of trust. He can share memories easily enough, but Zorian would be able to shield memories he wants to keep hidden even if his outer shields are broken.
    ```

    - u/GodKiller999:

        ... Yeah, but they could overpower it. And the implication that they could overpower it would probably be enough to encourage compliance. All Zach has to do is drain his shared mana pool enough to avoid problems, pop out a simulacrum, retreat, and let Zorian do his work.
        ```

        - u/Nimelennar:
          ```
          I can't imagine even an overmatched and outgunned Zach submitting to mind magic.  He'd probably put up a Mind Blank and self-immolate first.  Or trigger a reset.  Or find a way to escape.

          And it would take a *lot* of draining in order to get Zach down to a level where he could be overpowered easily by Zorian alone, with a Mind Blank up.
          ```

          - u/Gr_Cheese:
            ```
            Simulacrums share a mana pool with the main body.

            Main Zach can be complicit, drain his own mana, and sacrifice his simulacrum. Without mana, what's the simulacrum going to do? Bite its tongue? They don't bleed. They don't carry over functional items. It could literally be created inside a trap that prevents anything but compliance.

              we all ready know simulacrums can instantly self cancel, Zorians simulacrums do it more than once inside the story. It's talked about sort of like the simulacrum grabs a soul zipper and yanks, no real effort required, pop! gone.  


              Still, your idea has merit.

                Simulacrums have a 30 second window after creation during which they are effectively incapacitated. That should be plenty of time for Zorian to further incapacitate it with mind magic.

              ```
              Would it need mana to look inside its own soul and hit the "restart loop" switch?  I can't imagine it'd need much, and Zach's mana recharges at a speed proportional to his Magnitude (which is ridiculously high).

              It also takes a certain amount of mana to create a simulacrum.  So, Zach would have to either calculate exactly how much mana he'd need to use in order to perform the creation, so that he'd have exactly zero left when the simulacrum was made, or drain whatever was left so quickly that the simulacrum couldn't perform even the simplest tasks (like self-destruction or Mind Blank or a loop reset).

                u/addmoreice brought up a good point, that simulacrums can self-cancel, as demonstrated by Zorian. But, again, a simulacrum could be created directly inside a trap / ward that prohibits all the counter-measures you've listed. For example, instantly rendering the simulacrum unconscious. Or slowing time.

                The only potential counterargument I see is being unable to read the simulacrum's mind, for whatever reason.

                  Says who? Every in-story indication has been that Zach's marker is perfectly intact. He simply lacked the necessary skill at personal soul perception.

                  Since he's now capable of creating simulacra *and* wears the soul sight ring, he's almost certainly advanced enough to use those marker switches.

  I don't think it makes sense for Zach to have destroyed the body. He wasn't aware of the offer the primordial made at the time right?

  It seems odd that Panaxeth is able to recall Zorian's various friends and family, but not that he is a powerful mind mage in the previous chapter. I don't think Panaxeth actually has perfect recall, because he doesn't even address their plan to physically walk out of the loop.

  In regards to the actual offer and Zorian's suspicion, I think it's a solvable problem. Zorian himself doesn't need to be the one to look into Zach's head, just a decent telepath. Zorian should tell Zach to get some of the Aranea to look into Zach's head, while Zorian stays at a tea shop or something under supervision of one of Zach's simulacrum. Since no one else would know about the offer to Zorian without Zorian communicating with them, Zach could simply ensure Zorian can't communicate and then have himself checked out.

  Alternatively, assuming simulacra would inherit any compulsions the original is under, Zach could just make a simulacrum and have Zorian check it out for compulsions. Zorian couldn't do any damage, because the simulacrum could be immediately dismissed after Zorian checks it. Zorian is satisfied, and Zach doesn't need to endanger himself even if Zorian is hostile.
  ```

  - u/vallar57:
    ```
    >because he doesn't even address their plan to physically walk out of the loop.

    Just as likely because the plan is nigh impossible. They are inside a primordial, meaning they are inside it's prison too, and the prison is divine and capable of stopping even a promordial from breaking out.
    ```

    - u/abnotwhmoanny:
      ```
      Yes, but the Sovereign Gate clearly has an out for people. While details weren't forthcoming, I don't think Zorian was just talking out of his ass when he said he believed that had a 30% chance of getting it to work that month. The prison was made to stop Panaxeth, but despite being a superbeing there are most likely many things humans can do that he can't. Ever see an old bear cage? The bars were often narrow enough that a bear can't possibly hope to get out, but a person can easily slip through.

      I don't think they're actually passing through the prison interior. Panaxeth would simply kill them if that were so. I think they're using the fact that Panaxeth's prison connects both to the real world and to the time looped world to make a bridge, without ever going into the prison itself.

    >Zorian should tell Zach to get some of the Aranea to look into Zach's head, while Zorian stays at a tea shop or something under supervision of one of Zach's simulacrum.

    Zorian has previously asked Zach to have a trusted third party check his mind for compulsions, the result being Zach instead got mind defense lessons from Xvim instead. I don't think anything has happened that would change Zach's prior decision (they knew back then that there was a chance he had compulsions and had his mind edited, it wasn't enough to sway him).
    ```

    - u/MagicwaffIez:
      ```
      I think he is probably under a compulsion to not let people try to fix it,

      ```

  - u/abnotwhmoanny:
    ```
    I'm relatively certain that Panaxeth isn't half as capable as he leads others to believe. I like that he uses the exact example of viewing ants that Zorian and company had just used.

    Also, using simulacrum certainly removes the real Zach from danger, but that would hardly make the simulacrum agree. If Zach would never agree to it, you can assume the same is true of the simulacrum. And there's no way you could force a simulacrum into that situation without hiding it from Zach himself, and he would likely take that just as violently as if you'd tried it on him.
    ```

    - u/icesharkk:
      ```
      that not exactly accurate. What i would never agree to do changes wildly when you tell me I am a purpose built copy of myself. yes I feel as though I am the real me but ultimately I am just a copy with a lifespan.

      &#x200B;

      This would not affect the potential compulsion on zachs mind. I just feel that people keep talking about the simulacrum paradox as if the simulacrum can't update its behavior after it's created.
      ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    At this point, if Zach doesn't trust Zorian inside his head, then he shouldn't trust Zorian inside his simulacrum's head either - because with a deep memory dive like that, Zorian could completely subvert the simulacrum, have it turn on Zach, and thus subdue him like Panaxeth wants.
    ```

- u/Travisbuchanan:
  ```
  Side thought: As long as they're inside the time loop, it may get increasingly more dangerous for Zorian to summon simulacrum. There's always a *slight* difference in their mental models, no matter how in control Zorian is; as the pressure on him increases and the deadline for the end of the loop draws to a close, it's possible one of them will choose to defect.   


  I'm interested in the dilemma presented, but I hope neither betrays the other. That feels a little narratively forced. I want to say they should ally with Quatach-Ichl in response to this, but since the lich is explicitly working against them on this particular goal, that's unlikely. Unless QI is missing  some critical piece of information about Paxaneth that would change his mind.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    QI is missing several critical pieces of information, such as the Cult of the Dragon Below attempting to mind control Paxaneth, or the fact that Paxaneth is a shapeshifter that can easily fly over to QI's country and wreck it too.

    &#x200B;

    And unlike Silverlake, QI actually cares about people other than himself, such as his countrymen. He wouldn't prioritize his own personal survival over the survival of his country, so he would be unlikely to backstab Z&Z in the same way. The only problem is somehow convincing QI that they are telling him the truth.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      If they tell QI what the cult is really planning, then he'll thank them for the information and use it to ensure that his original plan works - ie releasing the primordial to rampage.

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        The fact that he suicide soul-bombed Z&Z is concrete evidence that he cares about some things more than his personal survival. Even if he knew about the time loop from mind reading Xvim, the fact that he killed himself rather than even try to get a temporary marker on himself (he does have the crown after all) shows that he is willing to prioritize some things over his own life. The only question is what did he prioritize over his life.

        &#x200B;

        It was never stated (because he died), but I suspect he succeeded in learning about the time loop from Xvim's mind, and then suicide bombed the group of time loopers to try and stop them from messing up the Cyorian invasion plan in  the real world. That shows he prioritizes his country over himself.
        ```

        - u/turtleswamp:
          ```
          Not necessarily.

          It could be that he views a copy of himself that will get reset in less than a month as the same kind of short-term expendable copy of his 'real self' (the immortal one outside the loop) that Zorian considers his simulacrums. 

          In that case it's not "sacrifice himself for his country" it's "sacrifice temporary copy of himself for his immortal real self". Though it is still notable that he goes from thinking he is the 'real self' to believing he is the 'expendable copy' with enough conviction to pull the trigger in so short a time.

    Quatach-Ichl doesn't want to _permanently_ release Panaxeth. I really think they should team up with him too, especially in the real world. After all they'll have to deal with Silverlake, who is a very good soul mage.

      Z&Z have the location of the remaining 4 artifacts of the first emperor, and exactly how to get them.  And they can give them up to the real QI in the real world.  

      It would be worth it on QI's side to call off the invasion for even a single artifact.  It would be worth it on Z&Zs side to trade them away in the real world, since they're not of fundamental importance once you're outside the loop.

  It's *possible* that Zach could use the crown to give Zorian another six loops for them to improve their escape plan, but if I was Zorian I wouldn't want to pin my hopes on that.

  Doylist assumption 1: the protagonist will survive.  Doylist assumption 2 (weaker): it wouldn't fit for Zorian and Zach to turn on each other at this point, not when other antagonists are readily available out of the loop.  Doylist conclusion: Zorian will survive but will not take Panaxeth's offer and turn on Zach.  The most likely way for that to happen is for their escape attempt to succeed.

  If the escape attempt succeeds, then all of our temporary loopers get out too (by now they're no worse off than Zorian), and we get to go full-throttle Red Robes + Silverlake + Ulquaan Ibasa vs. Zorian, Zach, the Cyoria crew and allies, and potentially their IRL duplicates as well.  Having two Xvims will certainly be helpful, among others, and something tells me IRL!Silverlake won't have any fondness for the antics of Loop!Silverlake.

                QI isn't particularly selfish and has been collaborating with a large and divers set of people as a major figure is a very large scale project. It's likely that two QI's will see each otehr as powerful allies after a brief check to make sure they aren't backing opposite sides for some reason, and with a bit of effort to re-secure their phylacteries against each other.

    Zorian did not have inclination to agree with Panaxeth, but he can be convinced when presented by a good reason, like any reasonable character do.  

    Stepping into Zorian's shoes, what Panaxeth presented rings some truth. One, Zach is a good actor, nothing so far confirmed that Zach has no lying bone in his body. Two, Zach's unwilling to risk Zorian from checking his mind. And finally three, Zach immediately trying to ensure Zorian stays in line (put his hand on Zorian's shoulder asking to disregard Panaxeth) after discord sowed between them. This is a high time to get paranoid!

  This chapter makes me question whether Silverlake actually made a deal with Panaxeth at all.

  Consider: towards the end of this chapter, Panaxeth admits that its primary goal once the key was assembled was to prevent Zach from exiting the loop and wrecking its escape attempt.  Its chosen method to try to prevent this was to attempt to cause infighting and division among the ranks of Zach, Zorian, and their allies.

  Given that we know this now, how confident are we that Silverlake actually betrayed them and made a deal with Panaxeth?  Sure, her doing so is somewhat plausible.  But that also means that if Panaxeth planned to sow discord and prevent the loopers from exiting, knocking Silverlake out of the loop whether she agreed to any deal or not is an excellent strategy to make them all distrust one another.
  ```

  - u/Seyt77:
    ```
    Well Panaxeth could have taken out zorian just as easily if he could take out silverlake which seems the smartest thing considering that he is the biggest threat(Not considering Zach since he seems untouchable without someone to work for panaxeth).

    I don't think for a second silverlake didn't betray them and took the same exit as RR since it makes the most sense. Despite that, real world silverlake might be an unlikely ally since she won't ever help her loop self(loop self would always try to kill her other self in order to get her stuff back).
    ```

- u/Seyt77:
  ```
  Even though Zach is seen as an enemy, I doubt Zorian has the heart to kill Zach. He might try to do some mind stuff but he knows Zach too much to kill him. Maybe stow him away somehow and deceive the bad guy though operating under a security camera at all times is difficult.
  ```

  - u/abnotwhmoanny:
    ```
    The very fact that he deceives Zach at the end gives me pause on that. Zorian has grown a lot in the time loop, but he's a fairly selfish individual. He's not like Zach, who gladly throws his life away to protect his friends. He could conceivably find some way to rationalize it to himself.  


    Under normal circumstances he wouldn't, but with death as the alternative who knows? He's certainly done terrible things to people he views as enemies.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      I don't think he will. He doesn't even really consider betraying Zach. He was suspicious of compulsions Zach may have been under, but I think he's extremely unlikely to go for Panaxeth's contract unless it's impossible to escape, in which case Zach would be just as dead anyways. When Panaxeth offered the deal last chapter, Zorian refused before even hearing the details, and I think he's feeling about the same now.
      ```

      - u/abnotwhmoanny:
        ```
        That certainly makes sense, but I'm not willing to rule out the possibility. If it wasn't something that plays to Zorian's character flaws and seems plausible for him to do, it wouldn't be an interesting dilemma in the first place.

        Unreasonable at many points when he realized he had a compulsion placed on him and might even have missing parts of why he is in the loop.

          You think so? He's a hothead from the beginning, with a very strong sense of what's right and what's wrong. His reactions make sense without a compulsion. Just look at the rest of the group. Every single one of them learns to protect their mind from Zorian as soon as they find out what he can do. Every single one.  


          And at no point does Zorian imply that he can recover Zach's memories. Even if he found out that they were purposely removed, that doesn't mean he could pull them out of the ether and return them to Zach's brain. Maybe he could, but it's completely reasonable for Zach not to believe that.  


          Maybe Zach is under a compulsion to avoid mind mages, but there is by no means "100%" certain evidence of it. Every piece of evidence for it is speculation.

            Given that kind of proof, you bet Xvim would march himself straight to the nearest trustworthy mind mage and do everything possible to recover those bits of himself.

            Also, you are mistaken about Zorian's expectations; he did indeed think that it was likely he could recover Zach's memories, if RR (presumably) didn't do a thorough job. See chapter 57.

            i think the refusal to acknowledge that a geas *could* exist, in this situation, is evidence towards its existence.

That's the only path out of this thing I see baring some major discovery or new information next chapter.
  ```

  - u/GarlicBandit:
    ```
    That would be an interesting take. The Cult of the Dragon Below thought they could MC Panaxeth, and Zorian was able to out Mind Control all of their mind mages put together like 40 chapters ago.

    At first I assumed this wasn't a possibility because I thought Panaxeth as an all-knowing supremely powerful superintelligent being... but honestly he seems fairly limited in terms of what he can know and understand based on what we've seen this chapter. He wasn't very good at convincing Zorian and the others, he can't seem to use mind magic on anyone in the time loop, and it doesn't seem like he considers Zorian a huge threat, though we know he's concerned about Zach getting loose.

    It may be that it would be impossible to out mind-magic Panaxeth outside of the time loop on an even playing field, but Zorian is essentially already inside of Panaxeth, and Panaxeth is restricted from using mind magic so he can't fight back offensively using mind magic. It seems to me that the circumstances are perfect for Zorian to take Panaxeth on.

    I actually think this might be Zorian has a chance of winning a mind magic battle between him and Panaxeth. If only for the few moments it takes for Zorian to escape.
    ```

    - u/CrystalineAxiom:
      ```
      Imagine hive-mind Zorian with the mana reserves of the crown and 20 simulacrums. He might stand a chance against a primordial with that level of power.

      ```

      - u/GarlicBandit:
        ```
        Yeah, I also figured Zorian would have fully exploited the rats hive-mind abilities and figured out how to boost his mana reserves with divine magic and give himself a whole slew of blood magic abilities before he tried to directly take on the primordial.

        I do think it seems like Zorian would stand a chance though. Panaxeth doesn't seem very powerful with the restraints on him, and he isn't much of a super intelligence. My original assumption was that he was a Cthulhu-type godlike creature, but he seems to be quite limited while in the gods prison.
        ```

        - u/CrystalineAxiom:
          ```
          > figured out how to boost his mana reserves with divine magic

          I doubt he'll be able to do this. Even Qatach Ichl says he has trouble affecting divine magic. Maybe if they had another 50 restarts to work with. Or maybe if the time dilation of the orb gives them years to work with. But as things stand, they're having trouble even modifying existing divine magic, let alone creating their own. Regardless, they'll need a lot more time to make that part viable. 

          > I do think it seems like Zorian would stand a chance though. Panaxeth doesn't seem very powerful with the restraints on him, and he isn't much of a super intelligence. My original assumption was that he was a Cthulhu-type godlike creature, but he seems to be quite limited while in the gods prison.

          One can only hope, however it's entirely possible that he's restrained from doing much while still retaining all his protective abilities. If that's the case, they probably don't stand a chance at mentally compelling him. If the gods had trouble killing primordials, they almost certainly don't have any natural weaknesses.

  Well, we probably know how RR became a Looper now.

This would explain motivation, timing and abilities and is utterly consistent with post-edit Zach's actions as a Looper.

          &#x200B;

          Alternatively, she might have forcefully magicked herself through the gate despite Panaxeth's attempts to stop her, and Panaxeth is just pretending she made a deal with it rather than admit it was bested by some ant.

If that was all it wanted, then it would have separated us for that little chat, but it didn't. Clearly, what it really wanted was to turn us against each other.

  If I betrayed you and wrecked your memories like it told me to, I'd be playing right into its hands.

  Panaxeth's offer seems half-hearted at best. Even if Zorian agreed, Panaxeth has little use for actually seeing the bargain through. He knows Zorian would probably work against him, so he's got no reason to make a fully functioning body for Zorian on the outside. If Zorian actually went ahead and mindfucked Zack, Panaxeth would probably just let Zorian die anyway, or plop his naked soul outside of the time loop with no body just as a means to get rid of him. For Silverlake, he had to make her a body so she could be an agent, but he has no reason to do the same for Zorian.
  ```

- u/scalymonster:
  ```
  I'm curious about the nature of Zach's potential mental compulsions. Any compulsions from Red Robe would be from before Zorian even started looping, so he couldn't have left anything targeting Zorian specifically. Since RR was also a looper, it wouldn't make sense to leave a general "kill other loopers" compulsion, especially not one that only triggers if Zach leaves the loop. In fact, any compulsion that only triggers once Zach leaves the loop would make little sense for RR to create, as RR was hoping to prevent Zach from leaving the loop entirely.

  It is a bit more likely that the angels could have left a "once you're out of the loop, kill any other loopers" compulsion as a safeguard against people like RR and Silverlake, but it would make more sense to compel Zach not to allow these people to become an issue in the first place.

  Panaxeth's "in the end, one has to kill the other" statement is also suspicious. If a mental compulsion is the danger here, then why ask Zorian to invade Zach's mind, where he could probably remove whatever compulsion Zach may have?
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:

  All ZZ-guardian interactions should be considered compromized. 

  Consider: Panaxeth is powerful, the scope of this power should not be based on what he shows/tells ZZ. Since both under selling his power level and over selling his powerlevel can be used to further his goals the safer options is to assume he is underselling his power.

  &#x200B;

  If Panaxeth is underselling his power then the statement of cost when controlling the guardian is immediately suspect. If controlling hte guardian has little/no cost then all guardian statements are suspect. 

  &#x200B;

  Additionally the fact that he ejected ZZ at the end of the dialogue means he could have eject Zach at the beginning of the dialogue and given zorian the new deal without putting Zach on the defensive.

  &#x200B;

  &#x200B;

  Therefore:

  if Panaxeth is underselling his powerlevel then it is likely that zorian is not in immediate danger of loop reset and ZZ should continue their escape plan as normal.

  If Panaxeth is overselling his power then the guardian statement is true and Zorian is in immediate danger and ZZ shoould try their escape plan as normal.

  &#x200B;

  Regardless Panaxeth behavior does not create trust between Zorian and himself. if Panazeth wanted Zorian to succeed against Zach he would not have allowed Zach to overhear. If Panaxeth wanted to create trust between himself and Zorian as a conspirator he would not have allowed Zach to over hear. Therefore his statement should be discarded.

  &#x200B;

  Many people are discussing how intelligent Panaxeth is or isn't. I think he's not trying very hard to appear intelligent beecause he does not need to. He needs to prevent ZZ from exiting the loop, he may not be able to stop Zach from exiting (Guardian statements are suspect) any longer.  If Panaxeth came accross as very inteligent or powerful it would confirm ZZ's suspicions of him and increase their likelyhood to cooperate. By portraying himself as less intelligent and powerful he makes it more likely that they will defect and damage each other. This is the only course of action that would prevent Zach from exiting the loop through the gate.

  Great chapter to confirm the stake and to reignite the old conflict. I personally lean toward Zorian, but conflict with Zach should cost him dearly. That's why I dread Zach-Zorian win-lose situation, never wishing it come to be. I was actually glad that there were multiple method for both of them to escape. *Until the last chapter. Sigh...*  Well, at least higher stake means more excitement.

  Two criticism which I hope constructive. I know that Panaxeth pronoun generate a discussion last chapter, but I don't feel it worth a paragraph today. Unlike plot hole that is 'dismissed simulacrum upon entering black-room' many chapters ago, this is merely a consistency problem. One or two sentence acknowledging different pronoun usage should suffice. Author could even just chalk it off. The story took Zorian POV (?) after all.  

  Then there's the posing of problem. I get what happened and what at stake in just one read through, indicating effective writing. But the experience to get there is cumbersome. Discussion on Noveda mansion has too much distraction before getting confirmation on Panaxeth capability and putting a close on Silverlake 'betrayal.' Noise and important piece of information is rather indistinct there. Author did well, but not as well as last chapter. Maybe breaking passage (using -break- stuff) into more parts so that reader can more clearly identify the piece of information story trying to convey?

    Honestly, I'd just go straight into narration mode and lay the whole thing out directly.

    &#x200B;

    There's a knee-jerk reaction to that with the whole "show, don't tell!" idea but that tends to get misinterpreted a lot. Show, don't tell is advice that's meant to apply to character details and important plot points. For distributing important information, I've found it's often more effective to just say it like it is rather than trying to deliver it through character dialogue.

    I agree with you. I thought the emotionless, zoomed out view at the beginning of the chapter was jarring, coming right after the end of the last chapter. 

    I think it could have started with the dialogue at the noveda mansion instead, then alluded to any important details about their escape. Just one possibility.
