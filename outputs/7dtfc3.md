## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You repeat the same day over and over, but as a different person each time. You do *not* know the rules that govern this innately, but may be able to figure some of them out over the course of several resets.

  * You wake up as a random person each time, but never the same twice. (with one exception that I'll get to)

  * You will have been everybody in the world by the time this is over. There are almost 7.6 billion people in the world. Buckle up, this is going to take a while.

  * The first time you experienced the day was as yourself.

  * The day starts when you woke up, and lasts 24 hours. This means you will sometimes start and end in the middle of the day, depending on timezones.

  * You have all the memories of the person you currently inhabit, as well as your own. Muscle memory doesn't transfer.

  * You keep these memories as you go through resets, so you also have all the memories of all the people you were so far.

  * You will gain memories of terrible things having been done to you, and having done terrible things. You'll spend time as a baby, with little you can do. You will spend days tied to a hospital bed. You will probably die many times. You'll have many, many lifetimes of memories which may be difficult to keep straight. Your first challenge is staying sane.

  * Assuming you are still sane by the time you get to around the 5 millionth time you relive the day, you find somebody who knows somebody who has gone through the same thing. By around 100 million you have the memory of a person who has gone through this. From this you can figure out the following rules.

  * After having been everybody in the world, you will relive the day one final time as yourself.

  * The next day, you will only remember that final day. A lot of the things you remember doing or thinking that day will make little sense to you, because they are based on information from previous resets that you no longer remember.

  * This happens once a year to a random person in the world. Many of them go mad during their resets, which just means you have a day when they are acting crazy but don't remember why. Some try to give themselves notes on incredibly advanced technology or solutions to world problems, which they are rarely able to understand the next day. In the cases where they did, it lead to breakthroughs in technology, billion dollar companies or miraculous peace deals where all attempts had failed. Some have tried to retain their memories of the resets, but failed.



  Challenges:

  * How do you avoid going insane?

  * During the resets, you have more than twenty million years at your disposal, and a lot more than that to draw experience from. You have a unique insight into humanity as a whole. Yet nothing physical you do lasts more than a day, and in the end only the last reset counts. What problems would you try to solve?

  * How can you convey your solutions to your normal self in a way that they can understand?

  * Can you find a way to retain your memory after the last reset? Otherwise you'll pretty much die when the resets end, replaced by a much earlier version of you.

    I'm not sure the insanity thing is necessarily something the majority of the people who go through this would end up with, and that's more of a trope about how people assume trauma works. There's no reason to think that having a tremendous amount of memories causes a person to go insane, and anyway if it did then since you remember all those people's lives there would be no people who managed anything useful after all this.                           
    So this brings things back to trauma, making it useful to note that getting actual PTSD after extreme trauma is by no means universal or even necessarily something that happens in most instances. Who gets PTSD seem to be pretty heavily genetic so it seems very plausible that whether you are able to handle this will just be down to your genetic luck. I'd also note that people getting more extreme forms of insanity from trauma is almost certainly similarly genetic, because it's very clear that some people can go through incredibly terrible things and eventually be recovered to the extent where they can function normally in every regard.

    My point being the insanity thing is probably not something you have to worry too much about, and either way it's not something it's clear you have much control over.

    As for what you can accomplish during the resets it's not clear that unless you were a genius starting out you are likely to be able to make more than a few chance breakthroughs (probably low hanging fruits that would have been noticed soon anyway). Given only a day to coordinate anything it's also not as though you're going to be able to do any new experiments either so the only chance of you getting somewhere here would seem to be to just be lucky enough to be the kind of genius who can make significant breakthroughs in theoretical areas.                    
    Mainly the main productive thing you'd do is sorting through your memories in order to figure out how things fit together and what was most useful. Near the end you would then want to come up with a script for you you to act out over a day, make sure it was the best possible highest bandwidth script and then practice it and perfect it over centuries/millenia. Basically you would plan on finding a video camera on the last reset and using all that time to record the most useful information you can in >24 hours.

    One thing that seems like a good plan once out of the loop (following the plan laid out by previous you) would be to figure out the right people to convince (having learned and perfected the exact right ways to manipulate certain important people) using your knowledge of their intimate internal thoughts in order to convince a government entity to work with you utilizing this information (which would include lots of very valuable government secrets). Since their power would let you maximally leverage your knowledge. One of the other things you would want to do is try to rehearse arguments to yourself to convince the next person who goes through this (and gets your memories) to join in with your little secret club.                            
    More importantly however you will want to rehearse arguments for why future loopers should cooperate with you, but also what specific information to pass on in their final loop sharing the expertise you would have gained from your own. You would also want to have people working with you to rehearse this information as well to minimize the chance that a looper only get the information late in their loop, as well as potentially making it more convincing by having them get in multiple times from multiple perspectives.                            
    Of course I would also track down every looper I can to get whatever information they may possess which may have not been included in my recording, though since I would have had their memories there's not likely to be much they know that was _that_ important and wasn't already in my recording.                        
    Trying to get future loopers going along with your plans is really important here because once you can start doing that then you can start exploiting multiple loops of iteration in order to accomplish your plans. As well as having any future loopers have plans for the best course of action devised by previous loopers working with experts.

    Also it should be just obvious to say that I would use untraceable insider knowledge to make massive amounts of money for myself in the stock market. Though I might not actually bother becoming a billionaire because if I successfully convinced lots of powerful people to help me accomplish whatever goals I'd devised then I wouldn't necessarily greatly need massive personal resources.

    The video I would record in order to transmit maximum information bandwidth would have some talking which is designed to explain things to my oblivious self and explaining how to decode the rest. However most of it would probably by incoherent babbling combined with flailing body motions, since I would want to devise my own languages of sign language and speech which would absolutely maximize information bandwidth.

    When it comes to my inevitable loss of memory I would be rather distressed by it, however if my past is anything to go by I've already basically settled on the kind of person I'm likely to be for the rest of my life (I've never been one to massively change except by getting more competent) so I would be most concerned with the loss in useful knowledge. Though luckily the personal insights that would be most useful/important to me could be encoded in the video message.                  
    I also don't have a theory of identity by which massive memory loss would actually correspond to the processes that is me continuing to have experiences so I wouldn't actually be fearing death.

  These are based off a series of books, but a power.

  You have discovered a book that teaches you hypnosis, by careful control and practice over what you say or how you make eye contact with someone you can send them into a trance where you can give them any command you want and they'll follow it. Naturally you're limited to the person, they're still limited by their own body and mind so even if you can do things like make them forget things they're not going to be solving the mysteries of the universe any time soon.

  Now, some additional rules and explanations.

  * You learnt from a book, this means someone wrote the book, it did not magically appear one day, you just found it in a library or second hand book store or something.
  * Hypnosis is still widely believed to be fake, evidence for it being real not much different than real life.
  * Strong anger can make someone unable to be sent into a trance.
  * It does not work via recordings or broadcasts.
  * It can work over the phone.
  * It can work on anything which can see or hear you. Animals, humans, doesn't matter. Animals tend to be easier however, simpler minds and all.
  * It can fail if there is enough distortion in what the target sees or hears.

  So, what would you do? You have the ability to hypnotize people to some degree, it's likely you personally aren't the greatest out there, and you don't know who out there might have it too. How would you try to use or abuse this?

  There's more rules, tricks, and possible explanations too, but this was long enough and figuring out your own is part of the point of this right?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Assuming it's not magic (but that brains have a backdoor), if broadcasts don't work but the phone does, then that's probably because you need to interact with the target, tailoring what you do to how they respond.

    One tactic is to hypnotize anyone, teach them hypnosis and have them use this tactic. One challenge is how to control the infected. If it's a password, any hypnotist could presumably extract it from any infected. If they're to obey any command known to be given by me, they know me. If each infected is to obey their sire or a password they generated, commands propagate slowly and taking anyone over takes over their descendants. Obeying commands known to be cryptographically signed by a certain public key might work.

    More robust than a command channel is a fixed policy, such as "maximize the chance of FAI". One elegance of this is that one needs not specify that they infect others - many will understand that infecting others maximizes the chance. One drawback is that stupid people might pass on mutated policies, summoning Malthus to crush us all under the heel of that policy which best spreads to others.

    Others will have considered all this. For all I know, someone has already taken over the world, and I am hypnotized to turn myself in depending on where this thought process ends. I do not expect a world like ours to remain without infection for long. If there were more than one infection, I do not expect I would be permitted the time for this thought process, because it could have been spent desperately getting the upper hand over other infections (unless I am to gather armchair intel, in which case I may as well do so, since more direct commands could also have had me gather the same).

    The world does not look optimized as a dictator would, so perhaps they only took over the world so nobody else could, prefering an apparently free world to an optimized one. This presents me with a Newcomb problem: If I am the first person following this thought process, I could take over the world for my own ends, or to freeze the status quo. If the status quo has already been frozen, I will presumably be rewarded if I decide to freeze the status quo and/or punished if I attempt to optimize the world. The rewards of hubris are great enough that I fail to see a disincentive that wouldn't defeat the purpose of an apparently free world. That my version of optimization is positive-sum for everyone might help my case. Okay, let's optimize. *eyes go blank, turns self in*

      You've guessed password locking commands, go you? First to do it at least. Passwords do work, and are a proven and used technique in the series this was based off. They have been countered, but it was via social engineering stuff, know the people well enough to guess what the password would be. 

      Nobody tries things like self propagating hypnosis, probably be a pain to setup without leaving giant trails leading back to you, and a lot of people just aren't going to be very good at hypnosis. Villains in the series seem to favour mostly just hypnotising well connected or rich people, with only a small group of hypnotist underlings. They do exist, and have already established themselves however.

      That said, this is basically magic. One of the possible tricks which is possible based off what I based this off is only possible if you're not just exploiting a backdoor that happens to be in every human and animals brains. That might even be enough of a hint, but this can be taken beyond just exploiting a backdoor in someones brain.

      As far as if this was based in the actual series? Status quo seems to be the way things go, once you start taking on celebrities or politicians you're likely to run into a hypnotised one very quickly, and they're all password locked commands. There's three levels up there too, the figurehead, the master hypnotist who is a wealthy public and politician, the hypnotist who controlled them into making a run for president, and a third level controlling the second person. He was doing in order to create secret mines in the US for magic gems which allowed hypnotists to travel through time. I deliberately did not mention any of the ways of using hypnosis to manipulate time here however.

        I would guess that you're hinting at people being able to hypnotize computers.

        Villians in the series, aka the ones that the protagonist hears about, aka incompetent villians, are the same ones that target well connected or rich people :P. If I'm the first to try self-propagation, go go gadget global victory.

    I would hypnotically teach local leaders how to hypnotize people, then tell them to hypnotize the people above them to follow my orders and then repeat this process until there was nobody above them. Proceed until I control everything?

    Well the fact you found a functioning book on hypnosis tells you there are probably at most a handful of people with this knowledge and they aren't tremendously competent (given the world looks the same).             
    So realistically while you need to be cautious and paranoid you're at least safe in the knowledge there's probably no major surveillance likely to notice your actions unless they're stupid and obvious.

    First off you're going to want to just start using hypnosis on as many important people as you can get access to (using them to get access to even more powerful people ad infinitum) until you have a large powerful network of people who've been commanded to be totally loyal to you. You will then want to outsource a great deal of your planning to a bunch of genius experts who are really good at dealing with the relevant planning (hey they're totally loyal and more hard working and competent than you!), at this point since they can just learn hypnosis the only thing you will do is have them ask you about your preferences since fulfilling them is their biggest goal.                     
    The plan they will likely come up with will probably involve wiping all non-essential information/memories from everybody under your control, as well as having them bear no ties to yourself and communicating using anonymous methods of communication such that if anyone else gains control over them they could never trace them back to you. Still that's something of a worst case scenario since if other hypnotists were competent to stringently check everybody they hypnotised for extremely subtle signs of previous control they would probably have already achieved world domination.

    Anyway the next phase of your (or well your experts) plan will probably be to discretely check as many powerful people as you can in business, politics, etc in order to see who has been previously controlled. Anyone found to be someone else's pawn will be probed thoroughly for any useful information and then memory wiped such that they bear nothing to tip off their masters to my actions. I'm also going to want to scour around to find the source of the book and sniff out the locations of every hypnotist or recording of hypnotism I can. I will be able to detain hypnotists using any number of means (the people hunting them wearing earplugs), and once I've done so I will be able to hypnotise them (drugging them, or just exhausting them until they can't maintain the anger needed to resist) getting all the information they know about others.                                         

    Once I've tracked down enough my next plan will simply involve rapidly taking over the entire world. Given everybody in my network has mind control and everybody mind controlled is totally loyal unless someone else mind controls _them_ I should be able to rapidly sweep the globe with the network setup in preparation for this. Taking over the entire world this way should honestly be something I could accomplish in days at the most, and people would never even understand it was happening since I would control the flow of information during it.          
    It's certainly possible other factions could fight me on this, however anybody else even playing on this level of strategy just doesn't exist given what can be observed in the world (unless by massive coincidence they just happened to also be in the planning stage of a similar well hidden world domination scheme).

    As for once you've achieved world domination well you can do far more good than even what your usual world domination scheme allows for. It's not just that you could form a strong world government, or make the individual ones more competent. Fundamentally once you have this sort of absolute control over humanity you don't need militaries or justice systems because courses of action you want to forbid just won't be attempted. Honestly it's hard to conceive of just how much you could affect the world with absolute control over all of human behavior and it doesn't matter that much to you anyway since you won't be the one actually running things.

    This sounds familiar. Is this the series about the orphan girl who finds a hypnosis book, and uses it to [spoiler](#s "give the cook a love for italian food, win a talent show, become an actor, and at one point her dog gets kidnapped so she has to rob a bank? And it turned out her friend was also a hypnotist?")? I read that book something like a decade ago, so I don't remember its name.

      That's correct, that's the book. Actually a series of six, although I've only read the first four. Named Molly Moon, after the protagonist.

    I think it'd probably be valuable to learn deescalation techniques so I can defuse "strong anger" to make everyone hypnotizable.

    Can only one person be hypnotized at once?
    ```

    - u/xavion:
      ```
      With practice you can hypnotise a crowd by giving a speech to them, and a character uses a giant lens to make their eyes seem bigger to assist in hypnotising crowds. There's a chapter dedicated to group hypnosis in the book pretty sure. And strong anger isn't too bad as a limit, it just makes hypnosis near worthless as a tactic for deescalation really.
      ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  How to best use this body-hopping ability?

  * You can hop into a person's body on line of sight; this doesn't work through photographs or video recordings but does work through solid objects like glass or some optical fiber cable setups.  Only humans, no animals.
  * You do not get any episodic memories or mental skills from bodies you hop into, but you do get faint muscle memories and emotional/relationship memories of the body you're currently in.  You can't learn languages, passwords, personal histories, or academic disciplines by body hopping, but if you hop into a professional athlete, you'll move in a somewhat more trained way than a total novice, and you'll always know if you're interacting with someone or something your current host felt strongly about, and how they felt about it.
  * When you hop out of a body, it vanishes, transmuted into an equal quantity of air.  This effectively means that hopping into someone's body kills them, because they no longer have control over it and when you leave it will die.
  * You don't know if there are any other people with powers on the Earth, but it would be fairly easy for your power to get exposed - seeing as people vanishing into air is so visibly abnormal.
  ```

  - u/neondragonfire:
    ```
    I'd say keep use of the power to a minimum. Sure, you can do flashy things and kill people and possibly steal large amounts of money, but that draws attention and thus risks yourself.

    Instead, keep your head down and consider it a source of immortality. Live a full life with little risk taken, and when your body starts to fail jump to a young body. Prepare for this in advance. Have that young person set up as your protege and successor, keep their contact with others to a minimum so the sudden change in personality won't be as obvious. Make sure they take care of their body. Switch when they are a young adult and you can pretty much continue where you left off. Repeat as often as needed.

    This allows you to act on a timescale far beyond what normal humans usually do. Go for a slow and steady approach to your goals. Focus on mental and social tasks, rather than physical, as those will transfer more easily through body hopping. For social, make sure that you act as a representative for your house/organisation/kingdom/etc rather than as yourself, so that you can keep any prestige and influence as you change bodies over the centuries. You are not concerned with getting things as fast as possible, but eliminating risks along the way.

    Ultimately, you will want a different source of immortality, since your power isn't fail-proof (and ethically problematic since you are definitely killing people). So invest in science and study it yourself. Research your power, but be careful not to disrupt it while you do so. It does break the laws on known physics, so figuring out how it works would presumably lead to new theories which then can be used for awesome technology. Finding other people with powers is also useful for this, since it means that you don't have to experiment on yourself. But it's dangerous, so be very careful and use proxies.
