  Okay, I was expecting more that it was another one of Rob's calculated "mistakes" but it wasn't

    Smashing one's head open is an unusual and disrecommended battle tactic.  :>
    ```

      Yeah, and in hindsight, you clearly said the head was the mana reservoir, and somewhere else you said mana is stored in water, so I should've put two and two together.

  My heart was in my mouth the whole chapter.

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Excellent!  I did my job.
    ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  Yes, last chapter was a cliffhanger.  Here's the answer.  Bonus points if you spotted the setup in the previous chapter.

  ```
  How did Rob get the battery into his head? How did he do it WITHOUT letting all the water out?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    His head opens at the top.  Think 'fishtank'.  He popped the lid and dropped the battery in, then sealed up again.  It happened immediately after the flash from the rogue mana that temporarily blinded the audience -- basically, he saw an opportunity and took it.
    ```

  ```
  This came earlier than I expected (what was it, three days?)

  I'm more emotionally attached to Rob than I should be, stupid awesome AIs, you shouldn't make me almost tear up every time!
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Yeah, it wasn't due until next Monday, but I did an early drop. 

    I'm glad you like Rob, and that you're tearing up; shows I've been writing effectively.
    ```
