## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  So I'm playing with the rough draft of a rational take on the Judeo-Christian Heaven / Hell / Earth conflict. Urban Fantasy for the most part, with some of the Cthulhu mythos thrown in to create an external threat to the classical conflict. 

  Has anyone seen something similar in the Rational Realm? Not necessarily Urban Fantasy or the like, but a rational stab at the Heaven / Hell conflict?  I'd like to compare what I've got to others and see if anything pops up that would bug me down the road.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    *Unsong* is largely about the Judeo-Christian Heaven / Hell / Earth conflict, in its own meandering way, and includes [probably the best answer to theodicy I've ever read](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/03/15/answer-to-job/).

    The *Dresden Files* is urban fantasy, a fun read, and has that conflict as a subplot in some books. Not super rational though, and that part of the setting in particular is largely shrouded in mystery (i.e. bullshit).

    *Good Omens* is also urban fantasy and fun. The setting is played as comedy though, and not even munchkined comedy like Discworld.
    ```

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      Good Omens is in the weird category of almost absurdist comedy, it's hilarious but uses that humor to make some very good points about things. I personally like it, goes down the same kinda vein as Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. 

      Not rational, but still a good read.
      ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        [Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593) is the recommended fanfic for people who enjoyed *Good Omens*. 

        (Technically it's a fanfic of the TV adaptation, but the differences are minor except in that the David Tennant personality really shines through.)
        ```

        - u/Bowbreaker:
          ```
          Seconding this. Though it's less about the Heaven/Hell conflict and more about >!its consequences.!<
          ```

  - u/steelong:
    ```
    Definitely not rational, but there is [The Salvation War series](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSalvationWar).  

    I *really* can't recommend you actually read it, but the tvtropes page might give you some ideas.

    Seriously, this is not actually a recommendation for this fic.  It just happens to have some ideas that might be interesting buried in it.
    ```

  - u/GrizzlyTrees:
    ```
    Unsong is not a classic take on that conflict, but might give you some ideas if you missed it (afaic it is a common rec here). Not strictly speaking rational, a bit like a crack/ratfic combination. Has a version of the heaven/hell/earth conflict as the background and part of the premise of the story.
    ```

  So I've been reading a number of Royal Road fictions from the best rated / trending list. 
  When I tried this out a year or two ago Everyone Likes Big Chests was the highest rated work, which really made me doubt the quality of their rating system. Fortunately things have improved. Here's a very basic rating / random comments.


  [Seaborn](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30131/seaborn)
  Good stuff. Initially the litrpg aspect seemed too heavy handed, but gets a lot better. Nice theme / niche. Quite well written. Short. Definitely read it.

  [Humble Life of a Skill Trainer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30737/the-humble-life-of-a-skill-trainer)
  Good start. Interesting premise, and good execution. Short. Read it. 

  [Queen in the Mud](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26317/queen-in-the-mud)
  Surprisingly good. Short. MC is lucky in everything, but its not grating. Read it.

  [Summoners Journey](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30029/summoners-journey)
  Decent. Readable, and okay execution. Short, kinda cliche. Read it if it sounds interesting to you.

  [Can't Cure Deceit](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30623/cant-cure-deceit)
  Premise is a bit red flag, but pretty good page turner so far. Worth reading it if it sounds interesting to you.

  [Wake of the Ravager](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager)
  Not exactly rational, but has some munchkinry (only from the main character). Popcorn fic. Read it if it doesn't annoy you.

  [Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl)
  Decent writing. Funny. Cliche premise with enough new to make it refreshing. Read it. 

  [He Who Fights with Monsters](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters)
  Enjoyable. Long. Cliche premise, but decently thought through. Pretty good use of abilities. Worth reading if it catches your attention.

  [Rebirth in a Magical World](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26581/rebirth-in-a-magical-world)
  Harry potter fanfic, but does a good job of keeping canon stuff present but to the side.  Has its own existence and characters. Worth reading.

  [A Journey of Black and Red](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red)
  Surprisingly good. Long. Worth reading.

  [Unto the Breach](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/30400/unto-the-breach)
  Kinda cringy.  Seems better than the description would indicate. Short. Hard to tell if this is worth reading yet.

  [Jumpspark](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29729/jumpspark)
  Decent original planes-walker imitation. Lucky / super high potential MC, but seems pretty grounded in having real threats, and reasonably growth rate. Gets Gengis Khan as a mentor, and he's pretty chill.

      > Vainqueur the Dragon

      I thought this started out strong but started getting repetitive and taking longer to execute weaker jokes. It's not building up to anything though, and you can drop it at the end of any arc without feeling cheated, so I'd still recommend reading however much of it holds your interest.
      ```

    - u/baniel105:

      I agree with all this except AYMT, which I found got kinda annoying lol. Great premise though.

      > Epilogue: A short story about a group of teens who are sent back to earth many years after being isekai'd. Pretty solid and won't take too long.

      Just going to second this one. It's a good take on an uncommon premise, and it's reasonably short and finished.

    Stories that have been shared on r/rational before, but haven't been listed here by others yet. I'd say that in all these stories, almost all characters (visible or background) are lvl 1 intelligent, so consider that on top of the sparse description I give. Key: \[wordcount status\]

    [Delve](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve) Nerdy MC does math on his litrpg stats. Good worldbuilding and characters too, it's implied that there are others that munchkin as well. \[400k ongoing\]

    [The Gilded Hero](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29286/the-gilded-hero) Dark (but not grim) isekai, where MC is a throwaway hero. Don't actually know why this appeals to r/rational, but it's good anyways. \[80k ongoing\]

    [Dungeon Engineer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25361/dungeon-engineer) Nerdy MC becomes a dungeon core, excellent magicbuilding, heavy exposition. \[100k hiatus\]

    [The Elemental Arena](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27800/the-elemental-arena) Haven't read this. \[150k ongoing\]

    [A Hero's War](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war) Nerdy isekai MC uplifts society. \[550k ongoing\]

    [Displaced](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15538/displaced) A multi-POV, 6-fold isekai. Conflict comes from clashing personalities and cultures. \[550k ongoing\]

    [The Law of Averages](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20101/the-law-of-averages) Isekai into parallel world with superpowers. Story of searching for self-fulfillment. Good worldbuilding. \[250k ongoing\]

    [The Good Student](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10286/the-good-student) Pure fantasy with a smart MC. \[450k, hiatus\]

    [Aeromancer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/19004/aeromancer) Urban fantasy deadfic. Nice magic system. \[100k dead\]

    You can search for them in r/rational for more info.

    &#x200B;

    Stories that may not be on your radar, but have interesting traits that might make them worth your while:

    [Twilight Kingdom](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21323/twilight-kingdom) Excellent world and magic system. Set in a fantasy land besieged by, iirc, a post-industrial civilisation. While it doesn't feel like a rationalfic, it isn't irrational either. To me, it's essentially novel quality. \[150k ongoing\]

    [Wood and Iron](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25182/wood-and-iron) Pure fantasy. Dead. Nice magic system. Divination, in particular, stood out to me: it works by querying a sort of collective consciousness of everyone in the area, so it only collects what people already know, and only gives you a decent signal if a lot of people know what you're looking for. \[35k dead\]

    [carl@fire](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28356/carlfire) A satire of royal road stories, but a coherent world nonetheless. It really goes the full mile with some of the themes, so there's a lot of disturbing content as well. \[250k ongoing\]

    [Lament of the Determined](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27875/lament-of-the-determined) A crackfic, also a satire of stories on royal road, but no attempt at coherence was made. Much shorter and crunchier. Very crude humor. \[10k ongoing\]

    [The Snake Report](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14396/the-snake-report) Comedic isekai as a snake. Same author as The Gilded Hero, but not as rationally themed. \[300k complete\]

    [The Worldforge: Warlock Rising](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11930/the-worldforge-warlock-rising) Pure fantasy. Dead. though the first book can be thought of as a (dissatisfying, yet) complete story. The main character is a likable type for this subreddit. It's very good at a number of things, worth reading despite the truncation. \[100k dead\]

    [RE:WRITE](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/6356/rewrite) Game creator isekais into his game. An interesting piece with philosophical quandaries and notable worldbuilding, despite the basis of hero vs demon lord. It is a little confusing at times, which detracts from its enjoyability as a story. \[250k complete\]
    ```

  - u/BoxSparrow:
    ```
    I'll add some as well:

    [I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension)](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21844/i-am-going-to-die-in-this-game-like-dimension) A group of people is transported to a litrpg world with different fundamental physics and is forced to complete various challenges. Worldbuilding is interesting, plot is okay.

    [Serial Transmigrator](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21803/serial-transmigrator) Isekai into a xianxia world. The MC is very genre-savvy and exploits genre conventions. Recommended for those tired of regular idiot xianxia protagonists. 

    [Isekai Speedrun](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun) A speedrunner of a game is isekai'd into said game. Protagonist is quite realistic and plans and strategises heavily. World is post-apocalyptic and has quite interesting elements and lore. Complete.
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      Serial Transmigrator isn't just genre-savvy, he's straight up a chunni edgelord loser referring to regular everyday things by made up xianxiaesque technique names, in an IRL setting. I'm not sure I want to continue if this is the way he thinks and navigates through life, even if it does give him some advantage in an actual xianxia setting. Does this improve?

      EDIT: A verbatim line from chapter 3: Oh, poor misguided Kaner. What he didn't know, that I'm taking the liberty to tell you, *Minor spoiler alert* is that his healing ability and understanding of languages would both cause him immense pain... Sucks to be him am I right?

      The author breaking the fourth wall in the middle of the chapter? Nope, dropped.
      ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      I'll second the recommendation for Isekai Speedrun - it's like reading the transcript of a Swedish speedrunner playing through a game with his life on the line, frenetic energy and slightly janky English included.
      ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    One RR fic that doesn't get posted here enough IMO is [Digital Marine](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24396/digital-marine)


    The setting is pretty great from a rational deconstruction standpoint. If we had a perfectly physically accurate MMO with time compression, nobody would waste it on consumers playing around with swords; it'd get immediately turned in to the world's greatest military boot camp.  There's also no magical skill injections here - if you buy Advanced Hacking, you go through the coursework for a Master's in Computer Science in time compression.

    The main character is relatively rational too - she makes informed decisions about her "build", and is exceptional but not too overpowered. The things she comes up with or invents as part of her career are all fairly reasonable in the scheme of things; there's no "oh you're somehow the first person to treat NPCs like people!" nonsense here.

      I'm surprised no one mentions that **Blue Core** is seriously pornographic, and that the sex stuff is absolutely central to its theme, in that it's pretty clear that the plot is tangential to the lovingly described hardcore sex stuff, rather than the other way around. 

      The entire setting is actually built around it being desirable to get fucked by the protagonist, to the point where he heals their actual soul with his black jizz (I wish I was kidding). In typical fashion, all the interesting and explored POV characters are females, and you guessed it: either have been fucked, will be fucked, or want desperately to be fucked by the dungeon core. Which will then be described in lurid detail, let me tell you. 

      It's not even that weird as webnovels go, but I do find it strange that everyone recommending it neglect to mention its... raison d'etre, if you will.
      ```

      - u/RetardedWabbit:
        ```
        Agreed, the amount of recommendations for Blue Core not mentioning the NSFW parts are a bit concerning. I actually think it's a pretty decent dungeon core story but I think you have to like or at least be able to ignore the NSFW parts. There's some weird coercive themes and nightmarish world mechanics that I found off putting.

        - u/RetardedWabbit:

          I don't think the NSFW parts are separate enough to recommend it to people who would skip those chapters and the themes/build up for those chapters.
          ```

          - u/lo4952:
            ```
            For sure, I just meant to emphasize that throughout the story Blue is doing a lot of other stuff. The NSFW content, while minimal in scope, is pretty decently tied into the characters. Which again I see as a good thing, keeping it from random one-offs. But yeah, if NSFW is a dealbreaker for you, you should probably pass on this one.
            ```

        - u/GlueBoy:
          ```
          > it's doing the other characters a disservice to say they only exist to bang the dungeon

          I read about half what's there right now, so 150k words. If my memory serves, there's only 1 or 2 brief male POVs besides Blue, which are snippets purely for exposition. The only females that have non-snippet POVs are: the queen(has been), the fox girl(has been), the lesbian couple(will be, i'm sure), and the dragon lady(desperately wants to be). 

          It's good writing to only expand on characters that will come to feature in the plot([conservation of detail tvtropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLawOfConservationOfDetail)), so no complaints there. What's not good writing--IMHO, obviously-- is when all the well characterized females in a story are attractive and willing to join the protagonist's harem. 

          And to be clear, I would object to this even if there was no graphic carrot top sex prominently featuring black jizz.
          ```

          - u/lo4952:
            ```
            I don't know if you've read this far, but the author does actually resolve the relationship between the lesbian couple and Blue in a purely non-sexual manner, having the character not wanting to compromise herself to get rid of the depletion. It doesn't invalidate your point about all the other characters that do lay with the dungeon, but it is a change of pace.
            ```

            - u/GlueBoy:
              ```
              That's a pleasant surprise. Though I imagine the herbalist lady(who I forgot in my list) joins the harem, right?

      I actually had read several of these before, but its been a while. Thanks!

      Blue Core - pretty good.

      Azarinth Healer -- dropped after figuring she was never going to stop just grinding in the wilderness. It didn't really seem to have a point beyond big numbers go up. Maybe I should revisit, since its progressed a lot after this.

      Defiance - haven't read this one. I'll try it out, thanks!

      Super Minion - don't recall. Think I gave up on this one till it advanced more.
      ```

      - u/lo4952:
        ```
        Yeah I don't blame you for dropping Azarinth Healer if you don't like the grinding, cause thats basically the story. I intentionally picked it up again specifically to get away from the end-of-the-world stakes a lot of other novels have, so it doesn't bother me as much. However there have been some solid arcs recently, so you might enjoy them.
        ```

      - u/baniel105:
        ```
        I really enjoyed defiance. I'd like to mention that the story starts with a heavy focus on survival to more of exploring (with some, but limited grinding) & city building - I enjoyed it, but reviewers on RR were mad that it changed lol.

    When does Rebirth in a Magical World pick up pace? I've read 18 or so chapters and the MC doesn't really do anything of impact. While future impactful storylines might have been set up I don't trust RR authors enough to just assume that they'll deliver.

  Been thinking of rationality in different genres, and I'm wondering this: What would a rational *romance* look like? Any recommendations for those?
  ```

  - u/pldl:
    ```
    Well, here's my thought process.

    If we assume soap operas are on the irrational end of romantic fiction, then the opposite of that could be considered to be "rational". 

    Soap Operas have ridiculous love geometries, crazy plots, and over the top melodrama.
    So the opposite is a slice-of-life between a monogamous couple working through their issues together?
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      > So the opposite is a slice-of-life between a monogamous couple working through their issues together?

      Which means that [I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying](https://www.crunchyroll.com/i-cant-understand-what-my-husband-is-saying) is objectively the most rational romance.
      ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      > monogamous 

      Or polyamorous by mutual agreement, which is another stable solution to the "love triangle" problem.
      ```

    - u/Roneitis:
      ```
      I don't think there's any need to have boring romance dynamics, you just need to have the characters be reasonable in how they approach things. I think of crucial importance would be an attempt to showcase responsible relationships.

      Rat fantasy still has magic. If there's no melodrama, it's not a soap, it's just a different story. I'll point out that there are directions you can go in the romance genre beyond soaps: see romcoms, and also genuinely smut.
      ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Lots of serious introspection, lots of clear communication between reasonable adults.

    [Luminosity](https://luminous.elcenia.com/) comes to mind. (As well as [pretty much every glowfic](https://www.glowfic.com/), but glowfic is an acquired tasted and I don't strictly speaking recommend it.)

    There are excellent scenes on that topic in *Worth the Candle* too, though it's not the focus.
    ```

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      Ugh I feel almost dirty agreeing with you in that Luminosity is an example of a rational romance. It's about *Twilight* though! Still we've both obviously read it. 

      It's not 'rational' unless held up in comparison to the original Twilight though. The Munchkining around the mental abilities of others is well done, but the vampires still ignore technological avenues of attacking one another. Sure, a hundred and twenty years ago Human tech was weak compared to them. 

      Without even approaching the destructiveness of nukes though, modern weapons can easily destroy 'stone'. Some Anti-tank rifles, a few pounds of plastic explosives, chemical weapons, hell nerve agents might have still been effective.
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        I love Luminosity and agree that it's rational but I don't find the romance rational, specifically. The way vampire romance works in the novel is... >!the vampires see each other and fall immediately and irretrievably in love, and pretty much the same thing happens with wolves!<. The "hard yards" of romance don't really appear in the novel, and aren't really the focus - the focus is on the power stuff which is cool don't get me wrong. (I am going to re-read it I think. I loved it so).

    ```
    [\*cough cough\* It looks like this](http://www.archiveofourown.org/works/14984261/chapters/34726769)

    I think there's maybe three rational romances I've seen posted here. The thing is, to write a romance you can't just make it rational, it also has to invest you emotionally. So it has to be a good work of fiction first, but the characters are also smart and just happen to love each other. (Also the story is probably really witty and has things to say about society, but it's not a requirement.)

    Anyways, here's one that I think might be worth a shot: [Marriage and Monsters: An Eschatological Romance](https://archiveofourown.org/works/18738010/chapters/44446768). I haven't read it though so can't rec it based on how good it is, but it seems to check the boxes.

    Also, like, anything by Jane Austen. [Pride and Prejudice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice) comes to mind. She also wrote an entire book that was a parody of gothic romance called [Northanger Abbey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50398.Northanger_Abbey). It's basically like Luminosity but written two centuries ago.
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Rational respondses to romantic interpersonal conflicts are communication, introspection, working on identifying needs, wants and boundaries, and on recognizing that love doesn't conquer all incompatibilities. 

    Rational romance could include:

    * Negotiating different wants/needs/lifestyles
    * Overcoming personal insecurities/insecurities/trauma and growing with someone else.
    * Facing societal challenges with the specific kind of romance involved, including facing job loss or family pressure.
    ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
    ```
    I'm not 100% sure these qualify as rational and/or romance, but here you go:

    * [*Bicentennial Man*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentennial_Man_\(film\)) [spoiler \ disclaimer:](#s "though the pro-natalist and pro-immortality members would probably disagree with the ending") >!though the pro-natalist and pro-immortality members would probably disagree with the ending!<

    Jane the Virgin series handles relationships and romance in rational ways; everything else, no, but unashamedly so (it's based on telenovela tropes so everyone has a twin brother and amnesia). 

    I'm also in the process of writing and releasing a romance story (with OCs): https://archiveofourown.org/works/13710744/chapters/31496223
    ```

  - u/EdenicFaithful:
    ```
    As far as rational-ish stories with somewhat mature romance goes:

    Trails in the Sky (video game) is one of the best told games I've had the pleasure of playing. Innocent, athletic/boisterous and social female main, and a pragmatic, kind, and yet sometimes uncomfortably cold male companion. Something of a jRPG blend of fantasy and steampunk-ish. Superb ending (though a cliffhanger) of the first game, haven't played the other two. The tension of the relationship is mainly around said open innocence and hidden coldness.

    I'll recommend Looseboy's two great erotic visual novels with the caveats that they could use an editor and you should prepare for the quirks of Japanese ero-games:

    The Devil on G-String's third route in particular (Shiratori Mizuha) is good enough that its worth playing the game just for it. Its a combination of intellectual thriller and surprisingly mature romance of two people trying to find a second chance, the romance more so at the very last part of her route, the good end (you have to specifically go there or you'll miss it). The interesting aspects of this romance itself were fairly short, however, though I think its well worth it given the quality of its writing and the fact that it is a satisfying conclusion to the thriller aspect of the route. The game is set between a cat-and-mouse battle of the main heroine and the enigmatic criminal who calls himself the Devil/Maou based on the classical Der Erlkönig, the protagonist being an amoral student with Yakuza ties who becomes a suspect for Maou's identity. (Also Maou is voiced by Lelouch's voice actor.)

    Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo (translation: The Wheel Country and the Girl of the Sunflowers?), Looseboy's other minor masterpiece (earlier and probably the better story overall), is much less mature on the romance front (too anime-ish at times), but it does indeed center around the criminal (by dystopian standards) girls and the Special High Class Individual Candidate protagonist in charge of their supervision. Morita Kenichi, the protagonist, is simply cool- friendly, tough, intelligent and with wide experience. The antagonist Houzuki, Kenichi's SHCI mentor, is a pedagogically minded economist/politician who is also a charismatic and violent authoritarian.

  I have a lot of time to listen to audiobooks, and am constantly running out of them.

  The good news is that I found one in podcast form. Apparently it started out as a reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/7asz8x/has_anyone_heard_of_the_leftright_game_part_1/)?  It's called the [Left Right Game](https://www.podcastrepublic.net/podcast/1498806952), and despite the stupid title, the story so far isn't bad. It isn't rational, but I wasn't expecting it to be. 

  They are currently on episode 5, and update religiously once a week. Each chapter is about 30-40 minutes long. (Meanwhile [Pact](https://www.podcastrepublic.net/podcast/1448857756) updates sporadically, kind of near once a month-ish).

  Really the best part of it is the sound quality. The sounds are realistic and you *will* occasional turn your head to see if that skidding car sound was real. I think it's even edited for [3d audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_audio_effect). That's to be expected (they are recording these in hopes of selling you high-quality speakers), but if you ignore the ads, it can be pretty good. 

  Also, as I write this comment, I learn that they have [more] (https://player.fm/podcasts/QCODE) of these, which I will probably be checking out.

  Also also, there's a sub for [these things](https://www.reddit.com/r/audiodrama/top/)? 

  Conclusion, I should write more reddit comments because it forces me to research things.

    Hey, I had a phase where I listened to a bunch of audio dramas. It's an interesting way to consume media no doubt. Here's a few I remember being good.

    * [Wolf 359] (https://www.wolf359.fm/) does a good job of starting as a comedy and slowly turning serious. The main character has a wonderful voice and is fun to listen to. 

    * [We're Alive] (https://www.wolf359.fm/) is a completed zombie apocalypse drama. I never got too far into it but it has good production value and starts off in a somewhat cliche but still enjoyable way.

    * [The Black Tapes] (https://theblacktapespodcast.com/) is a horror drama with a somewhat cliche plot, but the production value is high and execution is good. 

    Other than that I also listened to Edict Zero FIS (which is a scifi crime drama), Welcome to the Night Vale, and Tanis, which are all good but weren't things that hooked me straight from the get go. I'm sure there are many more dramas now, maybe I should get back into it.

    You may have good luck also using the term "doover," though for some reason it's quite associated with erotica (some of which can be surprisingly decent.)

    Don't expect munchkinry, this is more of a lit-fic. It's about a man using his rebirth to try to untangle all the emotional baggage he's been carrying from childhood.

    If you happen to speak French, I recommend the official French translation, as it's more professional.

    It also has a film adaptation (set in France rather than Japan) that has good reviews, though I can't vouch for it.

  I just finished [RWBY](https://roosterteeth.com/series/rwby) season 7, and I really, really liked it. The entire plotline this season was about political intrigue, and how different people respond to a difficult situation. It was funny, intelligent, and packed with a ton of great character moments. Also like...logical plot points that influence how the characters act and are internally consistent. :D I'm fangirling so hard.

  I'm not gonna lie, RWBY has irritated me in the past with some of their irrational plot points and characters doing dumb crap for no reason. But if you dropped RWBY because of it, this might be the season to pick it back up. I don't know if they added a writer or what, but they definitely took it up a notch. I actually had to stop and rewind a few times because the characters were analyzing so fast I missed something, and I NEVER have to do that with this show, so...

  10/10 highly recommend
  ```

  - u/Weerdo5255:
    ```
    Huh, I've been with RWBY since the beginning, and I'm part of the community over on /r/RWBY 

    For anyone getting into it, the Rule of Cool and not Rationality is the primary rule of the universe. Looking back on it though, I would have to agree with the sentiment, but more along the lines of the show becoming more Rational. It starts off very much not. 

    I wouldn't give it the Rational label quite yet, it's getting there but only for low stakes scenarios. 'Hero' characters for the most part are still operating on Saturday Morning Cartoon morals, with most villains suffering Disney deaths if at all. 

    Considering the mythos setup and the cliff hanger / last episode of the latest season though I suppose it is becoming more rational.
    ```

    - u/Ms_CIA:
      ```
      Ha ha, no RWBY is not rational fic, and I think the first few seasons were enjoyable just because they were fun. Interesting characters, cool fight scenes, intriguing mythos, etc. Around season 4-5 it stopped being fun and started being really annoying (at least for me) because of the glaringly obvious plot holes you could drive a truck through. But Season 7 turned out to be surprisingly good, and it's one of those things that makes me really happy to see. It's a cool, fun show that somehow also pulled off being really smart. :)

  - u/DraggonZ:

    Thanks for the rec! I dropped the show close to an end of season 6. Nonsensical characters and way too corny humour made it a torture to watch. And season 7 was a huuuge step up in all departments: characters, plot, dialogue, animation.
    ```

    - u/Ms_CIA:

      I know, it took me so long to watch season 7 because the last few have been underwhelming. But even the *humor* was better this season, man. Such an improvement.

  I've been wanting to get into reading more in general, but I get really turned off by poor or amateur writing. Even if the story's good and has potential, it's really hard for me to turn the critiquing part of my brain off. Does anyone have any suggestions for a rational fiction that is a well written, professional quality story? A few things I'm looking for:

  1) Satisfying narrative arc (follows three act structure)

  2) Realistic, well written characters

  3) Decently paced (don't want to read chapters and chapters of them just talking, unless it's really, really well written)

  4) Focus is on story and characters first, rationality/other themes second

  5) Completed and/or regularly posted fic

  Also, while it's not strictly necessary, I like reading humor fics. Anyways, if anyone has any recs, I'd be happy to take a look. :) I realize some of these points are harder to find in serialized fiction because the medium lends itself to wordiness, but I'd still like to see what's out there. And since I know you guys are going to rec them, I've already read some of Wildbow and Alexander Wales' work. XD

    I've read that one (it's [also on Ao3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15499401/chapters/35981172)). Thus far it's my favorite Death Note fanfic; I love the author's deconstruction of the SI genre.

    I suppose it's... sort of rational adjacent(?) in a 'crack scenario treated seriously' way. Like many of the author's fics, the story's strength lies in its portrayal of the inner lives of characters experiencing existential horror. It touches on some of the same philosophical topics as "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus", because those are themes that the author likes to explore in most of her stories.

    The fic is unfinished and the current chapter ends on a rather awkward note, but I enjoyed it enough that I'd still recommend giving it a try. But then, I'm a huge fan of the author's works and would recommend reading almost all of them regardless of completion status.

  Anyone have any stories (or stories containing significant scenes) that take place in abstract space, rather than the usual physical universe?

  I'm only mildly interested in universes with wonky geometry (e.g. [Dichronauts](https://www.gregegan.net/DICHRONAUTS/DICHRONAUTS.html), flatland). I want stuff more like [Onward To Providence](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/onward-to-providence-original-fiction.45926)'s souls/spirits/resonance/infosphere, or WtC's P-space (though WtC doesn't currently have any scenes set in P-space). Where metaphor *is* reality, or where any sort of "life" is totally information-based.
  ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    Since you mention Dichronauts I'll assume you're already aware of Permutation City.

    It may be a slight spoiler to say so, but Trudi Canavan's Age of the Five trilogy does some of this. Peter F Hamilton also plays with adjacent concepts in the Night's Dawn trilogy (zombies in spaaace!...) and in the Void trilogy. Max Harms' Crystal Society trilogy is also adjacent. Oh, and again may be a slight spoiler to say so but check out Nick Harkaway's "Gnomon". 

    Those are all still grounded in the recognisable, though. For closer blending of the abstract, metaphor and reality you might like to check out Jeff Noon, for instance; I quite enjoy his work but others have described the experience of reading it as comparable to having little grains of salt flicked at your eyeballs, so YMMV I guess.

    EDIT: oh, I'll also take a moment to plug Marina and Sergey Dyachenko's ["Access History"](https://www.toothycat.net/~sham/Access_History.html) again; [Vita Nostra](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07D461PYF) also fits the bill somewhat; the other two books in that series are much closer to what you're after, but haven't been translated yet, sadly.

    [Katalepsis](https://katalepsis.net/) has some of that, but only short segments. Most of it takes place in contemporary England.

    This segment from one of the latest chapters (minimal spoilers, only setting stuff) is pretty much the best fit for what I think you're looking for:

    > >!*The abyss between the spheres of reality is endless and dark, a place of horrible hungry things that hunt forever in pitch blackness, of predator and prey hiding and slinking, of silent filter-feeding giants and the echoes of alien thought carried on the currents. Small darting mouths of bottomless starvation, formless crab-hounds that seep through the angles of time, hunters of morsels of stray unwise thought and sensation across the gaps in creation, all of them catching my scent in the water and turning to stalk. Fleeing wisps, lost on the tides, desperate for the warmth and sanctuary of physical form, clutching at my ankles and moaning for help. Things vast and slow, thinking vast slow thoughts in trailing tendrils to entrap the unwary, eating, eating, always eating, growing bigger and thinking harder and trying to make themselves real.*!<

    The prose is not normally this... abstract and flowery, but usually really good compared to most of the stuff that usually gets recommended around here.

    Elevator pitch: Girl who always believed the monsters she sees because of her psychosis finds out they're actually real - for a certain value of "real" - and is drawn into a parallel world of cults and magic and zombies.

    > Too little mathematics has been written in prose. Thus we prove here, via a fantasy novellette, that a locally L-bilipschitz mapping f:X→Y between uniformly Ahlfors q-regular, complete and locally compact path-metric spaces X and Y is an L-bilipschitz map when Y is simply connected. The motivation for such a result arises from studying the asymptotic values of BLD-mappings with an empty branch set; see e.g. [L17].
    > As far as the author is aware, the result is new, even though it would not be hard for specialists in the field to prove. The proof is essentially a modest extension of the ideas in [L17] in a more general setting when the branch set is empty.
