## Rational Pokemon fanfic about research?

### Post:

This is my first post on reddit so I hope I'm in line with all the community rules and everything (please correct me if I'm not), but as the title suggests, I'm looking for recommendations for rational Pokemon fics that focus on Pokemon research. But I haven't had much luck in finding any...so I'm seriously restraining myself from writing my own.

 I love the world of Pokemon and the science implications behind it, but during my searches I find that fics tend to focus more on the people/trainer aspects (which is great, don't get me wrong), but I'm interested in fics that explore the rationale behind **Pokemon** (their biology, habitats, etc.). For example, I adore Thanos6's ["A Beginner's Guide To Pokemon"](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5822995/1/A-Beginner-s-Guide-To-Pok%C3%A9mon) because it feels like a real  guide you'd find in the world to help people learn how to take care of Pokemon. However, this is stylized as a guide and not a narrative/story, (which is again, totally fine), whereas I'm curious if there are any stories about Pokemon researchers/explorers or something.

Please save me from starting another long, lengthy writing project when I already have quite a few on my plate, and send me some high-quality, Pokemon research fanfic recommendations! Thank you! :D

  Have you read [Pokemon: The Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/61/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species)? 

  I'm very behind on it, but it miiiight scratch that itch you describe?

    OoS is definitely the go-to in terms of rational Pokémon.

    Red's background is that he's been working at a research lab before the journey begins. While there are some research scenes involving him and other characters, the fic is mostly about teaching rational thinking within the "three friends travel the world" setting of Pokémon.

    I'd recommend reading it. Without spoiling too much, you might especially enjoy the more recent chapters if you liked worm.

      I have been enjoying it a lot, and loved seeing how the writing has progressed over time. I'm looking for fics that focus more on just the Pokemon aspects, but don't worry, I'm still a fan of OoS. Thanks for the reply!

    Thanks for the reply! OoS is great! I'm on Ch. 60 now. I love the author's worldbuilding of the Pokemon universe, and there's some great information about Pokemon themselves, especially in the earlier chapters, but later on I felt that some of the focus on Pokemon shifted to other matters. Not at all a bad thing, and I enjoy the building narrative, but it doesn't quite satisfy my itch for learning more about Pokemon, the species.

      I too feel that the writer doesn't really want to a pokefic anymore as opposed to general sci-fi with pets. There's a lot more focus on the psychic powers, clones, stock market, research grants, politics, legal system, natural disasters, social media, journalism, real world maths etc as opposed to the actual Pokemon, which just get pulled out for the odd action scene.

  I would say "write your own as well" but remembered I'm in the same boat. I'm also trying to apply logic to the Pokemon world in a fic and that means I have to at least be able to bullshit how the ship in the second movie functions. Yike.

    Ha, exactly. I'd want to write about Pokemon biology...but I'm far from a biologist myself. But then again, you could always AskReddit, or some friends who might know enough to help you get started on the detail-oriented parts. Thanks for your reply!
