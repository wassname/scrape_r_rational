  Back as promised after ~~2~~ 5 weeks. We rejoin the story as Vash makes a critical choice. You can catch up with the previous chapter [here](https://ascentuniverse.wordpress.com/2018/01/07/chapter-12-beachhead/).

  *Feedback and comments would be greatly appreciated.*

  I can't quite tell if Vash is a genius or an idiot. But I figure he probably has way more background information than we do.
