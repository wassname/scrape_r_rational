  So the creator of this game got sick of waiting for Miegakure to be released and decided to make his own 4D game.

  It's much shorter and simpler in scope than Miegakure will be, but it's still amazing as a working 4D environment. One of the most noticeable 'limitations' is that pretty much all of the 4D objects one interacts with are basically some variation on a hypercube (or at least in the first few levels I finished so far). But it's really, really, really cool to play this game.

  Please donate something when you buy this game instead of just taking it for free!

  Go to /r/Brane if you want to ask the creator anything about the game.

  There’s also a list like [this,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_four-dimensional_games) which I myself haven’t checked out much.

    [Cursor*10](http://www.freewebarcade.com/game/cursor10/) is one of my all-time favourites. Very simple puzzle with a very innovative (at the time) idea. I believe PB Winterbottom uses a similar mechanic however I haven't played it so can't speak for its quality.

    I put together [this demo](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lLg3oLbwRsQ) as a school project way back when.  Still hoping to turn the concept into something real at some point.

    I find the lack of zachatonics disturbing

    Also [Fez](http://fezgame.com/), which is sort of like Brane and Miegakure but in one fewer dimension.
