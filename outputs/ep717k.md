  I found some points in this interesting but I don’t think that it  provides anything extraordinarily insightful that hasn’t been better put elsewhere. Additionally there are several points that I don’t necessarily agree with. For example, that people don’t support movements that benefit them directly. The article didn’t seem to address the fact that many people do support movement that are primarily about fighting for groups of people other than their own and that people can benefit socially from being seen to support a movement even if they don’t care about it personally. The article seems to greatly oversimplify the problem of social change as well as the number of agents involved in it. 
  Here’s a vastly better article on a similar topic for anyone who is interested though https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/

  Off-topic. Not particularly insightful either.

  FWIW, I think the strength of the negative feedback on this post is due to the effect Eliezer mentioned recently, where people who have the strongest responses are most likely to act upon them (vote and comment).

  My own opinions on the post:   
  Content-wise, I thought it had useful things to say, but also got annoyed at how little some of the statements were explained or expanded upon.   
  Style-wise, it started strong, but didn't seem to provide a good structure further in. If I was going to make a similar article for a general audience, I would write something shorter or choose to make a strong throughline (eg. taking a broken system and exploring different ways of trying to fix it, showing if and how they fail). 

  Overall: Not terrible, but if I was looking for something to share to a general audience, I'd hope there's a well-edited youtube video that explains the same.
