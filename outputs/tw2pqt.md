## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Having a lot of fun with this quest so far. Birdsie is a talented writer and the world building is rational and continues to surprise.

    Holy *shit*, that story went from 0 to a 100 *fast*. I don't like quests, but this one looks very interesting despite the format. From what I've read so far, the worldbuilding is rational and quite engaging indeed. But, like, *what the fuck*?

        Yes, u/Krakenarrior was correct. Not only this event happens, it was not telegraphed at all. Also, the choice that led to it was grouped together with very benign choices, so it was not telegraphed on the meta level as well. With that said, I have a strong suspicion that the author has planned this event to happen either way, but maybe later, and players' choices (+rolls) made it happen much sooner than expected—so there was no time for foreshadowing.

        Also, I don't like that author shares some interesting/useful worldbuilding information on Discord but not in the thread, so it has to be copied here by readers. 

        Overall, I found the story to be a bit better than average. It's super good for a quest, but that's because the vast majority of quests are shit. The prose is very competent, the worldbuilding is detailed and fascinating, and it has some really cool moments. The rest is ok. With that said, it should be read for one single character: >!Geist, who is almost literally hpmor!Voldemort on very strong acid!< (very minor spoilers). He's great.
        ```

      - u/Krakenarrior:

        I’m guessing they’re referring to what happens to Harry, right before he goes to Hogwarts. It involves >!major character death!<  and really threw me for a loop. 
        I can expand more if needed, but it kinda shocked me, especially when most quests (or at least the ones I read) don’t have those kinds of events happen out of left field. 


        Honestly overall this quest is super good, and it doesn’t read like an rpg, it reads like regular fan fiction. There’s also some interesting looks at how different houses work, and all of the voting prompts are written in character, which is really fun.

  I have a sort of anti-rec for [Millennial Mage](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47826/millennial-mage-a-slice-of-life-progression-fantasy).

  I kind of like the fantasy setting, where humanity is forced to build cities, live within them for ~ 300 years, and then abandon them, moving on to newly constructed cities. It is explained midway in why this is necessary.

  The MC (Tala) is a bit strange.  She goes from a middling / above average mage student in mage school (before the story starts) to a much more outgoing overachiever in the story itself. I can kind of give it a pass, since it occurs beforehand, but the motivation for the change is weak.

  Tala is stupidly reckless basically the entire time (but gets away with it), and to the story's credit, multiple characters tell her this repeatedly. It is still a fun read, despite that.

  But one of the most recent developments I just can't fathom, and I may quit because of it.

  >!After enhancing her strength and toughness (she's got it in her head to also fight hand-to-hand more even though she's a mage), she's decided to increase her gravitational attraction 4x (four times). She did this because of a brief comment about jumping with enhanced strength, and the danger of going up too high and having your trajectory easily predicted. This has *not* been a problem for the fights she has been in so far, and she hasn't yet fought with her latest enhancements.!<

  >!This I find to be very stupid, and the other characters don't seem to mind. Unless her major attack from now on is going to be stepping on people (she will weight about 1k pounds), she isn't going to see any benefit 99% of the time. Her reaction speed and running speed will slower.!<

  >!It doesn't even fit the fighting style of her main weapon, which can project an infinitely thin blade that seems to cut through anything. So she doesn't need to hit *hard*, just hit *fast*. If she is worried about being thrown up in the air and having a predictable path, why not get some other magic that will allow her to randomize her path instead?!<

    Assuming sufficient power, an optimized gait, and shoes/floor that *barely* qualify as slip resistant, something can accelerate at a max of 0.25g because of the coefficient of friction.  For reference, that's 25m/s in 10 s, or approximately Olympian performance over short distances.

    >!With increased gravitational attraction but *not* increased inertial mass, you could increase the shear force you apply to the ground without increasing the force required to accelerate yourself, allowing for higher accelerations without slipping.!<
    ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      That is a good point. >!Top running speed should improve a lot.!<

      >!Still, consider using a sword. For any movement with a down vector, yes, the increased gravitational attraction will make that movement quicker. But for any movement with an up vector, it will be much slower than what would otherwise be possible. But I would think that being able to make upward strikes at your full speed would outweigh the ability to make downward strikes with increased speed / force. And her bonded melee weapon is sort of a lightsaber, so increased striking force won't be as useful as raw speed. The hammer would have somewhat greater effect though.!<
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        ~~I think you're overstating the effect.~~ Huh, it's surprisingly relevant. 

        An arm masses about 5 kg, and let's model it as a uniform 1m long segment.  Let's also assume [0.5 seconds](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-1000-martial-arts-sword-cuts) per cut under earthly conditions, and that they are equivalent to 90 degree rotations (which is high, but easier to calculate).  It would be start->accelerate until 45 degrees, decelerate until 90 degrees, stop, repeat.

        That's would require an angular speed of 2 rad/s at peak, with 5/3 kg m^2 of mass moment of inertia.  The energy in the swing at that point is therefore .5 * I * Theta^2 = 6.66 J, with the other half of the swing removing the energy at the same rate.  You would therefore have to move 13.33 J per swing.

        >!Now add gravity and swing upwards.  You move the center of gravity up by half a meter, for 2.5 J extra (15.8 total).  Multiplying that factor by 4 is quite significant.!<

        Edit: I made at least one math error, fixing it later.

    ```
    I suspect she isn't a reliable narrator when it comes to her time at the academy.  >!she has a few nightmares that scream of repressed memories from the academy!<

    >!The weight thing is grating.  I get that she wants to get used to it.  and it would make more sense if she used like a heavy weapon or something that required leverage.  I'm most annoyed that she's just constantly heavy.  Like you really only need something like this in spurts.!<
    ```

    - u/vorpal_potato:
      ```
      Note that repressed memories are a pseudoscientific myth, at least in our own non-magical world. As I recall, it was a big thing back in the 1980s when people were imagining [Satanic child abusers crouching behind every rustling bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day-care_sex-abuse_hysteria) -- it was convenient for the purposes of witch hunting to be able to claim that sexual abuse victims often lost all recollection of any such crime taking place, and that a suggestible child asked a series of leading questions could "recover a memory" that just happened to confirm whatever suspicion the interviewer was fishing for.

      (My personal favorite example of this is the [McMartin preschool trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMartin_preschool_trial), in which allegations involved child sexual abuse, a network of secret underground tunnels, Chuck Norris for some reason, witches flying through the sky, and *extremely* implausible toilet design, possibly of magical nature.)

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      Yes.

      >!The argument in-story is that she should get used to the increased weight so that her reflexes can adapt properly. However, if Tala were really worried about "going ballistic" (being in the air on a parabolic trajectory and being unable to alter her velocity vector and thereby be an easy target for attack), then just blipping the gravity inscription momentarily would allow her to unpredictably fall faster as needed. Heck, having that manually controllable would allow tactics like jumping over your opponent, with a trajectory that will clearly miss, and then falling on said opponent unexpectedly. So much wasted potential.!<
      ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    Thinking about it further...

    >!So in some sense, yes, the increased gravitational attraction would have sort of helped in the giant raven encounter. But if Tala had fallen the entire distance with this new spell, she likely would have splattered on the ground in a huge crater. Much higher final velocity. She might not even have a terminal velocity.!<

    >!I could see this spell having use if she was moving to a different planet with lower gravity... but that isn't a thing in this setting. Probably.!<

        > I thought she did what she did because she wanted a constant magical/physical workout with minimal effort, but it seems I was mistaken. If the reason is the same one as you've specified, it does sound a bit stupid.

        Splitting her flows and all the other stuff should provide all the magical workout she needs.

        If she needs a greater physical workout, well, they make weights, don't they? She can likely put inscriptions upon them so that they are very heavy without a lot of bulk.

        It also occurs to me she asked the students to come up with a fighting style for her... and even before she's received the results, she has radically changed her physical circumstances.

        Also, (not that the fic is going that way) I can imagine a "death by snu-snu" incident should she ever want to get intimate with anyone who isn't Superman.

        > ...Tala acting like a retarded puppy in both magical and social encounters.

        There's been more than a couple occasions where I'm like "Wow Tala, that was rude, how you acted towards X." But she hasn't seemed to have suffered any consequences for that.

    ```
    Mostly-rationalist manga recommendation: *I'm Standing on a Million Lives.* Our protagonists get summoned to another world and given some task to perform; if they succeed, they get un-summoned for a few weeks until the next task -- which takes place a couple of decades later in the other world's time, so you get to see a sweep of history in little slices. The party size is initially one person, with an additional character getting added every time they get summoned.

    This manga is very much *not* like every other isekai. The situations that the protagonists are told to intervene in are complex and seldom have an obvious right answer -- they have to think about difficult tradeoffs, look into *why* things are the way they are, and sometimes ask themselves "Although this feels like Helping, will it actually fix the problem? What's the causal structure of the problem, and where can we productively change it?" Sometimes there are even diagrams. At least once, the manga goes on for a few pages about various hypotheses that are consistent with what they've seen so far, along with testable predictions that would differentiate them. Also, there are some really kickin' fight scenes.

    You can tell that the author really cares about this one, and wants to make it Actually Good instead of paint-by-numbers.

    The only isekai where they can go in and out of the other world regularly that didn't end up being shit that I can think of is Cautious Hero. 

    If you're willing to go a bit out of strict Isekai there's also Fate/Grand Order, where the protagonists are based out of a UN facility in modern day antarctica and "rayshift" in and out of singularities (bubbles of distorted history they're trying to fix, like one in 1431 where Gilles de Rais attempts to burn France to the ground with an army of dragons). Has the issue of different bits having different authors, so it's of varying quality, unfortunately. 

    In terms of other Isekai that's fine, I enjoyed:

    HameFura, a mostly slice of life Isekai Tensai but with good writing

    Konosuba, which *was* a parody of isekai (Unfortunately several of the things it does to lampoon such stories have since been uncritically adopted by the genre so) and is a good comedy isekai comedy

    I'm a spider, so what was also enjoyable, although some things were lost in the adaptation to anime.

    There's more outside of anime, especially if you're willing to include fanfics and stuff that strictly counts but is usually counted separately like SI fics, but those usually don't tend to be what people mean when they ask for this so I'll hold off.

    I'm gonna say these are very much not rational (though they certainly have their moments), but I'm gonna recommend the three works of FUNA - "Didn't I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life", "Saving 80,000 Gold in Another World for my Retirement", and "I Shall Survive Using Potions!". Only the first has an anime, which followed the manga's plot that diverged greatly from the novels, so I'd recommend reading the novels.

    All three are extremely similar - young adult gets reincarnated into a younger body by a dumb god that accidentally caused her death, gets given a ridiculously broken power as compensation, and tries to live a normalish, light-hearted life while constantly going on adventures and accidentally changing the world in dramatic ways.

    The second one, in particular, is what you're looking for here - the MC has the ability to teleport between Earth and a generic fantasy world (at any point she has visisted in either) and uses it to good enough effect. I liked it because she ends up changing earth too, by bringing exotic materials in, though sadly it (understandably) focused a lot more on the fantasy world instead.

      Other anime involving multiple trips to and from another world:

      * Twelve Kingdoms. Fantasy; an oldie but a goodie. Decent worldbuilding, though a little infodumpy; holds up pretty well by modern standards.

      * Yukikaze. Something very Philip K. Dick hiding in there between pretty dogfights and patchy storytelling.

      * Otherside Picnic. Sacrifices rationality, character development, worldbuilding and general sanity on the altar of existential horror, but still, not entirely terrible.

      * Madoka. If Wonder Egg Priority counts, so does this. Cliched now, but it originated many of those tropes - arguably every magical girl anime since is informed by its existence.

  Shokei Shoujo no Virgin Road , adapted from the Yuri light novel series "The Executioner and Her Way of Life"

Isekei protagonists have been summoned to such an extent that the world is in an industrial revolution , and Japanese culture and language are widely known.

    Of course, the Isekai protagonists are also dangerously powerful, and responsible for a long history of magical [disasters](https://i.imgur.com/8Q0BFJX.jpg). Governments now consider them an existential threat and summoning them is strictly banned.

    Took a look at the first episode of the anime and the way the story was presented came off poorly to me. It felt cardboard-y and cheap. Might be things were lost in adaptation?

    I imagine the first episode is more effective if you haven't read the synopsis, so the ending of the first episode is a surprise, but not enough effort was put into making the protagonist interesting outside of being an overpowered anime protagonist (who presumably falls in love with the girl who got isekai'd in the background, but is otherwise the most boring assassin ever).

Things escalate on a galactic scale. It is many novels in length and sort of a guilty pleasure read for me. I came for the fun escalation and space battles, stayed for the galactic scale plot that actually seems galactic in scale, and I reconsider reading it constantly due to literal Taylor worship.

    For something a little different, there's [Forty Millenniums of Cultivation ](https://novelfull.com/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation.html). I believe I saw Eliezer suggest it around these parts, and I can whole-heartedly recommend it! 

    I *really* enjoyed 40MOC, as someone who is a complete novice to Xianxia/Chinese WebLit, but well acquainted with rational fiction as a genre. It leans far harder on the Cultivation side rather than the 40k aspect, but that makes sense in context when you remember that some of the more OP Cultivators in the genre could probably give the Man-Emperor of Mankind headpats for being cute. But there's bolters, power armor, a setting that's totally not the outcome of a Horus Heresy, and the story is good enough to stand on its own even if every 40k reference was stripped out. 

    I would say it's one of my favorite works, period. The story is highly engrossing, and I didn't find the initial 100 chapters to be a slog or not worth my time, especially given that I wasn't told to ignore them in advance, as some people recommend. What initially piqued my interest was the sheer *strangeness* of a rational Cultivation/40K crossover, I simply had to read it to see if it was just as much of a crack-fic as I expected it to be, and was pleasant surprised to see it *wasn't*.

    The plot is extremely interesting, the worldbuilding is great, while I don't agree with the protagonist's refusal to *ever* compromise his morals and still never get punished for it, it wasn't enough to pull me out of writing that was a mixture of absolute emotional roller-coaster gutpunches, and then humor that made me cry-laugh for the opposite reasons.

    It's really, really good. Not diamond hard rational, but far closer to that end of the scale than typical Xianxia, or *any* other genre for the matter.

    The protagonists and antagonists are quite rational in their outlook, and behave in believable ways in accordance with their ethical outlooks and the information they have available to them. Sure, the MC always wins the day, but that's pretty much a given for most writing in general. HPMOR could have technically ended with Harry failing to stop Voldemort, and Yudkowsky certainly dangled that to motivate fans to brainstorm like crazy, but did he? 

    As further testament to how I'm not simply abnormally hooked to Chinese webfic now to the extent it rotted away my ability to appreciate good or bad writing, the same author has another ongoing serial I started after the translation for 40MOC stopped, and while it's *good*, I can't give it the wholehearted 9.5/10 rating I give 40MOC.

  House Kolchis is falling into ruin. Following the death of their mother, the lady advocate of the house, Mydea needs to navigate the political landscape to ensure her house, and her family, don't fall apart until they can find a solution that saves them. 

  This reminds me of ASOIAF, though not as brutal (so far), and with more magic. It's well written and has great worldbuilding.

  It's a Star Wars SI, the writing's good (though there are some problems here and there, like the way the author describes ships), and the author does a good job of describing the Star Wars universe beyond Tatooine and Coruscant.

  A transmigration story where the MC awakens in the world of ‘Heroes of Berendar,’ an open-world RPG's and his favourite game. In his original life, the MC basically wrote the game's wiki. Now, as Argrave, the sickly bastard of the royal family, they need to go about preventing the "bad ending" of the story.

  The game is set in fantasy medieval Europe, and aside from magic snow elf vikings is about what you'd expect. It reminds me of *Memoirs of Your Local Small-time Villainess*, but the MC has more freedom and is more jokey than stern. The story and the characters are well-written. The plot centers around Argrave and his struggles, including him adapting to the world around him, but feature POVs from side characters that help flesh out the story.

      Ty for the recommendation. It's a vastly superior self insert to the above where they all have insanely detailed knowledge such that every chapter is a new Deus ex machina. 

      It's obscure enough lore with a few details that make it a genuinely interesting story. The relative OPness of the MC is problematic but it solves that by having bigger fishes in the sea.

    Sith has super fast progression (which i love)
    And jackal is just good overall with an op mc (because of his knowledge and how he uses it not stats).

    If anyone has more recs like these, especially ones like Sith which progress fast with lots of agency in our mc please do tell.

    I'm a huge fan of Jackal and Memoirs.  Jackal is just the right balance of knowledge/power and squishyness.

    What's up with the way Sith? describes ships (From someone who knows nothing about ships)
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      There is a [standard naming convention for ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_\(ships\)) that is the same in the SW universe (though not prefixes IIRC), so it just looks really odd to me when it's not followed.

      The author has a tendency to sometimes call ships by their class or some description instead of naming them, which is okay most of the time. Like, if it was an X-wing or TIE fighter or random Star Destroyer that would be fine, but personal ships are usually named, like the *Millenium Falcon*. 

      For instance, we're introduced to the MC's ship as "my personal Fury-Class Interceptor inside *The Old Republic* remakes," and from that point on it's always referred to  as "Fury" and I'm not sure if that's the name or not. Later we see the *Ebon Hawk*, 

      >“That’s the Ebon Hawk, I’m not sure the make, though it was originally a freighter,” I explained.

      which makes more sense, ships have names and this one is famous, but it isn't italicized. Like here:


      >Captain Relquan looked out over his beautiful ship, the Guardian, from his vantage point on the bridge. Everything was running smoothly on the massive v-shaped carrier. Nothing beat a Venator. Sure, those new victory-class ships brought more firepower to a fight

      Guardian should be in italics, as well as *Victory*-class (capital for classes as well).

      There are a lot more examples, and almost everytime it just strikes me as odd.

      I’m trying to get into Jackal but I really don’t understand the motivations of Elias. I’m around the point where he steals his father horse to stalk the MC across the country. His father seems to welcome of the idea that his son is at his side about to confront the king but then without a word he steals his horse and goes into stalker mode? You mean to tell me he became a full fledged wizard just as a byproduct of stalking the MC to make sure he doesn’t do any evil? Whatever happened to finding the cure for his sister? 

      He was about to confront an allied duke about some information and decided to even forgo it with a word that the MC is in town. 

      Even the other side characters seem to revolve their lives around the MC and I really wish they just had their own motivations.
      ```

      - u/lawthrowaway172:
        ```
        Now that you mention it, Elias sounds hilarious.  I didn't think much about it and chalked him up to that "Annoying enemy to friends archetype" like you see in cartoons and anime.  Like in trying to stop someone from doing bad things, they end up helping them.  

        But now that you pointed it out, it makes a lot less sense

  I've been having a good time reading [Heterogenous Linguistics.](https://mangadex.org/title/bd29a3d0-9551-45e3-b1ac-941214e535b5/heterogeneous-linguistics?page=2) The general summary is that a student linguist is on a research trip at the behest of his injured professor, to learn about the languages of the various monster species in the area. They're based on the classic JRPG species - slimes, lamias, werewolves, and so on - but they feel suitably alien in biology and culture for this to be more interesting than you might expect. I mean, I expected it to be interesting, because worldbuilding is my jam, but I might rec even outside of that sphere :D

  [Apocalypse: Quest System](https://www.amazon.com/Apocalypse-Quest-System-Systems-Book-ebook/dp/B09WJWWL3T), the fourth book in the Systems of the Apocalypse series, is out. The series has some weaknesses, but features an intelligent and mechanical protagonist who solves problems with some combination of innovation and negotiation.

  [TRON: Endgame Scenario](https://archiveofourown.org/series/46436), a cohesive attempt to bridge the gaps between the Tron films.

  It's been recommended here before (I think, I found it in my fanfics bookmark folder). I just started learning Python yesterday, and just started reading it today, and I had no idea I'd be so hooked. I didn't know I needed this in my life.

  As a "portal fantasy" it has a few things in common with Isekai fics, but the worlds are intimately tied together and affect each other.

  Has anyone encountered works with narrated scenes of speed chess?

  In general I'm always down for a good chess (or other game) scene, but the other day I had the thought that speed chess in particular would be particularly hard thing to narrate well, curious if anyone has tried.
  ```

  - u/Cosmogyre:
    ```
    The Wandering Inn has this I believe, along with normal chess as well. The main character is basically isekaied to another world, along with a bunch of other random people, and one of the byproducts is that chess is brought as well. The MC loves chess, so there's a fair bit of it in the story, although to be clear it's not the focus. Speed chess in particular appears later in the story I think?

    [Mother of Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40051/mother-of-magic) (Previously titled "Isekai Mother") has a fictional alternate chess game with a cool internal monologue from one of the players.

  ```
  Someone with a status analysis ability comes across a timelooper and decides to ally with them without telling them that they know. Other than that it's basically typical Korean fantasy isekai based on an mmo.

  Here are some book series I've enjoyed so far. Note these are like, published series, not webfics or webnovels, so the prose is pretty good and the writing has been edited.

  **The Tapestry Series - Henry H. Neff**Max McDaniels goes to a magical school, with the magic in question being Celtic myth flavored. The magical world is more globalized, with more obvious politics, and the MC focuses on combat as the world isn't neat and ordered. Really interesting for the development of the story, this is NOT Harry Potter and I would say the worldbuilding at least is a lot better than HP, as there are fewer of the annoying inconsistencies that vanilla HP has.

  **Pathfinder Series - Orson Scott Card**I've seen other OSC books recommended here, namely Ender's Game, but the Pathfinder Series is pretty good, especially the first book. The MC feels very similar to HPMOR!Harry, and the gradual understanding you build of how the world came to be is enjoyable. Centers around a boy with the ability to see the paths living things leave in time, who loses his father and must set out to find a sister he didn't know he had. The last book gets a little dry as it goes into his powers a little too much, but I'd recommend the first for sure.

  **The Queen's Thief Series - Megan Whalen Turner**Set in pre-industrial Greece?, the story describes a thief named Eugenides as he works to steal many things. The character of Eugenides is really well done, MWT uses a lot of side-characters who observe the thief from different angles, and show different facets of him. There's a lot of political intrigue, and various factions attempt to control Eugenides. In addition, war and moral problems are explored it a lot more detail, and many characters become friends but end up on opposing sides. Importantly, while the first two books star Eugenides, the next three books have different people watching or interacting with him from the side.

    Seconding The Tapestry as a preferable alternative to Harry Potter. I enjoyed it quite a bit when I was younger.
