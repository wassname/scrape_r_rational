## Optimization: Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn [spoilers for that series][D]

### Post:

I've seen the Mistborn book series recommended on this subreddit before, so perhaps this will lead to some interesting discussion. First, some background: Brandson Sanderson's Mistborn books are famous for having a set well-developed, logically consistent magic systems based around metals called Allomancy and Feruchemy.

http://coppermind.net/wiki/Feruchemy

[Spoilers for the first book of the Mistborn series](#s "At the end of the first book, we learn that the main villain, the Lord Ruler, has both of these powers, which allows him to perform a process called Compounding- basically breaking the system by letting him get more out of Feruchemy than he put into it. This made him incredibly powerful, giving him incredible superhuman strength, Wolverine levels of regeneration, etc.")

So, the question is- let's say you woke up one morning and had the powers of the Lord Ruler. We'll assume that atium is some metal that is obtainable in our world- perhaps platinum. How do you optimize your newfound powers?

  Assuming (non-plot) spoilers for all the *Mistborn* books including *Alloy of Law*, because if you haven't read those I have no idea what you're doing in this thread. I can't consult the *Ars Arcanum* from the back of *Alloy of Law* (which I lent out to a friend), so I guess the wiki will have to do.

  Step one, experiment with metals and try to work out a system to figure out which metals provide which benefits. Since new metals *are* discovered, that means that the knowledge of metals is incomplete, which means that I might find more of them with new abilities, such as those known at the time of *Alloy of Law* (if I didn't know those already).

  Compounding is straight busted. Compounded gold is the one that makes you nearly impervious to physical attack, so that's the one I start with. Rapid regeneration allows me to have a wide variety of metals implanted under my skin, which ensures that no one can easily take them away from me. Electrum stores determination, and compounding it means I have super-willpower to let me do anything I want. Zinc stores mental speed, which means that zinc compounding lets me think really, really fast (probably start with this one).

  Of the new metals, chromium allows you to store fortune, which means that compounded chromium lets you go recursive with luck - making yourself hundreds of times more lucky than anyone else. Nicrosil allows you to store Investure, which is basically the Cosmere's "source of all magic", and which I assume is going to play a big role in some future book - having access to a source of it is really important, though the details haven't been revealed (I'm pretty sure that this would allow me to be better at the metallic magics). Cadmium compounding would allow me to go without breathing; bendalloy compounding would allow me to go without eating. Duralumin compounding would allow me to quickly form relationships with people, probably to be used in conjunction with my emotional powers.

  **tl;dr**; So once that's all done, I'm eternally young, eternally healthy, have no need to eat, drink, or breath, I can form relationships with people nigh-instantly, I have ridiculous amounts of strength, speed, and endurance, I don't need to sleep, and I'm ridiculously lucky. I would really like to see what's left as a challenge to me.

    Compounding zinc jumped out at me when I read the appendix to *Alloy of Law*, yeah. Perhaps *Shadows of Self* will introduce someone with that power, or address it in some other way - though I'd assign a pretty high probability that if it shows up/is mentioned, Sanderson would explicitly try to shoot down its apparent brokenness.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      The Lord Ruler *should* have had that ability already since zinc is a base metal, but maybe he just wasn't acting rationally. I'd have to reread the series to see how much compounded zinc would have changed things.
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        He probably did - I recall he basically went a thousand years without any meaningful challenge, and then lost due to a *very* unlikely upset driven by Ruin.
        ```

        - u/ancientcampus:
          ```
          There's a very good reason why one might not compound zinc: dependency.

          In Alloy of Law, it mentions once you start compounding Gold (for health), you can't stop, or you'll die - possibly from the shock of nolonger having massively magically enhanced health. This is consistent with Well of Ascension's talk of Adepts, who have become dependent on burning their metal 24/7.

          If you're immortal, you lack many significant challenges in your life, and your only real life purpose is to live for 1000 years to renew the prison on an evil god, then repeat ad-nauseum... you probably wouldn't want to live all that in slow-motion.
          ```

    ```
    You're a physical  and mental god with a few superpowers on top of the standard set. What's left as a challenge?

  It's fairly easy to become an unstoppable fighter. The big problem is Ruin. He's going to get free eventually and then no amount of petty powers is going to win you this. What he needs to do is start invading other worlds and pick up a shard somewhere. Dominion perhaps, or Honor. He needs some method of mind control that Ruin can't intercept. 

  To really tap the mysteries of identity and joining other magics he needs feruchemists. He needs nicrominds to draw in power. I would start an extensive breeding program for feruchemists, isolated from all culture, and a breeding program for mistborn. I'd then find a way to send them out from world to world to explore. Once they find a world I'd start to conquer it.

  I just finished this series a few days ago, so this stuff is pretty fresh in my mind. I loved it, really well-written.

  One of the biggest obstacles is the lack of information on how Allomancy and Feruchemy function. There are a lot of questions, and some of them can be answered with simple research:

  - How much metal is required to perform a given function?
  - Are burning and flaring binary actions? Can you adjust how quickly a metal is burned to get partial effects?
  - If a metalmind is divided in half, or if two metalminds are affixed together, how is the storage affected?

  Other questions are more difficult to answer, or may never have an answer:

  - How does one measure the trait a metalmind stores?
  - What is the upper limit of storage for a given metalmind?
  - How does the purity of a metalmind effect its storage capacity?
  - What is the multiplier applied when compounding? How is it affected by flaring?

  Since I don't know the composition of allomantic alloys, I'd have to start by using the pure metals. Gold and zinc will be easy to come by, and will assist in my research. To ensure I can compound properly, I'll need to obtain a gold metalmind, preferably something I can embed in my body, and some gold flakes. I fill the flakes with health, swallow them, then burn them. The resulting extra health is then immediately channeled into the metalmind, ready to use whenever I need it.

  Money will be a big issue, since Allomancy consumes the metals involved. I'll need a steady supply. Revealing myself as a god is probably not the best idea, but I can use chromium to store up luck, then visit a casino or work the stock market. That will be the easiest way to make a lot of money without drawing too much attention.

  As soon as I have a steady supply of gold and platinum, I can pretty much live however I want. I'm immortal and invulnerable, and I have pewter and tin to make me totally untouchable. At this point, I can reveal myself to the world as a superhuman, and spend my free time flying through cities and stopping crime. I would also make it a priority to start a family, since my abilities can be passed to my children.

  /u/alexanderwales has a very good start that covers all of the basics.  To add a few more ideas:

  Find out what atium's other alloys are.  WoG states that there are more than 16 and less than 100, IIRC, so malatium (seeing someone else as if they had made a different choice in the past) isn't the only one.  Test them with both Allomancy and Feruchemy.

  ~~Immerse myself in liquid atium/platinum, assuming that I can heal faster than the molten metal can burn me.  This would hopefully duplicate the effects of the Well of Ascension, even though it is based on a different god.~~ This is a terrible idea.  Channeling pure "Preservation" seems safe, as far as godly powers go.  Channeling pure "Ruin" is almost certainly suicide.  

  Try to find Lerasium to create more Mistborn.  Since Atium exists, it might exist too.

  Have a lot of children.  Both Feruchemy and Allomancy can be passed on to children, so it seems worthwhile.

  If anyone here reads Alicornfic, she wrote [a sandbox](http://unprophesied-of-ages.dreamwidth.org/495.html?page=1&view=flat) involving the Lord Ruler. (The other half of the setting is from [this short story](http://alicorn.elcenia.com/stories/visitor.shtml), which she also wrote.)
