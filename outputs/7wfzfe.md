  Wow. Even though I called it that [](#s "Norman would be alive because anime logic.") I still managed to be surprised by this.

    I think it was the way it was presented.

    It was obvious he was alive, but, usually, we get a sudden appearance by the "dead" character, followed by a chapter or two of flashbacks.

    This sort of interlude chapter is not usual in manga, and managed to evoke a bigger reaction.

    Tl;dr I think it was medium awareness, and not the plot twist itself, that was surprising

  Well. That's horrible.
