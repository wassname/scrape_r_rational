## Artemis Fowl for adults?

### Post:

What I like most about these books is how Artemis managed to outmaneuver a whole society of supernatural beings, so basically I want to read about a genius protagonist that contact the supernatural for the first time and approach everything with science and rational thinking to survive or for personal gain.

* I have already read HPMOR.

  I think the Artemis Fowl series would be an _excellent_ target for a rationalist fanfictionalization for many of the same reasons you mention. It would be especially neat if the reverse-engineering supernatural technology plotline got explored in more detail.

  You might like Two Year Emperor, it's not *quite* the same, but it has some similar themes going on. (portal fantasy where he munchkins the rules to great effect)

  If you're ok with porn the Daniel Black series covers some of those points.

  Animorphs: The Reckoning on this sub

  You've read HPMOR, have you read Worm/Ward? They are very good, and typically enjoyed by the same type of person.
