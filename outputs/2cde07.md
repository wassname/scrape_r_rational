    Thank you, that really did get an out-loud laugh.

    Okay, that was amusing. 

    Still, you probably have to actually *know* the knowledge you're sacrificing. Probably?
    ```

    - u/Muskwalker:

      I think that raises the question of what it means to know it.

      To sacrifice the secret of a buried treasure's location, how precisely does one have to know it?  Can you just name a town, or a landmark, a distance in feet, or does it have to be coordinates, and if so to how many decimal places? 

      Likewise for a book - does just knowing that a book, or a certain chapter of it, contains secrets count?  Or do you have to have read the book?  Or do you have to have understood the book well enough to be tested on it, and if so, what's the required passing grade?

      ....

      Outside of that question, it does not appear that secrets require active knowledge.  Herrún's temple was destroyed, and the damage to her was not solely because of the knowledge of the people there, but also the records—many of which were presumably unread, at least not by anyone living. She also mentions pregnancies not yet known to anyone as a kind of secret.   

      ....

      Even outside of *that* question...

      > It has to be something that is actually a secret, and that benefits the person, either by staying a secret or by being revealed. [...] The person making the sacrifice will no longer remember it 

      Just *a* secret, not *your* secret.  So theoretically I could sacrifice someone else's secret that would benefit me by being revealed (say, a wax-sealed paper from HJPEV containing the secret of Patronus 2.0 [^(WHERE IS THIS LETTER NOW, BY THE WAY)](https://pay.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2cg3qa/on_the_disposition_of_a_characters_effects/).)

  That is a very secure Emergency Bunker Loki gave Jake. Antimagic and books that can block magic! Polymorph any object should get them the microscope they need. This is very significant!

    ```
    Yeah, I read that response as 'You have **really** impressed me with that one.' He gave basically the maximal help he could possibly give without getting into huge trouble.

    More than one microscope is probably needed, though.

  >Afi sacrificed his own secret

  BOOM!

  (Take each letter on the keyboard, then slide up to the number above it, following the diagonal.)

  Given it was 'in order of importance', and loki went on about how the first few books of microtext were all about god stuff, that should be a strong hint of what to worry about now.

  Also, book propped open inside room, microscope type effect outside, or possible at a mirror held outside the room...
  ```

- u/bbrazil:
  ```
  I'm surprised it took them this long to realise that Afi was trying to take over the ritual. Looking forward to the next chapter.

- u/MadScientist14159:

  Okay, this has been bugging me for a while now:

  Why hasn't Jake had his wizards summon other Smart People and D&D munchkins from his native plane?

  It seems like having Sir Poley and EY as advisors (not to mention some *actual* military strategists) would come in very handy.

  Hell, he could summon engineers to manufacture modern weaponry, sell them to merchants (who then have an infinite supply) and buy back enough to equip everyone in Flobovia.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Taking those in reverse order:

    * The merchants actually couldn't buy them because 'howizter' doesn't appear on any of the equipment lists, so it doesn't have a price.
    * There's no way I could write Sir Poley or EY believably, and I'm not going to try.  Out of universe: bringing in more and better strategists, Munchkins, etc would make the story boring and confusing.
    * Out of universe, see previous point.  In universe, the ritual is extremely difficult and can only be executed when the stars are correct, or something.  Yeah, let's go with that.
    ```

- u/clawclawbite:
  ```
  So, if alfi is sacrificing enough secrets to effect the ritual, what important secrets is he giving up? There are not a lot of trivial to the grad scheme of things secrets that undead are likely to consider a 'sacrifice'.
  ```

    ```
    > So, if alfi is sacrificing enough secrets to effect the ritual, what important secrets is he giving up?

    The pre-undead memories of each undead?
