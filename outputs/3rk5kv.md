## [Biweekly Challenge] Amnesia

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3pp3lw/biweekly_challenge_fables_and_legends/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Fables and Legends". /u/cthulhuraejepsen is the winner with their story ["The Bear and the Fox"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3pp3lw/biweekly_challenge_fables_and_legends/cw9o0kj), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/cthulhuraejepsen!

##### This Time

This time the challenge will be "Amnesia", or more generally, the loss of knowledge. This covers everything from self-editing of memories to antimemetics. It's up to you whether to go with retrograde or anterograde amensia (the latter seen in *Memento*), or if you want to go with something more in the realm of science fiction. If you want to write fanfic, franchises of opportunity include *Men in Black*, *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, the *Bourne* series, *Harry Potter*, *Artemis Fowl*, along with many, many others. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, November 18th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

  This is an idea I've had kicking around for a long time. May last year based on when I created the original text file, probably longer in the form of idle thoughts.

  Also an opportunity to put something on the embarassingly empty wordpress I created for a project that isn't likely to see the light of day.

  I wrote it from 11 PM to 9 AM, so I expect it's rife with errors. I'll do an editing pass after getting some sleep.
