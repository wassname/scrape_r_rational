## [D] Thoughts on Alien Noninterference Clauses

### Post:

So my gut instinct about Prime Directive-like laws is that they're terrible, but I wondered why. Lots of universes have justifications for them.

First two I thought of, off the top of my head:

**Marvel**

The Watchers are reluctant to give any advanced tech to less advanced species, but given how many fuckups Marvel universe people tend to have with their advanced tech/ powers, it seems somewhat justified.

**Star Trek**

The thing is, the Prime Directive's imperative for the Federation. Normally, there isn't just one justification for such important rules.

So... the most common justification is that aliens might adopt explorers' cultures. Does that seem likely? Given how many alien planets seem to have been influenced by human cultures in the Trekverse (the Nazi planet, for instance), this seems like a reasonable explanation, although doesn't explain why the assumption of Federation values is considered bad.

One other reason that seems less likely to be spoken about in-universe, though, is that the Federation is basically a democratic alliance. If, say, Klingon-like aliens in the Federation sets itself up as an uplifting group, it can influence the aliens it introduces to more Klingonesque values, and Klingonesque values now have more vote weight in the Federation (and we know that there are Federation aliens with different values, like the carnivores that consider all their prey sapient). So why would, say, humans have the right to uplift others?

And if you just contact an alien species to help them out and then leave, they are going to try to follow you to the stars, with all the cultural influence that implies.

Your thoughts? Any other universes with reasonable/unreasonable prime directives?

    I agree with everything you've got here, except to point out that you're assuming a one-world civilization on both sides.  Given enough worlds in each culture, it would be likely that a few would survive.  See the Bolo series for examples.

        Well, I figure if you've got 10,000 planets (or whatever number you regard as sufficient)  then the chances are pretty high that at least one of them would manage to shield against / divert / destroy the inbound WMD(s).  Any single planet with a self-sustaining population base will be sufficient for a race to repopulate itself.

          Notably the Federation only had about 150 worlds. That's going to sharply limit their ability to absorb damage. Plus a limited number have large shipyards which are necessary to resist invasion from other alien empires.

          Perhaps as size increases an empire would be more willing to interfere?

  The prime directive is a fictional reaction to real world colonialism. When it was written, Roddenberry was probably thinking of how the major powers of Europe had royally fucked up Africa and the Americas. If you had posited a show then (or even now) where the technologically advanced society came in and enacted extensive change on a different, less technologically advanced society, it would probably be read in a historical (or even modern) context, where you were taking about British colonists coming to the New World.

  It's very easy to say "Oh, well they weren't as smart as us" or some other such thing, but you can see where that sounds like the sort of thing you can't really trust yourself on.

    A lot of the damage that the Europeans caused was intentional, as a result of mercantilist policies. Look at opium in China and the divide and conquer strategies and destruction of the textile industry in India. A lot of other damage done by the Europeans was just because of neglect. For the most part, they weren't even trying to improve the livelihood of other countries. Obviously you shouldn't let your civilization's corporations to get anywhere near a less-advanced species (how you would enforce that, even with a prime directive, is another issue). There'd still be a huge risk when getting involved with a less-advanced species but I think it'd be worth it if you could prevent many generations from dying, suffering from disease, etc.

      I generally agree that the Prime Directive is not a great idea - I would prefer an established set of procedures for first contact and a detailed set of rules that govern how to deal with a primitive culture in an appropriate way. The amount of caution that Star Fleet (and some other fictional organizations) show is a little bit of cultural skittishness which has historical foundations, and I think they go too far in their caution.

        I agree, it does seem like a reaction to colonialism. I'm surprised the sentiment is so strong even centuries from the present day, but I think that might have more to do with the writer using current values in their world building rather than considering what might be realistic in the future.

      I don't know, the White Man's Burden was definitely a thing as far as motives went.

      If you had the stated goals of colonialism as making money at the cost of conquered peoples, people would... disagree with policies.

      The best example of intentionally damaging European policy is actually the Dutch in the Congo, I think.

    Huh, didn't think of that.

  The Culture in the eponymous series of novels by Iain Banks appear to be A/B testing noninterference clauses. Sometimes they make contact, and sometimes they don't.

  Does this happen in any other stories?

  The Watchrs are wise to not share their technology, if only because any attempt to mess with the status quo in the Marvel universe will result in the universe itself screwing everyone over.

  As for the Prime Directive...it has its use, but too often verges into dogma. SF Debris said most of what there is to say: http://blip.tv/sf-debris-opinionated-reviews/prime-directive-analysis-5638650

      Pact is like this, though I gather from your flair that you may already be reading it. The universe is very resistant to changes to the status quo, and if one faction starts to get too much power, especially if it's a quick rise, the universe steps in and kicks them down a few notches, and this seems to be a well-known thing.

  I've often wondered about that and I've been meaning to look for a specialist's opinion on this subject. While it's prevalence in fiction might be a reaction to colonialism, there are also several real life examples of uncontacted peoples, living in South America, India and New Guinea, and several groups that defend these people should be left alone.  Like the  OP, my gut  instinct has always been that these people would have much to gain from contact  with a civilization that's  careful not to  infect them  with viruses they've never gained immunity to and that doesn't attempt to impose on their culture, but like I said, I've yet to look for good arguments on either side of the issue.

  well there is also "the road not taken" explanation. advanced race does not contact others so as to not taint their technological and cultural output. think it on terms like heirloom crops, sure commercial crops yield more food reliably and cheaply but people still value weird unusual fruits and vegetables because they're unique and something you don't see often. I can easily picture elder races monitoring younger sapients and saying "you know that communism thing seems like a neat idea!" or "hey they developed a global network BEFORE reliable atomic power! :D"
