## [HSF][RT][D] The Martian by Andy Weir. An amazing novel that's been plugged before, but barely discussed.

### Post:

First, a quick blurb. Mark Watney was the 18th person on Mars, the sixth crew member of the third Ares mission by NASA to explore the red planet. Six Sols into the thirty Sol mission, an unexpected storm forces the crew to abandon the surface. Mark was left behind, and he is now the first person to be on a world by himself.

I recently re-listened to The Martian in audiobook, and was amazingly surprised to see that Audible uploaded a revised edition. They corrected the Narrator's pronunciation of ASCII (He originally pronounced it Ay-Ess-See-Two. Epic Facepalm), as well as a revised version of the ending which, IMO, is much better than the original. Supposedly other miscellaneous errors in pronunciation, mathematics, and science were included.

I have a few discussion questions I'd like to pose to the groupmind, and I hope others would like to offer their own questions.

Firstly, did Mark forget anything major that could've improved his situation, which he could be reasonably expected to know?

Secondly, at one point, he reestablishes contact with NASA. They instruct him to lay out rocks in Morse Code if their communication channel fails. I always saw that as rather one-sided, especially considering they already had him on camera with every satellite they could. Besides obvious messages, there's few things that he could tell them to improve his odds of success. They discarded the possibility of broadcasting radio directly to him (main dish on the habitat broken, satellites too weak to broadcast to an antenna), but what about alternate forms of communication? What alternatives to radio could they have explored to try and bridge the gap?

Thirdly, the tragedy the Chinese Space Agency suffered hurt me far more than feels rational. I understand that the entire point of it was that sacrifices had to be made, but why didn't the CSA push for NASA to *build* the replacement, instead of simply paying the cost of the rocket to bureaucrats who would just pocket the money?

  Seconding this recommendation. Someone mentioned it here a while ago and convinced me to read it, and it was excellent.

  What was the change to the ending that you mentioned? I have no idea which version I had
  ```

    ```
    [Minor Spoiler](#s "The old version ends with Mark having a boring day. The new one ends with him on the happiest day of his life.")

    [Major Spoiler \*Salute\* Major Spoiler](#s "The change is set right after Mark being welcomed back aboard Ares. In the original version, it jumps forward to him back on earth, where a kid asks if he wants to go back to Mars. He snaps back 'Are you out of your fucking mind?!'. in the new version, it's a much nicer cathartic analysis of how much time, money, and effort had been put into saving him, and why everyone had thought it was worth it.")

      I wish the version I've read had the old ending then. :(

        I dug up an old copy of the self-published version, which explicitly allows non-profit redistribution. Here's the part that was cut from the hardcover version, and from the remastered audiobook.

        [SPOILERS. DUH. Click source to make reading easier.](#s "Watney finished his two slices of pizza and a coke. He had another half-hour to kill before going back to Johnson Space Center. Leaving the pizzeria, he sat on a public bench just outside. 
        Next week would be busy. He would be meeting the Ares-6 Engineer. He had read her file, but had never met her in person. He wouldn't get much time to relax after that. The following six weeks would be filled with constant training as he tried to impart as much knowledge as he could. 
        But that was something to worry about later. Right now, he took a deep breath of the fresh air and watched the people go by.
        “Hey, I know you!” Came a voice from behind.
        A young boy had strayed from his mother. “You're Mark Watney!”
        “Sweetie,” the boy's mom said, embarrassed. “Don't bother people like that.”
        “It's ok,” Watney shrugged.
        “You went to Mars!” The boy said, his eyes wide with awe.
        “Sure did,” Watney said. “Almost didn't make it back.”
        “I know!” Said the boy. “That was awesome!”
        “Sweetie!” The mom scolded. “That's rude.”
        “So Mr. Watney,” the boy said, “If you could go to Mars again, like, if there was another mission and they wanted you to go, would you go?”
        Watney scowled at him. “You out of your fucking mind?”
        “Ok time to go,” the mom said, quickly herding the boy away. They receded in to the crowded sidewalk.
        Watney snorted in their direction. Then he closed his eyes and felt the sun on his face. It was a nice, boring afternoon.")

  It really is an excellent read. Originally an Internet serial, now a novel (and apparently a movie is on the way).
  ```

    Yup, the movie is scheduled to come out in november, and I'm cautiously optimistic. It feels like it won't be very faithful to the source though, considering the main character's being played by Matt Damon. Hardly the first choice for a botanist-engineer with a wonderful sense of self-deprecating humor.

    Between his sense of humor, creativity, determination in the face of pure diablos ex machina, and the scientific accuracy across the fields covered in the book, I fear that the movie will fail to convincingly capture one or more of the core elements that made the book a masterpiece.

      Definitely worried they'll skip a lot of the technical complications/wizardry to make it easier to understand.

        *Contact* comes to mind. Who the fuck decided to rip out the entire explanation of the message encoding and replace it with a shitty, nonsensical 20 second 3d animation?

  For the puzzle of "Give NASA a backup way to communicate with Watney", let's make a few assumptions. Radio is totally a lost cause. the strongest receiver antenna he could make simply couldn't hear the strongest transmitter in orbit. The only ship between Earth and Mars is the Ares ship.

  How powerful would a visible light laser need to be to cross 18 light seconds and still be visible to the naked eye? A simple satellite in orbit around Earth might be easier, but I'm not an optical engineer, I don't know the right equations to calculate the strength needed to make Earth visibly change in brightness from mars.

  My other idea was to use the Ares and the manuevering jets to slowly turn a dark/light side towards Mars. Considering how heavy Ares was, this plan would likely have a very small data cap.

  But really, those solutions are extremely silly, when I have one that requires foresight, but would offer the most bits available to communicate to Mark. There are Satellites in orbit around Mars. Some of these would be visible to Mark. When in high bandwidth mode, the entire orbital situation should've been uploaded to Mark's computer, and kept updated. If high bandwidth is lost, the satellites visible to the naked eye are logged and watched. If Mark wants information from NASA, he writes out in rocks his question, and the designation of two satellites visible the next night, marking one as yes, the other as no. NASA then moves the right satellite so it's no longer on a course in sync with the record. With this, he reliably has as many bits of data possible.

  That could've made the later half more interesting, knowing he could literally and accurately divined the sky like the Nazca lines. It would've been intersting to see how he'd spend, say, 7 last bits of data (or more accurately, 7 bit flips. If the question was simple and low-risk, he could ask the same question every night, and have the system return 0 (no change) instead, like "Do I need to pack up and move ASAP?"

    I have not read the book, but changing satellite orbits or shifting space vessels around takes fuel, and if this book is realistic to current propulsion methods, fuel really isn't there to be wasted.  If they are using remote fuel methods, there might be fuel available, but we haven't started using remote fuel methods outside Earth orbit yet.
    ```

    - u/TildeAleph:
      ```
      True, changing orbits would be unrealistic, but changing the satellites attitude so that solar arrays did or did not reflect sunlight at Mark is possible. He most certainly would have a very sensitive camera and telephoto lens that he use to check the apparent brightness of the sats.

      I actually think is could be a pretty reasonable back up communication method.
      ```

    - u/Prezombie:
      ```
      Yeah, it does take fuel, but it's an extension of actions they already took. Mark was literally NASA's top priority, and they modified the orbit of multiple satellites to have multiple pictures of his base every hour.
      ```

  I will N(st|nd|rd|th) the recommendation on this.  One of the best books I've read this decade.

  Did anyone else feel like the interior life of the character was about as spartan as his surroundings? The people I've discussed this book with felt like by the end it turned into good thing, good thing, bad thing.

  Because the Chinese politicians don't care about the science, they care about the national pride and prestige associated with completing the mission. Having NASA do the mission instead is entirely antithetical to those goals.
