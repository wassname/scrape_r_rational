  Team Seven is *absurdly* overpowered.

  I love it.

    You want absurdly overpowered?  Here's what they need to learn: [Chakra Transfer Technique](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Chakra_Transfer_Technique). In canon, Naruto was able to mold chakra into the recipient's elemental nature for their convenience. It's also possible to pass on nature chakra, so Hinata doesn't have to bother learning Sage Mode. 

    If they learned that and Naruto expanded his water clone facility, all three of them would have infinite chakra and infinite numbers of clones. And all those clones have a Byakugan and a Sharingan.

    I don't know if Hinata knows the Kaiten, but if so there's no reason not to teach it to the boys. 

    Re chapter: Sasuke's threat to destroy the family name was a Crowning Moment of Awesome. Hardcore and a little sad, but awesome.

      Didn't Naruto already learn Chakra Transfer from Kabuto? I thought that was how he made his Sage Mode work?
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Did he? When?

        He learned to do Sage mode by being one with the universe. He gets the chakra because it naturally overflows from his water clones, but that's not a direct transfer, just a function of how clones work.
        ```

        - u/fortycakes:
          ```
          "His first idea was to generate a clone and put it in his “sage mode,” then to use that chakra-transferral technique he and Sasuke had learned from Kabuto. After finding a way to rest one body’s arm on the flesh of the other without the touch being too distracting he was able to feel the flow coming through a little, even while wiggling the finger of his other hand. That was a proof of concept, at least, but Jiraiya probably wasn’t carting around a limp shadow clone on his back every time he fought, so there were probably better options to be found."  
          In Chapter 16.

      ---
      >This technique was originally created by [Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki](https://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Hagoromo_%C5%8Ctsutsuki) in order to "connect" the spiritual energies of every living person. His intention was for it to be used to build and maintain peace through his religion of [ninshū](https://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Ninsh%C5%AB), but this technique ended up becoming another tool for war when humanity weaponised chakra. This technique is used by many shinobi, each one of them has shown to use technique in different ways. Once, the user transfers its chakra, he/she is able to manipulate that chakra remotely.

  I loved the way you handled Sasuke's meeting with Itachi :) Itachi's reasoning and justifications always rang hollow to me even in canon.
  ```

- u/scruiser:
  ```
  Kudos to /u/kaukamieli for guessing that the sharkguy (Kisame Hoshigaki for those wondering) would show up.  Nice munchking to see him to die to a syrup technique. Did you introduce the syrup technique with that scene in mind, or simply pick a high utility technique that Naruto would go for and then come up with the usage when you got to the scene?

  I was worrying that Sasuke was killed and Itachi was using an illusion technique on Naruto, until I remembered the countless backups clones spanming Byakugan.

  Well, they are pretty well min-maxed now, but I guess it will still be interesting given that they will be up against a min-maxed Rinnegan user.

  So many fucking powerups

    I know, isn't it *awesome?* :D

  I'm not really sure about this, but isn't ems+senju blood = rinnegan? That should allow Naruto to use the magic donut.
  ```

  - u/Jace_MacLeod:
    ```
    According to canon, yeah. Although there is some mystical mumbo-jumbo about needing to be possessed by ancient brother spirits that merge into the Sage of the Six Path's chakra, or something. As if Naruto needed to be even *more* overpowered. (Answer: He does. :D)
    ```

- u/traverseda:
  ```
  >Shit—maybe I should have tried putting one of mine into Itachi while he was still alive, just to see if the eyes would keep their upgrade once I took them back out.”

  ...right. Thank god we live in a proper reductionist universe, can you imagine if physics actually cared about that kind of thing?
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Honestly I find the extra water more worrying - most detail you can handwave with nanosomething, but *1.4 billion cubic kilometers of water* has to come from somewhere.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Comet mining? Water isn't actually all that hard to come by if you've got cheap space travel.
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        You've still got delivery issues - getting it to the surface in a reasonable timeframe might not leave a Tibetan plateau at all, from the impact and instant erosion.  Comets also aren't *that* big - typically ~80 km^3 of ice, so you'd need tens of millions of them, minimum.

        That comets are *still the most reasonable explanation* is scary.
        ```

          ```
          My first thought was a water-clone factory left on automatic, with one drone doing a non-stop water generation.

    Eh, doesn't seem implausible even in our universe. The mangekyo transformation seems like the kind of thing that would cause the a burst of chakra, which, like radiotheraphy, might effectively "sterilize" and then "cauterize" the eye, killing any of the host's immune cells inside it and then preventing any more from entering. The eye would, thus, be incredibly vulnerable to infection, which could lead to complications like retinal detachment or cataracts.

    But if the eye were to be transplanted to a host whose DNA was similar enough to *not* reject it as foreign tissue, then the surgical site would create an entrance for the new host's immune cells to enter the eyeball and protect it from then on. Sort of as if the eye had bones which got a bone-marrow transplant.

    This does bring up an obvious issue if we try to apply our world's medical science to the world of Naruto: why didn't Kakashi, or anyone else, experience organ rejection and auto-immune problems upon taking some random eye and sticking it into their body? Can *regular* eyes also be easily given to random strangers in the Narutoverse?
    ```

    - u/Schpwuette:
      ```
      Just to show that it *can* be explained away: after permeating the eye with their own chakra, their body accepts it.
      ```

- u/Shadawn:
  ```
  I remember theorethizing about Narutoverse and their transplantable eyes. My conclusion was that they weren't in any way usual eyes, but special simbiontes. This explained the apparent ease of transplantation. Also, with no way to replace one of your eyes, Hinata-style sacrifice would be much less pleasant to do (in Wavesverse I can see "eye donation" becoming mainstream unless Naruto actually fixes everything).

  Also, this fic is awesome.
  ```

- u/mns2:
  ```
  For a second I thought Itachi would ambush Naruto after tricking him into vulnerability.
  ```

  - u/derefr:
    ```
    Totally; Sasuke sitting on Itachi telling Naruto to get ready for an eye transplant is exactly the sort of thing a rational Itachi would project with the Mangekyo if he knew Naruto needed to drop his shadow clones to be vulnerable.

    Heck, for that matter, I just realized that I don't think we've seen a *single* use of genjutsu so far this whole fic. You'd think Naruto would love the idea of the battle tactics genjutsu use opens up—if not for himself (with his poor chakra control) then at least for Hinata.
    ```

    - u/i_dont_know:
      ```
      Can't the byagugan see through genjutsu?
      ```

      - u/rumblestiltsken:
        ```
        Never actually proven against tsukiyomi in canon. Open question.

  A Byakugō to go with the Byakugan
