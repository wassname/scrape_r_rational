  Whew. Longest chapter I've ever written, by a lot, and ties together some subplots from way back.  Enjoy!

    Wow

  I really enjoyed this chapter. The depth of design in the main cast always made other supers seem like second-stringers; but between the "Sparring Match" mini-arc and this chapter, I feel like they're all equally deep with their own unique powers and circumstances.

    Thanks! I'm glad that came through. The toughest part of the last two chapters has been the amount of material I've had to leave out or cut while muttering "Yeah, this is cool, but it doesn't belong *here*."  But I left hints and kept all the notes--there will be stories involving Osk's secret life, the Death of Hrothgar, the Tricksters banishment, the origin of the Lost Years, and even what the biogestalt assistant navigator of the *Primly Certain* did on her shore leave--just not necessarily in the ramp up to the climax of The Maker's Ark. 8-)
