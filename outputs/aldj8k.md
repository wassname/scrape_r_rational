## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

    Without a working theory of quantum gravity, it's up to you! 

    In my pretty much layman opinion, two situations might be reasonable (disagreement's/calling me out on bullshit welcome! I don't know any QFT):

    * The Graviton exists and behaves similarly to known particles; Gravity is propagated by some elementary particle so the relative sizes and position of the planets to the portal affect the 'gravity flux' traveling through it and where on each side those particles hit. 

    *  Gravity is the bending of the local spacetime in the literal sense. If the portal doesn't work on a similar principle (pure magic) then no gravitational effect is passed through the portal.
    ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    At a guess if your portal allows gravity waves to propagate through it, the portal would act as a point mass at the portal's location (destination, or at each destination if 2-way travel is allowed). Afaik no theory allows for them to bend or distort so your portal's properties would matter. 

    If the portal only allows entry from one direction (it faces west, trying to enter from the East won't work even for something that can phase through matter) then only the matter on the proper side of the portal exerts a gravitational pull through the portal.

    If it's a touch this nexus type of portal then it might translate all relevant forces or none of them, depending on what counts as a touch and how it knows what counts as the entity touching it.

     There's no rule that a fictional portal must interact with every kind of phenomenon. Maybe portals transfer mass, momentum, and the strong and weak forces but not em fields nor other space-time effects.

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    As GM, if the portals are supposed to respect spacetime, I would rule that in the portal you would feel half of each planet's pull, and in general at each point you would feel that part of each planet's pull which the portal does/doesn't take [as a fraction of your three-dimensional field of all-around vision](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle).

    So a planet-sized portal that makes two planets appear to be adjacent in space would make them crash. And a portal connecting ground-level doors on Earth would have no gravitational effect at all.

  Does anybody know much about geology and tectonic plates?

  I'm working on a story in which a certain magic can be applied to any "rock". I haven't quite specified which materials count as rock, nor have I specified exactly what the difference is between "one rock" and "two rocks very close together" (although I have some characters who would be very interested in these questions).

  So, tectonic plates. My understanding is that a tectonic plate is basically "a really big rock", and therefore, this magic should be applicable to any tectonic plate in the Earth's crust. But... I'm not actually entirely sure what a tectonic plate is? Like, is it actually one rock, or is it a bunch of rocks packed together? Wikipedia mostly just says that a plate is made of "oceanic crust" or "continental crust", and continental crust is "the layer of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rocks that forms the continents". But if it's a bunch of rocks, how does the plate move as a single entity, and what separates it from the other plates it's adjacent to? Do these questions even make sense? Is the pressure underground so high compared to things I encounter in my everyday life that I can't even comprehend what's going on?

    I forwarded your questions to a geologist friend of mine. Their reply:

    >A tectonic plate is a \[nerd nerd nerd nerd\] mafic \[nerd\] back-arc basins \[nerd nerd\] differing minerologies \[nerd\] physical forces of the material underlying it.  
    >  
    >*(Anakiri: So the short answer would be, "Yes, a tectonic plate is a single big continuous rock"?)*  
    >  
    >Yes.

    And here is the long answer:

    >A tectonic plate is a large section of the Earth's crust and has two varieties, oceanic and continental. Oceanic plates are usually thicker and denser, usually very iron-magnesium rich (called mafic) with a veneer of sandstones and limestones deposited from sand washed into the oceans and the shells of tiny plankton falling to the seafloor when they die. Continental crust, however, are usually lighter and more felsic (containing feldspars and lighter volcanics), and will typically ride over an oceanic plate when they make contact. These margins are known as subduction zones, and the denser oceanic plate will push under the lighter continental plate. This leads to volcanism near these zones, with examples being the Pacific Northwest, Aleutian Island Chain, and back-arc basins like the Japanese islands. At these subduction zones, a lot of minerals are altered from the immense heat and pressure of these plates riding over one another that most igneous and sedimentary rocks are reworked into metamorphic rocks, which have very different physical and chemical properties versus their parent rock.  
    >  
    >The plates are typically moved by upwellings in the Earth's mantle which acts like heat diffusing within a boiling pot of water. Rifting centers are where a plate breaks apart and spreads in two or more directions away from a common point, while subduction zones are where plates meet and one gets pushed under another. Think of these margins like the stitches in a baseball. Also it's key to think of the molten rock in the Earth's mantle as a boiling pot of liquid far deeper than the crust, which is just a thin shell around the Earth by comparison. The crust floats over this liquid rock like ice floats over a lake or river. The upwelling of hotter material circulating around the mantle pushes these plates around and causes them to bump into each other, rotate, and collide. Since the Earth's crust is pretty much all encompassing, like the shell of an egg, there's very little room for these plates to actually move against one another, hence Earthquakes at these margins.

    >*(Anakiri: Sure. But I think an answer like that might be a bit technical for someone asking "Is a tectonic plate a rock?" They also say that they've read the Wikipedia article enough to know that those two different kinds of crust exist, so you might just be elaborating on distinctions that they have already said aren't meaningful to them.)*

    >I used to teach this, shh.  
    >  
    >*(Anakiri: What is the actual physical distinction between different tectonic plates? Why are plates created along defined rifting centers, rather than expanding from just anywhere the mantle boils up?)*  
    >  
    >Plates formed and solidified as accretionary structures around a much older craton, and grew outward as they hardened, ultimately meeting each other as the full surface hardened. This happened very early in Earth's history. These plates, over time, do migrate, come together, and break apart again. We've had a number of supercontinents form and break apart in our distant past.  
    >  
    >*(Anakiri: Sure, but what determines that this patch of crust is a part of THIS tectonic plate, and this patch of crust is a part of THAT tectonic plate? If you look down through a cross section of a subduction zone, you would see all the many layers of rock of the top plate, then all the many layers of rock of the bottom plate, right? How would you locally tell the difference between "these two layers of rock are part of the same plate" and "these two layers of rock are part of two different plates"?)*  
    >  
    >To use a smartass answer when I don't 100% know, the plates could be defined by results of seismic testing and differing mineralogies unique to the rocks of each plate. I'm not 100% certain on any of that though. But these plates are usually assumed to be the natural continuation of the crust from the continent until it drops off at the submerged continental margin a good ways offshore.  
    >  
    >*(Anakiri: But if you do those tests, then you would find that there's a pretty sharp distinction, where one layer of rocks is getting shoved one way on the bottom of the continental crust, and the layer of rock right beneath that is getting shoved the other way on the top of the oceanic crust. How come? If the layers within a tectonic plate can pull each other, why don't the layers between tectonic plates pull each other, and give you some kind of fluid mess of transitional material? Or do you actually get that?)*  
    >  
    >You get that at rifting centers, such as the mid oceanic ridges and the Great Rift Valley in Africa. So yes, the plates do, in places, tear apart. But this isn't uniform.  
    >  
    >*(Anakiri: I'm not asking about plates breaking part into multiple plates. I'm asking what the difference is between "two layers of rock separated by a fissure" and "two layers of rock NOT separated by a fissure". What is the mechanical property that holds plates together, and why doesn't that property hold at plate boundaries?)*  
    >  
    >Physical force of the material underlying it. These rifts are like tears in a sheet of paper or fabric. It takes some force to tear it apart, while the properties of both halves may not be much different from one another.

      haha, thanks a lot. I really appreciate you anticipating my follow-up questions. I think "What is the mechanical property that holds plates together, and why doesn't that property hold at plate boundaries?" was an especially good way of putting it.
