  Lichdom has one major inherent flaw: 'evil' is a prerequisite, as are caster levels.

  These, essentially, are the components for the 'Summon Murder-Hobos' spell.
  ```

  - u/FeepingCreature:
    ```
    Can't you just Wish the king evil and back? Can you set up the wishes in advance, so that the temporarily-evil king cannot prevent his regoodization?

    Chaotic Evil favors self-interest, and what would be more self-interested than immortality?
    ```

    ```
    there were options in libris mortis for neutral or good liches. even if there is no option for that in the process the necromancers know, a simple helm of opposite alignment aplied shortly after lichification solves that
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      Is it possible to apply the helm before lichification and then remove it, or do you have to naturally be Evil in order to become a lich?
      ```

      - u/puesyomero:
        ```
        I've always understood that the vanilla lich became evil due to the horrible things done in pursuit of immortality (non-issue here due to help from friendly necromancers) or due to massive influx of negative plane energy, then if the moral component of the alignment defaults to 'evil' the solution would be for ministers/family/assistants present on the ritual to use the helm or any handy alignment changing magic before releasing or waking their new undead king. (did this on a campaign to the BBEG's minions and it looked like a zombie movie in reverse. all the enemies that fell to us returned as part of our horde :D )
        ```

      - u/Lord_Drol:
        ```
        A helm of opposite alignment is *permanent*, and triggered by its donning. That is to say, removing it doesn't do a thing. The magic has its effect the second the helm touches your head, and lasts indefinitely.

        Furthermore:

        > The curse only works once; that is, a character whose alignment has been changed cannot change it again by donning the helmet a second time.

        So, changing back isn't so trivial. But:

        > Only a wish or a miracle can restore former alignment, and the affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. (In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible.) If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an atonement spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated.

        So there is a way to transform the victim back to his or her former alignment, but it needs some seriously heavyweight magic. It's possible, but far from easy.

    Luckily Necropolitans have no LA, no alignment requirements, and no prerequisites other than the XP and gold cost. They're pretty much made for PCs who want to be Undead.

      Interestingly, they are also the only absolutely final-by-RAW form of death in D&D.  To do the ritual the person has to lose a level and then pay 1,000 XP. If they lose the level but can't  pay the XP then they die, turn to dust, and "can't be resurrected **by any means**." [emphasis added]

      That even includes divine intervention.
      ```

- u/codahighland:
  ```
  Remember that resurrection is a voluntary process on the part of the deceased. An opposing king is a waste of a diamond, as said king would PROBABLY rather let his crown prince succeed him than to let himself be captured â€” especially if HIS OWN clerics have schemes of their own to get him resurrected.
  ```

- u/Uncaffeinated:
  ```
  I'm a bit confused about which edition this is based on. Is there any version of D&D where Raise Dead and Ressurection don't result in level loss? That'd put a big damper on the whole constant Resurrection thing.

  Sure True Resurrection doesn't lead to level loss, but she never mentions that and it's a 9th level spell, by which point the game is irreparably broken anyway.

  Also, in the coup scenario, they'd probably just kill the king in a way that prevents easy resurrection. That's not hard to do.

  Of course in 3.5, magic is so insanely overpowered that the only reasonable form of government is a magocracy.
  ```

  - u/codahighland:
    ```
    > don't result in level loss

    This was addressed obliquely:

    > The King, his soul returned, lies in his post-battle glow for up to a week recovering from being hacked to pieces by the opposing army.

    In other words, yeah, it does result in level loss, because he has to recover, but on the assumption that he's carrying out kingly duties -- and considering that he just technically survived an encounter that was difficult enough to kill him -- he's got enough XP coming in to address that.

    > Also, in the coup scenario, they'd probably just kill the king in a way that prevents easy resurrection. That's not hard to do.

    Disintegrate's fun.

  Girlgenius (www.girlgeniusonline.com) has a mad-science steampunk setting  where mad science runs in bloodlines, and to ensure that all the power-crazed Sparks get a shot at being leader they have a rule. 

  Dying and getting resurrected comes with the prize of loosing the right to the throne. Of course this leads to all sorts of shennanigans were people try to hide that they were once dead...
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Also, you don't have to worry about little rules like that when you're an unkillable monstrosity commanding an army of minions, with a few war-machines and death rays for good measure.
