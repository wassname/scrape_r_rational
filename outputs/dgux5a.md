  When we last left Moonrise, our heroes had succeeded in growing their first harvest of potatoes, reverse engineering an AC generator by studying the sample Nightmare Moon and Iron Quill took from Vanaheimr, and inventing the light bulb. On the shipping front, the Sylvan/Cozen and Quill/Penumbra unions both bore fruit; the latter most unexpectedly.

  This new chapter takes place after a timeskip, and it looks like we will be following the 2nd generation of lunar colonist from now on; the first generation of ponies born on the moon. Iron Quill is gone, but his bloodline persists through his daughter, Faithful Gale. Meanwhile, Arclight seems to be the son of Sylvan Shade and Cozen. I'm glad the leadership and engineering/scientist genes are getting passed on; Moonrise will surely need both if it is to survive its thousand year journey into the present.

    The time jump was really sudden. Not even an interlude between the two generations.
