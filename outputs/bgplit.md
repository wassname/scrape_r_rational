## [META] Hey all, new to rational fic, care to give me some recommendations?

### Post:

I already have _Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality_ and _Pokemon: The Origin of Species_ bookmarked and have read about 1/4 through each and LOVING IT.

I never got into Worm, Firefly, or MadokaMagica _(three series that caught my eye when browsing random recommended works on the main page here and the TvTropes page)_, but would like to read them anyway IF they don't require a working knowledge of the series to enjoy them.

I mean, I have a passing familiarity with their basic points (Worm is a dark super-powers story of some sort, Firefly is space-faring sci-fi...I think, and Madoka Magica is an anime about magical girls who find out that magic isn't all that it's cracked up to be), but not a whole lot beyond that.

### Comments:

  ```
  *The Metropolitan Man* is a really good one, and all you need is a passing familiarity with the Superman canon (cultural osmosis alone should have provided that unless you live under a rock). *Friendship is Optimal* is great too, and all you need to know is that My Little Pony features ponies (bonus if you can appreciate the ironic contrast between the sugary aesthetic and... all that happens in the story). I read and appreciated *Luminosity* and *Radiance* without ever finishing a single Twilight book or movie. *A bluer shade of white* needs you to have watched a Frozen, but itâ€™s just a single movie.
  ```

  - u/FordEngineerman:
    ```
    I basically think that Metropolitan Man should be our main ambassadorial story. It's probably the best combination of excellent and digestible among rational works.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Yeah, it's just, like... a really good Superman novel. It's the right length to not be intimidating - fanfictions like HPMOR tend to lean on the 'would actually dwarf War and Peace if printed out' side. It's driven by cleverness and rationality while also being easy to read and without getting slowed down by digressions or author insert speeches. And its core theme is a genuine moral dilemma. It's got in many ways the same appeal as something as Death Note or Breaking Bad, where we follow a villain protagonist morbidly fascinated by their actions, however morally wrong, because we get to see into their heads and understand their motives. And also because evil geniuses, as a rule, are always a blast to watch do their thing.

  [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/summary/), [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning), and [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) are some of the most popular stories around here, for starters.

  I don't understand what you mean by this.

    ```
    _A Practical Guide to Evil_ is looking pretty great, but it's a BIG story, is there any way I can download it to read offline? 

    In fact, they're ALL huge, but at least Worth the Candle is from AO3 and has an easy downloadable format.  Don't know about Mother of Learning, since I've never used FictionPress before (looks an awful lot like FF.net, though, maybe it works the same way?)

      - u/Robert_Barlow:
        ```
        Royal Road somehow is a worse website than fictionpress to read original stories on. The only reason to recommend it is for the original stories that are *only* on that platform.
        ```

  - u/Random-Rambling:
    ```
    Sorry, maybe I should have clarified.   

    By "working knowledge", I mean that I have read/watched the series in question to a significant extent _(if not the entire series)_ and that I am well-acquainted with not just the protagonist(s) and basic plot synopsis, but with several side-characters and major story events.
    ```

    - u/thebishop8:
      ```
      I think I understand what you mean now. The three stories I listed are all original works, not fanfiction, so you don't have to worry.
      ```

    - u/Duck_Giblets:
      ```
      Worm is its own standalone story, there is a lot of fanfiction based on worm, but it is an original work itself.

      Only difference between that and published series are that the author released it chapter by chapter, online. It is complete.
      ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  Hunter x Hunter is an amazing anime which I think might count as rational fic. One of my friends introduced it to me recently. It's a shonen anime where "reality ensues" is pretty much a rule of the setting. While none of the characters are geniuses, they are often quite clever and tend to solve their problems in intelligent ways, the characters' motivations are also realistic. You'll want to watch the 2011 version though because the 1999 version is kinda crap.

  I would also highly recommend Marked for Death (naruto fanfic quest that's really good)

  Also Alexander Wales has written some pretty good stuff, like "Shadows of the Limelight".

  There's also Luminosity by Alicorn (imagine if Twilight had been written by an author who was smarter and better at writing)

  You might also like the musical "Twisted: the Untold Story of a Royal Vizier" by Starkid.

  Also highly recommend stories by Eliezer Yudkowsky like "the Sword of Good" and "The Finale of the Ultimate Meta-Mega Crossover" He's also written some great one-shots, like "The Simple Truth" and "A Fable of Science and Politics"

  Also Code Geass: the Prepared Rebellion by SeerKing is another good story that's in progress, although it updates kinda sporadically because he has a bunch of other stories he's writing at the same time.

  There's also Unsong by Scott Alexander, which takes the premise "what would the world actually look like if Hebrew scripture were true" and plays it straight to its natural conclusions.

  Strong Female Protagonist is a great one too. It's a superhero webcomic, technically, but it's \*really\* good.

  I also really like the schooled in magic series by christopher nutall, but the story starts out really weak. It gets a lot better later though. Most of the books in the series are designed to be read independently of each other, but for the best possible experience it's better to start earlier in the series and read on from there.

  Animorph's: The Reckoning is really good too, but I think it's probably been abandoned. Same with Harry Potter and the Natural 20. Both of them are still probably worth reading though even though they'll never be done. \*cries\*

    >There's also Unsong by Scott Alexander, which takes the premise "what would the world actually look like if Hebrew scripture were true" and plays it straight to its natural conclusions.

    Reasonably sure taking Hebrew scripture to its natural conclusions doesn't end with sentient peyote cactus hive minds.

    Definitely seconding the recommendation for unsong though. It's bizarre, but in an excellent way. 

    >Animorph's: The Reckoning is really good too, but I think it's probably been abandoned.

    Wait, Animorphs the reckoning is abandoned? I thought the author was just having super long breaks between chapters.
    ```

  - u/FordEngineerman:
    ```
    The 2011 version shortcuts the beginning though. The first few episodes of the 1999 version have some heartwarming scenes and a brief bit of character growth that I think benefits the later 2011 show. I think it is only one episode but I forget which one out of the first 5 that has the expanded plot I'm thinking of.

  Hi, welcome to r/rational. This community has wiki. I don't know why mods do not place it at most prominent place, but you can get [good stuff there](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index#wiki_defining_works). We also got Monday recommendation thread, [check it out](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/bauwc6/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/). 

  I'm a Mother of Learning fanboy ([click here](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21220/mother-of-learning/chapter/301778/1-good-morning-brother) if you wish to read it at RoyalRoad), I did tame critic from time to time, but my love for it is immense. The fiction's opening was fairly weak, but there's reason why it's this community current darling.

  It might help to know why you didn't get into those three works; if there's something about them you didn't like, we can try to recommend works that don't have those things.

  That said, if you have no particular reason, then, well, I highly recommend *Worm* and *Madoka Magica*. They're both excellent.

  Regarding rational fanfic, *To The Stars* is a great *Madoka Magica* fanfiction if you're into sci-fi worldbuilding. (Note that it will basically spoil all of canon.) (It's also fairly tonally different than canon. It doesn't have the same dark atmosphere, since it depicts a world where magical girls have mostly pulled themselves out of their nasty situation.)
  ```

  - u/Random-Rambling:
    ```
    Eh, I just never got around to them past the first episodes or so.

    Oh, I already know many of the big plot twists of PMMM, so spoiling all of canon isn't a big deal.  Not a fan of super-dark stories either, so thats good to know!  And I LOVE worldbuilding, so that's a definite must-read.

    And is there a good singular spot to read Worm?  I heard it was written over a series of several hundred to several thousand forum posts.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      If you love worldbuilding, then I feel I should tell you that Mother of Learning actually started as a play-test for the author's worldbuilding ideas. He found that considering the perspective of someone inside his imagined world helped him to spot flaws; thus, he planned out a story based on that.

      So, naturally, it comes with a rich background - geography, history, politics, structured and unstructured magic (including magical programming), spirits and religion, etc. It never reads like a textbook - all these things are brought up as and when they're part of the story -  but it means that everything is supposed to make sense, and the author will attempt to fix anything that doesn't. Though honestly, he's done quite well in that regard and is only occasionally caught in an inconsistency.

      It was published on a website, chapter by chapter. It's pretty easy to find an epub of the whole work if you google it. 

      TBH it's baffling to me that the author hasn't done it himself. He is missing boatloads of cash and exposure by forcing people to read it on his website.
      ```

      - u/IV-TheEmperor:
        ```
        Yeah, epub is the easiest way if OP doesn't want to click the 'Next Chapter' link after finishing a chapter. I made my own epub with [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtoepub/akiljllkbielkidmammnifcnibaigelm). It's also compatible with other fiction sites such as AO3, ffnet and fictionpress.

        About the reason why Wilbow hadn't done it himself, IIRC is because when he contacted publishing companies they did not want free-to-read version scattering around the internet. He doesn't discourage people from creating their own copy though, he just doesn't want it to be distributed.

        EDIT: Also, I'm curious on how someone would be missing boatloads of cash and exposure by forcing people to read it on their website. I think opposite will be the case. More people visit their site and more cash the owner will get through ads, patreon and donate button on their sidebar. And the owner gets more exposure and credit on their work if people link to their site instead of some site by an anonymous person who re-upload their work.

          One of the major complaints that I see people make for worm is accessibility. Having to read it on his website really pulled the wind from his sails when he had amazing word of mouth a few years ago, in my opinion. I know that every time I recommend worm to someone it's an issue, and if I could have linked an amazon book with a professional cover(or given it as a gift, even), the chance that they will try it is much higher than some rando website. 

          And ebook Self-publishing is very easy nowadays, and actually a major advantage if you're over the crucial marketing hump, like wildbow is, where he has great name recognition, dedicated fans, and amazing word of mouth. With a normal publishing contract you're looking at maybe 10% of the gross, if you're very lucky(normal ~5%). For ebook self-publishing, you get as much as 70%! 

          Self-pub authors like Will Wight and Andrew Rowe got big entirely off of word of mouth on subs like r/fantasy, r/litrpg,  r/noveltranslations, and so on. Just Wight's latest book(a piddly little ~70k words novel) made a few hundred thousand in the first week, which is more than  wildbow ever made from worm, I'd wager. It's possible Wight made more in the past 2 years just from the Cradle series than wildbow has made from everything he's ever written. 

          Imagine how different it would be if every time it were recommended, people could point to a $5 ebook?
          ```

          - u/IV-TheEmperor:
            ```
            I see. I was not aware ebook self-publishing was a thing and after researching a little, I found out the Cradle series I see recommended here quite a lot was one of them lol.

            If this format works, I don't see why wildbow shouldn't at least try it out. He'll definitely sell! It's too late for worm, though.
            ```

          - u/tjhance:
            ```
            Maybe it's just because I already don't have preconceived notions about "published" stuff being better, or maybe I just have strange UI preferences, or both, but I've always been somewhat confused by people's obsessions with ebooks. Amazon Kindle for example is a pain in the ass compared to just reading off a website.

        He wants to edit it first before releasing an official "book".

      Honestly, Iâ€™d still suggest you give PMMM a chance. Even knowing the plot beforehand, itâ€™s got great artistry. I havenâ€™t read To The Stars though so canâ€™t say how much detail you need to appreciate it.

  I suggest you follow up HPMOR with reading [Significant Digits](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html). Worth the Candle and PGtE too as already suggested above.

  Then you can follow up with [Sam Hughes' Ra](https://qntm.org/ra) + [Fine Structure](https://qntm.org/structure), or anything else from him really. If you didn't like Worm (neither do I) there are still plenty of [other stories from Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/) that you can enjoy.
