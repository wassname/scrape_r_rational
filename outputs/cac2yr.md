  Alright, first impressions:

  Chapter 1: Alright, nothing special. "I thought I would be a Tinker." is cool except that you don't really show us the moment when she understands what else she is. It's a pretty neat way to explain how she received information about her power. In general, we should either see more preparation or more contemplation before the first fight - Worm had a good three thousand words of it, you only hit about one-thousand.

  Chapter 2: A one-two punch of terrible. Lung fight for no reason, then transition straight into Robo-master. I'd suggest just removing it entirely, unless you're going to have Lung and Armsmaster be the first and second antagonists of the first two major story arcs, like in Worm. The only good thing about this chapter was Taylor flying over Brockton Bay. It doesn't even really plunge Taylor into this story's intrigue, like in canon, because it seems like you've gone in the direction of a different inciting event in chapter 4. In particular, I'd like to say that Armsmaster doesn't have any *obvious* social deficiencies in canon, and the insinuation that he does is both annoying and never treated with the consideration it deserves. (It takes Lisa's supernatural intuition to reveal that Armsmaster has beef with Dauntless, and has feelings of inadequacy. If he were struggling that obviously, the Protectorate would have done more for him before Leviathan.) The dialogue in this chapter is bad too - there's too much repetition and not enough context behind each line. Taylor's quips to Lung don't have any time to sink in before the next one comes. It feels like an abridged version of events. Give it a bit more meat and it could go from bad to just mediocre. I'd suggest cutting it in its entirety and putting the relevant stuff in later.

  Chapter 3: This is where the story gets much better. Props for not just quoting the bulling scene from 2.4 like a lot of hack authors do. Making the trigger event different (I think that's what I read?) is also neat. Taylor somehow not experimenting with her powers more before going out is the most out of character thing in this story - she waits a full three months in canon, and in that time Taylor would *definitely* have figured out more about allomancy than she has by now, even with monetary limitations. The part where she's caught unprepared with Lung is something that shouldn't have happened unless something strongly changed her mindset - this is the girl that kept a pile of quarters in her utility pouch after the first Lung fight, just in case she needed to use a pay phone. Still, now that we're getting this exposition and preparation, it's better late than never. The body hook at the end is definitely good, too. I don't think I've seen that in other stories.

  Chapter 4: The mystery presented here is neat. I feel like the PRT is too trigger-happy here - the only suspect who could have possibly made them act that definitively against Taylor is Sophia, and even then, I feel like they would have opened negotiations before shooting. (What if they caught the wrong person with Taylor's profile? She's in civilian clothes - even murderous capes don't get foamed if they don't start to fight back. They would need a *much stronger body of evidence* than eyewitness testimony.) But those inconsistencies can be ironed out, and in the end, you'll have a chapter that segues into conflict better than like 95% of Worm fanfiction. This is why I feel like the Lung fight is so unnecessary - if you cut it out and left this in, the question of why Taylor went out so half-baked would make much more sense.

  Overall, a decent 5k words. Not the best story I've read, but I wouldn't drop it from what I've read here, and I'm eager to see where you take this plot.

    I decided to let the first events in canon happen basically the same way, and diverge from there. I'll try to add more context between lines in the future, thank you.

    >and the insinuation that he does

    Can you tell me what gave you this opinion? I never like that characterization either, and tried only to show him as bluntly professional with a bit of flat humor that Taylor doesn't recognize. He's also looking for Lung since he's been rampaging.

    >this is the girl that kept a pile of quarters in her utility pouch after the first Lung fight, just in case she needed to use a pay phone.

    The key phrase here is after the first Lung fight. I tried to make the Lung fight an inciting incident so that she'd learn she needs more preparation than just steel. It seems you didn't get that impression, so I definitely did something wrong.

    >trigger happy PRT

    Consider it an AU element in that case. My logic is that they have a Ward's testimony that some cape went berserk on a civilian in her own civilian identity. If she's that unstable, I would think it understandable that she's foamed.
    ```

    - u/Robert_Barlow:

      Well, the problem is that she considers steel enough preparation, when it's only one-sixteenth of her power. Taylor went to great lengths when she was experimenting with her bug powers - going to the public library to research insects, gathering different varieties from around the city, and three months of physical conditioning. Even then, she was *procrastinating*. Canon Taylor needed the push from having her notebooks ruined in order to be persuaded to go out, and even then, she waited patiently for the weekend. Given enough time, she would have had full plate armor and a better dyed costume, etc.

      If she needed more resources in order for her power to work, she would have sought those out from the Protectorate - her desire to avoid "situations like high school" isn't enough to overpower her common sense. (No matter how much fanfiction authors would like to persuade you otherwise.)

      As for the PRT - Sophia herself is a notoriously unstable Ward. But even disregarding that, a cape that went berserk on a civilian in her own civilian identity would leave more evidence at the scene, wouldn't be standing on her own calmly by the body. And if Sophia were to describe an encounter with her, the PRT would ask for a description of the power. Sophia needs to come up with a lie dangerous enough to get them to send a full squad out, but not so dangerous that it could be instantly disproven. If she tries to flub on details or says something like "I'm not sure." there's a chance they might send the police to the scene of the crime instead, because they can't know if it's actually Parahuman involvement. These aren't impossible obstacles to overcome, but it's a very convoluted way to get to the end result.

      My impression of Armsmaster came from the fact that he was being economical with his words - it makes sense if he's trying to go after Lung, but it wasn't a strong impression for a first encounter. Taking a look back at it, it doesn't seem as bad as I remember, but given that it was my first impression, maybe you might want to put something more in there. Again - chapter two can be immediately improved just by giving the concepts in there more space to develop. I didn't get a very clear picture of the fight, and the conversation with Armsmaster on the roof (How did he get up there? In canon he made his approach with a motorcycle.) felt truncated.

        > she considers steel enough preparation

        I must have given you the wrong impression somewhere. She does not at all consider steel enough for cape fights—she just figures it's good enough to get her away from any fights before she gets caught up in it. Her priority is raiding stashes of cash and taking down unpowdered, unarmed criminals so that she can get enough money to buy the correct formulas for the rest of the metals she needs.

        This Taylor also had a different Trigger, and figures that the way to get the rest of the metal she needs is to get money, and hey, don't drug dealers have a lot of money on them? Also school sucks and she has no social life.

        >her desire to avoid "situations like high school" isn't enough to overpower her common sense

        I would disagree here. Personal experiences can form phobias for similar situations. It's not reasonable or logical, sure, but it's a character flaw and not a plot hole in my opinion. And as it turns out, she's right to be afraid of similar situations in the Wards. Sophia is one.

        >would leave more evidence at the scene, wouldn't be standing on her own calmly by the body

        Are you sure about that? What more evidence does there need to be? A cape has superpowers—all they need is their fists, and not even that if they have telekinesis or laser eyes or some such power. Psychotic killers are mentally unwell. They could indeed stand near the body for no reason, or continue wailing on it even after the person is dead, or even kill someone and then just go about their day like nothing happened. When a Ward tells you she saw some cape go berserk on something, you can't stop and consider if she's telling the truth—there could be a superpowered criminal going on the rampage, you need to take action. I do agree that any after-action investigation would pick up that something fishy was going on.

        >In canon he made his approach with a motorcycle

        He did that here too. Taylor descended form the fire escape before he started talking.

        >felt truncated

        Thank you. I'll try to do better in that department.

  Hoping for feedback before I add the [RT] tag.

  Summary: Taylor has the Lord Ruler's abilities from Mistborn.

    Well, I was waiting for there to be a bit more content, but now that you've asked for feedback, I think I might end up reading it. Quick word of warning, though, my impression might not be wholly positive.

      That's alright. I've no delusions about my skill as a writer. Any critique that helps me get better is appreciated.

  Why spacebattles instead of sufficient velocity, if you don't mind my asking?
  ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    I'm not familiar with Sufficient Velocity. I commonly find a lot of works posted of SpaceBattles before they're moved to other sites like AO3, so I thought I'd do the same. What's different with Sufficient Velocity?
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      It's pretty much a clone of Spacebattles, with some slightly nicer features and less assholish mods. There was a whole schism and everything. It has a nicer colour scheme too.

      I personally also find the average user to be slightly less standard-internet-comments-section-tier, but that could just be me.

      It's not uncommon for an author to make a thread on both forums and update each at the same time, but don't feel obligated to do so.

      - u/Lightwavers:

        Thanks for the information, I'll go crosspost. :)
        ```

    - u/traverseda:
      ```
      A lot of authors have moved to sufficient velocity, and it's even odds when you see something new it will be posted to SV instead of SB.

      The mods are generally considered to be less extreme on SV.

      I was mostly just curious as to what's causing authors to create new stories on one or the other.

    >but maybe I'm misremembering the thing with Vin's earring

    You are, but don't worry, the earring situation was pretty confusing. For a Hemalurgic spike, you need three things: a specific metal, a compatible bind point, and intent. If you're lacking any one of these it won't work. For Vin's earring, Ruin himself was providing the intent. You can't just accidentally stab someone in the right place and form a spike, you have to have some idea of what you're trying to do.
