## [D][META] realtime community chat. The #rationalfic channel in the lesswrong slack, and improving the IRC channel experience for visitors.

### Post:

It seems that the #reddit-rational irc channel isn't doing terribly well (down to about 4 members, transient visitors seem unlikely to get a conversation.) I figured I should extend an open invite to the [lesswrong slack channel](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_Slack), wherein lies a #rationalfic subchannel that sustains 33 members with a slow but steady stream of realtime interactions, growing over time.

We're discussing the possibility of opening a bridge between the two venues, we already have the technology ready to do that, and we've done it before. If the owners of #reddit-rational would give the green light to open the bridge, that'd be swell.

On that, I'm thinking of adding a feature that'd make IRC a lot more usable for anyone who wanted to chat from time to time but couldn't be bothered to get a lesswrong.slack account, essentially to make sure that the feature sets of the two venues compliment each instead of conflicting.

(the idea in detail: In IRC, you have to get a thing called a bouncer if you want any approximation of logging. It's basically a bot that sits there and records everything. A lot of users don't bother, as a result, a large proportion of comments made by transient visitors in IRC wont get replied to. I'm thinking of adding a feature to the irc bridge bot to unobtrusively relay responses to names who were absent from the channel when the responses were issued, as direct messages, so that nobody has to worry about messages getting missed. Slack's UX makes this feature even more important than it is in IRC for various reasons.)

Those wishing for an invite to the slack channel can PM me with an email address, message http://lesswrong.com/user/elo/ on lesswrong, or skip the middleware and email the slack admin directly at redeliot@gmail.com

EDIT: The bridge is open. You can now engage with the slack through http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-rational if you cbf getting a slack account.
