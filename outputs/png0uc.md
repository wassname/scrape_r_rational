Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I saw [*The Breadwinner*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3901826/) over the weekend. 

  It's the story of Parvana, a young girl who lives in Afghanistan before the 2001 invasion. Her family relies on her dad to support the family. One day he's arrested, and having no other male relatives that can work, the women are forced to stay inside, and can't even go out to buy food. Parvana eventually realizes that she can pass for a boy, and starts taking up odd jobs in order to support her family.

  The story is pretty straightforward: a young girl wants to save her family, and is forced to bear that burden in addition to living in repressive society. It's well told, and despite it unfolding through a child doesn't feel childish.

  Visually the film looks great. The characters have a unique style, without looking too cartoonish. The world is extremely detailed too.

  It was a nice movie, and fun too watch. Though I have to say that watching it now, after the Taliban reclaimed Afghanistan, make the film pack a punch if wouldn't have had a month ago.

    Second it—one of my favorite films of all time—and I highly recommend watching all four films by that studio, Cartoon Saloon. They've made *The Secret of Kells*, *Song of the Sea*, *The Breadwinner*, and *Wolfwalkers*. The other three are about Irish Folklore and way more light-hearted, but the soul is just as deep as in *The Breadwinner*. The animation is fantastic, too.

    In the same vein, [The Kite Runner](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0419887/) was also fantastic, if bleak at times.

  [12 Miles Below](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42367/12-miles-below) recently climbed up into page one of best rated on royal road, which is pretty good for a novel that's been out for 4 months. If you're in the mood for a sci-fi that reads more like a sanderson story, go give it a look.

  The novel was heavily inspired by BLAME, frostpunk, and Dune. Book is wrapped up, it's currently just started posting into book two, so it's a good time to binge. Here's the synopsis:

  >The world is in ruins.  
  >  
  >Extreme sub-zero temperatures suffocate the surface, making even simple survival an ordeal. Frozen derelicts of bygone eras span across massive ice wastes. And the elite few hoard any technology rediscovered within.  
  >  
  >The only escape from the deadly climate is beneath the surface. But it’s another disaster underground. Monstrous machines lurk in the depths. Unhinged demigods war against them, dying over and over, treating it all like a game. The land itself shifts over time, more contraption than rock. And an ominous prophecy states that the key to everything waits at the last level - but nobody’s ever reached that far.  
  >  
  >When an expedition into the far uncharted north goes terribly wrong,  Keith Winterscar and his father get trapped together in a desperate fight for survival. Stumbling upon an ancient power struggle of titanic scale; the two will need to set their differences aside while they struggle against Gods, legends, and the grand secrets of the realm that lies below.

  **TL;DR:** World go broke for mysterious reasons a really long time ago - and now everyone is cold. Really, really cold. Underground warm but evil toasters make for complicated neighbors.

      Enjoyed it at first but then the mechanics of charisma turned me off: if you loose an argument you are effectively enslaved to the person for a day? Its too hard to ignore society shattering implications of that which do not occur in the story.

        - u/Dragfie:
          ```
          It is effectively; if you define it well not doing anything the person asks you theoretically is acting against them.
          Keeping any secrets from them is acting against them, selling them products at any price higher than cost is acting against them, you could even argue that demanding them to pay for your services or goods is acting against them.
          Anything you do which does not benefit them is acting against them so anything they don't want you to do they simply say that would hurt me and you can't do it, that is effectively enslavement.

            ```
            And.. that is not how it works in phantasm. Either because the social dueling system just doesnt do that, or because anyone who pushed it that hard would end up murdered in an alley in short order.

            - u/Dragfie:
              ```
              Well, if you mean mechanically: she is not able to lie to him, which practically does mean that she can't keep secrets from him, it's a mental shackle on your actions which has hard rules about what you can and can't do, and with a rule like that its so easy to exploit.  


              As to end up getting murdered: If the count wanted her to spill all her secrets there is nothing she could have done. He wouldn't have gotten murdered in an ally. And he especially wouldn't if he gets all his staff to regularly lose to him in a social match and make sure none of them harbor ill will towards him. -> With a power like that there is no real reason why the people in power wouldn't regularly use something like this to ensure loyalty which ends up as basically a dystopia. 


              \^This is what I mean by what "doesn't occur in the story", A mechanic like that is like Soul-fucking in WTC. That story is very good at accurately showing the social ramifications of mechanics/powers like that. The fact that this DOESN"T happen in the story (and the MC is obviously going to use this mechanic to their advantage at some point but ignoring the effect it would have on society) just feels like the whole society is holding the idiot ball every time the mechanic is mentioned; which for me is too hard to ignore and enjoy the story.

        My understanding of social contest is it only compels you in a social way but if you went straight to violence then it doesn't compel you.

        I'm trying to find it mentioned in the text but can't find a reference for that, though.
        ```

        - u/Dragfie:
          ```
          Well it wouldn't matter; socially or whatever, unless you are implying that you could remove the condition if you attack the target but that doesn't really reduce the issues much. 

          Even if its just socially, "not being able to act against" is just so broad, someone could make you do anything they could if you were a slave during that time (which is why I called it effective slavery), there are things you could do as a slave which you could not under this condition so its **worse** than slavery.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            But slavery is long-term. This just lasts a little while and once it wears off they can act normally. Considering it's a medieval society, this seems like an improvement over the typical behavior of nobles. Typical nobles can send a few guards, capture, imprison you, and torture you for information to the point of death, so how is this worse than that? Winning a social contest every day would be exhausting except for maybe 5-10 hyper-loyal assassins.

            Just seems like a convenient shortcut. And the point of the violence clause I mentioned is that someone abusing social contest would end up with a corpse after a week of degradation rather than a loyal servant and addressed by law enforcement same as murder.
            ```

              >But slavery is long-term. 

              Well, I did say "slavery for a day"

              >Considering it's a medieval society, this seems like an improvement over the typical behavior of nobles.

              This is not a behavior, its a mechanic, nobles can still do all the bad stuff you described this mechanic does not prevent that.

              >so how is this worse than that?

              Have you read WTC? If so do you agree with the way soul-magic (particularly changing someone's loyalties to you) affected society was portrayed? And if so then this is exactly that but temporary (which would not make much difference. The exploits do not care much about time). - It is MASSIVE and the things you can do with a mechanic like this are incredibly powerful and will permeate everything in the culture. 

              >Just seems like a convenient shortcut. And the point of the violence clause I mentioned is that someone abusing social contest would end up with a corpse after a week of degradation rather than a loyal servant and addressed by law enforcement same as murder.

              I gave a bunch of examples of exploits and situations in the other thread about this on my OG comment, I can repeat them here if you don't want to read all that?

              >Winning a social contest every day would be exhausting except for maybe 5-10 hyper-loyal assassins.

              That's not how something like this would be done. Just from the top of my head let me think of a security system for nobility using this mechanic:  
               \- Find the quickest interaction you can do with someone to trigger this effect.  
               \- Daily/Weekly/Randomly require all staff to perform this action (it doesn't have to be with the count/lord but a single person it can be delegated to who themselves purposefully lost a contest to the main lord) and then answer a few questions designed to specifically test loyalty or what-have-you.  
               \- If you find anyone doing anything you don't like or who just refuses to participate; then interrogate\* them. 

               \- Any dictator could use this mechanic to massive effect: you can get a whole city under this influence by delegating the automated loss method.   


              \*Interrogation:

              \- Force them to lose a social interaction with you, the alternative being execution. - If they would rather die, hold them in jail and have random (previously tested like above for loyalty) soldiers/whoever constantly attempt to "win" a social interaction with the prisoner. (you can probably get creative with this depending on the prisoner)  
               \- If one of them catches him then you can get him to answer anything through the mechanic.   


              And this is not even considering the normal every-day things that you can do with something like this. Either the society would massively stigmatize using this mechanic or people would completely change the way they interact with each other to not "lose" a social competition.

                Sounds like I should continue WtC, it's been a while since I've touched it.

                I think the main limiter is the fact it is stats-based. If you delegate then the people you trust to win contests will eventually gain enough stats to contest you.

                But I do think we both might be reading into it too much. I'm not up on the latest chapter but I don't think that the social contest win has any effect on you when you've moved away from the person.
                ```

                - u/Dragfie:
                  ```
                  I mean that's irrelevant to the issue. You can only move away if said person lets you in the first place. Stats won't matter either, if anything it makes it more exploitable by the powers that be. Dictators are rarely top soldiers, the issue is one of centralization and retention of power. And if you can become a top soldier with money and social power then it just exaggerates the problem.
                  ```

          - u/Izeinwinter:
            ```
            I think you are misreading what the condition does. If it was obedience it would simply *say* must obey for a day. 

            It stops you from taking action against the winner.  - you would, for 
            example, not be able to continue arguing this point if I won a contest.

            But that only extends to the winner being able to compel actions if they were already formally in command of the looser. - That is, a private would be constrained to obedience of all lawful commands if the looser of a social contest with their superior officer, because in that specific circumstance, just sleeping in could be reasonably construed to be acting against the officer. 

            But absent such a formal relationship, you are reading one hell of a lot more into the condition than is warranted.
            ```

            - u/Dragfie:
              ```
              I understand where you're coming from, but you're missing the perspective I am looking at this at: The condition does not literally make you obedient, but any competent individual could exploit the condition to practically make you obedient.

              >you would, for example, not be able to continue arguing this point if I won a contest.

              Just to jump in here, if the condition only applied to the specific task/exchange that occurred then that would be a different story, it doesn't, it applies to all your actions which is the issue.

              On the face of it- say, with a single layered thought of cause and effect, its as you say. The issue is the exploits you can do by indirectly utilizing the effect. "cannot act against you" IS, through a few layers/indirectly, practically exactly the same as "must obey you".

              Edit:To give one example, simply by definitions we can equate the two things:

              1. "Cannot act against you" = "Must act in a way that benefits you"

              Explanation: (With a godly arbiter, there is no middleground here. Any action someone does either benefits or does not benefit you in total, we don't think that way because we as humans don't have enough information to tell if an action benefits or does not, but to an omniscient observer this is a yes/no. An action either benefits or does not which is the opposite of it either hurting you or does not.)

              2. Giving an order -> the recipient has 2 options, I. Obey the order, or II. Ignore the order.

              3. Position yourself so that acting in II does not benefit you (or harms you, it is the same).

              4. Adding 1 to 3 we get 1. "Cannot act against you" = "Must obey you".
              ```

              - u/Izeinwinter:
                ```
                *if, and only if you had a reasonable/justified expectation of obedience in the first place*. Otherwise you are manufacturing the "harm" and presumably the system - which is *not* in your head, but an external arbiter, would just go "Try the other one, it has bells on it". This does make it.. a terrifying tool in the hands of people in positions of authority, I suppose.
                ```

                - u/Dragfie:
                  ```
                  >if, and only if you had a reasonable/justified expectation of obedience in the first place.

                  No absolutely not, you don't need any expectations, all you need to do is position yourself so that not following your order is a harm to you, If you can do that (which is not hard) then anyone can make anyone follow any order.

                  >This does make it.. a terrifying tool in the hands of people in positions of authority

                  Exactly, but not just authority, anyone. This is my point, its too world-shattering of a mechanic, it's absolutely terrifying and would completely warp society. You can't exactly just ignore its effect either, because presumably, the parts of this the the MC will take advantage off are things which would completely warp society, hence the feeling of society holding the Idiot ball each time its mentioned.
                  ```

                  - u/Izeinwinter:
                    ```
                    You are assuming the system agrees with you philosophically as regards the action/inaction distinction. And at the same time staking out a quite radical "There is no distinction" stance. 

                    That stance is philosophically coherent, sure, that does not mean that the game system or the author agrees with you. In fact it is pretty clear neither does.

  I'm going to recommend *Virtuous Sons*. ([Spacebattles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/virtuous-sons-greco-roman-xianxia.925544/)) ([RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia))

  It's Xianxia adapted to use ancient Greek mythology and culture where Xianxia traditionally uses Chinese; it turns out that Cultivation maps really quite well onto concepts like Arete (approximately: the virtue of excellence), and whilst the actions of Young ~~Masters~~ Aristocrats are universal it doesn't seem to be glorifying Might Makes Right in the way that native Xianxia often seems to.

  It's not merely a competent translation but a well-written work natively written in English. The main characters bantering and annoying each other are consistently very funny without devolving into silliness. The worldbuilding adapts classic Xianxia tropes to Ancient Greece seamlessly, and I enjoy seeing a more familiar mythology explored through the lens of Xianxia. (Chinese mythology is plenty interesting, but Greek mythology is both more and less familiar in this context, which I enjoy.)

  I put off reading it for a long time because something about the concept seemed awkward to me, but having finally gotten around to it I thoroughly recommend it!

        Have you played the Atelier games? If not, I'd recommend them. I usually don't care at all about crafting systems, but I really enjoy the Atelier series; the crafting system in it roughly scratches the same itch as Factorio does. The plot can basically be boiled down to "cute girls having fun and occasionally saving the world" so it's pretty standard JRPG there, but the real core of the games are the Alchemy system. Every trilogy almost completely changes the way that alchemy (and sometimes combat) works, but it's still fundamentally based around collecting ingredients and synthesizing items, transferring traits between intermediate ingredients and optimizing the hell out of both the crafting process and the ingredients used. You *can* buy gear, but it's not going to be particularly useful unless you're on extremely low difficulties. If you want a worthwhile sword, you have to synthesize the sword. If you want a bomb that actually deals damage, you're going to have to make that bomb. 

        If you're just going to get into it, I'd recommend trying Atelier Ryza. It's the newest trilogy and the most streamlined by far, so you won't have to deal with some of the frustrations of older games. The mechanics to the alchemy systems in previous trilogies are different, but they all retain that same core experience so if you like the new one, you'll probably like the older ones just as much.

An elven mage wanders the world years after the Hero died, coming to terms with how much impact just short ten years with his party had on her life.  Very calm, meditative, good for remembering what adulthood is like.

  [Kisuriya no Hitorigoto](https://mangadex.org/title/e18fe8c6-f6dc-4f05-8462-7b2083ff9a6c/kusuriya-no-hitorigoto) (translated as "Drugstore Soliloquy").  A medicine-compounder kidnapped into the Imperial harem as a poison-taster solves pharmacy-related crimes.  Unfortunately falls far short of being a Fair Play Mystery - you cannot reasonably solve things before she does - but still has some of the meditative calm of Frieren.

    *[Kino's Journey](https://mangadex.org/title/2dadb5cd-b3e4-45a9-bc01-cd138e185dfb/kino-s-journey-gou)* - A young girl travels to different countries with her (talking) motorbike, only staying for three days.

    Sengoku Komachi Kuroutan, it's about a girl that gets sent back in time and does some up lifting, it's more reasonable than most. She's mostly just good at farming and improves quality of life by increasing food production and other innocuous stuff like naming streets and making addresses, making clocks and bells so people can be better organized..

    &#x200B;

    It's more adult than average manga but it's not up to frieren level. 

    &#x200B;

    You might want to read obituaries, that sounds like it could be related to what you want. Just pick some decently sized city and google it + obituaries. 

    &#x200B;

    It gives an unusual perspective, how short life is, how so few parts of it matter and will be of significance. It might be counterintuitive but it's not really sad, it's just a gentle reminder of death and what relationships matter most.

    if you haven't read everything by kui ryoko and hitoshi iwaaki, you should. I also recommend courtney crumrin.

    I don't know if they're exactly on this line, but they're pretty close to it. a bit further but still related are azumi and maybe blood and steel.

    ah, also touge oni/primal gods in ancient times.

    Try Helck. The tone fit these two with the MC also being technically a side character of the traditional hero plot. Its best going into it blind IMO and its complete.
    ```

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    Frieren's the only one of those two I'm familiar with, but maybe Beware Of Chicken from Royalroad is suitably adjacent? Guy gets reincarnated into Xianxia world, recognises what happened, then immediately bails to go be a farmer in the middle of nowhere rather than contend with Xianxia young master bullshit.

    It is much more wholesome than melancholy, so pretty distinct from Frieren, as the protag settles into his new corner of the world, but it still has a "peaceful giant among ants" vibe of someone powerful concerned with living their life rather than being the hero.

  Any litrpg/progression fantasy with a large focus on inner understanding or wisdom? Stuff like:

  * A Daring Synthesis, worm fanfic where Greg Veder slowly gains more wisdom (with a lot of pain)

  * Infinite Realm: Monsters and Legends. A large portion of people's power comes from how well they understand themselves. One avenue of power is almost wholly focused on inner understanding and willpower.

  * To a certain extent Dungeon's Pet and Humble Life of a Skill Trainer also felt pretty wise, since both protagonists had [meditation] and delved into it (although Dungeon's Pet less so).
  ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    Do you count Xianxia as litRPG? If so, I think Forge of Destiny would qualify.

    (Also, I think Dungeon's Pet has been renamed to Dungeon Scholar.)

  Does anyone have stories or fanfiction that revolve around the introduction of magic/superpowers and how society slowly adapts/collapses as a result? It seems like most superhero stories take place a few decades or more after powers have been introduced to the world.
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    Ra takes place a short while after magic is discovered, with the magification process still ongoing. Unfortunately for this post, it's more of a individual story than a society-based one.

    Many of Robert J Sawyer's books are like that from a Sci-Fi perspective instead of fantasy, with some strange tech being introduced in the early chapters then the trajectory becoming clear by the conclusion.

    Wheel of Time *kind* of does it with the introduction of [spoiler], [spoiler], and [spoiler] in the middle books.  It starts from a stable fantasy world and transitions to a newer, unstable fantasy world when those things are introduced.

      I figure two of those spoilers are >!male channelers!< and >!gateways!<, but what's the third?

    There's the Worm fanfic [Late](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/late-worm-au.765826/reader/) that has elements of this. The premise is that it wasn't until 2010 that the Golden Man appeared, and Taylor is part of the first wave of parahumans. It's pretty solid, though unfortunately for your request Taylor is still Taylor and very much doesn't want the limelight, so the whole societal thing is more in the background.

  I remember reading a fic with superpowers and there was a character with insect control and they thought they could be a superhero but actually they just rode a train through crop fields killing pests as a throwaway world building detail. I think there was temperature related magic radiation.

  - u/ironistkraken:
    ```
    That sounds a lot like a Worm fanfic.

  - u/reaper7876:
    ```
    Temperature related magic radiation? If I'm remembering correctly, that was the Change Storms series by /u/eaglejarl; there was a minor character that was a clear enough Worm reference.

    Depends on what you like! I'll give some recs anyhow.

    You want more of the same: Cenotaph. You want a different perspective on the same setting: Tabloid. You want things to get fixed: Constellations. You want everything totally different: I woke up as a dungeon, now what?

      It Starts With One is great, but should be read on [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16970325/chapters/39885288), since the mods threw it off Spacebattles. Apparently discussing fictional genocide, fascism, and all sorts of other unsavoury stuff is well and dandy, but discussing fictional class struggle and killing billionaires isn't.

        It's the entirely self-consistent policy of SB pandering (justifiably IMO) to their best perception of what speech is permissible in the minds of their advertisers, webhosts, DNS registrar and payment processors. And it's kinda obvious why the corporate bones of the internet are perceived to take a much dimmer view of fictionalised left-wing extrajudicial violence than fictionalised right-wing extrajudicial violence.
        ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Greg Veder vs the World and A Daring Synthesis are two gamer greg fics (basically powerset from The Gamer manwha). Greg Veder vs the World is a bit more of a stereotypical hero's journey. A Daring Synthesis has a really good Flowers for Algernon-esque development of Greg, who goes from a cringy teenager shitposter to Ninja Buddha. A Daring Synthesis is finished, although the ending is really anticlimactic.
