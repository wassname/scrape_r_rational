## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  My job allows me to listen to a lot of audiobooks on the clock. Coincidentally, the Starship Troopers audiobook is available on youtube.

  It's pretty good. The movie seems like it pokes fun at the fascist human society it portrays, but the book lacks that parody element. It's not persuasive as in makes you think fascism ain't so bad, but it makes the world seem much more plausible, and the citizen/resident distinction is well explained within the culture of the world. There also aren't any technologies that should transform society but mysteriously don't, like the resurrection tubs the movie added for no apparent reason, and the scifi tech that does exist leads to societal changes that make sense. I recommend it. Good book. Also the first time I've come across power armour in fiction and liked it.

    *Starship Troopers* (the book) is definitely soaked in militarism and while I agree that it's not really going to persuade anyone towards fascism, it does portray fascism is a pretty positive light. It's hard to know what Heinlein was saying with that though; whether he's making a full-throated endorsement of fascism or just trying to steelman it. I'm sure if I read more biography of him that would be clear, but I don't really care to. (Reading more Heinlein didn't really help me, because he took a turn somewhere in his life and became much more leftist.)

    The translation it made to film is one of the most fascinating ones out there, because while there are a lot of movie that aren't faithful adaptations, and a lot of movie that change the moral, there are relatively few where this happens for ideological reasons. Verhoeven grew up in Nazi-occupied Netherlands, so had some problems with military fascism (to put it lightly).

  So, is anyone else playing Stellaris?

  My experience with it so far has been fairly positive, though I haven't been able to put in as many hours as I'd like. It does feel like there's a lot of room for additions and improvements, but other than a few bugs I've run into (nothing terribly game-breaking), it's a great 4X.

  I do run into the problem I normally have with 4X games, which is that I find the early parts (dominated by exploration and capture of resources) more enjoyable than the later parts (diplomacy and warfare). I don't think that's a result of anything Stellaris does though, that's just how I am with any sort of game like it.

    I did.

    I played it a lot at first, so it's not terrible, but after the first 2 games I lost motivation.

    The writing is pretty great, but once you've seen a lot of the events, that's over and you notice that the game is pretty threadbare.
    There just isn't much to do.

    The aliens are all the same. Yes, they look pretty different, but they're pretty much the same. There are no radically different playstyles. I would say less difference between nations than there is in CK2 or EU4. There is no real character to these randomly generated races. It's just a bunch of bonuses randomly assigned to a cool portrait.

    * The fighting system is not that great. It's very hard to understand what is going on and most wars are decided in the first big engagement. (After the parties get done playing cat-and-mouse.)
    * There should be a lot more events happening in the midgame. There is a lot of exploration stuff early and some late-game stuff, but inbetween it gets pretty boring.
    * Sectors don't work correctly. Their AI is pretty dumb, bu what's more, they don't build robots or enact Edicts or even build out spaceports. So you still need to access all those planets, which are now hidden in the UI or remember where they all are on the map.
    * You can't order a new fleet at once like you can order an army template in EU4. It gets really annoying in big empires to get a new fleet up and running. Especially since most of your ports are in sectors.
    * Armies are even more annoying, since you can put attachments on them, but that has to be done for every unit separately. It's also kind of opaque on how many units you need and I don't feel like better army technology brings me much. The hard part is beating the enemy fleet and not the invasion of planets.

    * I'm sure eventually, with a couple of expansion packs, all this gets improved, but currently, I'm done after about 30 hours.

    I have been, overall I think its pretty decent right now and has an incredible amount of potential.

    The biggest issue for me is that the empire doesn't feel like it has a real internal life. For example, in Victoria II and Crusader Kings II you really get the sense that their is a civilization and then there is you. You are trying to steer this civilization, but it has its own interesting dynamic behaviour that you have to work with and understand in order to accomplish anything. Its very different than, say, Civilization and 4Xs in general where you're basically a God emperor who extracts resources from the "civ/empire" that doesn't actually have a genuine civ/empire being simulated underneath.

    Right now I can see sectors and pops giving that potential for internal life (and, in fact, its not completely devoid of internal life as it is). But as it stands the sectors make it feel a bit like you're the God Emperor who got a little lazy. 

    That said I like Stellaris for the reasons I love Civ. And, based on the already scheduled updates and my expectations of Paradox, I'm looking forward to loving what Stellaris will become.

  Does anyone here like hiking or other outdoorsy stuff? I recently tossed some photos from a few of the hikes I've done in recent years on [imgur](https://imgur.com/a/SA96g) and felt like sharing. What are y'all's favorite hikes? Where will your future outdoors adventures take you? I think the nicest places I've been would include the Sierras, Northern Arizona, the (US) Pacific Northwest, and the South Island of New Zealand (sadly, my camera broke a fifth of the way into my backpacking trip in the latter, so I don't have too many pictures from there). My next stops will be Iceland, the Scottish Highlands, more of the Pacific Northwest, and maybe parts of SE Asia.

  I just bought one of [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00Z7MMOB4/ref=mp_s_a_1_27?qid=1463751402&sr=8-27&pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&keywords=survival+card) little survival cards. Not because I expect to ever need it, but because it doesn't feel fair to give charachters I write too many advantages compared to myself, so now I can justify them having a pocketknife on them or something.

  My priorities are weird but, shit, it was only 99 cents! (A dollar actually, but that's close enough.)

  *[Life After Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30200089)* is a *vaguely*-interesting time-loop story, [available for three dollars from Barnes & Noble](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/life-after-life-kate-atkinson/1112411960?ean=9780316230803). It's written in a weirdly-disjointed way, it has more characters than I'm reliably able to remember, and its protagonist doesn't start to recall her past loops (beyond sudden premonitions of terror) and make plans for exploiting future loops until literally the last few pages of the book. Really, most of it is a slice-of-life story from approximately 1910 through 1950. It's a gigantic bait-and-switch, for someone who, after reading the summary, is expecting *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* or *[Chunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411)* or at the very least *[Sisyphus](http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651)*. It's one of those stories after whose reading I feel disgusted with myself for not having found a better way to spend a few hours. Still, I found it just barely fun enough to be worth three stars on Goodreads--and, if you want something approaching one hour of entertainment for every dollar of expenditure, it provides a nice value for your money.

  (Generally, I rate books as follows:  
  \- ★★★★★ = awesome enough to be read many times (e.g., *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)*: "That was incredible! I can't wait to read it again!");  
  \- ★★★★☆ = fun enough to be read several times (e.g., *[The Swiss Family Robinson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62111)*: "That was pretty cool.");  
  \- ★★★☆☆ = tolerable enough to be read once (e.g., *[Ra](http://qntm.org/ra)*: "Well, I guess it was better than nothing.");  
  \- ★★☆☆☆ = boring enough that I give up partway through (e.g., *[Cryptonomicon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/816)*: "I think I should cut my losses here."); and  
  \- ★☆☆☆☆ = unbearable enough that I shudder away from it almost immediately (e.g., *[Harry Crow](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071)*: "Ugh.").)

      Yeah, I love that book. I can definitely see why some people wouldn't, and the ending does leave something to be desired, but it's one of my go-to books to lend out to the right sort of people.

    I like your rating system. I've always struggled with 2 and 4 stars, so I think I'll steal your versions of them.

  - u/Frommerman:

    My rating system would have to be different. I remember things I read vividly, so rereading is only a thing for really amazing works.

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      Hell I never reread, can't stand knowing _exactly_ what will happen in detail in advance it's boring, though I don't mind knowing the gist in advance necessarily so I don't mind spoilers that much unless the story relies heavily on a twist.
      ```

  - u/thecommexokid:
    ```
    I was similarly annoyed by the book. Bait-and-switch is an apt descriptor. There's an inherent promise in a book that opens with a time traveler going back to 1930 and shooting Hitler on, literally, page 1...and Atkinson didn't even come close to fulfilling that promise.

  I've been reading through Diane Duane's Young Wizards series and loving it (so many feels!!), but there's an aspect of the setting I'd like to nitpick: the lack of communication. The Powers That Be rarely tell wizards what to do, or even directly notify them that they have work. Nita and Kit just look at their manuals and say, "Look! We're on active status, there must be something important to do," and go searching for it. Wouldn't it make more sense to be more direct?

  The Powers aren't the only guilty ones, I'm surprised at how unorganized wizards are considering their goals of universal preservation. They do coordinate with each other sometimes, but so far it's seemed more along the lines of friends helping each other out with problems that are usually mutual. New wizards are all but forced to face their Ordeal alone, even when Seniors are consulted they usually just provide advice rather than direct assistance.

  Lastly, I have no idea why wizards haven't told everyone about wizardry and the Lone Power. I understand minimizing outside influence on Earth, disrupting the natural order causes entropy, but wouldn't telling people the truth make the prevention of entropy easier? Aliens know about wizards, which does make errantry easier to do. Humans will presumably make contact with those aliens someday, so would hearing it from them make it easier to accept?

  Bizarre thought experiment: consider a trivial decision, like moving a finger. Change your mind about doing it as many times as you can. You can always change your mind, right? Or are you just telling yourself you changed your mind? Like I said, it's weird.
  ```

  - u/Rhamni:

    Here's how it went down for me:

    I decided to do the 'experiment', so I put my arm down and held it still. Imagined moving it. Imagined not moving it. Realized that I wasn't actually changing my mind, because the hand was going to remain still for a while if I was going to do this experiment. Decided I needed a fixed time limit, and if I couldn't trick myself before then I was just going to end the experiment. Realized that that meant move the hand at the end of the countdown. Immediately discarded the countdown. Realized I had just changed my mind, but saw no further avenue toward deciding to move it again. Thought about how boring it was to just try to tell myself what I was thinking. Thought about having a countdown. Didn't trust myself to adhere to the countdown. Got annoyed with myself for being unable to decide on something as easy as moving my hand. Realized I was still holding my hand deliberately still. Was offended. Tried to trick myself into accepting the countdown idea again, but failed. Resumed watching Parasyte - the maxim. Moved hand at some point.

    The lesswrong post [belief in self deception](http://lesswrong.com/lw/s/belief_in_selfdeception/) is relevant.

  Orphaned story idea:

  In *Madoka Magica*, Kyubee refers to having received his energy quota from "this planet".  This implies that the Incubators have more planets than just Earth.  But he also stated and implied that human beings, with emotions that can effect magic, are rare, and no small bit crazy, compared to the multispecies, astronomical-scale civilization that produced the Incubators and is mature enough to worry about the heat-death of the universe.

  So Empress Homura sets out to conquer and reunite the many unknown worlds of humanity and take the fight to the Incubators.  This "demon" stuff doesn't fool her: she knows the Goddess Madoka cannot be satisfied until despair plagues humankind no more.

  Mahou shojou power armor and genetically-engineered SPEHSS MAGICAL GIRLZ may appear.
