## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  What are some political systems that are *only* possible in the realm of speculative fiction? Some examples:

  * Rule by a supreme diety
  * Rule by a hivemind
  * Rule by a representative who exists as the coherent extrapolated volition of the citizens
  * Rule of the living by the dead
  * Rule through chained geas
  * Rule of the past by the future

  Ultimately, some of these will devolve down to simple autocracy, democracy, or some other real-world system with some extra steps, I'm just thinking in terms of getting weird with how a society is governed.

    Damn it, I keep thinking about different political systems you could write around magic rules, and then I go "No, wait, he already wrote a story about that."

    In general, I'd go for exotic means of communications between citizens:

    * Some people have mind-reading powers.

    * People can communicate telepathically when they sleep.

    * The government can rewrite people's memories, but not their beliefs.

    More exotic ideas:

    * Having political power makes you more charismatic and convincing (though not necessarily well-liked). Large kingdoms have a tendency to collapse because extremely powerful monarch are so convincing that their advisors are literally unable to disagree with them even when they have terrible ideas.

    * The people are lead by a democracy, but in dire circumstances, they turn to dictatorship. The dictator wears the hat equivalent of the Heavenly Sword: a crown that gives them mind-related power (telepathy, telekinesis, enhanced learning), but they can't take it off and it kills them after a while.

    * The people worship separate deities with conflicting ideologies, with a priest caste making most earthly decisions. The deities are well-meaning, but shortsighted and impulsive. The wisest of them are the ones who learned how to find competent, trustworthy high priests to compensate for their own shortcomings. The job of a high priest is to curb your god's excesses and counter-productive impulses (eg "I know You were gravely slighted, but we *really* shouldn't go to war with this other country right now") while still convincing them that you're trying to serve them and advance their ideology.

    Having some weird form of fate might make any form of political decisions meaningless. 

    People just wait and see what's coming, going with the flow of history. Leaders are unnecessary as any conflict already has a predefined winner, and any civilizational development will happen regardless of what the humans plan for. 

    I guess this is similar to having a supreme deity, but more obscure.
