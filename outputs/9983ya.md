## [Meta] Distinction between rational/Rationalist fiction and "good" fiction?

### Post:

I've fallen in love with rational/ist stories. I'm sharing them with friends, and I had a friend make an point that I disagree with, but can't quite articulate.

He was saying that, based on the description in the sidebar, some comments on the topic by Eliezer Yudkowsky, and my own description, that the rational/rationalist subgenre (?) is just a fancy way of describing stories that are "done properly." That it's just a way to shit on other kinds of stories. That the tropes that are avoided are universally bad, so this is just a subsection of "well made fiction."

My perspective was that it was focused in a way that regular fiction isn't. He's agreed to read HPMOR (though I tried to suggest something shorter to start with (and maybe less "preachy" feeling)), so I bet that it'll give him a sense of the difference.

But it bothers me that I couldn't articulate the subject in a way that he could understand without examples.

Could anyone possibly give me some ways to make the distinction clearer? Obviously, it's a fuzzy boundary (I am of the understanding that the Dresden files, for instance, are borderline).

Thanks for any insights!

  Proof by contradiction: *Hamlet.*

  Certainly not rational fiction. Everybody in the play is irrational.

  Certainly "done properly", on every level I can think of, and several levels that probably only Eng. Lit professors know about.

    Excellent example! I'll have to remember that.

  My favorite distinction between rational fiction and good fiction is that rational fiction tries to actively reward thinking, either on the part of the characters or the reader. It is a *genre* that communicates what sorts of challenges the plot will contain and how the characters will have to overcome them: by using clear and demonstrable thinking, rather than physical might or social power or a triumph of will.

  Please have him read the updated sidebar, and please to offer his opinion on it. Let us know what he thinks. (There *will* be small tweaks to it in the near future as well, so any contribution from an outside perspective is genuinely useful)

  The problem your friend mentions is one of the primary reasons we changed the sidebar, after 5 weeks of deliberation, discussion and voting (you can see the final results and links to the previous weeks at https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/93aqlu/meta_rrational_characteristics_of_rational/ )

  To offer an example of what I consider excellent but non-rational fiction, consider "Lord of the Rings".
  ```

  - u/WanderingUncertainty:
    ```
    Another thought - based on some replies here, it might be a good idea to have a thing on the sidebar that lists some examples. Lord of the Rings, Hamlet, and Harry Potter are good examples of good fictions that aren't rationalist. The Dresden files are in the fuzzy zone, and plenty of others are, too, I'm sure - Flowers for Algernon, maybe.

      I still have to read up on the sidebar discussion (new job, getting up to speed) but have a virtual coffee, for clearly articulating what we should consider doing, as also illustrated by u/derefer being the top comment with his proof by negation.

      Caveat: this may have been discussed but seems like a good idea.

      Edit: u/ArisKatsaris If this hasn't been brought up (it's going to be two months to never, before I can give the sidebar discussion the level of attention it deserves, if I want to follow up on this idea, and you seem to care and have spent time on the effort); would you please follow up if this is an idea with merit, worth the effort, if a continuing improvement process has been instituted?

        >if a continuing improvement process has been instituted?

        I think the current sidebar is very much based around characters, and I like the Adjacent Tropes section more because it's slightly closer to the 'r!characters, r!world, etc.' paradigm.

  Nope. No way. I love rational and rationalist fiction, but Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite authors. Magical realism is about as far from rationality as possible, but his novels grasped me and pulled me in like nothing else. Heck, my username is based off "Cien años de soledad" The common thread is "meta-narrative is my drug of choice," but clearly it doesn't need to be rational to ensnare me.

    Oh man, I [*hated*](http://daystareld.com/review-100-years/) 100 Years of Solitude. Would be interested to hear what you enjoyed about it.

      Oh dang, the Pokemon Professor himself! Big fan, love the podcast, etc....

      To be fair, it's been almost a decade since the month I spent poring through the original version of the text, using a translation book to work my way through the novel. I came out of it feeling drained: the story started as a sprawling epic and ended like a Greek tragedy. It gave me the same feeling I felt so often with rational(ist) fiction: that your Ur-protagonist was careening toward a bad ending because they put emotional pragmatism and socipathy over social awareness and incorporating other people (and their emotions/values) into your model.

      I liked your review, and honestly, I need to reread the book to see if I feel the same in my 30s as I did in my early 20s. At the time it felt poetic and fatalistic. Not sure that would be the case nowadays!

        Got it, would love to hear what you think of it now, if you ever do a reread and analysis :) It's one of my step-brother's favorite books, but we have very different tastes, so it would be interesting to hear what someone who also enjoys rational-fic likes about it!

    So what *is* magic realism, anyway? The wikipedia page isn't very clear, and I haven't read 100 years of solitude or any of the other listed books.

      It's stories that aren't properly fantasy but aren't properly realist either. Usually they're set in the real world, but there are surreal or supernatural elements - however, they're not lampshaded or even drawn attention to, but they're just part of the reality everyone experiences. A big thing is also that they're not *explained* - they're lived on a spiritual/emotional level, not a rational one. If magic has rules, it's just science yet to be discovered, after all.

      Examples:

      - a story about a man seeing ghosts but it's all in his mind is realist
      - a story about a man seeing ghosts and finding out that he needs to exorcise them with a certain method or he will die is fantasy/horror
      - a story about a man going on about his normal life and meanwhile happening to see ghosts which is, like, the most natural thing in the world and doesn't surprise him in the least is magical realism.

      You want to read magical realism, I'd suggest Isabel Allende's "The House of the Spirits" or Italo Calvino's "Our Ancestors" trilogy (especially "The Cloven Viscount", one of my all-time favourites). Calvino's not classic magical realism - usually that's south american authors - but I think he too can be considered an expression of the genre.

      > So what is magic realism, anyway?

      Phinneas and Ferb is [considered an example](https://www.deviantart.com/tyrannotitan333/art/Magical-Realism-and-Phineas-and-Ferb-755095265).

      > Characters might discuss Phineas and Ferb doing extraordinary and impossible things on a daily basis, but the framing of the show never treats them like they’re fantastical or beyond this world. In a more realistic setting Phineas and Ferb would be hailed as child prodigies and use their inventing skills to rapidly advance the world’s technology and solve all our problems. The show however simply has them having fun with what they do or using their skills to help people like their friends. To Phineas and Ferb, defying the laws of reality is daily routine.

      Contrast to HPMOR:

      > "You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That's not just an arbitrary rule, it's implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And cats are COMPLICATED! A human mind can't just visualise a whole cat's anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what about the neurology? How can you go on thinking using a cat-sized brain?"

    Much appreciated!

    I think a lot of that boils down into, "rational (ist) fiction favors a certain subset of 'Cool Stuff,' which aligns with Good Writing in some ways (partially due to it being incompatible with certain forms of Bad Writing), but ultimately Brust's theory applies in that this specific subset only appears to be quintessentially Good Writing if you're the target audience, as it were."

    Which is a helpful perspective.

    I am sure he'll love rationalist writing, though, which is why the topic came up in the first place. He's convinced fanfics are universally awful, and that's why he's so curious about HPMOR. If he doesn't love it, I'll be sad. 

    I thought The Sword of Good was the best introduction, because it shifts from a parody non-rationalist story at the end, but for some reason, they keep deciding to do other things instead of reading it. It's like 20 minutes...

  Hmm, this is interesting. I think in many ways the best fiction has a lot of irrational actors, primarily driven by their emotions. Which is a good description of what humans and society really are, and in many cases rational characters don't exist in the real world. These irrational characters behave a lot like us and are relatable and deal with issues that face a lot of us in many ways, many of them poorly.

  For a great example, I'm gonna go with TV, Bojack Horseman is something I'd say has a lot of irrational characters dealing with depression, ennui and unhappiness and most can't articulate their thoughts and actions well, but behave in relatable ways. Bojack doesn't solve any of his issues by thinking about anything rationally and his betrayals, breakups and friendship's don't make a lot of outward sense. But it speaks to that depressed and destructive side of us. Other books like catch 22 god of small things, the sellout are some great novesl that have characters primarily driven by emotion.

  Rational fiction is still a young genre in many ways and to criticise it, is to criticise something that is not quite fully formed. A lot of the work doesn't quite approach anything resembling literature and they are in many ways superior versions of pulp fiction. By ensuring there are no idiot balls and Deus ex machinas there are no distractions to the reader and by generally having great flow with plenty of foreshadowing it's very narratively satisfying. The trope lampshading is a cheap source of humour and has become a bit of a hallmark but doesn't inform. Conflict is primarily driven by agents with opposing goals rather than emotional conflict.

  I find that as much as I love rational fiction, I also find myself unable to relate to any of the characters in any way. The only exception has been worth the candle, in which we have a lot of hallmarks of rational fiction and emotional conflict is present in allies rather than enemies. But this too has a very large overarching plot, a call to action and high stakes. Add: Twig is a much better example, though again a huge overarching plot is required.

  Are there other recognised works of literature that I'd consider rational? Of all my reading, I'd be hard pressed to even find a rational character in traditional literature, with Sherlock being the closest and only one I can think of, though maybe others may have thoughts.

  Overall, i think your friend is not wrong - rational fiction is definitely fiction done right, but I also think rational fiction is still finding it's feet and a lot of the work is more comparable to pulp fiction that established lit.

  A "good" story is one that achieves its goal. That goal might be simply to let the reader down an enjoyable path, it might be to preach an ideology, it might be to expose a hidden truth, or to teach a simple lesson.  A good story will keep its audience engaged until the end, and, if there is some lesson or message to convey, will get that message across to the reader, if only subconsciously.

  For example: HPMOR is a rational story because its protagonists and antagonist act rationally in pursuit of their goals.  It is a *rationalist* story because it preaches the benefits and methods of rationality.  It is a *good* story because people enjoy reading it through to the end, and, when they put it down, want to think more rationally themselves.

  Terry Goodkind's *Wizard's First Rule* (the first Sword of Truth book), though not rational, is a good book.  It's enjoyable to read, and gets the author's message across that you need to make sure you're not just reacting emotionally to what you've been told, believing it because you want it to be true or are afraid that it's true.

  *Confessor*, by the same author (the final book in the same series), is a preachy, logically inconsistent mess.  It is *not* a good book.  I didn't really want to read the pages-long speech that the character directed at the audience; having read it, I don't want to read it again, and, far from adopting the views of that character, I think he's *monumentally* stupid for believing them.  The book fails utterly, both as an enjoyable read and as a vehicle to spread the author's personal ideology.

  You can have good stories that aren't rational, radical stories that aren't good, and stories that are both, or neither.  I think that most stories can be made *better* by having rational plots and characters, but, beyond that, the quality and rationality of a story aren't related much.

  Does your friend understand tropes? 

  I ask because rational fiction does things because of reasons, instead of because of tropes.  Good thinking is not just first layer pattern matching. Whether defying tropes because the world runs on detail, is a definition of "good fiction" or not, says more about the critic making the judgment's personal taste than the about the fiction.  

  I hope that helps.

  I'd actually recommend Metropolitan Man over HPMOR. The latter is a bit too preachy and has a weak start.
