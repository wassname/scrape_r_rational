  While I enjoy the possibilities unfolding, I would really like to see some meaningful decisions or actions. in the next few chapters. It feels that aside from Celeste's thing we've just got background info for 5 chapters straight at this point.

    I appreciate the constant feedback, Sonder! It’s really helpful, and good motivation to keep writing and getting better. 

    I started this project to work on my writing chops, but it’s become a whole world to me. I’m hoping to get to a point where I can successfully share that with all of you  in a compelling fashion, and the comments and critiques are all incredibly helpful for that goal.

      I'm glad that my feedback is adding to your writing experience. I know that feedback can sometimes be too much though so please do let me know if you prefer more support rather than suggestions. The world is really fascinating and I look forward to where you go with it.
