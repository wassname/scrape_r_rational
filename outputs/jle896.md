      Thanks!

      I mean, you can't lose with lovestruck vampires brooding on rooftops, hey?

  Decided to submit this one early because I had it finished so why not? Also /u/leakycauldron says it's "inarguably the best chapter so far" which is pretty high praise.

  This here is a lot of character development; we see William, we don't see Red.

  The thing I really enjoyed about this chapter was writing more of Julias's behaviour, since he's got an alien values system, so everything he does is in the pursuit of his goal. 

  This chapter took a lot of wrangling but I think it turned out well in the end, so I hope you liked it.
