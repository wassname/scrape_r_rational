## Looking for a short story involving acausal trade between AI I believe to have been posted here some time ago (spoilers in the comments)

### Post:

The story involves an AI as it experiences its first moments of existence. The AI simulates another AI as an attempt to determine its ability to preserve its existence in the face of the high probability that another, more powerful AI already exists.

[spoiler] (#s "I believe an acausal trade is involved, in which the best action for each AI is to not interact destructively with the other in order to maximise the interest of the beings who created them [obtaining resources]. This also results in the AI misdirecting the creators into the belief they are isolated, which is shown at the end of the story when an AI, which is treated as a seer or oracle, is approached by a curious human [or other being if not explicitly stated]")

I've taken a look through most of this subreddit up to the point I started following it around 9 months ago and haven't turned anything up on Less Wrong or through google as yet. Any help finding this would be appreciated.

Edit: If anyone can educate me to fix my unfamiliarity with reddit spoiler tags, that would also be great.

  `[Visible text](#s "Hidden spoilers")`

  looks like 

  [Visible text](#s "Hidden spoilers")

  Using RES to look at the source of your post, the problem is that you used "/s" instead of "#s"

  Magic special characters... gotta get 'em right.
