## [META] Definition of [RT] (rational) vs [RST] (rationalist)?

### Post:

According to the dictionary they are synonyms, but in this forum they are treated differently. I think it's a good idea to put a clear definition in the wiki.

  Rationalist means it's an explicitly didactic work, that's about it in practice.

  > Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.

    I guess that would also be true for 99% of rational fiction, no?

      No, I'd say rationalist fiction is pretty rare. In fact, I'm struggling to name a mainstream novel that's rationalist off the top of my head. It's certainly not an almost full Venn diagram overlap between the genres.

      Think of the focus of the story in terms of solving the puzzle vs actively trying to  become a better thinker (and then *maybe* solving the puzzle).

  ```
  Rational = rational world, Rationalist = Rationalist characters
  ```
