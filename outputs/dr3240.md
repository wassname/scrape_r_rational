  It is very reader-unfriendly to have tiny text on a huge image. If you want to get more people to read through your systems, I would recommend at least placing them in a text repository like pastebin or in a comment here.

  Hello fellow rationalists!

  Faith system is a setting I've been working on for several years now. The basic idea is that reality in a given location is dictated by pervasive beliefs of sentient minds in that location, so you end up with a world where people in different regions hold different beliefs, and thus their region - called a dominion - and their region's magic system, politics, ethnicity, and culture all reflect that. Here I present twenty magic systems, each in their own region, each subordinate to the overall faith system, and a detailed description of what the magic system is like in each dominion.

  I'm looking for ways each of the dominions' magic systems can best be exploited / made to be broken by some mage in the setting that knows what they're doing and can think rationally about their situation; or if you have any critiques in general. Thanks!

    This looks interesting, but can you give us the text in a regular text format as opposed to reading it off of the (beautiful, enormous) image?

    I understand your meaning, but I'm going to put a nickel in the pedant jar and suggest that *sapient* is the word you want, not *sentient*, unless the wildlife has an impact on the local magic somehow. See
    https://grammarist.com/usage/sentience-vs-sapience/ for a reliable-looking Google result explaining the difference.

      Ah good catch, I did not know that! Yep definitely meant sapient then!

  This setting would lend itself to motivated belief and schisms within each belief.  You should end up seeing central power groups propogating new versions of a belief to change the way their magic works and you should see magic systems changing and working differently within a single dominion.  You might see more gradual gradients between systems akin to something like the romance languages?  Your 20 totally different systems doesn't seem like a very likely outcome?  


  How did these systems first arise?  Was there originally no magic and these were the original religious beliefs of each country then yeah something like this could happen.  Does seeing a magician from a rival sect perform magic make someone switch their allegiance?  Obviously they would "believe" in what they just saw with their own eyes

    > You should end up seeing central power groups propogating new versions of a belief to change the way their magic works

    One of the things I didn't go into much detail in this post is that one can't intentionally go about changing one's beliefs to try to manipulate reality. Their knowledge that they're making it up would counteract it. 

    > You might see more gradual gradients between systems akin to something like the romance languages? Your 20 totally different systems doesn't seem like a very likely outcome?

    I do want to have geographically close dominions have similar philosophies. Hence the 4 orientalist dominions are close to each other, as they share ideas like qi, Faeralism being close to Sigilism being close to Traceism, Dreamism being on its own, etc. I don't want there to be too many dominions since when writing a story in this setting I want each dominion to feel distinct, and having too many can get too difficult for readers to follow ("which sect of which dominion are we in again?"). 

    > How did these systems first arise?

    These arose spontaneously through people having certain beliefs due to random chance (praying to a storm god and there happening to be peaceful skies that day causing them to strengthen their belief in a storm god) and then the beliefs getting more complicated as more sub-beliefs get tacked on. I call it "fortufaction". There's also "manufaction" where someone consciously creates a new faith (but for this new belief to have actual magical power, that can only happen once the founder has died). Manufaction requires careful setup and some luck because if you as the founder claim that act X causes magic Y and your followers try it before you're dead, it'll fail and they will cease to belief that claim.

    Where? Would a visiting magician's magic even work in your dominion? If you're visiting their dominion, you'd see everyone doing it, so you might believe in it, while also believing in your home style of magic, thus weakening that dominion.

    A viable tactic would be just sending a significant fraction of your population to another dominion to dilute the belief there.

  Namism and Nobleism are the same, is that intentional?

  Soulism: can soul mages put souls into recently-deceased bodies?
  ```

  - u/luminarium:
    ```
    Yeah totally missed the Namism and Nobleism issue, I have the actual description in the text link in my post.

    Soulism: yep, also sealing them into long deceased bodies, the idea is this setting is one where liches and necromancers run rampant with armies of re-embodied souls-in-reanimated-bodies.

  Are the people aware how it works?

  If so - religions/mages would bribe people to become followers, and the system that gives the most benefits to most people would monopolize the continent.

  "Have you heard of omnipotentism? Everybody is omnipotent. Just sign here and enjoy! \*small restrictions may apply"

  Also - what is the cutoff point? I know you wrote about flexible borders, but you need a cutoff for how many people-beliefs create a domain and how many doesn't. If there's no cutoff and you only have linear combination of people and their belief - the whole world should be 1 big domain, or everybody should be their separate domain, anything in between needs some kind of granulization in the system (cut off or special kind of sampling).
  ```

  - u/luminarium:
    ```
    > Are the people aware how it works?

    Most people wouldn't, however all the people "at the top" are "in the know" (and it is their being at the top, i.e. ascended, that allows their belief about how the faith system works, to "realize" the faith system itself). 

    All the faiths are (to varying degrees) aggressive about attracting and keeping followers, defending against other faiths, attacking weaker faiths, inoculating followers from converting to other faiths, monitoring and enforcing the faith of their followers, and hunting down heretics and those who would try to convert others. (Any faith that didn't do this would go extinct.)

    There's a kind of "power limit" tradeoff in each system. If a dominion had both the idea that everyone could become powerful and the idea that powerful meant nigh-omnipotent, only one of these would be realized, this is enforced by the overarching faith system. Then either the dominion changes to be one where people believe the former, or it becomes one where people believe the latter.

    At any location, the dominion that wins out is the one that the locals believe (subject to things like certain individuals' faiths being overweighted). The closer the believers of a domain are to a location, the more "dominion pressure" they can exert on that location, to influence its faith.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      So, it’d be possible to have a functioning system where everyone has trivial, easy access to it, but a relatively low power level? And would this power level scale with the population of believers, or remain fairly constant? 

      I feel like a system where most people have some magic would spread a lot more than one where only a few will get any and they’ll get a lot, in part because the former means you’ll see magic on a daily basis and you’re more likely to want to continue to believe if you can do it yourself. Also, it’s more conducive to armies. Although, depending on the upper limit of power, small numbers of royalty/mages could be just as effective as an army in a more concentrated system.

        On the other hand, second generation people using this system may feel stifled by the limited power of the system compared to the obvious power of other systems, and feel like they could become more powerful elsewhere..

      >Most people wouldn't, however all the people "at the top" are "in the know"

      This feels inconsistent. As your comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dr3240/faith_multimagic_critiquetry_to_break_up_to_20/f6ksaor/) implies, anyone with a knowledge of inter-faith warfare would be well aware that the power of a magic system is largely dependent on the number of similarly-talented mages present, rather than intrinsically tied to location. Assuming that at least some people who engage in such warfare survive and interact with civilians afterward, this should be fairly common knowledge.

      >All the faiths are (to varying degrees) aggressive about attracting and keeping followers, defending against other faiths, attacking weaker faiths, inoculating followers from converting to other faiths, monitoring and enforcing the faith of their followers, and hunting down heretics and those who would try to convert others. (Any faith that didn't do this would go extinct.)

      The paradox contained in this worldbuilding is that if reality changes to conform to faith, then once reality has conformed, *it no longer requires faith by definition.*

      What does it mean to "convert" to a "faith" that believes exactly what reality presents? Any mage of any system can prove to a non-mage that their "faith" is real and correct, as long as they're in their dominion, so the farthest anyone could reasonably go toward "disbelief" is thinking that a system's strength is linked to the location of the user (which is still at least partially correct).

      The kind of militant policing you describe would be pointless, because everyone would already "believe" in every magic system they'd witnessed, and non-mages would simply not believe themselves capable of performing magic themselves.

  The descriptions are vague and need quantification to make this easier. That said:

  **Tapestrism:** Depending on how karma works, you might be able to make a death cycle of infinite sin, like in the end of The Study of Anglophysics. E.g. go to an orphanage, collapse a floor with your telekinetic powers, get karma for the dead orphans, repeat, move on to next building, repeat until leveling cities...

  **Bloodism:** Wouldn't whaling realistically be a higher-volume, cheaper, easier, and less-likely-to-lethally-backfire source of blood than international kidnapping?

  **Dreamism:** Vague as heck, but lucid dreams are probably the easiest way to hack this regardless of the specifics.

  **Yin-Yang (typo???) -ism:** Again, way too vague. Provide a spell list or something and it might be possible to find exploits (aside from being genderfluid and flipping every 12 hours, which also neatly avoids the psychoactive effects).

  **Blasphemism:** Again, demonic reality warping is too vague. Tapestrism synergy?

  **Evocationism:** 

  >Evocation can also be used for affinity with people in order to manipulate them, sense their thoughts and emotions etc, 

  Blasphemism synergy.

  >People can use spirit stones to try to accelerate the rate at which they absorb qi. However this is forcefully over charging a person's natural capacity and is thus very unnatural, and can hamper a person's ability to attune with nature. 

  So find a way to transfer qi from person to person, maybe? Or would that run into the same problem?


  **Namism:** I hereby name Namism! Jokes aside, obvious Blasphemism synergy. The description is pretty vague, but it sounds like a straightforward way to power e.g. a factory or ship.

  >The true name sounds to everyone to be simply the common name of the thing, one can never hear the true name being spoken or written, this makes it impossible to know a true name without proper attainment.

  Break with Dreamism or Evocationism?

  **Soulism:** Gender reassignment, selling youth/beauty, have a minion possess a whale and keep it in one location so you can periodically drain some of its blood for sale to the Bloodists. Put the whale soul in the minion's body when it isn't in use. 

  >the soul mage can consume their soul, adding their paths to the soul mage's own.

  Become soul mage --> find another, weaker soul mage (or one who's sleeping or something) --> consume soul, gaining better soul powers --> repeat.

  **Attributism:** Have a Soulist put a jumping spider soul (or something) into a human body, then steal reaction time. Same thing for sperm whales and total mental computation rate, octopus and focus, etc. Become a superhuman intelligence. 

  >pull information right out of their subjects' minds,

  NAMISM SYNERGY!!!!!!!

  >Mages may even be able to draw out and steal an enemy mage's magical power and mana in this manner. 

  First Soulism, now this...

  **Sandism:** Mage powers too vague. 

  >Adventurers who happen upon the uncovered ruins explore the uncovered desert ruins within this narrow span of time, oftentimes having to fight against the mummified or desiccated, skeletal remains of the living dead within these ruins,

  Obvious immortality route for power-stealing disciplines. 

  **Faeralism:** Okay, but in terms of *specific* powers? At any rate, soul-swapping faera with something easy to feed might be useful.

  **Elementalism:** Again, not really sure what this *does*. 

  >This excess provokes heavenly tribulation from heaven's will,

  Then do so deep underground \s.

  **Nobleism:** Does the Spirit of the World object to Powergaming? At any rate, more houses' powers would be useful.

  >Related imperial powers include seduction, mental influence via whispering, and **awaking the dead.**

  Steampunk industrial necromany! Skeletal horses turning wheels as power sources! Undead whales producing more economically important whale blood without needing to be fed!

  **Runism:** What do runestones do?

  >The northern side of the Spire is permanently enveloped in the Mist Wall and the Spire is believed to hold up the Roof of the World.

  Cool! Let's have our Bloodists burn twenty kilotons of zombie whale cruour and blow up the base in order to cause Doomsday!

  >Those caught in such a storm can be left trapped and frozen in blocks of pure ice for all time. 

  Cryonics!

  >the more dangerous the climb, and the more powerful the runes granted

  So trying to exploit this is like inventing a cheap diamond-making process in D&D to provide material components for spells. The spell requires a certain stable price's worth of diamonds and the physical mass needed grows. Unless you can metagame and work out the specific way that danger is calculated...

  **Prayerism:** Kinda antitheist. Anyways, get Tapestrists to connect themselves with those who will probably go to hell in order to summon them back. Better yet, pray a Tapestrist connected to another Tapestrist into heaven, have the heaven Tapestrist entangle with various expensive heavenly objects, have the ground Tapestrist recall the heaven one, and have the now-recalled heaven one summon back the expensive heavenly objects.

  **Manacitism:** 

  >Over time and as they are used, the gems lose their light, which limits how long and how deep an expedition can delve. Expeditions have to keep this in mind as if they use up all their light sources while still delving, they're doomed. 

  A lot of the other magical traditions have ways of generating lots of light. If I was the Sentai lord, then I'd establish a pipeline of zombie whale blood running from the surface to the deepest depths of the underground, allowing Bloodism-illuminated fortified outposts where lighting supplies are exchanged. Or if Bloodism doesn't work that way, use natural gas instead.

  **Channelism:** 

  >The presence of qi in various places influences the kind and quantity of wildlife present there, and makes certain kinds of magic more powerful and others less powerful.

  Channelstan: where the whales are numerous and engorged with blood and the Bloodists function at high efficiency. The effect can get arbitrarily high if any of various immortality methods are employed. Probably also synergistic with Faeralism.

  **Traceism:** Nothing stands out, too vague.

  **Sigilism:** Way too vague.

  **Spiritism:** 

  >Their elven ears allow them to understand the language of beasts and critters

  SNAKES ARE SENTIENT?!? (c.f. HPMOR when Harry learns of Parseltongue)

  >Some elves are able to cause creatures to morph into other forms (eg. Tougher and more dangerous forms), or to animate plants, cause roots to burst forth from the ground, etc.

  The zombie whale blood thickens. Same industrial power from plant manipulation as with necromancy. Expedited construction?

  >The elves believe themselves to be the children of Gaia, Mother Nature, and that the spirits have minds of their own, and that sufficient disruption of nature will cause the wrath of the spirits, causing roiling elemental storms and Awakening earth.

  ANOTHER ludicrously powerful entity dedicated to slapping down munchkins?!? I wonder how many Imperials one would need to control the mind of the Earth herself...










  Oh, and are all forms of mana and qi interchangeable? Because if so, things get easier to manipulate.

  I was thinking about something similar recently (magic being created by beliefs and bound to areas where those beliefs are held in mass) and I encountered a weird potential problem. Basically, can a dominion's magic only be accessed within the specific dominion? What if two dominions are waring, does the one on offense basically lose their ability to use magic once they get into the other dominion? This seems to me like it would have a huge impact on how war is conducted and probably result in a focus on non-magical weaponry and/or isolationist policies.

  - u/corneliuspudge:
    ```
    Not OP, but how viable is the line of reasoning that enemy combatant's belief in the magic sustains its effect? What's the population density threshold for making magic work? Because I think there's cool stuff you could do with that.

    As an army starts dying, the magic starts weakening as there are fewer and fewer soldiers to sustain it? Ooh, or a side that weaponizes non-believers. People raised in isolation, with no idea other non-regional magic exists, and buffing out the army with them to dilute the enemy's power.

    Interesting to hear how you chose to resolve this question in your setting!

    I want my setting to have several things, which inform how I chose to resolve this question: 1) select (POV) individuals being able to use the magic they'd mastered in one dominion, in the next dominion they visit, giving continuity to their powers and showing clear progression as well as the ability to synergize multiple kinds of magic, plus being able to awe / surprise everyone else in the dominion who had come to expect only their own kind of magic; and 2) inter-dominion mass battles featuring different magic from each side (think Illwinter's Dominions or Total War Warhammer II); and 3) mages going too deep into enemy dominion finding their magic (without sufficient faith support) no longer works, and potentially getting routed.
