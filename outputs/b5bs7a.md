  **Webfic**

  I've been reading random stuff on r/HFY. 

  [They Are Smol](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q6K5WuZVMlAYdohcz19dt0fwOMzabuAzjZLAb1v6yxs/edit#gid=0) (link goes to master catalog, They are Smol is the complete first book, Invasion of earth is ongoing prequel, of the rest I highly recommend reading the official oneshots and The Smol Detective, which the orinigal author canonized.) is a really fun universe that's gained a cult following on HFY, and has attracted quite a few fanfics. The general story is, humanity made first contact. The other three races have huge empires with trillions of citizens, thousands of worlds, and to top it off, they're all much larger than humans. After accidentally invading Atlanta (long story), they've been doing their best to keep humanity from collapsing, and getting humanity integrated into their society. Also, all the alien species find humanity adorable. The series is hilarious, and definitely worth trying out.

  [HEL jumper](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/7oulr8/oc_the_hel_jumper_chapter_1/)'s a decent WAFFy story about a guy stranded on alien planet getting a catgirl waifu, but there's a huge amount of worldbuilding and sidecharacter arcs to make it good. It's really, really slow though in terms of pacing, so it's not for people who don't have the patience for a lot of character growth arcs.

  [This Has Not Gone Well](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/) is a fun story loosely based on things from the GURPS game system. It's heavily inspired by HPMOR's general idea of using cleverness and the power of science to make magic better. I'm not completely sold on the second book since it feels like a setting reset to keep the MC out of the political arena, but the first one was absolutely golden and up there along Mother of Learning and Schooled in Magic.

  **Books**

  Last month I caught up on the book series [Earthcent Ambassador aka Union Station](https://www.goodreads.com/series/161822-earthcent-ambassador). It's a great series of light adventures set on a space station. Each adventure is fairly well contained, but over the course of the 20 novels the main character gets married, has two kids, and matures into the role of an experience ambassador, and there's a satisfying cast spread with quite a few side character arcs. There's also a strong amount of creative worldbuilding that's always around, but never drowns out the action.

  I've been on a kick of Urban Fantasy novels with a mundane protagonist, purely out of coincidence. [Guild Codex: Spellbound](https://www.goodreads.com/series/230305) has a mundane woman end up as a bartender for a magical guild, and ends up making friends and gets involved in the magical world far more than is legal or wise. It's light hearted and not really dark at all even with the informed ruthlessness of some characters. There's a minor bit of romance, but it's not a driving factor in the stories.

  [Ester Diamond](https://www.goodreads.com/series/44055) feels a lot like the Doctor Who and mundane companion in an urban fantasy setup, with the main character being the mundane companion like with Sherlock Holmes. This series is more rigidly a murder mystery series, so is darker in places. There's some romance drama in the main plot, but it's not a constant thing.

  I just finished the first book in [Magebreakers](https://www.goodreads.com/series/227285-magebreakers), The Flaw in All Magic, and it's probably the closest thing I've seen to a rational protagonist in published fantasy. Tane was a magical genius who was expelled by the university of magical technology after it came out that he didn't actually have any magical ability of his own. He made up for this by learning the spells anyway, and basically cheating the system with artifacts. Just because he can't cast spells doesn't mean he could design them, or take advantage of The Flaw In All Magic, that it was all written by mages, and mages aren't perfect. The first book was an awesome read, a bit magical heist, a bit magical mystery with a white hat hacker protagonist, and I'm hype for book two and three.

  **shows**

  Finished up Reincarnated as a slime. It's got a dumb title and the Main Character is stupidly OP, but it was a fun ride and I'm excited for season two, simply because it's got a powerful heart. [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsJ4aguEcNk) did a great coverage of how it's a rare gem in the isekai genre, and that's the video that convinced me to give it a try.

  Love, Death, and Robots was great for the most part. It had a few episodes that felt like mostly pointless demo reels, but I enjoyed most of the episodes.

  - u/Robert_Barlow:
    ```
    It's interesting for the mindfuck potential, but I think the idea fails from a literary perspective. We as the reader *know* the world we live in right now is real - the main character just *happening* to hallucinate the exact reality we live in, to a degree good enough to convince us in the first place, is too much of a coincidence to believe. It's the advanced version of some alternate history Earth happening to evolve English, independent of the original - only in the case of dream-skewering, it's been uplifted from "plot convenience" to "a huge, integral part of the story".
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Oh, but it doesn't *have* to be a pure coincidence. In a world with complex magic, it shouldn't be too SoD-breaking to introduce, let's say, a Cursed Crystal Ball of Alternate Possible Worlds which uses dark magic divination (or whatever) to rewrite people's minds with fake memories.

      And, if we broaden our requirements a little, even the Earth *itself* doesn't really need to be fake, just the protagonist's memories of it. That also could make for a couple of convincing scenarios.

    [ManMagnificent](https://forums.spacebattles.com/members/manmagnificent.359488/) recently started a fic called [Aspect](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au.724264/), which crosses over HP, Worm, Pact, and Twig.  The whole point of him writing the fic is to get the voices and personalities of the characters right.

    >Elevator Pitch: Protagonists from the HP, Worm, Pact and Twig are flung back into child bodies a few months before their first year at Hogwarts. There's more going on, other facets (this might have been a good title, but I'm already sold on aspects), but those are better explored in story.

    When he says other facets, he means how some elements from each of Wildbow's fics got half fused into this AU. Yet, it still feels like Harry Potter, but also like Worm, and Pact, and Twig.

    I mention it because it's an active HP/Worm cross, but I feel like Taylor's character is very accurate. More so than A Wand for Skitter, anyway (though I do really like that fic too).

    I'd also recommend all of ManMagnificent's [other fics](https://forums.spacebattles.com/search/member?user_id=359488&content=thread), especially [Reprieve](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/reprieve-mcu-worm.646409/) (MCU/Worm), and [Cycle Eternal](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cycle-eternal-naruto-worm.660329/) (Naruto/Worm).

      I mean it has been several chapters and she has only released the bees on one person. Seems like she actually toned it down, possibly due to lack of opportunity and a shortage of bees. I would agree she has a different tone than in canon and is more overtly threatening/manipulative but pretty sure she was already as ruthless as it gets. It is low on chapters, but it is being updated very quickly.

    Having read A Wand For Skitter, and another one of ShayneT's older stories, [The Many Deaths of Harry Potter](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter) I can tell you that his style gets predictable very fast. 

    Redeeming qualities:

    1. He doesn't seem as ardent about bashing as most people are, nor as beholden to fanon.
    2. His "gritty" take on the setting makes the antagonists properly threatening.
    3. He only has the occasional spelling/grammar error.

    Cons:

    1. Despite being *more* even handed than usual, he still doesn't really give Dumbledore or Ron a fair shake.
    2. He has a habit of making the world gritty, but he forgets to make any other adults or students smarter to compensate.
    3. His habit of sorting people into Slytherin is about as endearing as Slytherin itself, and it was a stale plot idea long before he got to it.
    4. Reading twenty straight chapters where Harry spends the *avoids* making friends because of paranoia isn't very fun.
    5. On a similar note, he doesn't understand how to write relaxing scenes, or scenes where anything funnier than a minor gag happens.

    He's a decent fanfiction author. Not decent enough to have had an idea I would consider original, but decent enough that I don't feel slimy reading his story. The most remarkable thing about his writing is how he managed to sort Harry into Slytherin, but avoid most of the things that make Dark!Harry fucking intolerable, like when the author bashes characters, or when they are so busy trashing on the heroes of the original story they forget about Voldemort. Still, when you sort Harry into Slytherin and take away the edginess, what you get is a boring, humorless mess - in a setting that was designed for satire, comedy, and adventure.

    So far, A Wand For Skitter seems like more of the same. I read >!post-Gold Morning!< *Worm* fanfiction for the sake of watching a character that I like heal and grow into a better person. If I wanted to read Taylor going into a downward spiral through some violent and unpredictable scenario, I would read canon, or one of the many crossovers with which a gritty attitude makes the setting more interesting. (A setting needs to be designed, or at least redesigned, for the purpose it is used for. Shayne doesn't do this enough, and neither do most HP authors.) Taylor's self-serving attitude is at odds with her characterization in literally all of the original Worm. When she was ruthless, she was either doing it out of a misguided sense of altruism, or for the sake of her friends. The "what does this spell do" followed by "can I weaponize it" thought process is not only trite, it's also a complete mischaracterization. Taylor is the queen of Mundane Utility - she uses her bugs to flip light switches and kill mosquitoes.
    ```

    - u/andor3333:
      ```
      Authors can definitely have a habit or be better at writing some things than others. Still maybe let them write the new story before judging it on a past story? None of your criticisms seem to apply to the current story except the sorting which is a style choice and was the latest chapter so nothing has happened with it yet. Its been a year since they wrote the last fic and it has a different main character. Having read only the new one I thought it was pretty good so far. In this story she was being ruthless either to defend herself from people literally hunting her down or for protection of the other students who would be attacked. Where is she being ruthless to be ruthless here?

      Also if I could sum up Taylor's combat strategy "Can I weaponize it" is a perfect fit. I could name 100 examples of her weaponizing absolutely everything. Meanwhile I don't want to start an argument in this thread about whether fanon whitewashes Taylor but in canon she was a terrifying person who did some terrible things. The right things for all the wrong reasons. She seems justified and always has no choice but to do them because the point of view we see is hers.
      ```

      - u/Robert_Barlow:
        ```
        >Where is she being ruthless to be ruthless here?

        It's the little things. >!Threatening Snape with a knife well after he established that he was non-hostile.!< The constant skepticism about stations of canon, like the Hogwarts Express and Sorting Hat, up to and including *inventing* reasons for her skepticism to be right all along. >!(The trace being applied on the Hogwarts Express is fanon. Monitoring magic doesn't need to be cast on a person in order to monitor them, see: Voldemort making his name Taboo.)!<  And yes, inventing ways to hurt people with common spells. I get that fanon has a tendency to make Taylor look perfect in retrospect, but that's not what I'm saying. Canon Taylor was creative with the resources she had *universally*. She wouldn't *just* use her bugs for combat, or to hurt people. She'd find ways to blind, disable, eavesdrop and mislead. Or she'd use them to communicate. In this story, she considers escalating to lethal force several times in her internal monologue, when in canon it was always an exceptional circumstance that forced her into that sort of thing. 
        >Yet if I was a criminal mastermind, I wouldn't trust anyone who wouldn't let me read their mind. I'd insist on it, even if I had to force them at weapon point.

        >Or I'd just kill them.

        That's the kind of thought I wouldn't expect Taylor to have in a million years - she *was* a criminal mastermind, yet the only ground rules she gave her minions was to not be dickwads. Even the minions that violated those rules and held her at gunpoint only got chased off.
        ```

        - u/andor3333:
          ```
          You might want to spoiler out some of this. Also notice the example you gave of being ruthless is Taylor imagining what she would do if she were Voldemort. Anyway I donâ€™t want to clutter the thread. We can agree to disagree and I did mention above the tone isnâ€™t perfect.
          ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          This Taylor went straight from being shot by Contessa (and the alienation from humanity she was experiencing at that moment) to the alley. The removal of QA from her brain might be the only reason she's even appreciably human right now, and she's way more traumatized now than she ever was in canon, even if she doesn't realize it. I think even more paranoia than usual makes some sense.
          ```

        - u/andor3333:
          ```
          So a few more chapters are posted now. You were right... Ruthless Taylor is ruthless.
          ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        It's definitely true that Taylor weaponizes everything, but she doesn't literally think "can I weaponize this" as she does. She also wouldn't feel the need to announce the fact that she can weaponize something to a potential enemy, both because she doesn't think of herself that way and because it would put her at a strategic disadvantage.

    Mob Psycho 100 is similar to One Punch Man, with an extremely powerful protagonist who's a bit odd. Made by the same author. It's a bit more serious though and has school life B plots.

  Second season of 'Mob Psycho 100' is almost done. This is the first anime since maybe Full Metal Alchemist where I fully appreciate the characterization and the storytelling. To be honest, I have generally very little respect for ~~Japanese~~ anime/manga/light novel writing, but this series is fantastic in every way.  No fan service or cliches, lots of kickass, movie quality art and action sequences, and the whole thing is a very clever subversion of the typical shounen anime, while still being itself a good rendition of a shounen. 

  I wouldn't say it's a rational world, but the characters and story are somewhat rational.

    I love Mob Psycho for its amazing animations, charismatic characters, and the whole playing around with the usual tropes.

    I'm kinda on the fence about the central theme of the story, though. The whole 'supernatural ability doesn't make you superior to other people' is a good moral lesson, sure, but it's taken to an unhealthy extreme in the show, with people acting as if being a talented ESPer *literally* doesn't matter and psychic powers shouldn't be used for your own gain even if they don't hurt anyone. Which is even more confusing when they directly compare supernatural abilities to mudane abilities, like athletic predisposition, and then applaud the Body Improvement Club for it or Mob for training his body, while criticising other characters for being proud of their psychic abilities and/or focusing on them. 

    Still, this whole contradiction is subtle enough that it might be just a quirk of translation, the author unintentionally being a little careless with writing, or just me reading too deep into things.

    (I did see similar sentiments on 4chan during the Mogami Arc, though.)

      I don't feel the same way about this. Mob's progression in the story seems to be in large part about him realizing that it's OK not to be scared of his powers, and that there are ways to use them to help people that he's uniquely capable of doing. The complete lack of munchkinism is more down to the allegorical nature of psychic powers.

      You're missing a key point that the whole thing is stilted by Mob's perception of values and goals. The whole point of ESP not making you a better person could be substituted with any exceedingly high natural talent. You could be a literal math prodigy or a body building monster, it's not what gives you your worth. It's your ability to communicate how you feel and reach out to others that makes you feel less lonely and brings you real happiness.

      The espers are never satisfied with what they have because there wasn't really all that much work put into achieving it. They don't get the satisfaction of having hard work paying off, which creates this dissonance in them. They hyper focus on one thing and that makes them incapable of empathizing with others. Mob's whole journey is to be able to relate to others despite his overwhelming talent which could naturally isolate him from everyone around him. But he pushes past that to focus on bettering himself in areas he is bad at. He WANTS to be better at things like socializing and even though he is initially terrible at it he doesn't shy away from his failures like the other espers do. THAT is the whole focus of the show, around which everything else is predicated. The minute you ignore that is the minute you lose track of why things are happening and nothing makes sense anymore.

      The whole point of the show is a kid with social anxiety pushing himself to succeed despite the fact that he's terrified of other people making fun of him for failing. The point of the Body Improvement Club is to show others that you can be humble and magnamimous in your success and there are people out there that WILL be genuinely invested in you bettering yourself. ONE took inspiration from real life gym friends and experiences to create the Body Improvement Club.

      Edit: I feel like I didn't address your point specifically enough. The difference between the BIC and the other espers is that they don't let their success in one aspect which they are naturally gifted stifle them elsewhere in life. This isn't covered as much in the show but in the manga they all have fulfilling goals they want to achieve in high school and are all working hard to meet those goals head on. They don't rest on their laurels, they use them for further motivation to succeed. 

      The whole point of the show is to show Mob that he CAN use his powers to benefit himself and others in a way that isnt self destructive or narcissistic. There's no need for a positive psychic role model because he already has Reigen advising him. 

      Furthermore many of the enemies Mob has faced have turned their lives around and became decent people using their powers for good.

    > To be honest, I have generally very little respect for Japanese writing

    Kind of a shallow thing to say imo. Most of the popular japanese media that get translated into english are for young adult audience, or are otherwise based more on popularity than critical acclaim. I wouldn't judge the whole of american cinema based on superhero movies, or writing based on whatever YA novel of the day is popular.

      You're right, I should have written specifically 'TV anime, manga and light novels'.  

      Thinking a bit about it, my impression is that it's mostly the fault of the of the manga/light novel industry. Because the market is so saturated and the margins are so small, most mangakas are great artists (they need to be, to get a shot) who have to write their own stories, which they are almost invariably bad at. They then have to resort to all the tired, overdone, but popular tropes. Basically all mangas tend to be high concept premises, which are then either extremely mass or extremely niche appeal. Since most anime is adapted from manga the bad writing is also reflected there. 

      ONE, who created One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100, is a shitty artist and an excellent writer whose works are both clever subversions of the most cliche'd anime tropes.  From what I can see this dynamic of great writer/shitty artist is non-existent otherwise. Even mediocre artist/great writer is very rare. The only reason he was able to stand out enough to get his works adapted is because he has a very popular webcomic, which caught the attention of an amazing artist, Yusuke Murata, who translated his scribblings to "proper manga quality".

        I kind of hope this sort of pairing happens more often.  You take two people, each of which has one really good talent, but each lacking another component.  Individually, they could each create decent works, but those works would have flaws due to the talents they lack.  Together they can combine their talents and make something amazing that has great art and writing.

        I hope that people hear of their story and pair up with people to overcome their flaws like this more often, but it requires a degree of humility to recognize what their own flaws are, and enough income to pay for both people to work on a single project, and enough raw talent in each individual person to convince other people that pairing up with them is worthwhile.

    Have you watched Hunter x Hunter? I'd say it's similar in fan service being fairly uncommon, great action, great plot, etc. It starts off a little weak but gets much better after the first few episodes.

    - u/GlueBoy:

      I watched the entire thing. I thought it was good, but not great. There were a lot of cliches and idiot ball moments. I liked the 'ending' a lot, even if it didn't provide closure.

    Does *Mob Psycho 100* pick up any as the series goes on? I loved One Punch Man (and FMA:B, for that matter) and am fond of anime in general, but found myself pretty bored after a few episodes of MP100. Dunno what about it didn't hook me.
    ```

      ```
      If episode 2s humor doesn't hook you then you probably won't enjoy the anime overall. Later you get to see more of the fantastic animation and more of the heart of the series, but if the humor doesn't hook you then you won't enjoy a lot of it.

      I didn't enjoy first few episodes all that much. It became better for me as people started getting characterization. 2nd season is especially good in that department.
