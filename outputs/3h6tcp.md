    I'd like to add that knowledge of the source material isn't required to enjoy it.

      Oh, thank god, I've wanted to read this for the longest time but I didn't want to watch Sailor Moon for it

        You can get by with basically no knowledge of either world. A few quick glances at the wiki and you're set, basically.

    Try [this](http://page2rss.com/0ff8bb3c441dc586101d6ed6c068feb8) feed. It's how I noticed this update. It detects every addition, including the ones not by Pusakuronu, but it's a far nicer system than checking the page intermittently IMO
