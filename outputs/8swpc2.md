  Your description had me interested, but the story itself didn't manage to keep it. 

  Thoughts while reading:

  Chapter 1: Boring repetitive background exposition. When will things start happening? Please show don't tell. 

  Chapter 2: Not interested in reading about a fetus. When is something going to happen?

  Chapter 3: Still nothing happening, more exposition, encountered phrase "Suffice to say" where you've summed up your own exposition, checking out.

  A modern man chased immortality and found it.  In a mixture of good and bad luck, he was re-born as part of the Uzumaki clan from the Naruto-verse, some few years before their scheduled destruction.  But if Daichi were the sort to allow a little thing like fate to get in his way, he'd never have survived in the first place.  Dedicated, intelligent, chock full of ideas from a technologically advanced society, and perfectly willing to scorch the earth, he sets out to avert history. 

  Can he avert canon, save the Uzumaki, and forge his people into a mighty nation?  Or will he fail, dooming his clan to extinction?

  At the end of the day, all he wants is a good life.  And considering even Death itself didn't stop him, he pities whoever gets in his way.

  Tags: Naruto, Reincarnation, OC, eventual multi-cross.

  Author's (Brief) Note:

  Back by popular demand.  This was my first significant fanfic (and fic in general).  I wasn't happy with the writing as time went on, and took it down, but years later am still getting requests to put it back up so I guess some people liked it. 

  Newly re-released as I finish some minor editing, there are about 100,000 words (~360 RRL pages) already written, so releases should be fast until I catch up with the backlog.  That said, it may languish in hiatus at that point if the interest isn't high enough to merit continuing, so if you're the type to only read finished stories (or ones where the author promises to do so), I am very specifically not promising that.  On the other hand, if enough people read, like, review, comment, rate, etc. then it will get added to my writing schedule.

  Generally, the character is based on a “how badass could someone who hasn't done ridiculously crazy shit be? Or, how does someone with the potential, in another setting, with a lot of luck, to be a badass act and develop as a modern, productive member of society? And then how would they deal with the Naruto-verse?”

  Please, please do not judge my writing by this.  Unless you really like it, in which case fine, do, but recognize my other writing is likely better (unless it’s that one MTG/ASoIaF/SW fic I did over on SB as a speed-writing experiment, which is also pretty terrible).
