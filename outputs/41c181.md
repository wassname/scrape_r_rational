  Interesting mark. The asymmetry might be a drain on Twilight's self-esteem itself. I wonder, why seven...

  It kind of looks like a turtle on another turtle that got run over.

  What could it mean? 7 is supposed to be a powerful magical number, according to numerology and basically every fantasy novel. 

  The characteristics of the number 7 on numerology.com seems to apply to Twilight's personality more than any other number, though I could be forcing it to fit to her personality w/o realizing. 

  The biblestudy website says "Seven is the number of completeness and perfection (both physical and spiritual). It derives much of its meaning from being tied directly to God's creation of all things."

  The black and the white are reminiscent of yin and yang, though the colors aren't on an equal footing here. Coincidentally, there are an even number of nubs on half the symbol, and an odd number on the other half. Yin is represented by even numbers and Yang by odd numbers. The top left would be yang then, which fits with how yin yang circles are typically represented.

  The circles with nubs look like gears. I'm not sure what that could mean beyond the obvious. 

  Take from this what you will.
