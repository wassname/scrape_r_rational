## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Scenario:

  Your body is de-aged to 8 years old, and you are dropped into the middle of a dank, dark alley in Gotham city with nothing but a swiss army knife and a raggy t-shirt and shorts. It is midnight. 

  Powers:

  1: You are immune to any and all powers that would influence or alter any and all aspect of your personality, including your moral compass and priorities. Your memory and skills can still be tampered with, you can be forced into unconsciousness, and your actual body can be puppeteered against your will, but other than that your are immune to all forms of mind control. As a side effect of this power, your core personality traits will never change naturally like those of other people, although your opinions, knowledge, and skills can still change and grow.

  2: In addition, you have powerful regeneration, but it only applies to your blood and skin. This means that you could deliberately bleed yourself out as much and as fast as possible, and you'd never even lose blood pressure, let alone bleed out, and that any and all wounds would be gone in 30 seconds maximum. As a side effect of this power, you never have to worry about high blood pressure. You are also immune to any and all bloodborne diseases, toxins, and drugs; anything that "shouldn't" exist in your blood is immediately destroyed.

  3: Due to mystical reasons, if 1 ml or more of your blood plasma is inside of another human body at any given time, they will be permanently put under the effects of this power. The following are the effects:

  * Their primary personality traits will be overwritten, and replaced with your primary personality traits and moral compass. Secondary personality traits, memories, skills, knowledge, etc. are left untouched. They also gain immunity to any and all effects that would influence or alter any and all aspect of their new personality.

  * If you have a line of sight to them, you will be able to instantly identify them as being under the effects of this power.

  * If they learn of you and/or your powers, they will not attempt to harm you or hinder you in your endeavors, even if they learn that they are under its effects. (Note that this does not allow you to mind control them or force them to aid you, it simply means they will not hinder you.)

  4: Lastly, You have an instinctive understanding of all your powers, and how to use and exploit them for maximum effect. 

  How do you go about minimizing Gotham's crime rate as fast as possible?

    I'd use this.

    > an instinctive understanding of all your powers, and how to use and exploit them for maximum effect.

    I mean, it may not be the answer you want, but if the process of getting the powers I also get an understanding of how to exploit them for maximum effect any plan I make now should be strictly inferior. Given I presumably got no warning to research Gotham before hand in comics, the clear answer is that I can't know in my current state.

    I'll simply utilize my new knowledge of how to use my powers to maximum effect to utilize my powers for maximum effect in decreasing the crime rate in Gotham.

      Well played, I didn't see that coming. 

      Assuming you don't get that power, what would your plan be? How would you go about staying under the radar, infecting the greatest amount of people the fastest, etc?
      ```

      - u/xavion:

        I mean, you have superhuman mental capabilities, it was the natural solution.

        That said, the simple solution, as right now time is a bit limited, figure out where Gotham's water supply is, bleed as much into it as possible. The lack of identity is one of the big issues, but assuming anyone who drinks it is motivated to help, or at least won't do anything to impede it then all you need is to try and get blood in. One milliliter isn't much, and spread out it won't even be noticeable.

        The crazy villain strategy is dig your way under the road next to a water bottling facility and carefully set yourself up to feed your blood into their water supply at a ratio of about 1ppt. Preferrably use your swanky villain tech to first make the blood as transparent as possible. Then just wait a while, of course the problem with said crazy plan is needing fancy tech, but hey, I'm an intelligent person who is a superhuman in DC, I'd be surprised if my mind hasn't suddenly turned into a supervillain right?

    I think the question to ask here is which Gotham are we talking about here? If we're in the DC universe then you will want to exploit your comics knowledge similar to parts of _This One Ring_.                    
    If you are in the DC-CU then there's a lot less to exploit, but you can still do quite a lot like convincing superman to do things like help with massive infrastructure projects, etc. However in those universes a mind control scheme probably wouldn't work as easily due to having to worry about superheros stopping you. Though with a fewer number of heros in the DC_CU you might be able to convince most people in the justice league to let you do tests on them (whose actual purpose is to inject them with your blood). Once you got superman and most the other very powerful members of the justice league you can forcefully take over any remaining heros as well as many supervillains.                                      
    If however you are in the dark knight universe then there's no magic so you can try your scheme more easily.

    Also what counts as a primary vs a secondary personality trait?                           
    Either way i'm still pretty sure people given my blood would help me, as they would also be primarily concerned with fulfilling my moral compass in the most efficient possible way, _and since you can affect more change if we're secretly in control of world governments_..

    As for Gotham's crime rate that's kind of an afterthought once you're in control of the world, but i'm sure if you wanted to waste money on fixing Gotham instead of much more efficient charitable causes you could probably do so. After all when you control nearly the entire world you can produce many billions of dollars probably quite easily.

    PS. So I did some research and over a year you should be able to safely extract over 36,000 ml of blood a year (well about half that early on as an 8 year old). So I could affect a massive amount of people, but with some planning I can vastly exceed this number.                    
    I should have around 6 liters of blood (well half as an 8 year old) so if I was routinely extracting all that blood every day and replacing it with donor blood then I could get an absurd amount, though realistically let's say about 3 liters so as not to waste too much donor blood since I will get diminishing returns as they mix in my body (how long does it need to be in my body to be considered "my" blood?). Anyway for 3 liters a day I could affect over 100,000 people a year, so I might be able to seriously affect Gotham's crime simply by affecting a massive number of it's criminals, and giving the rest cushy jobs with my nearly unlimited monetary resources.

  Reposting from last week, since I got in too late to get any responses.

  You have firm evidence (in the form of extensive documentation containing many easily-confirmed details, which may be used to solve a considerable number of old unsolved crimes) that a machine has been created which, given access to a sleeping person, will permanently make them obedient to the user of the machine (ie, they will follow any order to the best of their ability, regardless of their personal code), at the cost of a typically small but variable portion of their general intelligence. (In the vast majority of cases, the intelligence loss is hard but possible to detect; in rare positive cases it is entirely negligible and in rare negative cases it's an extreme effect that renders them completely incompetent.) You do not possess enough information to recreate the machine. You also do not possess enough information to determine what's happened to it - whoever currently has the machine has covered up their tracks well enough that your evidence does not lead you directly to them; the original inventors of the machine are dead or disappeared. What actions do you take and what protocols do you implement?

    Who am I? Sounds like someone in the executive branch.

    That machine sure sounds like it places an involuntary Occlumency barrier on your mind, forcing you to continually imagine perfectly how you would act if you were the person the machine describes to you.

    For all I know, 50% of the population are compromised. For all I know, I'm an Occlumency barrier and the actual me is waiting for me to think of pink elephants before Obliviating me.

    If orders conflict, do older or younger orders override?

    If this goes public, everyone and their dog needs to install 1984-level webcams in their bedrooms so law enforcement can supress any attempts at going Drug Lord. Prepare for abroad dictators and warlords to find their communism suddenly start working.
