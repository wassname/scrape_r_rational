## What happened to Glimwarden?

### Post:

There haven't been any new chapters in Glimwarden. Has the author abandoned it?

  It's on indefinite hiatus. I have the next two and a half chapters written, but I want to make sure that everything is in order before I start publishing again (since some of the problems I have with it now come out of just putting a chapter out because there was a deadline, rather than editing and refactoring until I was happy with it). Right now I'm thinking that I might just write up until the planned end of Book 1, then release that at a chapter a week. And then take another long hiatus so I can work on other things that caught my attention.

    In case that outrageous flattery helps your motivation, I really like Glimwarden and shall look forward to its continuation and any further works you do.

      In case it does help, I will chime in and say I completely agree.

    I wanted to share some Glimwarden fanart on the next thread update for the story, but since it's on hiatus, I'll post it here.

    Thanks for creating such an engaging world!!!

      That's really good :) Do you work professionally?

        I take commissions, but no, it's not my day job.

      This is great! It's always a little odd seeing someone else interpret my characters, since I have this clear mental image in my head, which has to meet up with that interpretation. And it gets reconciled in my brain a little bit, so the way of think of Sander is now closer to how you've portrayed him.

      Good work, and sorry about the hiatus.

        Thanks!

        I use written descriptions as a springboard to designing a character's look.  On a conscious level, I know that Sander has eyebrow-ish length blond hair, but when I pick up a pen to actually draw it, it turns out there's a lot of ways it can possibly look, while still being compliant with the story's description.  

        [**Here's**](http://i.imgur.com/fckRVCC.jpg) a character concept sketch I drew as a warm up a while ago.  Sander wears shirts and pants, Melanie wears a dress, Chloe wears Langust's armour, and because the story doesn't need to dwell on the details, the readers' imaginations can fill in the blanks between the concepts.  I enjoyed creating a visual that tries to match the atmosphere and feel of the Glimwarden universe.

  I think the author was getting a little burnt out, and also wanted to focus on some other projects for a while. He recently finished the Dark Wizard of Donkerk, which in my opinion is easily a publication-quality novel. http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2016.html

  Hopefully he'll get back to Glimwarden some time, as it was starting to get interesting. We'll see, I guess.

    Uh, he never put that on Patreon, did he?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      It's technically just at first draft stage and will be put out for wide(r) release once I finish editing it.
      ```

      - u/elevul:
        ```
        Nice, thanks. I prefer reading it on .epub, that's why I was checking your Patreon for it.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          As a stopgap until I finish with editing (which might take some time), you can get the first draft in epub format here: http://www.alexanderwales.com/darkwizarddraft1.epub

        For what it's worth, I was really enjoying Glimwarden while you were writing it and would eagerly start reading again if you decided to continue it. Also, if you make the final edited version of the Dark Wizard of Donkerk available for sale, I will buy it.

        I had a thought when I read DWoD, I was late to the discussion so I don't think you saw it (If you did see it and it was just super wrong, feel free to tell me so, hehe), I'll ask once more:

        >Are spirits an analogy for intuitions? Is the process of turning them into magical items an analogy for sublimation? Essentially... A well adjusted person (Sophia) has control over the mind (world) because she respects the remnants of the old world (spirits) that it was built from. This would mirror the process of maturation a person undergoes as they understand the context and purpose of their instincts and learn to move with them instead of against them.

        I think it'd be worth writing about these things. I questioned the efficacy of doing it analogically. I'd question the efficacy of communicating anything analogically. But it'd still be cool if true.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          That's not the analogy that I had in mind, but spirits were always designed to follow a more social model whose pathways were intuitive rather than explicit. /u/daystareld and I have an upcoming episode of [Rationally Writing](http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/) where we talk about *Dark Wizard of Donkerk* in-depth as the focus of the episode; it should be out within the week (edit: or month? I don't actually know the schedule).

          I do think there's more to be said about intuitions than was said within the text - it's one of the things that I'll keep my eye on for future edits (or the inevitable sequel).

            Looking forward to that :)

        We really need to find/build a publishing platform that lets readers just highlight errors and report them. Medium's highlighting and private comments by default are already very close to being perfect. Once we have that, errors would get pretty thoroughly scrubbed out with very little work on anyone's part.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          The Wordpress part of my website actually does have something like that feature courtesy of an addon I installed. You can go to a random chapter of *Glimwarden*, highlight, then hit Ctrl + Enter, and it will send me an e-mail with the highlighted part, which is usually enough that I can figure out what's wrong (and usually fix within a few hours of it being reported).

          However, the kind of editing that I want to do on *DWoD* is more like ripping out characters who aren't doing anything, adding in chunks of exposition if needed, excising plot threads that go nowhere, etc. And since all that stuff needs to be done, and would doubtlessly introduce *more* grammatical/spelling/consistency errors, I kind of want to hold off on sending the whole thing through a copy-editing pass.

  On 23 Oct 2016, Alexander Wales posted the following to Patreon:

  > I am putting a halt to Patreon, effective immediately. I lately haven't had enough energy/motivation/inspiration/discipline for writing, which is resulting in me not actually writing anything, or just writing at an impractically slow pace. This isn't really fair to anyone who's supported me on Patreon, and I'm sorry for that. This isn't the end for Glimwarden, but it's the end of me pretending that I'm going to be able to hit regular updates, because clearly that's not happening.
  >
  > I want to return to the green fields of writing, where I can wander off and take a few days to write Air Bud fanfic, or map out a world where vampires and wizards are battling in the streets of New York City. In that sense, serial fiction really isn't suiting my creative needs, and a schedule is proving counterproductive. I feel bad about this, but feeling bad about it isn't actually helping me write more, so that's sort of useless for everyone.
  > 
  > The options for Patreon are either to delete it completely or to switch over to per-unit and then not putting out any units of anything. I'm electing to do the latter; anything produced until this indefinite "break" is over will not be paid posts, and I'll give plenty of notice if I decide that I'm changing anything in that regard.(I am still planning on participating in National Novel Writing Month in order to complete The Dark Wizard of Donkerk, but don't have particularly high hopes for completion given my current output rate.)

  Paging /u/alexanderwales

  I don't know. It comes up pretty often in the Rationally Writing podcast, but it seems to have ended in a weird place at chapter 12.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I seem to recall the author saying on his Patreon page that he was talking a (possibly permanent) break from writing.
