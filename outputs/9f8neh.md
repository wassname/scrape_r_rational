## Rational fiction that starts with a non-rational character who becomes more rational as the story goes on?

### Post:

It seems to me that most rational fiction begins with a character that is already rational to some degree, but is there any that starts with a character who is not, but learns rationality as a sort of character arc?

  Now I'm imagining r!My Fair Lady.

  "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain, given typical weather patterns and the fact that much of the country's geography is flat."

      That would be some pretty crazy population density.

        The population is low, but the density of said population is so high that raindrops rarely if ever escape their gravity.

  https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12149957/1/The-Mind-Tailed-Fox tries to do this -- I attempted to start with Naruto roughly the same as he is in canon, and diverge from there -- but I'm updating it very sporadically.

      Yes, but just when I feel like writing a chapter, not on any sort of schedule.

        In that case I hope you feel like writing a chapter soon. I really enjoy where it's heading.

  I can't remember the name of the comic, but there's one where the MC starts as a below average individual and has surgery where a timeline splits every few minutes with him being aware of each split.

        Yeah, you have to power through that but it's well worth it.

        Thirding that yes this is sub *ms paint adventures* art, but the blunt force math and understanding of it's horrific implications  makes the storey absolutely beautiful/horrifying.

  The closest I have seen is "Everbody loves large chests." It's a story about a mimic that slowly gains sapience.  I'm not sure if it fully qualifies as a rational story, though it does feel fairly rational adjacent.

  Note: It starts out with a lot of erotic stuff, but that generally falls away in the later chapters.  I think it was originally intended to be a one off smut story that gained a life of its own, which is all sorts of meta.

    It is certainly an exploration of reasoned self-interest.

  If you don't mind some erotic stuff, including some non-con and brainwashing, then I'd reccomend https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid

  A naruto fic in which Sakura suddenly finds herself in a time-loop right before the forest of death chunin exam. She starts off as pretty close to show Sakura, depending on naruto and sasuke, blah blah blah, but that quickly doesn't work anymore for her and she grows from there. I don't know if she gets more _rational_ per say, as she starts off smart even in the show, but she _Acts_ more rationally as time goes on.

    I liked it an would go past chapter 3 if not for it practically being porn. Its a lot like MoL.
    ```

    - u/water125:
      ```
      Yeah. In the early and mid points of reading MoL I was honestly like "This... this is just reskinned time-braid, what?" a lot of the time.
      ```

      What does MoL stand for?

    Oh yeah! I actually started Time Braid awhile back but just got busy and didn't go back. I don't remember it ever getting erotic though, so I don't think I had gotten very far.

  Honestly, I think HPMOR is *supposed* to be this. 

  Harry basically goes from talking the talk but utterly failing at the walk, to walking the walk.
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    um. . . Doesnt harry go from talking the talk to *trying* to walk the walk against a sufficiently prepared  antagonist, who  as a *Diabolis ex machina* forces him to **really honestly try to walk the walk**, but win's anyways because of creative use of a technological/magical advantage that's basically a 4-5 sigma event even being on his tech tree?  

    The "solution" was a fair cop for a solvable mystery, but we could argue for months about if it was a realistic solution to various outside context problems, as well as who the actual actors are in the conflict considering the presence of oracles and  long dead actors.

    TLDR: I think I didn't spoil anything: If you haven't read HPMOR I'm either: arguing or being a pendant, about who is rational in HPMOR: go read it, then come back to this discussion. If you do so, please "@" me because otherwise I'll never see it: it's a long book, but worth it.
