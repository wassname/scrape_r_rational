            Funny coincidence, we actually met briefly at ICFP in Vancouver - you were talking about the exact arithmetic library using continued fractions.

              For rational(ish) fiction? My recommendations there tend to be pretty vanilla. Mother of Learning (obviously), Unsong (not rational, but hey), Worm, Metropolitan Man, etc. More or less the popular stuff around here. I've also probably read far more Worm fan-fiction than anyone would care to admit, but any recommendations coming out of that slush pile are relatively reader-specific.

                  Thanks! I was rather worried giving [that talk](https://yow.eventer.com/yow-2014-1222/stop-treading-water-learning-to-learn-by-edward-kmett-1750) as it was given to a large "general" developer audience that was by-and-large afraid of math, at a conference that had more of an IT/development focus than computer science per se. Talking even in general terms about life lessons from mathematics and computer science seemed risky, as I was quite worried at the time that it'd come across as feel good drivel. Despite all of that, the response has been quite positive, overall.

                  [Gambit](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/gambit-worm.430580/#post-25701419) is surprisingly good given the premise. I wish the author would get back to it. [Dire Worm](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dire-worm-worm-au-oc.360121/), likewise.

I keep reading [Taylor Varga](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/taylor-varga-worm-luna-varga.398991/) despite the fact that its clearly just OP silliness. At least the author of the latter keeps pumping out content. =) They make a good break from other worm stuff. 

                  Of course, most anything by Ack tends to be worth reading, e.g. [Security!](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/security-a-worm-si-story.300658/) and the like.

                  Stepping outside of Worm a bit, [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) is a Naruto fan-fic that I rather enjoyed. Bit too literal with the mind-rape for me, but it did manage to tie things up in a much more satisfying manner than I expected.

        > Timelooping Tinker

        Bakuda protagonist? That's interesting. Although I have to say, when I first saw the title I instantly thought of Leet. I kinda want to write that one. There aren't many characters in Worm or even in fiction in general whose powers are constantly worsening with every use, and that would be interesting to pair with the mother of all self-improvement powers.

        Edit: Also, I believe there is WoG out there somewhere that the reason Leet doesn't have the full cooperation of his shard is that he tends to play it safe and avoid conflict, which is antithetical to the shards' purpose. A time loop could fix that, even while it exacerbated the limitations inherent to his power (ie, the inability to repeat designs). So he'd probably improve at slightly different iterated designs that are functionally identical, and if he's lucky he might even learn the actual operating principles of very basic Tinker equipment after enough time, but he would still be losing access to specific designs with each and every loop.
        ```

        - u/edwardkmett:
          ```
          > and that would be interesting to pair with the mother of all self-improvement powers.

          The question there is should he lose the ability to make the same thing across all future timeloops or not. If so, he'd be practically drooling into a cup after a few iterations.
          ```

          - u/Tommy2255:
            ```
            As I explained in my edit after I thought about it a bit, I think yes, but at the same time you have to remember that, by canon and WoG, Leet has two real problems with his ability, not 1. He can't repeat himself, which is an inherent limitation of his power set by his Shard at the time he triggered, **and** the fact that his Shard hates his guts, which is a result of his behavior and choices. If I were writing it, I would interpret that as being sort of like his power is a DM with a grudge against the player. The limitation is the same, but it might be interpreted broadly, even unfairly.

            A Shard that's cooperating with Leet might say "oh, that idea you had? It's a good one. Get some materials and I'll walk you through making it, but just this once." "Oh, you need something similar to an earlier project? Well, we can't do that, but maybe I can help you figure out just how different it needs to be, since we're buddies like that."

            A Shard that's sabotaging Leet might say "oh, that's a cool idea you have there. Here's a sudden, migraine inducing flash of inspiration on how to make it. What, you didn't catch that? You can't interpret or retain that much information at once and you didn't even have your workspace ready? Well that's too damn bad, because I'm not repeating myself, so you can just try your best."

  Woo, family backstory! At long last!

  **Daimen’s Psychic Powers**

  This chapter confirms it. I find it extremely unlikely that Daimen was trained by aranea or has as much experience sifting through people’s thoughts as Zorian. I think there are three options for Daimen’s control of his powers then:

  * He discovered (perhaps unconsciously) how to control his empathy to the extant that it didn’t negatively affect him.
  * He has no control over it, but his empathy is weaker than Zorian’s. This could give him his social edge without the drawbacks.
  * He has been trained by another psychic.

  I want to expand on a theory for point 3 a little bit. We know that Zorian and Daimen’s abilities are inherited from their mother’s witch lineage. Since Zorian received some lessons from his grandmother as a kid, it wouldn’t be unusual if Daimen had as well. Perhaps Zorian’s grandmother taught Daimen how to control his powers. Though it is never stated explicitly, it seems like Zorian’s grandmother has since passed away—and before she could train Zorian, no less. Then Daimen either purposely keeps quiet about Zorian’s psychic powers (because Daimen is a spiteful asshole), or doesn’t recognize Zorian’s symptoms as psychic pressure (after all, how could anyone be as special as him?). I guess we’ll found out more about Daimen’s abilities (and his awareness of Zorian’s) next chapter.

  **Neolu Foreshadowing**

  From my perspective, this chapter confirmed that Neolu is an important character. She’s been mentioned more than just about any other classmate at this point--even if it’s just because she habitually eavesdrops and gossips. I scoured the earlier chapters for more references to her backstory:

  From Chapter 7, when Zach first explains the time loop to Zorian:
  >"You’re the most interesting person I know of at the moment, and the only other person who believes me about time travel except Neolu,” Zach said. 
  >
  >“Neolu?” asked Zorian incredulously.
  >
  >“She’s an avid reader of speculative fiction and mysteries and is very imaginative and open-minded,” said Zach. “A naïve dreamer, her father would say. It was surprisingly easy to convince her I’m really a time traveler. I guess she wants to believe it’s true.”

  From Chapter 63, when Simulacrum #2 tells Neolu that he is using a time machine to cheat at school:

  >“Really?” she asked suspiciously, like he had just told her something unlikely but still entirely possible.
  >
  >[…]
  >
  >“No, I was just joking with you. I don’t really have a time machine,” Zorian explained patiently.
  >
  >“Pity. Having a time machine would be grand,” Neolu said, smiling. “Sometimes I really wish I could go back in time and fix things before I mess up.”

  Though she seems happy on the surface, I think she seriously regrets whatever scandal she got caught up in back in Xlotic. We know one of the keys is hidden in the Xlotic desert, so maybe she will end up aiding Zach and Zorian in their search in a future restart. At any rate I think she will *at least* be given the Raynie treatment—privately confiding in Zorian after he goes to her for more advice.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > "Sometimes I really wish I could go back in time and fix things before I mess up."

    Yeah, it does sound like her wanting to go back and fix something is specific, not general. And it would be both logical and interesting for them to have her help in searching Xlotic rather than doing it themselves.

    > it seems like Zorian’s grandmother has since passed away

    I'm not sure. However, his recollections of his grandmother seem somewhat positive, yet he told Kiri that she's the only part of their family he likes, so probably yes, their grandmother is no longer around. Not to mention how much she might be able to tell him about his bloodline, so surely he would have visited her at some point during his country-hopping if he could.
    ```

    - u/cathemeralman:
      ```
      Yeah, I remembered Neolu talking back in Chapter 63, but I was honestly surprised when I found the earlier mention of her father and desire to time travel all the way back in Chapter 7. If this does end up being significant later, Nobody103 deserves a pat on the back. There aren't many authors who plan out their character histories so carefully.

      Your reasoning re:Zorian's grandmother was essentially the same as mine. I can't help but wonder if her relationship with Zorian and subsequent death will be discussed. There could be an interesting story there. We *did* eventually get an explanation for Zorian's aversion to the police and his lock-picking skills, so I don't think it's unlikely.

    The aranea treasury is another thing.

    Stealing from the invaders/cultists might be a bigger source of income than you realize.  After all, there's supposed to be a lot of supply caches, with cash and other valuables, there's also several high ranking politicians and mages among the Dragon Cultists, and stealing their secret stashes of cash/crystallized mana/valuables or even from their bank accounts directly somehow seems likely.
    ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    Zach became a full-time treasure hunter for, what, a decade or two? All sites he raided before are still there, and most of them loaded with artefacts. I'd assume that something like the Simulacrum scroll could fetch a pretty price on black market, not to mention all the things either of the two don't have any use by themselves.
    ```

  - u/Rheklr:
    ```
    Zach still has quite a lot of money. Nothing compared to where the Noveda fortune was, but if you only have a month to spend it all, quite a lot.
    ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      However, Zach already explained that he couldn't access the large majority of it, and especially that he needed Tesen's approval for using any large amount of funds. So no, this couldn't come from Zach. These were Zorian's and Zach's own personal funds.

      They did mention in a previous chapter that after visiting the dungeon together for the first time, they left it with 3 large crates full of crystals. Considering that it's been about 8 months since, it's quite likely that they mapped the depths of the place much better than before, and Zach also knows the location of many rare magical creatures. So I'm pretty sure that this is where the large majority of their funds came from.
      ```

      - u/Rheklr:
        ```
        I'm forgetting enough to justify a reread :D

        That does make more sense. I think the actual source of the money is a non-issue as it's been long established that they have quick access to lots of easy money and the specifics don't really matter at this stage.

            ```
            You got me ;)

            Though I've so much other stuff in the to read pile it probably didn't matter anyway.
            ```

    - u/Gauntlet:
      ```
      Zorian might also have access to Ibasian invader accounts.
      ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    That raised a legit question. Any chance Zorian mind-rape the whole bank's staff to have that number written on his 'prepared' account book?  

    For as far as I can understand, mana crystal is very liquid, but Zorian once said even if he focused entire restart to mine them, he wouldn't make a dent to the market. Monster part is equal to chump change compared to mana crystal. And raiding the invader is not really a breakthrough either.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      I'll have to disagree on the raiding invaders part. Everything else compared to that is bound to be small potatoes. The cult leadership has infiltrated the top of Cyorian government and surely these people are filthy rich. But disregard that, the invasion is funding an entire army delivered via one-of-a-kind trans-dimensional gate. The amount of resources poured in by invaders is insane on a scale of one person. Leeching these cash flows is a great and morally clean way to get rich.
      ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      > Any chance Zorian mind-rape the whole bank's staff to have that number written on his 'prepared' account book?

      Not a chance.  Zorian has always been very careful about not sliding down that slippery slope.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Hey, remember that time he practiced his mind rape skills on innocent aranea, and thought it was okayish because they weren't human, even if he had reservations?
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          He most certainly didn't think it was okay. It was really stressing him out, but he had no choice. With money and even Xvim's list he has a choice.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            > he had no choice.

            I'd agree.

            If you put Zorian in a situation where he could either compel a teller to write him a bank check, and get out of the loop, or refrain and vanish into oblivion when the loop ends - no other options - then he'd be walking out of the bank with the check within 5 minutes, and the teller would have forgotten he ever existed. However, given many avenues of training and research, he very much prioritises ethical ones.
            ```

    - u/TwoxMachina:
      ```
      I believe part of the reason for giving money, is that Zorian is uncomfortable mind-raping the secrets out of the mage.

      I think he once equated it with robbing someone of their most treasured item.
      ```

  - u/SpeculativeFiction:
    ```
    They killed numerous monsters/evil mages with treasure stashes.
    Most likely though, the crystallized mana is enough.

    Zorian could map several dungeons, and clean them all of mana pretty quickly. That would add up fast, especially as he and Zach can teleport through the dungeon now.
    ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    Because the invaders are supplying an entire army with food and equipment, there is probably a lot of wealth to be stolen there.

    Think 10k people, $10 of food per day, plus say $10 per person for miscellaneous expenses per day, for one month---so that's $6M right there. Say Z&Z get 10% of that. Plus crystalized mana, the simulacrum scroll, and whatever other artifacts and valuable carcasses they've found.

    Oh, and Zorian knows the identities of the cultist red robed mages, who are powerful politicians with fortunes perhaps on the scale of $1--100M. Reading their minds could have given him access to their bank accounts. That's probably the biggest source of wealth for them by an order of magnitude or two. The mana crystals, loot, etc. might just be chump change compared to the combined wealth of several politicians.

    Enlist seem simulacra to sell the wares around the country and that's a sizeable fortune, probably equivalent of $10--100M. And if their currency is 100 pieces to the dollar, then showing up with a check for $100k is 10,000,000 pieces, and that's definitely "a lot of zeros".

    Maybe /u/nobody103 can comment on the size of their wealth.
    ```

    - u/nobody103:
      ```
      Not much to say, really, except to note that Z&Z could gather lots of money in any number of ways, but usually resort to robbing the cultists blind and raiding the Ibasan supply caches to fuel the bulk of their activities (because it's fastest). They could plenty of money by selling looted items and rare materials too, it's just that it would be more of a hassle so they use it as a supplement rather than the main deal.
      ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        Yeah, that makes sense.
        ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > selling looted items and rare materials

        Those might also be useful directly; rare materials were one of Zorian's suggested bribes for the mages on Xvim's list. So it makes even more sense to just spend the hard cash.
        ```

        - u/Cheese_Ninja:
          ```
          I've got to say, nobody103 has been very consistent about giving multiple good meanings to chapter titles. This one could be applied to Daimen as a person, and Daimen's relationship with their parents. 

          Still, I'm guessing that Daimen's talent is a good bit weaker than Zorian's, since apparently he was never as negatively influenced by it as Zorian. And that he uses it more as a passive guide in dealing with people than influencing them outright. Basically, "I'm pretty sure this person would like it if I did this, so I'll do that." and vice versa, possibly like how Zorian originally was with his empathy. If Daimen had gotten professional training in mind magic, either from humans or aranea, given how insular the community is, I think Zorian would have found about it in the course of his own training and investigations.
          ```

        - u/DerSaidin:
          ```
          I'd interpret the happy couple described as perfection, and Zorian is marring it with his lewd portraits and general unexpected disruptive presence.

      > and he isn't a reciever he is a sender, Social Magnetism.

      That's not really how natural mind mages work in this setting though. "Receiving" emotions and basic details comes naturally to someone who is open.

      Connecting to other minds takes training.

      Possibly. But he hasn't been working on his mysterious project for "several" weeks now, so the point is moot. The Bakora Gate transportation theory is off the table, so Zach would have had to come to him.

      Zach and Zorian had to spend a few restarts just getting to Damien at their current level of skill and power. So that doesn't make sense either.

      Also, Zorian knows RR is not a natural psychic because his first exercise in studying kind magic was being able to distinguish between open and "flickerminds". However, we also know that Damien is psychic.

      Except that RR's mind magic was structured. RR is not a psychic. Plus, after looping for years, it would be a given that Daimen would have probably developed his skills far more than what Zorian was capable of at the time.

      > If anything, Damien messing around the likely Gate Key

      He explicitly isn't though. The crux of that theory is that he somehow activated a bakora gate or the sovereign gate at the beginning of the loop, which is already an outdated theory because we know Zach is the center of the time loop.

      But he hasn't even been at his mysterious project. He's been hanging out with his girlfriend for "several" weeks, which as this isn't the end of the loop, likely means he's been there since before the time loop started.

      So the theory now relies on Zach having become powerful enough to teleport to Koth before the end of the loop, which he can barely do now (seriously, how many updates did that take with Zorian's help?), having found Damien (who wants no visitors and has all members of the house he's at turn away people looking for him), then been either voluntarily bringing Damien into the loop via a temporary marker, or Damien somehow mind-probing him and getting in...somehow.

      It's just incredibly unlikely.

      >and being Open (RR used mind magic)

      RR used very crude unstructured magic after years of practice, and when he probed Zach's mind for details on the Aranea, he used structured mind magic (he's explicitly described as casting a very complicated spell, then placing his hand on Zach's head. Zorian's mind magic requires no visible gestures.)

      Xvim told Zorian mind magic shaping exercises could give someone very crude unstructured mind magic. That's probably what Red Robe has.

        I forget---how do we know this? That's my belief, but how do we know it's Zach who wasn't brought in? And I agree that's super unlikely, but do we *know*?
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          > how do we know

          Well, we know that Zach has a fully-intact Controller marker, and that RR either *couldn't* outright eject him from the loop or couldn't afford to.

          We know that Zach remembers spending decades and hundreds of iterations in the loop, and that it's only been going for about 30 years. RR, on the other hand, has clearly spent a long time there, but Zach found it easy to beat him in a straight fight (which might, or might not, just be because of Zach's abnormal mana reserves).

          We know that Zorian considered Zach to be a prime candidate for the loop, with lots of underdeveloped potential that has now come out, whereas RR is most likely a cultist. With the gods silent and the Key scattered, the choice of Controller would have to be made by the Maker's agents, who are unlikely to favor the guy who wants to mess with a primordial.

          And if Zach was the original Controller, we can easily think of reasons that he might have tried to include others in the loop, or been tricked/compelled into doing so, but if RR were the original, why would he have ever chosen to include Zach? And why wouldn't he have done more radical mind surgery *before* turning Zach into a Controller?

          We don't have definite confirmation from, say, the Guardian, because it's clueless about that kind of thing.

            That's an assumption. There has been massive political upheaval in the past hundred years and many Houses a in tatters. The keys could could have fallen into the wrong hands.

            The strongest point here is that it's easily conceivable for zach to add people to the loop rather than RR.

              I'm pretty sure that you have to assemble the whole Key to mark someone, and we know it's *not* assembled. So presumably it wasn't used to mark the original Controller.

              I assumed that the Maker's agents would oppose the cult, because the Maker is probably a god, and they didn't like primordials at all.

              On a related note, Zach's family actually had the Sovereign Gate in their vault until recently. Which tends to strengthen the "someone chose Zach as the Ikosian heir" theory.

                As you say, the keys are not assembled, so they are not necessary to mark the original controller. They may not be necessary to mark additional loopers either. The "soulkill" spell is precedent for a Controller ability that we've seen been used without access to the keys.

                All we know is that unbarring the gate requires them, and that we have several lesser functions that do not. Thus, we can't assume loop inclusion requires key access.

                It's very possible that the soul exclusion and inclusion functions are built into the marker, but Zorian's marker doesn't have those functions because his marker is disfigured.

                ---

                This actually hints at evidence against Zach being the original marked individual---he lacks the soul awareness to engage with his marker. If the loop was well planned, you'd think the original looper, pre-loop, would have been been at least setup with a soul mage to teach them how to use the marker. 

                Although it's possible that Zach was brainwashed of soul awareness, however we know they long-term memory adjustment is very, very difficult, and trained skills are unlikely to be wiped. What's more, we do know RR has facility with the Controller functions per his use of the soulkill spell, which is a point in favor of him being the original looper---though admittedly brings up the nagging question of why would Zach be added to the loop then? It's more likely the cult was trying to piggyback on the original looper than Zach trying to piggyback on the cult.

                ---

                If Zach *is* the original looper, Zach's lack of soul awareness suggests that the loop may not have been terribly well organized or was a last-minute effort to impede the invasion. Again, this assumes skills cannot be easily brain wiped, which . . . maybe they can.

                Also, while I do favor Zach being the original looper, I should point out that your statement

                > On a related note, Zach's family actually had the Sovereign Gate in their vault until recently. 

                works both ways. The Gate being moved *from* Noveda possession may also mean *someone else* wanted access to the Gate---possibly to hack it to allow a second looper.

                  The Guardian explained this in chapter 55. The Maker's agents can mark the Controller.

                  I'd agree that either skills must be subject to memory wipe, or else Zach was poorly prepared. After all, marker interaction is necessary even to access the control room. But we *know* the loop activation was rushed - a month early - so maybe he was supposed to take time for that during the loop, as he is in fact doing?

                    The Controller cannot mark someone without access to either the Key or an agent. This means that adding anyone to the loop means either unconventional means were used or there's an agent who helped the original looper. I wonder who that agent might have been . . . ?

                    ---

                    > But we know the loop activation was rushed - a month early - so maybe he was supposed to take time for that during the loop, as he is in fact doing?

                    I  would have expected him to already have learned how to sense his marker fairly early on in the loops, *unless* Zach was highjacked soon after the looping process began. That's one possibility. In my mind, the other possibility is Zach never learned to control the loop because be wasn't the original looper in the first place. Or, as we said, they successfully brainwashed him of loop control.

                    What are some other options?

                      Second, I think it's reasonable for mind magic to deprive you of skills.

                        er, I didn't mean create a second controller but rather give temporary loop access, which may be a mark of some kind that could be reworked into Controller-like status.

                        And while I agree that mind magic might remove the knowledge to cast certain spells, I'm skeptical that it could remove the ability to see souls. Like, can mind magic make someone forget how to see? But those questions make several assumptions about soul awareness, so I may be wrong

                        - u/thrawnca:

                          Soul awareness cannot be a bodily adaptation, or else it would be erased by the restarts.

                          I highly doubt it involves actual soul modification, since that's always treated as significant, dangerous, and morally charged, but Alanic would teach personal soul awareness to the masses if they wanted to learn.

                          Therefore, it is simply a technique learned in the mind. Therefore, by default it's vulnerable to mind magic.

                          > temporary loop access, which may be a mark of some kind that could be reworked into Controller-like status

                          It's definitely a marker. Again, that's in chapter 55.

                          As for making it permanent...I actually had an idea about that, involving RR getting a temporary marker and then using mind magic to make Zach place it on him again in between the time when it wears off and the next reset. It's a way of gaining full loop continuity, consistent with all the known rules, and it would neatly explain why his control of Zach broke down (because Zach became too suspicious of him, overriding any embedded compulsion to ignore him, like what happened with Veyers, and then hid himself from divinations so RR couldn't get him again) and why RR then exited the loop (because without Zach, his marker is temporary). The outstanding question is how he a) used Controller abilities like loop erasure; and b) persuaded the Guardian that his marker was good enough to actually let him leave, since I'm pretty sure only the Controller is supposed to be allowed to do that.

                          On the other hand, it's theoretically possible that a temporary marker is sufficient to use Controller powers if you know how? We don't really know much about temporary markers.
                          ```

                            Hmm, okay. I concede that skill removal should be within the scope of advanced mind magic. But I'll point out that if the *only thing* passed around between loops is the soul, and since Zorian retains knowledge between restarts, knowledge must be contained within the soul. This means the gain of knowledge and mental abilities *is* soul modification. Alanic has no problems with this type of soul modification because it is natural.

                            We know that mind magic allows one to read or control a person's brain. We also know that mind magic allows one to permanently modify the brain---memories can be altered and the brain can be damaged. We also know that knowledge is imprinted onto the soul---not only from the above paragraph, but also because we know that a primary function of the soul is to be a record of a person's experiences. Thus, if mind magic can alter the mental record of one's life, then this means that such mind magic indirectly modifies the soul. 

                            ---

                            > As for making it permanent...I actually had an idea about that, involving RR getting a temporary marker and then using mind magic to make Zach place it on him again in between the time when it wears off and the next reset. 

                            I like this solution. If a geas were placed on Zach, he could include as many people as necessary.

                            As for temporary markers giving Controller powers, that's certainly possible, however I feel like that would be a terrible design flaw that the Maker would not have implemented. If the Controller judges someone incorrectly and includes them in the loop, that person could then cast the loop erasure spell inappropriately and a lot of damage, or maybe even start including their own people in the loop. However, maybe the temporarily marked person needs to be *taught* those functions and RR simply ripped the knowledge from Zach's brain.

                            Another possibility is that the loop erasure spell doesn't require a marker at all---it's just a spell like any other, but it only works inside the loop. Thus, stealing  the knowledge from Zach's mind would be sufficient.

                            ---

                            There is another issue: If RR and Zach meet every loop in a situation where Zach is essentially at the mercy of RR, then Zach should be more easily controllable. Why isn't he captured every loop, drugged out of his mind, then memory wiped? Certainly, if abilities like soul awareness can be erased, then RR (and his allies?) could erase the memories of an entire loop spent in a coma---it's not like there would be many memories clean up.

                            This may be a point against your hypothesis, as it seems Zach is not so easily accessible at the beginning of the loop.

                            The above also makes me wonder: If the cult is in on RR being part of the loop, why aren't more cultists included in the loop? RR may be an independent actor, but in my previous reply, I indicated that QI probably knows of the loop.

                              Zorian noticed that he was confused about this, in chapter 51, after Batak explained souls to him. It's not yet clear, but to me it seems most likely that the Gate/Guardian is using the record in their souls to populate their minds.

                              > temporary markers giving Controller powers

                              Yeah, there are pieces of evidence suggesting that RR had a full Controller marker: he was able to exclude the aranea from the loop, and for that matter leave it. On the other hand, the more power you assume he had, the more you have to wonder why he didn't have his own army of time travellers.

                              Perhaps it's because only one can leave? He doesn't want competition, even from allies.

                              > Zach should be more easily controllable

                              That may be a matter of "can't do much to him without his marker triggering a reset". If RR was only able to make a small number of changes to his mind with each loop, he'd probably stop bothering once Zach was sufficiently docile. I'm envisioning his control as being less "memory wipe at will" and more "pay no attention to the red-robed guy behind the curtain", which was enough while Zach was oblivious but broke down once Zorian and the aranea tipped RR's hand.

          He has the marker. You can't duplicate it any normal way, barring incredibly risky soul splicing that could just as easily kill you. That's how Zorian was pulled in. This method was stated to be so unlikely that an actual soul mage would discount it entirely, and Zorian confirmed with a tracking ritual that only two people (himself and Zach) had it.

          The entity that guards the gate confirmed this. Red Robe must be using some other method to keep his memories intact (and fool the guardian)

    In chapter 56 Zack's memory of Veyers Boranova had been erased and the investigation into him showed that he most likely was Red Robe.
    ```

    - u/FeluriansCloak:
      ```
      >confirmed

      >most likely

      These are very much not the same thing. I think it's widely accepted that red robe is in someway related to veyers, and zachs forgetting him, but there's been no concrete evidence that veyers is rr
      ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Absolutely not. Veyers is an unstable teenager and not a competent mage when it comes to mind, soul or general high level magic. He might lead to the red robe, maybe RR even is using his body, but original Veyers is very unlikely to be RR.
      ```

      - u/Undead_Slave:
        ```
        So what? The same could be said about Zack and Zorian. Red Robe used structured mind magic and it is not like it is that hard to learn outside or inside a time loop. The hard part is getting in contact with that info and the loop makes that much much easier. The only question is how RR was able to join the loop in the first place.
        ```

        - u/Cheese_Ninja:
          ```
          RR used **unstructured** mind magic, and isn't a psychic, that's actually a pretty high bar. Simply reading minds and erasing memories doesn't seem like much compared to what Zorian can do, but in Xvim's estimation, for a non-natural mind mage to do that would require at least several years of dedicated study.

          Chapter 42:
          >"Can you also use telepathy and mind reading in unstructured manner, too?" he asked Xvim, acting on a hunch.

          >"Me, personally? No. I’ve never had an interest in anything other than defending myself," Xvim said. "But if you’re asking whether it’s possible, the answer is yes…with caveats. It requires great dedication for rudimentary results – such an aspirant would never be able to duplicate the attack you just casually did, for instance, even after a lifetime of honing their skills."

          At this point, I'm thinking the ritual to awaken Veyer's bloodline opened him up to some influence/being who actually had the knowledge of the Sovereign's Gate, like a soul bond with an ancient Fire Elemental or something. 

          Chapter 12
          >The main issue was that one of the participants usually started to mentally and spiritually dominate the other, making them more like themselves in mind and soul, not to mention disturbingly obedient and deferential. This was a good thing when binding animals as familiars, since it was almost always the animal that got dominated by the human, and animals actually tended to benefit from such domination by developing higher intelligence and better control over their magical abilities (if they had any). Sentient beings usually had issues with someone magically subverting their entire personality and worldview, however. At least until the soul bond finished, turning them into a servile clone, that is.

          Chapter 61
          >Unfortunately, it soon became clear that either the new ignition ritual was faulty or that some kind of specialized training regimen was required to stabilize the ignited state, because Veyers started losing control over his emotions and magic. He became prone to rapid mood swings, laughing uproariously in one second, only to be reduced to near-suicidal depression in the next, and then erupting into murderous rage when confronted. His non-structured fire magic started manifesting itself based on his subconscious desires, frequently spinning out of his control entirely, almost as if **it had a mind of its own.**

          Emphasis mine.

          In which case, Veyers/RR probably both planned the early activation of the time loop and his own expulsion to capitalize on that. I'm still not sure how Veyers/RR would have made their way into the loop though, short of getting a temporary marker. So it's still not a great theory, but I haven't seen any great RR theories.
          ```

          - u/Undead_Slave:
            ```
            Yeah there is still a lot to learn about what happened and how it was possible, but there is no denying that RR has a strong connection to Veyers. As for any powers that RR showed that can all be explained by the many years spent in the loop. I don't buy the dismissal of Veyers simply from the fact he could not have had those powers before the loop. I highly doubt RR entered the loop with brute force, it seems more like a logic or programing type flaw so you really can't rule Veyers out like most seem to want to do.
            ```

            - u/lostatnet:
              ```
              My working theory is that Vatimah Tinc (head of the Mage Guild) recruited Veyers Boronova (heir of a house) to have him share some of his house's secret magics in exchange for revenge against those who wronged him (both his house & the city). As Veyers would be part of the true ritual, Veyers would have to be part of the inner circle.  If Veyers has a soulbond-like tie to a fire elemental, his magic can potentially give him insight to subjugating an alien force.
              Assuming this is true, then Zach's early loop activities (convincing anyone he can of the time loop) could have got the inner circle's interest.  When Zach sought out Veyers, for a laugh, the inner circle used that meeting to set a trap to capture Zach & study him at their leisure.
              This theory means that anyone of the inner circle could be Red Robe. However, as the time loop seems vulnerable to unstructured magic, Veyers' unstructured fire magic may have given him a slightly better opportunity.

              Regardless of my theory, I think its likely that Red Robe is an inner circle member.  At the very least, Veyers would be prime cultist material for his *potential* hatred for Eldemar & Cyoria (looting his House & training commoner mages), as suggested in ch 50 by Tinami.
              ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          So that original Veyers does not posses magic to subdue Zach, get information out of his mind about the loop and forge a copy of a soul marker. And no, mind magic is not trivial to learn, by virtue of being illegal. We are talking about Veyers Boranova, not Veryers Aope after all.

          Zach doesn't need to have any proficiency, since he is an original looper. Hell, the whole point of the loop is to make Zach a good mage.

          Zorian was just a fluke and got into this using, so to speak, the lich and not his own skills.
          ```

          - u/Undead_Slave:
            ```
            We have learned that Zack has also forgotten a lot of functions of the loop. One of the powers is to bring people into the loop for a limited number of loops. There is no telling what other powers there was. If Veyers was working with Zack for a while until he was able to betray him it fits. Who knows what other details about the loop was erased from Zack's mind that could help him get into the loop. Veyers was mentioned way back in chapter 2 and unless RR is someone who has not been mentioned at all in the story it is him.
            ```

            - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
              ```
              Honestly, Veyers is a decent candidate:

              1. He's recruited by the cult due to his wealth and nobility, and perhaps he is soul bound to an elemental, which might be old enough to have knowledge of the primordial.
              - Knowing the time loop will occur, the cult has Veyers plan to hang out with Zach somehow with the goal of being brought into the loop. He uses  the fact that he and Zach share somewhat similar upbringings as the young living heirs of their houses.

              2. Veyers feels his friendship with Zach has progressed enough and Veyers is brought into the loop. The cult tutors him and also conducts research on his temporary loop marker to figure out how to make it permanent.

              3. Once finished, Veyers and the cult set an ambush for Zach. They steal what knowledge they can, wipe his memories, and then proceed to perfect the invasion process. Veyers continues his training.

              4. After many years, Zorian enters the loop and the story as we know it begins.

        I haven't ever seen it used as a promotion, either (also USA native speaker).  Maybe it's a British thing?

Like "She torpedoed into his side and wrapped her arms around him" or "He torpedoed through the door and looked around..."  Maybe that's what /u/sambelulek was getting at?  It seems quite reasonable to speak of a theory "torpedoing" upward in probability.  Reasonable, but I've never heard it.  It would be rare enough that I'd be confused to see just "the theory torpedoed" and not the full "the theory torpedoed to the top of the list".

        And of course, there's a direct object involved in SpeculativeFiction's use.  When "X torpedoes Y", Y is always destroyed, and without connotation of X rushing forward.

  Daimen being a natural mind mage helps explain this in chapter 3:
  >"The spell moves you around like a puppet on a string until you learn how to move along with it, if only to make the feeling of something jerking you around go away," said Zorian. "Eventually you no longer need the spell to dance correctly."


  >"I see you have personal experience with this method," Ilsa said with a smile.


  >Zorian resisted the urge to scowl. Getting put under that spell by Daimen was one of his childhood traumas. It wasn't amusing at all.

      I got the same feeling when I read this chapter. However I did not think of Damien being magically compelled through mind magic, but through magical honey. From his girlfriend's perspective, Damien is a good catch. This is especially true if the local mages of the region know of the 'compulsion' honey and are wary. It makes Damien a much more valuable opportunity for their clan. 

      If Damien is a untrained psychic, then he might not notice the compulsion. If he is a trained psychic, then there is still a chance its more of a biological compulsion then a magical compulsion. Finally, he might be turning a blind eye to it as he wants to believe he is in love, or was falling for the girl before the honey pushed the him right into 'love'.

      Also, it'd be cool to see it pan out as fatalistic love. His empathic powers pushed her over the edge and in response she *had* to be with him. Hence magical honey to ensnare him with love. It could be tragic or comedic, but it'd be a cool interplay of magics within the world/setting.

  So Damien is psychic but didn't see fit to tell Zorian about it, wonder why that is.

  He could just be a dick and didn't tell Zorian about it cause he's an asshole but a theme I've noticed so far is that the more Zorian actually gives his family a chance the more he finds out his initial impressions were at worst wrong and at best missing some critical info to explain the behavior. Like Fortov giving him space or his sister's reasons for stealing all his crap. Admittedly, Fortov is still a dick for the creeper rash thing and his Dad doesn't seem to pleasant.

  Also I've noticed all of the bad stuff we've heard about Zorian's mom has come from his own internal musings or talking to Zach about all of which could just come from Zorian being bitter. There hasn't been much in terms of specific examples regarding his mother's, for lack of a better term, maliciousness. The closest to actual evidence I can remember seeing was her criticizing Zorians appearance every restart to put him in a bad mood when the subject of taking Kirellle to school with him comes up. So admittedly she's manipulative but I doubt she has malicious intentions.

  We haven't seen Damien's psychic abilities yet so I suppose it's possible that Damien still has no idea that he's psychic and has just been using his passive empathy to become more successful. That would bring up the question of why Damien didn't encounter the same problems that Zorian had growing up. 

  Earlier in the story they were talking about people with large mana reserves not being able to control their mana as well as people with little reserves. Perhaps with Damien having a large mana pool his psychic abilities aren't as sensitive as Zorians thus avoiding the whole problem with crowds and such.

  Personally I'm betting that Damien isn't trained as a psychic, No way is he as good as Zorian and maybe he's received some training to shut off his mind or something, maybe even the unstructured mind shield but I doubt much more than that.

  Interesting to note that the house he's marrying into is able to control bees, combined with the somewhat ominous title of the chapter apparently relating to Damien's fiancée I wouldn't be surprised if they control their bees with mind magic in some form (maybe like Zorian and his golems or the crows). If their method to control bees involves mind magic I highly doubt that Damien, a (I'm guessing) genius untrained psychic from a faraway country just so happened to fall in love with the heir of their clan, it just seems way too suspicious to me.

  Additionally Damien was supposed to be hard at work researching something, but he's apparently spent the past few weeks hanging out with his fiancée. Possibly out of character for him, at least his mom seems to think that nothing would get in the way of his work, and she seemed worried enough to make the trip to check up on him. I know Zorian thinks his mom is worried she wont be able to make use of Damien's connections but I wouldn't be surprised if Zorian is completely wrong about that and she's just worried about her son. Would also be a bit of a slap in the face to Zorian when he finds out his mom was just worried about Damien.

    Re: Zorian and Daimen's mother - you can actually see her unpleasantness directly this chapter, when she comments about Daimen's marriage that "he's making a big mistake and he needs to know that". Remember that the crux of her disapproval with it is that he's not making a marriage that's useful to *her*.

    I believe the term for this kind of behaviour is "self-entitlement". With perhaps a worldview where her children are assets for further gain rather than people in their own right.

    Zorian did comment on Fortov's and Kirielle's ability in the chapter where he's taking about inherited bloodline skills with Batak in the Church, and specifically mentioned that neither were psychics, nor was their mother.

      Taiven commented way back in chapter 12:

      >
      >"Eight!?" Taiven gaped. "But that’s…practically below average!"

      I wonder if it's possible for Daimen's psychic ability to be a lower cost/power version than Zorian's own, which could be part of the disparity in natural starting reserves. Still, I'd guess Zorian is a bit on the lower end while Fortov and Daimen are on the higher end of reserves.
      ```

      - u/TomSmash:
        ```
        You might be onto something, I hadn't given thought to the Zorian's limited mana reserves being a result of the price paid for his psychic abilities, I knew it played a part but I didn't think that Zorian might have had to pay a bigger price than his brothers. Maybe with his research into blood magic he could somehow fix that, seems more likely to me that Zorian would use blood magic to help his psychic abilities rather than develop new ones.
        ```

        - u/Cheese_Ninja:
          ```
          Well, Fortov wouldn't have paid any cost in reserves, since Zorian has stated that he's not psychic.

          A lack of initial reserves is not something that can fixed with blood magic, or even really something that needs to be fixed at all.

          Nobody103 stated that inherited magical abilities are always "minimum cost", as opposed to acquired ones, which have an additional cost depending on the efficiency of the ritual that gives them that ability.

          But since reserve growth isn't negatively affected by inherited abilities, Zorian will also gain greater relative growth than a mage without an initial ability cost. Let's assume that the cost of Zorian's ability was 3 units, his max reserves should be around 44 [(8+3)*4], even if Daimen's cost less, say 1, he still probably has far higher initial reserves, if Taiven thinks they're "huge", let's say 19 or so, which would give him a max of 80.

          Simply put, it's not a disparity that Zorian can make up for, unless he gets the same strange doubling benefit upon leaving the loop that Zach already has.
          ```

          - u/Quetzhal:
            ```
            Well, it's not outside of the realm of possibility that Zorian's mind magic is particularly strong. I don't think he's ever had the effects of his mind magic on his natural reserves explicitly measured - and he's proficient enough with his mind magic that he's able to break down Xvim's mental barriers after something like 3-4 years of training. Which is absurd. 

            I know inherited magical abilities are always minimum cost, but Zorian could potentially be an anomaly? When you think about it, his growth is absurd. He's been in the loop for six years and he's actually almost caught up with Zach, although his proficiencies are in different areas that aren't combat magic.

              Could be his minimum cost is still somewhat large.

              - u/Xtraordinaire:
                ```
                That seems unlikely, though. This cost means that if the baby's reserves are average, and average is around 8-10, that baby is a zero-mana mage in the beginning. This doesn't seem right, especially since inherited abilities have maximum possible efficiency. So a ritual-gained psychic powers have a 20 mana cost? That's... not reasonable.
                ```

                - u/Cheese_Ninja:
                  ```
                  I'm pretty sure zero-mana or negative mana just means a dead baby. I wouldn't go over a 6 cost for even the absolute strongest psychic ability set or a 3 cost for Zorian's. I feel like anything higher would be more noticeable to him in reserves growth.

                    Yup, I agree. Zorian starts at 8 that looks like below average but really was 11-3, and will end with 11*4-3=41. However this means even if Daimen has his cost reduced to 1, he still has bigger natural reserves, 15+ I'd say. Psychic ability cost disparity alone can't account for Zorian having 'below average' and Daimen 'huge' mana reserves.

          - u/TomSmash:
            ```
            Yeah, you're probably right. Especially since this is a story about largely thinking your way out of a situation as opposed to blasting your way through. For Zorian to suddenly get a boost in mana reserves would take away from the struggles and compromises he's had to make to make his magic/whole fighting style work as efficiently has possible to make up for his deficiencies.
            ```

            - u/Cheese_Ninja:
              ```
              Zorian might still get that doubling/increase in reserves upon leaving the loop. I think Zach got his from his original real world soul being merged with his initial loop soul, and it could work in reverse if Zorian's current loop soul is merged into his real world soul when he leaves. Of course, I could be wrong about why Zach's reserves are doubled, or I could be right but that still might not be an option for Zorian.

              nobody103 had a comment about Gamer-type series, one bit of which is somewhat relevant:

    ```
    Didn't mind magic require a superior mana control? And isn't mana control and manipulation adversely affected by larger mana reserves (i.e. harder to train with more mana)? 

    So if Damien received both mind magic and large reserves, it could have limited his empathic resonance and that might be the factor that caused him to turn out like he did (sociable, outgoing, charismatic), while Zorian with his smaller reserves and mind magic had a became more empathic and he turned out as isolated and grumpy to shield himself.

    Also most mages don't improve their mana control beyond its useful limit as they can just pump more mana to overcome any deficiencies. It could be that Damien just never developed his control and therefore doesn't understand what his mind magic tells him or doesn't link it with magic but just social cues.

      >2a: Special abilities like that are effectively unstructured magic, but the users does not have to exert much effort into shaping the effect because it’s all instinctive to them. If he depleted his mana reserve, he could not continue using his mental abilities, no. But they are extremely mana efficient, even more so than regular mind magic, which is already very cheap in terms of mana requirements. 

      >2b: Your guess is correct. In addition, his mental abilities would be far worse than Zorian’s, because they would use his general shaping aptitude as a base to build upon, and he kind of sucks there. He’d be a virtuoso in mental magic compared to regular humans, but Zorian would still leave him in the dust. Telepathy benefits greatly from finesse and good shaping skills, and not so much from awesome mana reserves, so he would be worse than Zorian in almost every way when it comes to mind magic. 

      I don't think this necessarily precludes Daimen from having a weaker version of their psychic bloodline than Zorian. nobody103 doesn't directly address whether higher reserves affects empath sensitivity, just that "Telepathy benefits greatly from finesse and good shaping skills".

      As far as empath sensitivity, that seems to be something that needs to be trained separately from mana control. Zorian was affected by it before ever becoming a mage, so even after improving his shaping skills, people and especially crowds were still an issue until he trained with the aranea.

  The last three members of [the Kamizuru Clan of Iwagakure](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kamizuru_Clan), capable of controlling bees just as [the Aburame](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Aburame_Clan) could control [*kikaichuu*](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Kikaich%C5%AB) and related insects, were the villains of an anime-only filler arc in *Naruto*. IIRC, however, non-combat applications of their abilities were not discussed in those episodes.

  (Note: The manga-appearing, 100%-canon characters listed as members of the Kamizuru Clan on the linked wiki page were listed there on the basis of claims made by the filler villains' leader. Those claims have been neither substantiated nor contradicted elsewhere in *Naruto*.)

    Not a chance. How could he be? When would he have put in the kind of time that would let him learn that level of skill, and who would have taught him? And if he were a *better* psychic than Zorian (who has, at this point, hit diminishing returns with the *aranea*), how could he possibly not have done or said anything for his little brother who faints in crowds? Jerk he may be, but not *that* level of jerk.

  >"As for the rest… how much did you really offer them for their life's work?" Zorian asked.

  It's weird to me that Zorian thinks stealing secrets by breaking into a civilian's mind is wrong, but scamming them by offering a trade for their secrets that they don't know is temporary isn't.

  I guess the idea is that if you restrain yourself to things that are only abusable within the timeloops, you won't have as hard a time adjusting back once/if you get back to the real world? I.e. scamming someone in a trade is less emotionally scaring for the scammer than mind-raping someone?

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I was thinking a bit about this when rereading recently, and I concluded that there is a definite moral difference between giving someone a good, even generous deal, and having it negated by the loop, vs committing a crime against them and having *that* erased by the loop.

    First, it's a difference in yourself. "You are what you do," so it's much better to be in the habit of paying handsomely for what you get. It affects how you subconsciously think about people, how you approach hard problems, and basically your whole mindset. Zorian is very aware of that. If the loop turns a good deal into a scam, that's not something he can help; he didn't start it and can't stop it. How could he treat them any better? Sitting on his hands to avoid deceiving anyone would not save them from being erased at the summer festival. In fact, in light of the invasion and primordial summoning, teaching him is their best chance of surviving in the real world.

    Second, when those copy-souls all float off to wherever souls go, carrying records of everything that happened to them, and Zorian floats off to join them someday, wouldn't he rather that they record he treated them well despite having every excuse not to?
    ```

    - u/Anderkent:

      I agree with the first point, but

      >Second, when those copy-souls all float off to wherever souls go, carrying records of everything that happened to them, and Zorian floats off to join them someday, wouldn't he rather that they record he treated them well despite having every excuse not to?

      How are they being treated well? They're offered what they believe is permanent wealth or knowledge transfer, which is then being taken away. Do you think any of those subject would agree on the terms knowing that they're in a time loop? Of course not. It's like paying someone with counterfeit money; it's not better than just stealing just because the other person doesn't know what's happening
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > How are they being treated well? 

        Those copy-souls are only embodied for a single month - no matter what Zorian does. Giving them immense wealth during that month seems to me like about the best thing he could do for them.

        > Do you think any of those subject would agree on the terms knowing that they're in a time loop?

        No, I don't. Actually, I think that if it were feasible to explain the loop to all of them, and if they really believed it, then they would accept much *smaller* payments, in hopes of ZZ saving their lives from the invasion. They might also want Kael-style deals - which Zorian is, in fact, doing to some extent for the golem-makers etc. Whether he'll have time and attention to get to them all and reward them in the real world remains to be seen, but he intends to try. And incidentally, it seems to me that finding a price they'll accept would help him to know what kind of real-world reward would work best for them.

        However you slice it, he really is doing his best by offering outrageous bribes.
        ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    also remember that Zorian has mentioned that he still intends to pay them back after leaving the loop as well. so he still feels bad about doing it this way (or at least does feel the gratitude)

- u/AKAAkira:

  I feel that's very worth pointing out and praising Zorian for putting thought into the ethics of the notebook Xvim gave him and more or less resolving it with his morals largely intact. I feel like a lot of publications would praise a work just for raising up moral issues, but this right here goes and takes a step forward, which I see to be a much more productive state of affairs.

  And to think that, in the discussion thread for chapter 58, multiple people took for granted that Zorian was going to have to mind-rape those people...

        "Uh huh" seems to me to fit the context better. Daimen is dubious about Zorian's claim that he randomly visited another continent and then suddenly remembered his brother was there. "Uh huh" can have a similar tone to "Yeah, right". Whereas "Ah ha" suggests a discovery of some kind.

        The eyebrow thing, if it had a comma, would have a nice [three-part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_%28writing%29) sentence.

  ```
  Zorian's simulacra are coordinating with each other...this could become a whole new kind of hazardous. What happens when they start ganging up on him?

  And although Simulacrum 2 didn't mind having a one-day stint at school, isn't there a new risk, now that there's a precedent for long-lived simulacra, that others might complain about having only 24 hours?
