  ```
  Does this end with her establishing a new Dungeon in the city she just conquered, for maximum Evil Overlord dramatic irony?
  ```

- u/lostatnet:
  ```
  Now Ami sees the aftermath. Will this "conquered city" force her to change her plans?  Or can she immediately try out her soul reclaiming plan?
  ```

- u/Hexatona:
  ```
  Wait - Dungeon Keeper Ami - is this that super old one that was like branching paths in the story...?
  ```

  - u/natron88:
    ```
    Yes. The branching stopped now that it's on Sufficient Velocity.
    ```

- u/k-k-KFC:
  ```
  Is this the original dungeon keeper Ami still being updated or a new fanfic of it?
  ```

  - u/cretan_bull:
    ```
    The original, still going strong at 840k words.
    ```

    - u/Hexatona:
      ```
      Is there like...  an easier way to read it than poring through that forum..?
      ```

        There are probably other ways to scrape these stories but the FanFicFare addon for the open source reading software called Calibre is what I use. 

        Just paste in the URL and it collates the story pages into an ebook.
        ```
