  [The Martian](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Martian-Part-1-Audiobook/B00B5HZGUG) is great.

  [Worm podcast](http://audioworm.rein-online.org/) is very well done.

  [Mistborn Series](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Final-Empire-Part-1-Mistborn-Book-1-Audiobook/B002V0QCYU) by Brandon Sanderson is awesome.

  [Dresden Files](https://www.audible.com/pd/Storm-Front-The-Dresden-Files-Book-1-Audiobook/B002V8KYMI) - I didn't like it as much, but people here recommend it often. Personally, I prefer the [Night Watch](https://www.audible.com/pd/Night-Watch-Part-1-Watch-Book-1-Audiobook/B004HCDZAO) series - really amazing urban fantasy where mages weave complex plots against each other, I think you guys will love it.

  [The Knowledge](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Knowledge-How-to-Rebuild-Our-World-from-Scratch-Audiobook/B00J55GD0W) - non-fiction book about rebuilding civilization from scratch.

  [Atlas Shrugged](https://www.audible.com/pd/Atlas-Shrugged-Part-1-Audiobook/B002VA3KG8) is absolutely amazing, and the audio version I'm linking to is extremely well produced.


  Also, technically not fiction, but biographies of [Elon Musk](https://www.audible.com/pd/Elon-Musk-Part-1-Tesla-SpaceX-and-the-Quest-for-a-Fantastic-Future-Audiobook/B00UX8ODPM) and [Kevin Mitnick](http://www.audible.com/pd/Nonfiction/Ghost-in-the-Wires-Audiobook/B005H3FYR4/ref=a_search_c4_1_3_srTtl?qid=1487463773&sr=1-3) read very much like rational fiction, I highly recommend them!

  Also there's [Phoenix Project](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Phoenix-Project-A-Novel-About-IT-DevOps-and-Helping-Your-Business-Win-Audiobook/B00VAZZY32) - people recommend it often but I haven't listened to it yet.

    How is atlas shrugged rational? Objectivism comes off as ant-rational at times.

  [hpmorpodcast](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/) did an HPMOR audiobook, and is seven chapters in to a Metropolitan Man audiobook.

    Three Worlds Collide and a lot of other short rational fiction is also on the podcast! Great stuff.
