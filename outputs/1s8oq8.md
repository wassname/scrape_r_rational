## Malazan Book of the Fallen?

### Post:

Someone recommended [*Malazan Book of the Fallen*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen) to me as a rationalish *Game of Thrones*-style series. But I'm not sure of it; before I start a 10-book-long series, I'd like to be sure it's good. Has anyone here read it? Yes or no, in your opinion?

  Having read it:

  - There is less rationality than Game of Thrones
  - It is high fantasy, with excessive amounts of magic, gods, etc. Not really that similar to Game of Thrones in tone in a lot of ways.
  - The characterization of various people in the story is mostly pretty weak; The individual characters aren't as strongly written and differentiated from each other as one could hope for.
  - There's a lot of extremely extensive and interesting backstory, there is a complicated series of plots that are each not terribly complicated on their own but there are like fifty of them. 
  - The first book, Gardens of the Moon, is dramatically weaker than the others in the series. The books are independent enough that you could start with book 2 and 3 before book 1, to see if you liked the 'better' Malazan writing first. 
  - Setting elements are unique and interesting. 

  Overall, there's a lot to like, and a lot to hate. I would suggest it for readers of the fantasy genre as a whole, but I do not think it has much real rationality in it, so if you specifically look for that you will be disappointed. I would caution against buying the entire ten book set at once - a library to get book 2 and see if you like it would probably be your best bet.
