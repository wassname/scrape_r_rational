## Guilty pleasure: badass, dangerous male protagonist ( can be a graphic novel, novel or thread story. )

### Post:

I really enjoy reading about badass, smart and over powered MC's who take their worlds by storm. Looking for new books as I've been through most of the more often recommended ones like:

Prince of thorns, kingkiller, dresden, first law, nightside, forgotten conqueror, Conan,fimbulwinter, gemmel, kings dark tidings, demon cycle, e.t.c.

So i would really appreciate something new, don't even mind self promotion as far it's in line with what am looking for, thanks in advance!

Ps: please no harems, 99% of the time they turn out to be utter nonsense.

  Does it have to be a male protagonist? Because when I think of works I've found on this sub that meet the criteria "badass, smart, OP protagonist takes world by storm," I think Worm and Practical Guide to Evil. Although in both of those cases there's a lengthy ramp-up before the OPness and the taking-the-world-by-storm, they're pretty intense once they reach that point. Both protagonists are vicious and deadly when they come into their own, and they set their aims high. 

  That said, I'm not sure whether you prefer the protagonist to face challenges proportional to their own skill and power, or whether the guilty pleasure is in watching them steamroll everything. Both legitimate preferences, but the works I mentioned are in the first category. The more powerful the protagonists get, the higher the stakes and the more dangerous their opponents.

    And if they the protagonist doesn't have to agree even vaguely with your own morality, then Max Harms' [Crystal](http://crystal.raelifin.com) trilogy would qualify, too. The world is *quite literally* taken by storm.

    Perilous Waif too! Badass female protagonist and lots of cool sci-fi!

    I think i would prefer the stakes to match the power,but the other option is okay as well, anyway yeah i would prefer a male protagonist , easier to imagine myself as the mc that wayðŸ™„, that being said I've read both worm and a pgte, thanks anyway.

      I swear you've been around here before under a different username with this same request. Very similar request and reasoning for wanting male protagonists. Maybe I'm going insane or something but I noticed I was confused and I wanted to try and follow up on it.

      - u/CeruleanTresses:

        I think you're right. I remember the last time now that you mention it, and OP's post history is mostly just asking for this same thing on various subs.

      Thereâ€™s isnâ€™t, although thereâ€™s a little bit of ship teasing at some points.  (Either that, or Datcordâ€™s infamous comments on SB are making me see things that arenâ€™t there.)  Itâ€™s a fantastic story and should be right up your alley, though.  You donâ€™t need to know anything about RWBY or the Gamer for it to be good.

  Have you read Zelazny's Amber? The original snarky first person fantasy series of which all others are shadows.

  Seriously, if you like the voice of Dresden Files, Amber and Brust's Jhereg novels are both wortha shot.

  Both are cleverly smart badass protagonists operating at high levels of skill.

  If you're looking for something seriously badass (though perhaps not the strongest re: rationality...) you should check out Feng Shen Ji.

  http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manhua/FengShenJi?from=Manga.FengShenJi

  It's a chinese graphic novel. The premise is that in a fantasy world in which vaguely Buddhism-inspired gods rule mortals with an iron fist a king dares rise against them. In the first chapter he clashes fiercely with an army of thousands against them out of the doors of his city... and loses. This isn't his story - it's the story of his *son*, who sets on a long and tortuous path to power in order to be able to finally avenge his father and accomplish his dream - that humans might live free from the rule of the cruel, capricious Gods.

  It's amazing. Seriously, seriously badass, full of page spreads that will leave you gaping in awe at the spectacle and of incredibly awesome fighting scene. You want a spectacular fantasy epic in graphic novel form with an original setting (at least if you're used to the western-type ones), it doesn't get much better than that.

    Yes, this story is amazing

  The Acts of Caine by Matt Stover. Contains everything you asked for, is very well written and has plenty of rational aspects plus an intriguing premise: â€˜actorsâ€™ from earth make their living playing roles when theyâ€™re sent to a parallel realm that is a fantasy world with conventional fantasy â€˜physicsâ€™ and have their internal experience both recorded and â€˜live-streamedâ€™ to viewers. The protagonist could be straight out of most of the series you mentioned except with more depth.

  Of the series you mentioned I would place it slightly above Joe Abercrombieâ€™s First law, which I would place a tier above all the others mentioned.

  Chronically underrated series. Ignore the awful cover!

    Upvoting this for visibility. It's like Robert Heinlein and Michael Kirkbride (head writer of TES3: Morrowind) decided to rewrite John Wick starring Vin Diesel.

    * Heroes Die
    * Blade of Tyshalle
    * Caine Black Knife
    * Caine's Law

    Books 1 and 2 are so good, I reach a point 3/4 through each that I simply cannot stop reading. I have to finish, even if it's 3am. I'm about halfway through book 4 for the first time, so no spoilers.

  Have you read Dune?  Paul (and later Leto II) Atreides get super-OP.

  The Elenium/Tamuli series by David and Leigh Eddings would probably suit you better than the Belgariad, given your description of the protagonist.

  Sandman Slim is pulpy but a lot of fun -- of all the recommendations on my list, I think match what you're looking for the best.

  I'm not sure if Earthsea quite matches your description, but it's close enough that I'd feel bad leaving it out.

  And yeah, as someone else mentioned, Zelazny's Amber and Bryant's Jhereg series (and the related Khaavren Romances, which are based on the D'Artagnan Romances, but with magic).
  ```

    ```
    Thanks man, I've read them, though sandman slim was kind of disappointing to me as i couldn't get past the first book becasue the author kept trying to pass off dumb ass decisions as impulse, but seeing as people recommend it a lot ,maybe i should jump to book 2?

  Kirth Gersen and Adam Reith if you'll accept a little less overpower in exchange for literary quality.

  [Core Threads](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads) mainly consists of power growth.

  [Make a Wish](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish) for an example where the MC doesn't realise how OP they are, while the entire world freaks out about it. 

  [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning), of course.
  ```

  - u/daestro195:
    ```
    Thanks a lot, aside from mother of learning the rest are new., oh, just took a look at these,I've read core threads during my hp fanfic binge ,my favourite was harry potter and the boy who lived and as usual it's the good ones that get dropped, anyway not sure if I've seen make a wish before but it seems familiar.

  Self promo: I write a superhero serial called [Inheritors](https://inheritorsserial.com) if you don't mind those. The main character is a clone of the greatest hero ever, and while he isn't as strong as his predecessor yet, he's still badass enough to take on Houston's Hero, and fight off a bunch of gang members in a hallway. He can convert heat into kinetic energy, which packs one hell of a wallop, and during the first arc he becomes the talk of Houston.

  Lots of stuff from /r/hfy would fit there.  

  * [Deathworlders](http://deathworlders.com/books/deathworlders) by Hambone. Not all of his protagonists are male, but all are awesome and dangerous.

  * [Oh This Has Not Gone Well](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/61ya08/oh_this_has_not_gone_well/) started good, got awesome, stayed that for a while, had a bit of a slump in content and quality, but the last few chapters have been getting better and better again.

  * [The Fourth Wave](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/30tk8j/pithe_fourth_wave_part_i/) went on a bit long for my taste, but it should fit your criterias very well.
