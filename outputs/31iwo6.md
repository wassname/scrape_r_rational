## Suggestions for rational/munchkin/making-the-most-of-a-magic-system type stories?

### Post:

Like, stories that involve taking the rules as given, to their logical conclusions, with as much magic system abuse as possible (meaning the main character has to be intelligent and think outside the box - a lot). I'm wondering what you'd recommend as I'm out of ideas. So far I've enjoyed:

* Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality (Harry Potter)
* Two Year Emperor (Dungeons and Dragons)
* Harry Potter and the Natural 20 (Harry Potter / Dungeons and Dragons)

Thanks!

  I hate that people now think that that's what 'rational' means. Rational stories are not about munchkins breaking their systems, they're about a set of characters who all behave like real people and make rational decisions from their *own* perspectives.

  Your second word ('munchkin') is a *much* better name for that class of stories. Stories in which one character actually thinks about the system and tries to figure things out, and the rest of the characters are essentially part of the backdrop onto which the protagonist can reflect the GLORY OF THEIR POWERFUL BRAIN make me feel ill.

    Munchkin-Sue stories are icky, but I find it enjoyable when *the antagonist* is *also* a munchkin.

    Agreement to everything written above, with the additional comment that the fact that most of Sanderson's characters are somewhat irrational is only a good thing! There's really only so many ways you can do 'rational' characters, and Sanderson's writing is so prolific that it'd be dull if every single character was the same sort of perfectly self-controlled optimizer.

      \^ the distinction between *rational* fiction and *rationalist* fiction, right here.  And why /r/rational welcomes both!

  Try [The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/) by Wertifloke. The pacing is really quick and some people complained about how Naruto is so meticulous with management of his chakra, but that's how scientific investigation works and seems to be what you're looking for. This isn't a spoiler, since this is revealed in the first chapter.

  There's [Saga of Soul](http://www.sagaofsoul.com/) by Sun Tzu which starts with using the magic system to help advance science and very early on, [Soul learns to](#s " use portals to deliver a crushing amount of pressure because of the velocity difference between two altitudes.")

  [Ra](http://qntm.org/ra) has magic as an unholy fusion of particle physics, fluid dynamics, and bizarre programming languages. I don't want to say anymore because it would spoil things, but it's a very long read.

  Stuff by /u/AlexanderWales. He's written several.

  "With This Ring" over on Spacebattles.

  There's a great Animorphs fic that has its updates posted here, *The Reckoning*.

    I'll never understand why people use Spacebattles instead of AO3 or FFNet. Do you know if With This Ring has an ebook version?

      In my experience, you get more feedback on spacebattles (though less views) because it's a forum.

      WTR has a lot of coloured text in it, so it's pretty reliant on formatting. There's a Story Only thread, though; you don't have to skip past everyone's speculating between every chapter.

        It's also very good.

  it's not exactly rational, but really really munchkinny to make up for it. rick cook's wiz series puts a programmer into a fantasy world whose magic allows one spell to trigger another.
  ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  I think [Erfworld](http://www.erfworld.com/) is pretty good, although it's not based on any actual game, and while the rules generally seem like something out of a wargame there are some that seem impossible to implement, such as predictomancy.

  Fimbulwinter by ShaperV. First six chapters available for free [here](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3198066/1/Fimbulwinter). The rest of the book is available for purchase on amazon.
