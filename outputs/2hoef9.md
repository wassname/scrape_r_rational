## Any good rational horror stories?

### Post:

A lot of horror stories rely on the characters doing stupid things due to not taking the threat seriously or not being logical in deciding how to confront it. For example, in the Goatman creepypasta the characters don't constantly count each other, don't keep each other within sight, and don't sleep in shifts in a coordinated way even though those are effective tactics for dealing with a shapeshifter partly because for most of the story half of the characters don't take the threat seriously. Which is realistic and adds to the horror, but is frustrating to read.

  Lovecraftian horror doesn't rely on stupid characters - have you read The Rats In The Walls, for example? Rational or irrational, if you're in lovecraftian horror you're f'ed.

    Nah, sometimes the solution is simply to be proud of your family heritage and accept who you are.

  I consider Permutation City to be horror, but not everyone agrees with me.

  [Bunny Love Has No Limits](http://www.voicesoa.net/bunny-love-has-no-limits/) is certainly horror, and as close to HSF as any Orion's Arm story; I'm not sure whether or not enough actually happens therein for it to count as a rational fic. But it's the closest I can think of.

  Other than Charlie Stross's stories on Bob Howard, of course, with CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN and all that jazz; but that can pretty much be taken as a given, right? :)

    My favourite short rationalist-horror from Stross is 'Colder War'.

    Honestly, I never found the Laundry books to be particularly terrifying or anything. The horror aspect just doesn't really frighten me. I sort of view them as generic urban fantasy. The latest book, The Rhesus Chart, in particular inspired more laughter than anything else.

    That's not saying they're bad books - just maybe not what a horror reader is after.  Or maybe you will find them scarier than I did.

      They definitely swing towards funny, though there were a few times throughout the series that I actually felt horror (like the maternity ward stuff from *Apocalypse Codex*). The series isn't intended to be straight horror though, not by a long shot.

  Over in [my market research thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2hq2at/qbst_author_of_the_two_year_emperor_asks_would/) /u/Nepene suggested that I look into doing commissions. I think this would be a blast, and I'd like to give it a shot. 

  I will need to figure out a livable rate but let's start with a basic reality check: if I write you a rationalist horror story (potentially with a basic premise that you specify), will you pay money for it?  

  How long would you want it to be? Here are [my definitions](http://www.writing-world.com/fiction/length.shtml). 


  (Note that the "you" in this is really more of a "all y'all" -- one person is unlikely to be able to fund my time for a substantial writing project.)

  Blindsight, by Peter Watts.  More horror in the makes you reconsider your life, your place in the universe, and humanity, but still the most scary thing I've ever read.  And it's rational, no one makes stupid decisions or acts dumb.  Great writing, would recommend.

  How about [NoEnd House](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/NoEnd_House)? I recall being faintly surprised when I reached the end without any real irrationality.
