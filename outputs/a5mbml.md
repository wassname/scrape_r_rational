  Submission statement: *Ra* was one of my favorite stories, in part because I love Sam Hughes' writing style (low on the hand-holding, information dense, whip-fast), and in part because I found it inventive, exciting, and *new* in a way that's pretty rare. It finished ages ago, with a rewrite of the (contentious) ending a few months back, but it's now in e-book form, if you'd like to support the author. Pretty cheap, for being 500 pages.

  In terms of plot, magic is real, and it looks a lot like computer programming and engineering. It's approached that way by most of the characters within the work, including the main character, who's studying magic at university. There's more spoilery plot stuff after that.

  Edit: You can also [read it here for free.](https://qntm.org/ra)

    Buying. does anyone have a pdf? I've yet to spend the time capital on making kindle to my phone (@voice it reads pretty much anything not drmed) work, but text to speech is my preferred approach for anything not having an audiobook/podcast

    Memory usually requires repetition. You probably read it quickly or something and didn't need to revise the plot as much?

  I think I liked the original ending slightly more but I'm definitely picking this up. $3 is a steal for such a good book.

  I have just binged on this book in the space of an evening and 1) oh god why did i do that, it's 3 am and I have work 2) oh god why did i do that, now my soul hurts 3) why yes it does in fact live up to the hype

  I actually ended up not liking Ra. I think the opening was good but as it progressed I got more and more confused. It's been a while since I read it but I remember being disappointed with the ending.

  I really enjoyed Ra! Hope he makes some money off this.
