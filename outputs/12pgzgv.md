## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  If at any point you enjoyed the Maximum Ride series, an author called No_Wasps_Here is doing a [full rewrite](https://archiveofourown.org/works/32403190) on Ao3. It is far superior-- structurally, thematically, and technically-- than whatever James Patterson's ghost writers were doing.
  ```

  - u/alphanumericsprawl:
    ```
    It'd be hard for anything to be less structurally clear than Maximum Ride past book 1. The plot was mostly incomprehensible, it's one of the least rational things I can think of. And at one point, Max declared her conflict-resolution strategy for geopolitics would be for world leaders to duel with spears (something about low tech levels being better?) - I found that pretty cringeworthy when I was 11, let alone today.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      James Patterson is extremely competent at coming up with a premise and characters, but his ghost writer factory simply doesn't create high-quality works.

      > at one point, Max declared her conflict-resolution strategy for geopolitics would be for world leaders to duel with spears

      Now I *really* want someone to write some kind of a crack-taken-seriously story where this happens in our world. What would the political ramifications be if the Cold War was decided solely by a one-on-one spear fight between the leaders of the two superpowers? What happens if Andorra suddenly produces the world's greatest spear fighter?

          ```

      - u/fljared:
        ```
        I imagine we'd see some sort of devolution of power structure where the "leader" has little official power besides being the fighter, and real power is vested in some lower office that officially answers to the spear-leader. After that, presumably a lot of effort is put in to tournaments to find the best healthy young fighter, who's kept in top shape and rotated out every few years.

    - u/gfe98:

      I tried reading that, but eventually there were too many "You have to be a brain damaged idiot to come up with an idea that stupid" speeches for me. I guess the quest participants weren't really up to the level of difficulty.
      ```

      - u/Gold_To_Lead:
        ```
        Yes I enjoyed it for a while but the QM (QMs?) wore on me quickly. It was transparent that they had a very specific vision and were eager to “punish” participants for deviating from that. IMO Quests work best when they’re flexible and collaborative; this one felt as if it were steered with  too heavy a hand. The tug-of-war between QM and participants gradually became unignorable and overshadowed the story itself; immersion became impossible. It was fun for a few afternoons though!
        ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        Haha fair enough. I will say that the quest participants have gotten better... but it is true only because sanity checking the ideas with literally all the other main characters has become the usual MO for the protagonist nowadays. : ) 

        Surprisingly the protagonist has also survived up till now which is an *achievement* considering the blunders the quest participants made.

  u/xamueljones made a recommendation this week for "The Game At Carousel," a litRPG about people stuck filling the archetypical roles in horror movies. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65629/the-game-at-carousel-a-horror-movie-litrpg

  I binged it over several hours (36 chapters out so far) and really enjoyed it; I think much of the sub would too. Check out the thread for more people's take on it, but I see myself following it (or at least returning to it once more chapters are out).

  The author of that one recommended another story in a recent chapter author's note, Casual Heroing (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/63149/casual-heroing). I also binged that one but found it much less compelling. The protagonist is a horn dog, but he's a Marty Stu who seemingly has all the hot women find his aggressive sexual forwardness to be charming, not repulsive or upsetting. His mortal weakness is... Paperwork. He refuses the call to adventure, except he still ends up with legendary magical talent, to compliment his legendary culinary ability. 

  It's not all bad; I enjoyed how his brain goes off on random tangents (well, when they weren't horny tangents, which they frequently were), and the in-depth description of cooking and baking, and discussions about anxiety disorders and homelessness. But all the characters just seem to fall for him - or are obviously irredeemable villains - and it gets to strain credulity just a bit. Volume 1 just ended, and it doesn't take too long to get through, but I don't think it's a good fit for the sub. Maybe not bad if you want some fantasy fluff with a hefty dose of cooking discussion.

  Edit: I was also thrown off by a few of the mental tangents of the protagonist that I assume reflect the author's own views, which I think I wouldnt like much IRL. There's more than one positive reference to Joe Rogan and some dismissively mocking "people can be *anything* these days" comments that made me raise an eyebrow.

    >"The Game At Carousel,"

    Seconded. It's entertaining and interesting so far. The tickets are an interesting take on perks/abilities and seem to have real impact, but I'm less enthusiastic about the stats. There's not much discussion of strategy (even internally) but a decent amount tactically.

    I also want to see others take on it here. I'm not as extreme as others, but generally find that I dislike meta-narratives in stories. I've only enjoyed a few stories with this as a heavy theme, all from AlexanderWales, and even though I ended up loving one of them this made it a tough read due to unenjoyable patches of it for me. I generally find that other authors don't have the skill and planning to pull it off.
    ```

    - u/NinteenFortyFive:
      ```
      It feels like a LitRPG, but more in the sense of a Narrative style system like PbtA, or Fate Core/Condensed/Accelerated.

    Thank you for the warning on Casual Heroing. I was gonna give that one a shot. Apparently it is a rewrite and the prior version had the protagonist being MUCH worse.

    Hi Aureliano, I'm the author of Casual Heroing. I saw this thread through some refs. 

    I agree that Casual Heroing doesn't fit the rationalist category in many aspects. 

    One thing I'm curious about your comment though is the part about villains. 

    I think it's the first time I heard this particular critique and I would like to know more about that. The reason I say this is because I gave the impression that Plinius would be the villain, when in reality, by the narrative's account, the first book's villain ends up being Flaminia. Plinius has been kept on the sidelines and his story has had an expansion in the Interlude. 

    When you say 'irredeemable villains' do you refer to either of them or to Appius? 

    Also, as a curiosity of mine, how are you finding the magic in the latest chapter? The magic system probably fits the bill of a rationalist fiction. Curious to know if you found it interesting.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      Dang, I had an entire comment written out and my screen messed up before I posted. I'll do my best to replace it.

      So, first of all, hi! Wow, it's not too often I get authors responding directly back to my comments, so I'm trying to gather my thoughts well. 

      I want to start off my saying that I enjoyed your story, especially the parts about cooking/baking, which you either clearly have a passion for, or did a lot of in-depth research! The Great Elven Bakeoff arc was excellent.

      As for the villains comment, I was thinking of Appius and Violante in particular, with a bit of Melina on the side. That being said, I foresee only Appius being a one-note villain; when it comes to women, they all seem to fall for Joey eventually, and i imagine Violante, with the multiple references to her amazing "assets" will do so eventually (maybe Melina too, but she seems a tertiary character who may just fade into the background). As you mentioned, Plinius is being set up as a more nuanced villain, and Flam is already nuanced enough to straddle the line. I like Flam the best out of the mentioned characters, but I never considered her a villain. 

      My main issue is that characters are being set up on a side of obviously "good" or "bad." Not that characters can't change - obviously they can - but that *Joey* is obviously good, and people opposed to him are thinking in "wrong" or "bad" way. As said, the people can change - but that change is that they come to like Joey. It's never a question that what they believe or feel is wrong - it's a given. Maybe they are speciesist (many Elves) or proud (Flam) or ambitious (Plinius). But there's never a question that they are wrong and just need to reconsider their views to come around to Joey. I would have rather preferred to see the idea that Joey is wrong about some things, especially his aggressive sexual advances. Or that there is value to some of the antagonists' views. In a world of levels, those levels and skills SHOULD matter. 

      Joey is the most proud person in the story, and so far its been the world taken down a peg for not acknowledging his skill; whereas i feel like he needs to be taken down a peg for not accepting that this isn't his world, and his skills aren't as valuable as they were in ours. The world seems set up for Joey to be clearly the "good guy" and to succeed, and that rubs me the wrong way. I think most people on this sub would rather have a story where the protagonist needs to figure out the new rules and subvert them, than one where the protagonist is going to apply his worldview on everyone else, and it works out for him.

      Again, I want to thank you for the story. It's not very rational (or rationalist, obviously), and I don't think it'll be a huge hit among this sub's users; but it's well-written and fun. I didn't like everything, but that doesn't mean it's unlikeable -quite the opposite! Like I said, I found it good fantasy fluff to binge, and if someone likes cooking, they'll really like the chapters invested in that. I hope you keep writing and wish you much success! 

      Edit: haven't read the most recent chapters - just through the first volume's epilogue. I'll put in a new comment once I've read the two newest chapters!
      ```

      - u/Fowl_ez:
        ```
        Thank you for the praise! 

        I'm going to try and address every point you made:

        So far on RR no woman has fallen for Joey, though. In Patreon's chapters, there's two possible love interests, both with very good reasons *not* to pursue the relationship. 

        Flaminia is posed as the villain in volume 1, yes. It's why I was surprised by your comment. The fact that she was not considered a villain is great. Means people like her. But narrative-wise, she triggers Joey's Ordeal. She straight up puts him in the biggest existential crisis of his life in one of his most vulnerable moments. 

        Appius is probably one of the weakest characters I wrote. Agree on that. 

        There was never a plan for Violante to fall for Joey. Same for Melina. She has a future subplot with another guy mentioned in the advanced chapters. 

        Out of all the women in the bakery, there isn't one who actually fell for him.

        Also, I hear this 'sexual aggressiveness' very often. Save for the infamous interrogation with Lucinda where she appears quite hostile at some point, most of what Joey thinks stays in his head. Apart from joking with Clodia, who's *really* not interested in him since she has a girlfriend, there's very little to go on. On the outside, he's done very little. Irene, for example, came herself to speak to him. 

        I agree on levels but there are explanations that have been slightly foreshadowed that better explain this situation.

        Joey has been literally punched silly in chapter 68. Wouldn't that be 'taken down a peg'? 

        The other stuff about characterization is hard to discuss without giving away too much, I think. 

        Anyway, thank you again for the feedback. I often comb through comments and reviews, good and bad, to see what I can improve as a writer.

      The anime for that made me cry watching it in high school. After college I found out it was originally a visual novel. Playing the vn broke my heart. 

      What I will say that WA2 is not a love story, more so a story about love. I'm not sure that white album is a good recommendation for someone interested in a triad love story.

      >!Imo a core part of the story is about making the hard choices when it comes to love. Choosing love and people that are right for you even if that might hurt other people. That there often is no perfect ending that satisfies everyone. A theme that goes against the spirit of stories where there are triads generally. Since stories that end with triads are ones where the triad situation is usually that's a compromise that turns into something more than the sum of its parts in time. There's a reason why all of WA2's true endings are bittersweet and force the player to make decisions that will always leave some characters sad and unsatisfied. The ending you're talking about is not really a triad by any generally assumption of the term.!<

      I read it on his recommendation and found it good.  It's not OMG BEST Litrpg ever, but it's good maybe even inching into great if you're comparing against litrpgs.  

      The characters usually feel complex and have understandable motivations.  There are no major idiot balls anywhere. The world is well realized and fits together sensibly with the system.  There's some gaps in the worldbuilding (the unpowered stop being story relevant and disappear 10% into it), but it mostly works out well.

      The best thing about it is that it is a realized STORY, first and foremost. Many stories of this genre are basically a setting, a powerset, and a handful of cool scenes that get stretched to 200k+ words. This one is a big narrative arc that pushes forward its themes start to finish and feels more like an actual book.

      It's better than most of Royal Road, and I'd give it a high rec if you like the genre.

    Ok, so I read this over the past few days and it's....ok. If you are really itching for LitRPG, then it might be worth it. The fact that it's done is certainly nice.

    But the writing was workmanlike to say the least with a decent number of SPAG issues (not terrible, but noticeable). It wouldn't surprise me to find out the author was not a native English speaker.

    But the worst critique is that, other than the fights, the entire plot is "and then this happened". Basically everything that is not a fight that the MC does happens off screen (and most of the most important plot relevant actions are taken by characters other than the MC, also off screen). 

    And then it just sort of....ends. 

    So all told, the writing is mediocre, the MC has basically no agency and is just along for the ride, and almost nothing that isn't a fight happens on screen. If it wasn't for the fact that almost all LitRPGs that I have read are somehow much worse, I'd be solidly on the "de-rec" side of this, but like I said, if you, for whatever reason, really love LitRPGs, then sure, this one is a better-than-average example. I guess if what the reader is looking for is really detailed descriptions of fantasy fights, then this is exactly that thing.

      I didn't make it past the second dungeon due to the same issues. I had a general feeling that the whole plot and characters were just trudging forward in uninteresting ways to me, and didn't like the kind of "litrpg" it is.
