  So when I mentioned this story here before, people asked me to let them know when this next updated. And after two years of the author busy with work, he finally updated!

  It's a classic reincarnation into a new world except the hero has forgotten nearly all of his memories except for hints and vague information. The author does a very good job with the worldbuilding and having the slow exploration of an interesting magic system.

    Reincarnating a character that gets access to memories according to plot convenience doesn't seem like it would be interesting.

      It's more like he gets ideas to try and then he has to spend time, usually months to years, testing and experimenting to make them work.
