  Seems like a subclass of the teleporter problem; if "you" die and are reconstituted elsewhere, does this matter? I mean, given my beliefs on the matter, I'm pressing that button all day long. (Though this short raises a lot of questions, like why this guy's first thought was that he should use the button to seduce this random woman. Or how anyone knows about the parallel worlds. Or where this time machine came from.)

    It matters if the reconstructed copy is not close enough to the original to prevent observers from treating it like a death. In this case, each time the guy presses the button one more girl — and one more set of all the people the guy knows closely — treat his “time-travel” like a death and get a stress / depression from that knowledge.

  Why would the version of you that presses the button die? Wouldn't the machine (ideally) just seem to not work for that instance of you?

  The only person dying repeatedly would be the past self who get overwritten.

    ```
    I suppose it's a destructive read of the brain state to copy into the new body? Doesn't have to make sense really.

  ```
  So what happens in Universe 16A after she dies? The man already seems pretty traumatized.
  ```
