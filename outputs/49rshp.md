  > And “he” corresponds to the English letter H. H is for hydrogen

  Breaks suspension of disbelief. When you're not connecting He to helium, it becomes clear that you're just witnessing the divine subgraph of the looks-sparser-than-it-is graph of reality.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    But in the fusion of an H-Bomb, hydrogen isotopes fuse to create helium.
    ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    "He" connects to "H", not to "'H','E'". If you wanted something to connect to "'H','E'", it would have to be "He, [Hebrew E]".
    ```

    - u/Lord_Drol:
      ```
      Except that Hebrew _doesn't have_ an "E" equivalent. Hebrew uses an [abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad), not an alphabet, and so vowels are not represented in writing.

  Welp. Suicide has become a lot more common. God knows I probably wouldn't last long in this universe, since sometimes the only thing that keeps me alive long enough to get out of a bad time is the lack of a convenient method.

    You ok now? 

    Also, don't ever even think of buying a gun.

      It comes and goes. ATM, I'm stuck at a religious school where I can't be too open with the therapists (who aren't all that good anyway, IMO), so I'm trying to hang in long enough to graduate (this semester and two more). 

      I have an internship in San Jose starting next month and have a few places that I can go to, which will hopefully make the last two semesters a little easier to handle.

      I have no intention to buy a gun, for that very reason (although another reason that the Mortal Name would be so tempting is that it would make "donating my organs post-suicide" a lot easier; it's when I find myself starting to think about how to manage this IRL that I realize that I'm slipping again).
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Fuck, man. I'm sorry. I assume you're stuck at that school because of your parents? I've got double clergy parents myself, and though it sounds like I've had it less bad than you I still can't stand being around them for more than a few days at a time. Too many bad memories. Where others see them as paragons of Christian Virtue, I must see them as people, broken as the rest of us, putting on a mask for those they teach. Really shatters the ability to believe any of their tripe.

        Anyway, things do get better. For me, it happened when my parents moved several states away so I didn't have to deal with their crap all the time. Get educated, get out, and if necessary remove toxic influences from your life.

    A lot more common for a short burst as the information spreads. Then less common again for Darwinian reasons.

      Bet that's hell on murder investigators too
      ```

  ```
  There's somethng strange n the comments there.  Dd anyone else notce that?  (Also, t seems to have propagated backwards through hstory)
  ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  Something bigger, if not something better.
  ```

- u/JulianWyvern:
  ```
  Fun fact! I either mispronounced the Tetragrammation like every other catholic OR Divine names don't work in our world...

  Now i could try other pronounces but I think I'll quit while I'm ahead
