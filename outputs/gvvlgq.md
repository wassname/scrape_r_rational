## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  I've wanted to read a rational take on a world with deities that need faith to live and give out various supernatural powers (healing magic, superhuman strength, control over metals and so on.) Hence, I've started outlining a book with that as its premise. My central conflict will be between the fair deities who reward people sufficiently for praying to them, and the evil deities who punish nonbelievers and create followers through coercion. I only have a few vague ideas about it, but I want to hear this subs advice for how to use the premise in a clever way. I'd like to know:

  1. What are some ingenious way of abusing/exploiting the need for belief in deities? (Deities can be made through sufficiently strong belief in enough people).
  2. What would cause someone to be an anti-theist character in a setting where deities are tangibly helpful?
  3. How would religious conflict and orthodoxy be different in a world where deities unambiguously exist?
  4. What are the political implications of living in a world where religious sects are supernaturally empowered?

  or any other interesting consequences of people trying to take the consequences of divinely-empowered D&D-style clerics and paladins seriously.

    1. I would think that you would get messiah-type characters who have their own practices and beliefs which they align with a diety, without being deific themselves. Imagine a cult leader who needs to be wined and dined lest he switch his allegiance (this doesn't necessarily need to be cynical). Similarly, a sufficiently large and well-organized state could have enough power to put pressure on the gods, depending on how strong those gods are. A state religion might exist as a method of coercing or pleasing gods which the gods would in turn by obliged to support or make compromises with. Whether a state would attempt creation of a new god depends on how hard that is.
    2. "Tangibly helpful" is kind of loaded. Deities, even 'good' ones, probably have different definitions of good, and you might disagree with how their 'good' operates, for example thinking that they are, as a whole, entirely too paternalistic, something that can't be solved by replacing them, e.g. "No one man should have all that power". Alternately, you might deeply care about the emergent structures of this setup and think that the structure itself is the cause of huge amounts of waste and/or evil.
    3. Historically, a lot of religious conflict happened because of different views of the law and the social contract. I would imagine that it wouldn't change that much, if those differences persist. People legitimately believe in their religions, so gods being 'real' is kind of a non-issue except to the extent those gods actively interfere with warfare, which is kind of on the gods. Intrareligious conflicts would be a lot different though, because a god with two sects could pick a side, or fail to pick a side, or be attempting to hold a lot of different believers under a 'big tent' which would lead to conflicts in what certain positions put forward by the god actually meant. A god has the incentive to have as many followers from as many different places and ideologies as possible, but they also have incentive not to ever let those followers come to blows.
    4. I'd think there would be many more state-sponsored religions, and religion-sponsored states, likely blending governmental and religious functions to a point that's only rarely seen on Earth. You might also see a collection of state-sponsored religions, since each presumably gives different benefits, and having only a single god on your side limits you to only a single tool in the toolkit. This depends a bit on the specific powers in play, what their roles are, and how godly power ends up scaling with the number of believers (i.e. whether there's a diminishing marginal utility of belief, or whether it compounds, or some other curve or equation to where the benefits are).

    1. I encourage you to consider meta tactics. If dieties gain power through worshop you would expect that dieties which religion had their followers breed more offspring and who converted other people to be more successful.I would expect that there exists a good chunk of dieties that is of fertility(both of people and of crops) and of war(to convert more people into followers) since such a diety simply would reinforce behaviour that made it stronger more efficiently than others. I'd also expect that there are dieties that somehow forms unbreakable vows of worship. I suggest that you look at memetics.I would also expect to see a trend towards fewer and fewer dieties and dieties are insentivized to take over each others followers.What stops the evil dieties from literally having breeding stations similarly to what slave owners had but now magically efficient and with the only way out of it being to believe sufficiently strongly?
    2. They've experienced that dieties bargain in bad faith. They don't like the idea of superpowerful mindparasites. They think that dieties have bigger control over them/can track them if they actively worship.Can an individual make up a small diety for themselves?
    3. How important is it for the diety that people think of it in the exact same way? If it doesn't care much for minor details you'd see memetic drift. Notably what happens if an arch bishop in some area decides that he wants a big diety to be in X way and thus start to preaching that the diety is that way?
    4. I don't think that sects matter much tbh. State religions have so much more mojo than a sect.

  The story I'm currently writing uses ability scores. It doesn't get a lot of screen time, but it's similar to the system in The Gamer in that you start seeing bonuses outside of raw scaling as you raise your stats. The bonuses don't pop up all at once on round numbers, but they might for example start appearing in weakened form at 400 and then be fully developed around 500. For example, normal people gain and lose muscle mass as normal, but as your Strength increases you retain muscle better and better, and once you hit 100 or so you no longer lose muscle short of starvation. Then, between 1 and 500 you start getting the benefit of exercise without actually doing it, while also raising the ceiling you can hit if you do exercise. Then things get silly (As they should) and you go beyond human limits and petty thermodynamic concerns.

  I'd love some input on what abilities the different stats could give as they start going beyond mere scaling. The actual stats in this story are:

  + Form (Strength & endurance)

  + Grace (Agility, aim, precision)

  + Intelligence

  + Wisdom

  + Presence (Charisma, attractiveness, bullshit leadership aura)

  + Luck

  + Corruption (Putting points into this one lowers it, it increases when you come into contact with *eeevil*.)

  Form and Grace are fairly straight forward. They just dial up parameters that real people have, even if they do end up dialing them up beyond natural limits. I also figure Grace at high enough levels might allow you to change your perception of time, speed up thought and reaction time, etc, while Form will eventually allow for Wolverine levels of regeneration.

  Intelligence and Wisdom are split a bit arbitrarily, but I figured making them one stat was too much. We do want to make room for intelligent fools, as well. So really high Int will give you things like a photographic memory, the ability to sense physical and magical elements, eventually let you delve into Alchemy, etc. High Wisdom meanwhile allows you to sense 'life energy' and souls, and as the stat goes up you can sense them over greater distances and in more detail, eventually letting you sense personality traits and such. Different magic systems use either Int or Wis. Basically DnD style.

  Presence is an interesting one. Other than the making you 'prettier' part, it's basically just subtly mind controlling those around you, growing less subtle the more you raise it. However, it doesn't fuel magic of any kind, so going all in on it makes you less of a glass canon and more just glass.

  Luck... Well, it's useful, but the rich and powerful have spent a lot of money developing ways of neutralizing it, because otherwise it breaks everything a little too much. So it helps against nature, but not in high level combat or at up scale gambling dens.

  And finally, Corruption. Although 'discouraged' by the churches, having a high Corruption gives you secret insight into terrible, Lovecraftian truths and all that (Sanity is a resource to be spent, after all), but the flipside is it really does also damage your mind, so it's not for everyone and you might want to consider putting a few points in it now and then to keep the score down.

  There are also a million hidden stats that you can't normally touch, but spend a year at the North Pole meditating on the nature of Cold and you might 'discover' the ability to put points into Cold affinity. Live in the woods training animals and you might find a new stat representing your spiritual connection to nature. Things like that. These are mostly so I can throw in NPCs with unfair powers.

  Partly writing this to help organize my thoughts on a story I'm currently writing, but also if you have any interesting ideas on non-obvious bonuses that could come with high stats, I'd love to hear them. I'm also planning on having the main character discover a way to trade stat points around, and since in this system the stats don't bottom out at zero, I'd especially love ideas on what 'abilities' might develop out of sufficiently negative Luck and Presence.
  ```

  - u/TheJungleDragon:
    ```
    Well... If high Presence makes you 'prettier' and makes people gradually align their actions and beliefs to your interests, then largely negative Presence would presumably give you an aura of 'ugliness', and the aligning of their actions and beliefs against your interests. Now, the first boon this has is shared with high Presence, and it's that it makes others' actions more predictable. Extremely low presence means that you can be relatively certain that the people and creatures around you are going to hate you, possibly even going against their own self-interests in order to make this work. An assassin, normally preoccupied with ending your life, may open up opportunities for escape or retribution due to an instinctual need to drag the death out and make you suffer. 'Ugliness', on the other hand, has value in that it deters people from looking to closely at you. People may be inclined to look away, instead of observing you for visible weakness. They may become nauseous just from looking at you. If people are inclined to see the worst in you, and your form feels horrific, then that's terrifically intimidating, and until you get to the point where people would commit suicide just to spite you, it may be useful for information gathering.

    Once you get to the absolutely lowest of the low in Presence, you might find that people are acting almost like an AI. They may start to consider, logically, that because their future selves are likely to value self-preservation over making your life worse, that it is an imperative that they precommit to actions that make the only viable course of action destroying you. They cut ties and install dead-man's switches, learn mind alteration magic to use on themselves to make sure they maintain their hatred - and in this way, because the hatred is now cold instead of hot, your low presence has now become an aura of death in some ways, destroying the lives and psyches of those around you as they attempt to destroy you. Of course, this isn't pleasant for you, either, but a superior might have some use for such a specific variety of WMD. It is much more destructive for a nation to have its government suborned with these hate-agents than to simply wipe it out temporarily.

    Luck, then, works similarly to presence, save that the agent you antagonise is the world instead of people. The world is going out of its way to make your life a misery, and frankly this is much harder to manipulate than people, since the world has an arbitrary amount of intellect to work with. If you bottomed out on luck, for example, you might spontaneously develop a painful infection that leaves you bedridden but alive and suffering, or even worse, and there's not much anyone can do about it (unless their good luck and desire to see you happy outweighs your bad luck and similar desire).

    ```
    Form and Grace are much better stats than strength and dex - form, for example, obviously also govern how attractive you look in a still photo, while Grace governs how effectively you can do a seductive slink/strut. 

    Extend this, split mental stats into Mind and Soul. 
    Mind is thinking, memory, common sense. 

    Soul is inspiration, charisma, standing up for yourself and against evil, the favor of the gods (that is, luck) splitting out presence and luck by themselves is just too damn narrow.

    Maybe have sub-stats, much in the way worth the candle does, so that the system does permit narrower focus, not that someone who gets to distribute their stats themselves, as opposed to the auto-allocate the masses of the world are stuck with. would ever be daft enough to actually use that part.

  So, I assume nobody remembers the post I made a month ago and have been procrastinating replying to some really nice comments about? 

  In it I was saying I was considering making my urban fantasy protagonist not a cop anymore because it made the "don't go to authorities" thing too unrealistic, since she is the authorities. 

  Now for some reason "police as the good guys" seems like it requires more suspension of disbelief than "vampires as sexy love interests". 

  So I'm going to make her a firefighter, because 1984 tells us that firefighters set fires (which can be used to kill vampires - she's a vampire slayer). 

  So, my actual question:

  ------

  ***What are some cool consequences of a vampire-slaying-urban-fantasy-protagonist being a firefighter that I might not have considered? What are some opportunities? What are some drawbacks?***

    Easy access to axes springs to mind instantly.  
    Holy water in the fire hose? Vampire mind control has difficulty working if they can't see your eyes through the oxygen mask properly. People don't ask you why you are covered in ashes (from staking vampires). You can break into peoples homes, do pretty much whatever you want and as long as you emerge carrying a cat/small dog, people will cheer for you.  
    I'm liking this concept a lot.

      oh my god. AXES. 

      when she was a cop I had the crossbow be her arm of choice but.... AXES. She can throw them too. 

      And yes, firefighters are so universally loved. 

      I also figure she'll know how fires work (since that's part of firefighter training) and she'll know some basic first aid. The instigating incident for her becoming a Slayer is a car crash, which is something the fire department often goes to (as well as the police). 

      It's gonna be awesome. And she'll have a badass uniform.

          It's tricky, I'm trying to work out the logistics. 

          She's got a partner who is a wizard, so the original draft had them followed by a ghoul who they were able to defeat through a combo of having the literal high ground (they were on the top of a building) and the wizard realising for the first time that her powers actually work (she didn't think they were altogether real, it was more a "wiccan" thing for her, setting intentions etc). 

          They survived by not being worth the vampire's time, essentially, because they're not a threat. 

          But I never really liked how the masquerade was pierced by them. It involved her finding a suspicious series of murders with sightings of local vampires years and years apart. 

          When I was toying with the firefighter thing earlier, it made a lot more sense that she'd find a vampire house that burned down (probably an internal vampire conflict?) with no bodies (maybe she's in the house trying to save the occupant, and she sees the body explode into ash. the other firefighters are like "yeah, sometimes weird shit happens, or you see shit" but she is like "no there's more to it" - but why does she investigate more? Do firefighters also do post-fire investigations? Perhaps she could find something suspicious like, no food in the fridge or a "bdsm dungeon" that looks suspiciously real?). 

          I want her to ultimately have a target, but video surveillance with the (vampire) arson suspect visible plus coincidence/happenstance of the vampire showing up at the same club as the firefighter could work. It does make you wonder why a vampire would be so careless as to commit arson in view of cameras, but then again, the police force can now be corrupt (and maybe the head of the fire squad, if this vampire frequently kills rivals with arson), so the case can be dropped even though the guy investigating with the MC thought it was clearly arson. 

          Hmmm.... it's sort of coming together. The "gimme" becomes them running into each other In The World, which is not horribly inconvenient. EDIT: and the vampire being careless enough to be caught on camera.

                According to the mythology, I'm pretty sure that it's the same as the reason why they don't show up in mirrors/photographs; old mirrors are backed with silver to make them reflective, and silver tends to work against classical vampires. Also, I understand that old camera film used silver in some way.

                This implies, of course, that even classical vampires may remain *perfectly visible* on modern digital cameras, because they no longer use film.

                Of course, if you really want to give your protagonist a Big Hint, have the camera catch the vampire turning to/from a bat. And *then* have the camera taken by the police before she can copy the recording, and the official police recordings shortly afterwards 'mysteriously' do not have that bit (instead, they have a visibly *different* person setting up the arson; that guy is promptly arrested for the crime, with everyone ignoring his protestations that he wasn't anywhere close to that building at the time).

                  > Of course, if you really want to give your protagonist a Big Hint, have the camera catch the vampire turning to/from a bat. [and then all the evidence is "mysteriously" destroyed]

                  Oh, that's a good idea. That's a massive hint, believable, and immediately points to a large conspiracy so that she will be spooked from reporting this. 

                  The only thing is - would the fire department review the camera footage? Maybe her cop DNA manifests as her being more inclined to do her own investigation. The main arson guy knows that This Fire is not one for her to investigate. But she knocks on the doors of the car wash across the road and they do have footage which they send to her personal email. She looks at it, sees the damning stuff, and then... is probably already suspicious enough not to mention it? 

                  Then a few weeks later, the boss says, "oh, we managed to get footage from the car wash across the road, we found the woman who set the fire" and the MC is shocked because it was clearly a man and all of a sudden she wants to get to the bottom of this.

                  Then she runs into the vampire a few weeks later at a nightclub, observes him doing vampirey things, and the conspiracy is unwound in her brain.

                    > The only thing is - would the fire department review the camera footage?

                    Perhaps her departmental chief is a chronic delegator. He hate getting up off his chair and doing stuff himself, so he delegates *everything* to one-or-other of his underlings. And, as it so happens, he delegates the task of collecting camera footage to her.

                    Of course she looks at it, sees the transformation, and report it to him. He doesn't believe her - people don't just *turn into* bats - but he tries to be gentle, calm, supportive and get her into a session with a good psychologist, because *clearly* the strain has been too much for her and she's snapped. (Her protestations that she really did see it and she's *not crazy* don't exactly reassure him). Eventually, he agree to go to the car wash and see the evidence himself, all the while trying to suggest that perhaps she was mistaken and there's really *nothing wrong* with having a discussion with a psychologist...

                    And then when the two of them get to the car wash, the footage is different. She *can't* avoid her discussion with the psychologist now (and the fire chief, out of respect for her, tells no-one about what he considers the 'bat delusion').

                    Perhaps the psychologist turns out to be an ally. Or at least a neutral person who acts as a sounding board - someone she can at least talk about her discoveries re the conspiracy with (even if said neutral person doesn't believe a word of it, but at least maintains a noncommital facade), incidentally allowing you to tell the reader what the Protagonist is thinking without having to show her thoughts directly.

                      Hmm. I like the psychologist angle, especially because a lot of psychologists have ins with the werewolves who are keeping their masquerade very, very tight and would be on the lookout for people like Jack to refer to "specialists"(really: werewolves). 

                      I think the bat may be a bit much, especially because if the rumour gets out the vampire may come find her to silence her. But if the footage is just doctored to change the person's head, that would serve much the same purpose. 

                      We don't even need the footage: she can be on the scene putting out the fire, spot a man leaving (...actually, why would the vampire stay long enough to be seen? well, if we have the mage cast a spell to help the firefighter "find her purpose" or some bull you get there, otherwise the fact he can tamper with the video means that being seen is no problem), and then the video footage they get shows someone obviously different at the same place and time (different hair colour / clothing / etc). They are then arrested, managing to get a relatively short sentence on a plea bargain with a confession that sounds oddly rehearsed and doesn't quite match the scene (damnit my werewolf lawyer would be great here, but she does immigration stuff mostly so I doubt it would make sense for her to be here unless you use the trope of All Lawyers Can Lawyer Anything).

                        Hmmm. Some alternative options:

                        - The psychologist is *really* just a random person with no connection to the werewolf conspiracy. However, being close the the psychology industry, she is herself in a position to start *noticing* the werewolf conspiracy once she starts looking. Which she only does at the instigation of the firefighter. (Not sure if your wizard character could be making a living as a psychologist). At regular intervals (say, between chapters or something) you could have a scene where the protagonist talks the matter over with the pychologist; at first, it looks like you're doing this so that the reader knows how the protagonist is thinking (which is also a part of it), but then later on the psychologist starts noticing signs of conspiracy in her *own* industry and there's another part of the mystery revealed through that part...

                        - Maybe the fire just happened to be where the protagonist was - walking her dog, or across the road from her favourite donut place, or similar. Coincidences like that are allowed at the start of a story, in order to get the plot moving.

                        - Instead of having the scapegoat give out a rehearsed confession, it might be better to have the scapegoat react with shock. He was home all evening that night! He was nowhere *close* to the building that caught fire! He doesn't have any *evidence* because he lives alone, but he really was, and he insists on it!

                        ...and then it turns out (eventually) that this guy really *is* totally unrelated to the vampire conspiracy. He's just some poor schmuck who didn't have an alibi for that time period. The judge, however, *is* a part of the conspiracy, so he really hammers this poor guy, refusing to admit any evidence that may exonerate him, and doing everything in his power to find the guy guilty (based, if anyone asks, on the clear video evidence; and maybe a "witness statement" from another conspiracy member who insists he saw the guy there).

                        It makes sense for the vampires, because having the judge in their side is worth a lot more than having a dozen people each willing to confess to anything; because the judge is (effectively) a reusable resource.

                          > psychologist uncovering the conspiracy

                          I've been watching The Sopranos and I do like the idea of the psychologist getting in on it. I've got the wizard being the firefighter's roommate, but the psychologist would be a great bonus character. Now I wonder if we've got an existing OC I can template onto the psychologist or if we'll need a new OC.... Hm, I have a thought, though this OC is/was the wizard's love interest so... maybe not? 

                          > Maybe the fire just happened to be where the protagonist was - walking her dog, or across the road from her favourite donut place, or similar. Coincidences like that are allowed at the start of a story, in order to get the plot moving.

                          Yeah, unfortunately I'm using another coincidence to get the story moving elsewhere (she and the vampire end up crossing paths a second time, and she sees more evidence that only seems suspicious if she's suspicious of vampires anyway). 

                          > He was nowhere close to the building that caught fire! He doesn't have any evidence because he lives alone, but he really was, and he insists on it!

                          I don't think the patsy being in on it or not really affects the protagonist's actions: unless she's an expert witness (and she'll be too young for that), she's not going to be in the courtroom.

                          I don't know if we've cracked it in a way that is logical. Probably the best way she can see something suspicious is by actually physically being in the fire trying to rescue the vampire who is dying (but, if this was a vampire hit, then.... the vampire would ensure the opposing vampire was put into pieces and burned first thing and then let the rest of the building burn to cover it). 

                          Unless it was a dumb/young/inexperienced vampire... maybe that's the ticket. I wanted her to start out by hunting the biggest baddest vampire around, but maybe it's better to go for a young'un. Maybe a young vampire kills (e.g.) her maker, is dumb enough to leave the other vampire dangerously un-dead before she flees the fire ('non-paranoid vampires rarely live long'). The vampire victim is smart enough to have a house just around the corner from the fire department so Jack is on the scene very early in the fire and is in the basement/whatever to rescue the occupants. She sees vamp!vic burn to death in a way that is very unlike what she's seen before (the whole going to ash very quickly part), and is freaked out. 

                          Her work thinks she's just got PTSD, the psychologist angle happens. 

                          Now, the problem here is:

                          - How does Jack find the vampire culprit, but the police/etc don't? 
                          - How could she find the vampire culprit, if the vampire legal system is going to strike ASAP?

                          That's not too bad: culprit is bad at murdering, so was on video camera. The picture can be published in the newspaper / online on a wanted poster. 

                          But I think "seeing a vampire burn to death" uses up my one coincidence, right? So I can't have them run into each other "in the real world", and the vampire culprit in this situation wouldn't be moving freely because she'd be scared of a bigger, badder vampire finding and "arresting" her.

                          And the "vampire legal system" would have the culprit be killed almost immediately in retaliation, so that's bad. Only alternative would be the vampire realising she's about to be executed and turning herself into the police, but the corrupt police would probably deliver her back to the vampire legal system. 

                          But the logical way for this to go would be that Jack sees vampire victim burn suspiciously, Jack finds vampire culprit, Jack kills vampire culprit (with a big dose of luck), and then the vampire powers that be are like "okay this lady knows about us and has killed one of us successfully, we need to off her", and the war begins. (Naturally, the oldest vampires won't be risking their life fighting a slayer when they can have their underlings do it for them). 

                          So the big question becomes: how can Jack find the vampire culprit? And that is.... exactly the question I was asking to start with. I've just added extra steps *facepalm*

                          > It makes sense for the vampires, because having the judge in their side is worth a lot more than having a dozen people each willing to confess to anything

                          A judge is great but I feel like an unfair judge wouldn't keep her job very long, or would at least get a reputation. There's appeal and whatnot, and if the judge is actually refusing good evidence, then that's going to be something lawyers can work with. Much easier to do framing more directly and possibly with co-operation
