    A grammar note:  'thrusted a young deity in a world he[...]' on first reading sounds like a paper-thin euphemisn*; perhaps 'thrust a young deity into a world he[...]'?

    *"Och, the rebellion in the world I was in last night caught me by surprise.  Serious egg on my face.  What, you want to know if it was like being caught with my pants down?  /Worse/, sonny.  It was like it caught me with my pants down, then before I even noticed it was there bent me over and /thrusted/ me."

    (Edit:  Then again, if I take the current meaning and run with it, him not fully understanding that world would certainly go a ways to explaining why he was so caught off guard by the rebellion in it, though if it was the site of his father's pantheon then his father might have been wiser to teach him a few more things about it when he was even younger.)
