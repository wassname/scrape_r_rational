  Rational horror of a sort

  >"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush," Dr. Cliver repeated. "It's a simple
  proverb. What does it mean?"


  >I knew what he was doing. I was by no means an expert on schizophrenia, but I
  was familiar with the symptoms. Blunted affect...disorganized speech and
  thinking...No one symptom by itself is evidence of schizophrenia...No one thing by
  itself is evidence of...

  >"The proverb," Dr. Cliver said. "What does it mean?"

  >"It means...the bird in the hand stands for your inner character," I said. "While the
  outer world seems larger, the inner world..." No, that wasn't entirely clear. I tried
  again. "It means that what you understand is more important than...what
  you...what you do."

  >I felt naked as Dr. Cliver stared at me. He looked sympathetic, but I could only
  imagine him shaking his head.

  >"Am I getting it wrong?" I asked. "I feel like I'm..."

  >"You're close to the mark," Dr. Cliver said. "If you were a schoolteacher instead of
  a psychiatrist, I'd praise you for your nonstandard reasoning abilities, like I was
  the teacher and you were the student. But instead I'll act like I'm the shrink and
  you're the patient: you're displaying evidence of a schizophrenic thinking
  disorder."

  >I was drowning. No air. Air.

  >"I don't want this," I said.

  >"If you didn't want this, you shouldn't have spent all last week trying to figure out
  the true nature of thought. You shouldn't have started building that thing that
  you think can glimpse the thoughts behind the thoughts, the syncopated concepts
  that piggyback on what we call consciousness." Dr. Cliver sat up. "You deduced
  their existence, and now you want to see them. You want to see the world of
  Inspiration, to see that light face-to-face."

    "You're going insane by inches, Doctor Ibanez," Dr. Cliver said. "You can feel it, like a fever in your mind, like weevils eating your brain."

    > This is the peers' lesson to their own: mad science is mad, and believing oneself sane is the deepest form of madness.

  Ooh, I love this game. The rationalist-horror installment of the nWoD.

      It's a setting for a pen and paper RPG. A lot of those pages are going to be descriptions of rules, an encyclopedia of the local magic, etc.

          I was one of the playtesters. It's pretty good. I'm running a different game right now, but would you like for me to message you when I run a Genius campaign?

              I'm fine with that. In my experience the ruleset has been pretty easy to learn.

              Haha. I'm getting a bit more attention than I expected. Might not be for awhile, I should warn you, but I'll make sure to let you know all the same.

  WoT is telling me this site is less than safe, however there is a low confidence interval. Then the site asks me to download an attachment. Looks fishy.

    It's the CDN for google sites, which means it can host arbitrary files. That means malicious people could use it to host all kinds of nastiness.

    I don't think it's bad in and of itself, just that it's flexible enough to be used for evils.

    Here, use [this](https://sites.google.com/site/moochava/genius) link, instead of my direct link.

    - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
      ```
      Ah, thank you. I suspect I'm probably just being a bit paranoid, but what point was there to downloading such attachments if I ignore them? Anyway, I like this descent into madness they've got going on.

        No worries. It's a good rule of thumb if you're not doing this kind of thing professionally, and can see where things are likely to be security issues. I still use it for detecting scams and non-technical attacks.
        ```
