  Great. Now we just need a third level recursive fanfiction to cover what happens next.

    Considering how popular HPMOR and this fanfic is, I will bet 75% or greater probability that someone, within the next three months, will do so. Conditions for winning: a fanfic of any length greater than 2,000 words explicitly stated to be based on *Following the Phoenix* published before 4/12/2015.

    Propose your stakes for this most glorious bet! It's win-win for anyone going against me, since my opponent will either win, or receive a new HPMOR fanfic as a consolation prize.

  I loved this story, it's been a really fun read. So glad there might still be an epilogue chapter! I really want to see some of the results of Harry's work in the future.

  Heiligeezel, thanks for everything. Quite a ride! Just wanted to express gratitude, your first chapters had me spilling tears, it was so right for Hermione to get a phoenix. Keep up the good work!

  On the one hand, a bit abrupt of an ending; I would have liked to know *why* we keep hearing that Harry can off-handedly destroy the world.  On the other hand, "go and study" is certainly a fine point to end the story at.

  The general reaction, both on FF.net and here, seems to be that this was a happy ending. Are we really sure about that? The setup of this last chapter really reads to me like Harry has just started talking to the boxed AI, and is just about to happily let it out of the box. Maybe this is just me being paranoid, but we've got a number of quotes from previous chapters related to existential risk that suggest Harry is...very bad, to be kind...at managing it.

  > "If there was a one in a thousand chance that the ritual did not do what you expected, that it might have summoned an unstoppable horror that could have ended all human life, then you should not have even *considered* it. All turned out for the best yesterday, but what will happen the next time you make such a gamble?" [Ch 112]

  > "have you managed to destroy civilization yet?" There was no anger in the question, merely resignation. [Ch 115]

  >*Note to self: think before acting.* [Also Ch 115]

  What does Harry do in the last chapter? Just a partial list: he enters the tomb before anyone else, he meets the eyes of the *insanely powerful person* from an *entirely different culture with potentially alien values* without thinking twice, and as the story ends he's just about to give Ignotus the ability to possess the most powerful wizard currently alive today, with access to a phoenix and the Elder Wand!
