  Man, Quirrell's description of horcruxes SCREAM deception. "Oh no they're totally not cool, here's a perfectly sound reason why SMART people don't pursue them, people like you or I." He's also programmed Harry to mistrust/dismiss the Killing Curse. 

  So now Harry is mentally headed down the completely wrong track on Volde's two biggest threats- his horcruxes and the Killing Curse (aka the CTRL ALT DLT of the wizard world). 

  The odds are stacked against our hero- WILL HE PREVAIL?
