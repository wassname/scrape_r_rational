## [RT, HF, FF, eventual RST] Sweetie Belle and the Tablet of Knowledge

### Post:

[For rational pony settings of a more canon flavor, try this.](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/208802/sweetie-belle-and-the-tablet-of-knowledge) Sweetie Belle gets a very useful Precursor artifact stuck in her head and must embark on a mission to regain her autonomy. Part one of an eventual three; the second part is in progress.

Honestly, I love this story. The author seems to enjoy making supplemental objects to display story details. For example, in a recent chapter of the sequel, they wrote and formatted a standardized test in an Equestrian school, and provided an answer sheet to grade your results. They also provide drawings of a few mathematical calculations done in story (such as the use of calculus with Precursor symbols to obtain the area of a triangle), and draw diagrams and model some of the settings.

Beyond the tiny joys of supplemental material, the characterization of the foals (the main characters) and the supporting ponies is realistic in my mind, with great reactions, both emotional and logical, and plenty of character growth. I don't know where the second part will end up, but the current major arc of the story seems to be a coming-of-age tale with a rationalist Sweetie Belle. Definite recommendation.
