## Can you name the exact moment when your fandom went off the rational rails?

### Post:

So let's say you're really getting into a new story in some medium, it's clicking, you're falling in love, and you're intellectually stimulated...and then the writer(s) make that fatal choice to do something disappointing, contrived, and intellectually shallow.

When was the fatal moment for you?

Example: I loved the first series of *Downton Abbey*, but the moment that Julian Fellowes decided to create dramatic tension merely by having Lady Mary choose to keep silent about her reasons for not accepting Matthew's proposal, the story quality started to suffer. (When you posit a problem with an obvious solution, but you don't follow it, WRITER BEWARE.) The failure wasn't obvious at first—Lady Mary's silence was somewhat believably motivated—but I had the disappointing premonition that Fellowes was going to stick with shallow, contrived tropes to tell his story...and that premonition was confirmed in spades within the first five minutes of the second series, when the story quality took a totally predictable nose dive, and the contrived tension was maintained for the whole remainder of that series.

**Moral: Once you commit intellectual suicide in your storytelling, there's precious little that has a hope of rescuing your story and making it rational again.**

Thoughts?

  Battlestar Galactica is probably the single most promising half of a sci-fi show I've ever seen, followed by the most disappointing. Without spoiling details, it built a great world full of rich characters, compelling plots, and exciting mysteries, and tied them all to a single, nonsensical, contradictory deus-ex-machina reveal. 

  Now anytime a show promises that there is some "master plan" that will be eventually revealed, I just have a sinking feeling of deja vu and save myself some heartache by predicting that the writers are backing themselves into a corner that they don't intelligently know how to get out of.

    Aye... so often it turns out to be a blatant lie; there was never a master plan. There were never any explanations. The writers end up punishing viewers for trusting them and for trusting their curiosity.

    It's funny, Valve have admitted that there is no set worldbuilding documents for Half Life and the plot wont be determined till they have specific gameplay experiences to fit it around. I know that the G-Man's story might not have ever been written, but I wont get off the HL3 hype train yet, because if there's anything this subreddit has taught me it's that a sufficiently creative rationalist can salvage any series.

    We'll just see who they replace Mark Laidlaw with.

    Yeah, I had that same feeling with BSG. Whenever sci-fi writers crap out with a mystical angle, it always leaves me with a disappointed, hollow feeling. I don't mind a little bit of mysticism in my sci-fi—after all, any sufficiently advanced tech is indistinguishable from magic, right?—but I don't want the mysticism to be the lynchpin "revelation" of the whole master plan.

    Arthur C. Clarke walked this sci-fi/mysticism line in his writings, and sometimes he did it well (*Childhood's End*) and sometimes he did it poorly (*2001: A Space Odyssey*). Figuring out exactly why one works and the other does not is a fascinating question...

          I'm in the process of deconstructing the wish-fullfillment 'people wake up transformed as X in the 'real world' ' fic.

          In this case however that is not what is really happening at all, instead the characters in the story are some degree of accurate approximations of the minds/memories of people that were produced by what MIGHT have been a GAI. But quite possibly could have been something a lot less capable then a truly general self modifying intelligence.

          The characters are in bodies that on the surface look like and even kind of work like jRPG monsters. But everything is smoke and mirrors and compact applications of technology.

          So the story is less "wish fullfillment yay!" story and more "my life as a high tech theme park animatronic arriving a few decades earlier then the tech level should support it"

      BSG started out with perfectly "explainable" mysticism based on character motivations. Or, if it wasn't explained it didn't determine everything.

      I didn't need it to really be explained either but it became a tumor that grew and swallowed everything. 

      The easiest thing to do would be to simply leave it as something the characters believe but the show is agnostic to, the way they started out. 

      The problem was -and I think the admitted this- they had an idea they felt was soooo brilliant they had to throw it against the wall and see if it sticked. No planning, nothing. Just..do it, for fun

      The ironic thing here is that BSG is brilliant because the creator ran from all the dumb things in Star Trek that frustrated him. No damage lasting more than a week, no character or arc planning and no consistency. And he falls back into the trap.

    Personally I enjoyed the second series more than the first due to its more mature characters and themes, but both series suffered from plot contrivances in my recollection. The major issue I had with the second series was how much it of it was driven by prophecy.  I've gone on rants before about how every story with a prophecy in it would be better without one, but the Heroes of Olympus series in particular uses it as a crutch to propel the plot.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I wouldn't go as far as you in your evaluation of prophecies but  do think fantasy series in particular need to be wary of prophecies.

      Vague myths or ancient stories that have suffered from 'telephone' over 1000's of years are far more interesting than explicit prophecies, for one.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:

        Exactly. Pedictions with some unknown probability of being accurate are fine: seeing the characters try to react to the information can be really compelling. Truth from On High, whether religious or magic, are far less interesting.

    Personally I think it was after the major and obviously spoilery climax between the seasons. The new characters and plots just didn't have the same weight or focus.

      IIRC, it was supposed to end there.

      The publisher demanded more, because they didn't like the sort of ending that stopping there created.

    I am currently watching FMA: Brotherhood. [Third Act Stupidity](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdActStupidity) in this show comes into play barely some 10-15 episodes into the story: the antagonists are just so much more powerful than the main characters that they have to sabotage their own plans by one stupid decision or another almost at least once per episode.

    edit: Same thing happened in the later Hunter x Hunter arcs.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I'm okay with the villains being powerful but flawed beings (the ants in Hunter) as long as their blunders feel organic and do not outweigh the smart decisions and sacrifices of the heroes. Everyone's mileage may vary on where that subjective line is, though.

  In the most recent bout of episodes of Steven Universe we get to know that the evil aliens have an inter*galactic* empire and that the supposed supreme rulers are kinda goofy and not as competent as would be required to run a pan-galactic fascist government.

  It's not an egregious example but it shunts the worldbuilding from sci-fi to space fantasy.
  ```

    I feel Steven Universe is still getting better. I don't think some characters being petty stops them from being effective rulers (not optimal, just effective); Caligula didn't stop the Roman empire from being an empire.

      ```
      That's not what I am saying.

      I am saying: Governance doesn't look like that. The DA is made to be... Caricatures, perhaps, of totalitarianism. So far I have seen no evidence of them having the levels of hypercompetence it takes to govern just a single planet, to say nothing of multiple galaxies.

      YD ought to have been surrounded by senior staff and advisers, shouting orders to and fro 24/7. You can't do the kingly thing and have an effective society that spans a galaxy at the same time — the information bandwidth simply isn't high enough.

      Take the PotUS for instance. Obama has aged two decades in two four-year terms. That's how taxing ruling a 300 mill.pop. country is. A 300 bill.pop. galaxy? Good luck having enough time to sit in a lighthouse with only a single servant by your side.

        So all the other weird Steven Universe stuff does not bother you? Thats where you draw the line for suspension of suspension of disbelief? 

        I think the world and empire should look vastly different if they have semi-immortal hyper powerful psi-beings everywhere. What were the rebels up to in last 5000 years? Done apparently nothing of importance. Where is the stream of scientists, fans, and political advisors doing a pilgrimage to the temple? 

        And why would the empire retreat 5000 years? There are just 4 gems left! Thats not a rebel army.  Send a scout ship once in a thousand years to check!

        It's not clear that they have a 300 billion population galaxy (or multiple galaxies).  There's a lot of Steven Universe that implies the Homeworld Gem population count is fairly restricted : the size of the Kindergartens, the scale of structures like the Ancient Colony Ship and Galaxy Warp, and much of the background art on Gem architecture.  Peridot's identification scheme could theoretically extend to ~78 billion Peridots, but the way it's formatted suggests that use of the address space is probably two orders of magnitude lower, perhaps even three, and she's one of the single most common gem types.  Even the Cluster, made from the remains of an intersystem war, is described in the mere millions of gem shards: these are scales that humans would wage war on by the mid-19th century, not what we'd expect from people like us a step up the Kardashev scale.

        Homeworld Gems may do the Kingly thing because that's what the have the population (and where a Galaxy warp isn't established, communications technology) to actually implement.

        I understand where you're coming from, but I think Steven Universe focuses on the atmosphere, and the atmosphere feels properly totalitarian. On the balance, I don't think this is enough to shift the story from sci-fi to fantasy. Sci-fi doesn't have to be perfectly realistic. 

        Defining genres is based to some degree on preference though, so I think we can agree to disagree.

  Ra, when it introduced a superintelligent antagonist. I was pretty invested in the story and [wrote about it in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/qntm/comments/2p6zep/ra_ch_35_destructor_finale/cmv00xf).

    I think Ra (and Fine Structure to an extent) was constantly going off the rails in every way. The author can't seem to keep his stories "grounded" if that makes sense. He needs to constantly raise levels of complexity for some reason, eventually going past what's enjoyable.

    Still really enjoyable as a whole, I have to admit.

      That *really* bothered me [Spoiler](#s "about the ending- when the mother was castigating the daughter for being so dumb as to fall for the lies specifically crafted to make her want to believe them. I'm sorry, you were part of the plot to recreate an entire dead civilization so that you could rule them as demigods, abruptly threw away your family to save a handful of "fake" people, and now you think you have the moral high ground to complain about how your daughter grew up in your absence, even though she fell for a plot as a direct consequence of you abandoning her?") Bullshit. To let that stand and then end the story was just bad storytelling.

  The Two Year Emperor, Suzy's ascension.

  Her ascension itself was selfish, endangering the future of her civilisation for the sake of her getting the credit and power by not sharing her two-levels-higher thinking with the rest of the government.

  Then, after her ascension, she continues to refuse the obvious route of asking the former protagonists for help, but instead wanders aimlessly, terrorising people and eventually committing genocide in a world where even 'always (chaotic) evil' is easily reversible with a mass-purchasable helmet of inverse alignment.

  If you don't mind me asking, what happened in the first five minutes of season 2 that turned you off?
  ```

    We learn that:

    * Matthew has been avoiding everyone in the Crawley family, except for his mother, for *two years*. (Really? So he had a falling out with Mary and he's stopped talking to *everyone?*)
    * Matthew has gotten engaged to some new, offscreen female character that he only met once, very briefly.
    * Mary is getting herself entangled with a new, offscreen male character that apparently nobody likes, including herself.

    Setting aside the contrived and implausible nature of this situation, let's imagine how this will play out, shall we? There will be a tedious love quadrangle (because obviously Matthew and Mary are endgame) for the entire season, where we do not become emotionally invested in the new characters and where most of the plot machinations surrounding Mary and Matthew involve getting the two new characters back out of the story again.

    And, lo, that is exactly what happened (::yawn::). The male character was reduced to a bully and Matthew punched him (which was briefly satisfying, I admit), and the female character was conveniently killed off by the Spanish flu, which also conveniently spared all of the other characters that we know and love.

    But, okay, lots of romances have this kind of extended will-they-or-won't-they structure. The thing that really irked me was that this shallow and predictable plot line dominated the Crawley family's half of the Series 2 plot, and the opportunity cost was immense. Julian Fellowes sacrificed the possibility of a deeper, more resonant treatment of WWI (which was, in effect, just a background contrivance to keep Matthew and Mary apart, and which Fellowes dispensed with in only *four* episodes—by episode five, Matthew is home and we never see another war scene), and then Fellowes compounded his mistake by utterly wasting the dramatic opportunities inherent in the Matthew-paraplegia storyline, finally capping it off with a completely unbelievable miracle recovery. (Because of course we can't have our male romantic lead injured in any *real* way as a result of living through *four years of war*.)

    My tooth-grinding frustration with the terrible waste of a possibly fantastic storyline at least had one good outcome: it prompted me to [write the story that we *should* have gotten](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10078078/1/Trust-and-Providence). :)

  Eragon. Where do you begin???

  edit: For me, up until the final book, it could have been saved. But that was just the nail in the coffin. Between the deus ex machina powerups and downs, the inexplicable killing-off of the centuries-old magic, telekinetic, and super-strong elf queen only for her killer to be revenge-killed by a normal human, and then the frantic shoehorning of the last third of the novel's events to fit the prophecy - kind of - from the first book... there wasn't really a shred of sense in it by the finale.

  Suffered greatly from poor plotting in advance, which led to struggling to very quickly set up the endgame with no... setup.
