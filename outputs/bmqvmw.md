  Another thing I've been meaning to ask:

  Is there some trick to mind-reading with genjutsu (in particular with the Sharingan)?  Hypnosis/suggestion can be cleverly achieved by simulating subvocalized thoughts.  If you buy the [Predictive Processing](https://predictive-mind.net/) account of cognition, the ceiling seems high on mind control by faking internal and external sensory stimuli.  But how do you read someone's mind with illusions?  Is it just an extra power that genjutsu has, or does it follow from legible laws governing how chakra works in this setting?

    Thanks for the link. My interpretation of genjutsu is based on information theory 101, as also explained in HPMOR:

    >"Information theory 101," the boy said in a lecturing tone. "Observing variable X conveys information about variable Y, if and only if the possible values of X have different probabilities given different states of Y. The instant you hear about anything whatsoever that varies between a spy and a nonspy, you should immediately think of exploiting it to distinguish spies from nonspies. Similarly, to distinguish reality from lies, you need a process which behaves differently in the presence of truth and falsehood - that's why 'faith' doesn't work as a discriminant, while 'make experimental predictions and test them' does.

    In canon, you have genjutsu techniques like the Hell Viewing jutsu which work by digging up the target's greatest subconscious fear. That is already a very basic form of 'mind reading', though of course most ninjas don't know about science to see it that way. Kakashi takes this to the next level when he implants [suggestions](https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Suggestion) in Zabuza's brain using his Sharingan, which is a form of 'mind writing', and then Sasuke really drives this home in Shippuden by having a three-way conversation *inside Naruto's mind* with him and the Nine-tails.

    And it *makes sense* that illusions would be able to do all of that, from an information theory perspective, because there is no such thing as action without interaction: There is no such thing as one-way communication, in other words. If you punch a wall, then the wall also punches you. If you don't believe me, ask your hand.

    And if you can communicate with someone, then it should also be possible to read their mind while keeping your own thoughts hidden. That's how genjutsu works, after all: You sneak your chakra into their brain and manipulate their thoughts without them noticing it. And that's also why reverse-genjutsu works - if you *do* notice that the enemy's chakra is in contact with yours, then by definition your chakra is also in contact with theirs, and that means you can instantly cast a genjutsu by using the interaction that is already occurring between your brain and theirs. :)

    And from there, all the other abilities of the Sharingan make sense too. You can use it to control the Tailed Beasts, you say?? What a random OP ability! But wait, if the Sharingan lets you cast illusions, and illusions can be used to impart suggestions, and those suggestions can only be dispelled by releasing the genjutsu, and if Tailed Beasts don't have that ability because they aren't ninjas... then of course the Uchiha can control the Kyubi. Any powerful genjutsu user could do the same thing! They're just passing it off as a unique ability because they don't want to share the secret to their power.

    That's one thing that makes Naruto so rich in potential for rational fanfiction: A lot of mechanics just make *so much sense* when you start thinking about them. It would have been easy for Kishi to write a system that falls apart upon further reflection, but as weird as it may seem, Naruto just gets better the more you think about it. :)
    ```

      Ok that makes sense.  I was thinking of genjutsu as basically being light/sound release illusions (with only only distinction being that the effect is generated locally in front of the target's eyes (etc) rather than eg around one's own body.  But it sounds like genjutsu interacts with the target's mind more directly.  

      If genjutsu is somehow correlating one's brain with that of the target, it makes sense that one can both "read" and "write".

      So, a ninja gets their chakra into your brain, and then you flare your chakra to expel it? 

      And for reverse genjutsu, is it that you have access to their chakra and specifically chakra that is currently "linked" to their brain, and then you use your chakra to manipulate it?  If it's just access to their chakra, you could cast a genjutsu on someone through their shadow clone or fireball or whatever, yeah?  

      I can also imagine reverse-genjutsu as taking advantage of the correlation the attacker set up, and manipulating one's own brain to produce the desired effects (eg they expect to see one's greatest fear, but they see an empty void).

      How are you thinking about it?

  ground or a -> ground a

  Kakashi mentions in this that the attack on Konoha reminds him of the attack on the village in the Land of Waves, and that it carries the same signature (at least that is how I understood him), but did Akatsuki actually have anything to do with that?  I had thought that was just Haku's plan.

  Also, I have to agree that Kakashi is amazing in this fic.  The combat in this chapter really captured the core appeal of the battles in Naruto, probably more than any fight I can think of from the anime/manga.

  Are you planning on releasing a chapter each week until the end of the arc?

  Oh, and I'm really excited to see you updating again!

    Kakashi is speculating that somebody else might have influenced events behind the scenes. He's basically getting at the same thing Naruto originally accused Sasuke of, way back in chapter 20:

    >Naruto  turned to face his teammate. Perhaps it was the way he said it, or just  the fact that Naruto had never seen Sasuke look uncomfortable before,  but that was the moment he knew. “It was *you*.”  
    >  
    >“What?”  
    >  
    >“That night –  you left me and Sakura at the dinner table with Tsunami, while Kakashi  and Tazuna were getting the beds set up. Where *were* you? You went to Inari’s room, and you convinced him to fight, didn’t you? You’re the one that got him killed!”  
    >  
    >“No! I never – I never meant to…”  
    >  
    >The  horrified look on Sasuke’s face was all the confirmation Naruto needed,  and the smouldering fury that welled up inside him brought new certainty  in its wake. “What Kakashi said back at the training grounds, about how  you convinced us to fight Gato just so you could get some combat  experience… what did he mean by that?” Before Sasuke could give an  answer, the next realization hit him. “You were complaining about the  lack of combat missions even back in Konoha, and then we get a C-rank  mission the next day – but of course the *Lord Uchiha* would be  able to pull some strings to make that happen! And then it turns out  we’re up against one of the Seven Swordsmen, what’re the odds of that?  Tricking us into accepting a dangerous mission – was that Tazuna’s plan  to save some money, or did you whisper that idea in his ear too?”

    Of course, just because one of the main characters says something doesn't mean it's true, so the whole thing could just be a coincidence. But considering how this is the second mission in a row where a powerful ninja seems to be targeting him specifically, you can see why he might suspect foul play.

    Also, Itachi totally did rescue Zabuza from Gatou in the very next chapter, and then they used him to start a revolution that ended with the death of the Mizukage. So all of this does fit with Akatsuki's methods and goals

    >Also, I have to agree that Kakashi is  amazing in this fic. The combat in this chapter really captured the  core appeal of the battles in Naruto, probably more than any fight I can  think of from the anime/manga.

    Thanks! I've been really happy with how well my combat scenes have been received, and Kakashi especially really seems to take the spotlight. I may have underestimated how much people enjoy seeing genuine competence in their main characters :)

    >Are you planning on releasing a chapter each week until the end of the arc?

    Yep! Though sometimes I find myself thinking that maybe it would be better to update every few days or so, seeing how the enthusiasm from last chapter already seems to have calmed down quite a bit. And whenever I read other popular stories, like Purple Days which was recommended here recently, I notice that they all update very rapidly and become hugely popular as a result despite having awful writing. So I'm starting to think that maybe I should just stop editing obsessively and just post more chapters even if they're less than perfect <\_<

      All of that makes sense re: Kakashi and his thinking there.  I'm not sure why it struck me as strange before, because now it seems really intuitive that he would be thinking something like this.  I'm a bit convinced myself.

      Regarding update pace: I can't believe I'm saying this but I hope you take your time with editing.  I really think this is a fantastic story, so I'd be pretty bummed if it ended up worse forever so that chapters could come out a few days sooner.  On the other hand, I've been visiting this subreddit multiple times a day hoping for an update, so getting one a few times a week would be pretty hype.

      I don't know why the story is so much less popular than like MoL or even Origin of Species.  I guess I shouldn't expect people to be rereading things all that much, so it makes sense that a lot of readers fall off.  I'm also not sure why there's so little discussion, and I feel a bit guilty for not commenting more.  I imagine it can be discouraging, if you think you are making something awesome but it isn't being received that way.  (I may just be projecting though.)

      Re: Kakashi's fights, and combat in this fic in general, I think you do a great job of avoiding "puzzle fights" (Naruto v. Gaara excepted) where the whole thing is about putting together some weird interaction to get past someone's unbeatable defense or whatever.  Your fights are very interactive, and don't feel gimmicky at all.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        I suspect a lot of people take strange events in NTBS for granted because they happen in very similar ways in canon, and so they assume that these events are just copied over and you're not supposed to question them. I try not to have things happen because the plot demands it though, and so when really weird coincidences occur it's usually because something strange is genuinely happening.

        Anyway, there's absolutely no need for you to feel guilty, but yes it does bother me a little that people read so much trash and have so little patience for stories like NTBS. But then, from an objective perspective, maybe that just means that those 'trash' stories have a hidden quality that NTBS does not. I mean, if I didn't write the kind of story that most people want to read, well then, that's on me :)

        >Re: Kakashi's fights, and combat in this fic in general, I think you do a  great job of avoiding "puzzle fights" (Naruto v.

Your fights are very  interactive, and don't feel gimmicky at all.

        Thanks! People really liked the Gaara vs Naruto fight though, but that's probably just because there was \*finally\* a payoff where Naruto could go all-out and show everyone what he was really capable of... only to end up making matters worse as always, of course :)

        (see, it's my own fault for being an elitist who refuses to give the readers what they want!)

        I actually really enjoy having that bit of variety though. Literally every single fight in NTBS is totally different from all the others. Naruto's first real fight has him running away from a superior enemy while attempting to save an innocent villager. His second fight is a hidden attempt to convince onlookers that rationality is an advantage. His third fight is an effort of his best friend, Sakura, to stop him from risking his life against Gaara. His fourth fight has him putting up a show while his real body is acting to kill his opponent while being chased through the Village. And now in this arc, we just had Shikamaru fight a doomed 5 vs 2 battle that shows the importance of preparation and teamwork, followed by a 1-on-1 fight with Kakashi against a madwoman who might be sent by his true enemy in an attempt to engineer his death.

        Every single fight is completely different in nature, with different stakes, different terrain and different fighters, and I think that's a big part of what makes them so fun. :)
