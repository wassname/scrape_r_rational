  Enjoying seeing Velika as a deeper character. Maybe Rain really can get through to her, or act as an advisor for things.

    Yeah I appreciate that the characters all have their own motivations and goals. Even Velika,  who was introduced as a generic egotistical antagonist, now feels more real.
    ```

    ```
    For a moment there I thought Rain was going to paraphrase Machiavelli. It seems the sort of thing that would really help her, to wit: "That one should avoid being despised and hated".

  ```
  Another great chapter. Maybe over-clarity is doing Velika some good?
  ```

  - u/Luminous_Lead:
    ```
    Oh yeah, that would help wouldn't it. Rain very nearly uplifted that horse he was travelling with. A longer memory might help Venika be less impulsive

  The majority of those trainees were holding massive idiot balls that don't make much sense in the world they live in.
  ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    I agree. Consider that absolutely everyone we've seen side from Rain considers Clarity a dump stat.
    ```

      I mean whatever in that case. People not trying out dynamo and not understanding the implications of how experience works can (barely) slip by my SoD.

      But specifically the non-awakened that were supposed to go into the dungeon were clearly behaving too dumb for reality.
      ```

        Dynamo isn't that good, sure you get to cap skills fast (stamina would be even faster) but that's not what limits adventurers (including Rain himself) mid to long term. He's great against low level mobs in the area immediately around him, which is awful in  the combat meta of the world. Although every party or at least town should have their own aura guy to fuel them.

        Edit: Although a decent Dynamo/Stamina build should have unlocked tons of skill tiers and informed their government/group.

    They fit my experience of gamers.  The wiki is wrong but woe to anyone who dares contradict it. Also the wiki isn't actually a wiki in that they restrict who can add or change content to just a handful of individuals.
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      Not even gamers.  All teenagers are really dumb and are awful at gauging risk.  

      Take them to dungeon Disneyland they've been waiting all their life for?  You're just lucky that any of them are keeping up with you and holding formation.
      ```
