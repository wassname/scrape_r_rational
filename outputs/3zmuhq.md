## [META] We balance on the edge of a new mille

### Post:

Not all that long ago we celebrated our 3000th subscriber.  My understanding is that it took the sub several years to get to that point; it was a moderate-sized deal at the time.

I've been watching the subscriber numbers for the last week or so, and they been teetering around 3990 +/- 3; as I write this we're at 3991.  Quick, someone go out and recruit 9 friends!

In more seriousness, this kind of growth always fascinates me.  Network effects, exponential growth, tipping points, meme vectors...cool and very useful stuff if one can understand it.  

I'm curious as to what is bringing people in; for anyone who cares to chime in, how did you find out about this sub and what made you subscribe?

  As a matter of historical record-keeping, this sub was taken over (from the very charitable /u/centipeed) on 12/3/2013 following [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rz3k5/ripe_for_abuse/) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1rkkam/in_light_of_the_recent_slew_of_recommendations/) in /r/HPMOR, the latter of which is where our sidebar rules originated (thanks /u/vivificient), now with some minor refinements. The original mod in the early days was [](#s "REDACTED"), whose spirit is said to haunt our subreddit to this very day.

  As a friendly reminder, the (bi)weekly challenge is now a little over six months old, [and is cataloged here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge) if you missed any of them.

  Whenever I got a noticeable spike in my fiction blog traffic, I'd do a search to see if I could find what caused it.  Going back more than a year, there were periodic posts on here and a few other subreddits linking to my stories.  I stayed away for a long time, because I wasn't sure about the boundaries for self promotion, and didn't want to offend, but after some nice feedback, I decided to make an account so I could answer questions and thank people.  I'd never really thought of my fiction as 'rational fiction' so much as stories where smart people actually acted reasonably intelligently, instead of being driven by the whims of plot and limits of the author.

    That's what 'rational fiction' has come to mean. This sub was created as an aggregator for 'fiction that's like *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*', but as the community grew we've figured out what we specifically liked in that and what sort of story appeals to us (and what things we'd created tags for turned out to be superfluous). It's a fascinating process to watch.

    I love your story, by the way. It and the weekly discussion threads are what keep me coming back here.

    - u/DocFuture:
      ```
      Thanks, glad you've enjoyed it.
      ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    I haven't read your sequels yet, but I know I definitely enjoyed *The Fall of Doc Future* and I was wondering if you were planning on releasing it in epub, mobi, or pdf form so we can have our own offline copies?

    I enjoyed your story so much that I went to the trouble of copying and pasting each chapter into my very own Microsoft file and converted into a pdf for private use.

    Thanks so much!

    Not a fan of your series's romances (I stopped reading at the appearance of the anthropomorphic AI that *just happens* to be romantically inclined to their creator), but the first book was good enough.

- u/None:

  Uh-oh.  We're becoming *popular*.

  Soon, not only will sempai notice us, but assholes in unexpected places will be referencing half of everything we post in really embarrassing ways.

  Part 1 (circa 2011; 95% correct?): Found FanFiction.net → browsed stories, mostly for *Naruto*, *Harry Potter*, *Avatar*, and *Death Note*--but FanFiction.net hadn't yet implemented sorting by number of favorites or reviews, so I could only filter by number of words (>100k or >200k, usually) and sort by date of publishing or date of most recent update. How lucky I was to discover *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)* in such circumstances!

  Part 2 (circa 2012; 80% correct?): Saw that FanFiction.net had implemented sorting by number of reviews and favorites → sorted all *Harry Potter* stories by number of favorites → discovered *[Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com/)*

  Part 3 (circa 2014; 90% correct?): Found TV Tropes → stumbled across Polandball article → browsed r\/Polandball → glanced at other subreddits → found r/ParadoxPlaza → made this account to show off [the cool maps that I'd made for my own amusement](http://imgur.com/a/Lb4hj) → subscribed to various subreddits, including this one (presumably discovered through the RSS feed of *HPMoR* updates)

    If anyone is interested, [this now several months out of date spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EwpYAPX9vzG-TyMDDO3tIYqEO21qsHcGvcVFS2EoA1M/edit?usp=sharing) shows the date of your first ~~post~~ comment in this subreddit.

      It seems awkward that you can't sort it without breaking all the formulas. WTF, google? [Here's a values-only copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zuu4o7J0YF-fSD2YN_SjD9GB7mCEbEvBa2oh-uj5dN4/edit?usp=sharing) that you can sort intuitively.

      Also, damn, I've been here since 2013? How the time flies.
      ```

        The values-only copy appears to have not copied the links

        - u/Anderkent:
          ```
          Haha oups. Well, can't be arsed to do that :P It's only really meant to make things sortable.
          ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Assuming not more than 500 new subscribers since then, it seems less than half the accounts that subscribe have posted or commented. Interesting.

      - u/Chronophilia:

        That's fairly typical for Reddit. The admins have talked about the 90/9/1 rule: 90% of Reddit users read but don't interact, 9% only upvote and downvote, and 1% write comments and posts.

  Ahh, I'm not actually subscribed in this particular throwaway. Here it is, then: 3994! (Edit: exactly 4000 at the time of editing!!! Woot!)

  I'm glad this subreddit has grown so well. Kudos to our great mods, picked by /u/eaturbrainz – and man, serious kudos to the dude who picked brains after realizing he needed to quit reddit for a bit … bet he'd be really proud that his baby is lasting nicely. I remember when it was just an empty forum with a vague promise about "cool-headed discussion" or some shit like that … a diamond in the rough. Super thanks to the dude who was really nice by willingly surrendering such prime domainspace in response to a short PM. By the time I even accepted the request to mod it, he'd already unmodded himself. Fun stuff.

  Anyway, looking forward to seeing the new thousand.

    Are you /u/sapphirebnb, or whatever that username was back in the day?

    (Personally, as a mod, I'm just happy that this place is fairly active and runs well without a lot of interference.  Getting involved in modding wars is the least-fun, most time-consuming thing to do as a mod, and I'm glad not to do it.)
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Yeahhhh /u/seraphnb, guilty as charged – tho I must say, I enjoy /u/sapphirebnb much better. I'd always imagined this sub as a rather laissez faire sorta place, so it makes me happy to see that most mod action is still along the lines of "promoting fun things for the community" as opposed to "approving posts and deleting submissions." You guys have done amazingly through and through, and I look forward to seeing where the future goes.

        And thanks.

        But stop chain-deleting accounts.

  First read HPMOR since it was #1 in Reviews for the Harry Potter section, loved it, and found this sub through /r/HPMOR.  There wasn't much that interested me in the beginning but its gotten a lot better over time.

- u/gamarad:
  ```
  We reached [3000](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/38a2b1/meta_rrational_hits_3000_subscribers/) 218 days ago and we reached 2000 a year and three days ago. It took 58 days longer to go from 3000 to 4000 than it took to go from [2000](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2rcbbz/meta_rrational_hits_2000_subscribers/) to 3000. I suspect growth between 2000 and 3000 may have been inflated because HPMOR ended in that time which gave this sub a boost from people searching for an alternative source of rational/rationalist fiction.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    So the growth was linear. Disappointing.

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  Personally, back when I started writing 2YE someone linked it here and told me they had done so.  I stopped by to say thanks and the rest is history.

- u/GaBeRockKing:

  Haha! I unsubscribed so I could make a ninja re-subscribe to be the 4,000th member!

  Get on ma lvl.

    It's been over a week now that we've been teetering on the edge and we haven't come close enough for one more person to matter.

    Have fun obsessively reloading the page.  :>

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      I was going to re-subscribe because I was getting bored, but now I won't, just to spite you  >:(

      ^^oh, ^^who ^^am ^^I ^^kidding, ^^that's ^^not ^^going ^^to ^^happen.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:

        Haha!  My cunning plan to keep the counts low so that I can be the 4000th subscriber has succeeded!

      The real question: how many different people can have been the 4000th member?
      ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  I think, but I'm not certain, that I discovered "Three Worlds Collide" (although I'm not sure how), which led me to Yudkowski, which led to Less Wrong, and at some semi-random point, HPMOR. HPMOR's final exam led me here, in turn.
  ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  I got linked here from HPMOR around when it was ending. Needed my rational story fix, and the community was great, so here I stayed.

  And now according to /u/alexanderwales 's spreadsheet I'm apparently in the top 15 for postcount. Honestly did not expect that.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Me neither for myself as well. I only post when I come across something shiny on the Internet that I think everyone else here would like.
    ```

- u/icingdeath9999:
  ```
  Normally I don't participate in discussions on this subreddit, because the bar is set to high for me to contribute anything of value.
  I like how people reason over here and the interaction between community and authors.

  A post on HN pointed me to HPMOR after the last chapter was released,  I really enjoyed HPMOR.
  Afterwards I filled my reading time with worm and HPMOR fanfiction and then another post on HN finally pointed me to r/rational

  I check regularly for new content and look forward to new chapters of Mother of Learning and Team Anko.

    > I check regularly for new content and look forward to new chapters of Mother of Learning and Team Anko.

    Thank you, that's really flattering. FYI, Team Anko updates every other Sunday, most recently on the 3rd. There isn't a specific time, but I haven't missed an update yet.

- u/Rhamni:
  ```
  I was browsing thepiratebay for audiobooks and found the HPMOR podcast way up the top 100 audiobooks. And I figured, hey, HP fanfiction with a pretentious name that is popular enough to get its own podcast, might as well give it a shot. It cut out just after Hermione's little incident. So you know, that made me kinda motivated to go look for the rest of HPMOR. There wasn't much more written, but it did let me find the subreddit. Which links here all the time. I stayed because there's good content and good people.

  Also, the squeaky clean reddit account I use on untrusted hardware is also subscribed, so I'm afraid there is *at least one LIE* among those 4k. Gasp!
  ```

- u/TheImmortalLS:
  ```
  Found this sub from "lighting up the dark" by velorean., inspiredhby hpmor. He doesn't update often, so I decided to go to reddit to check. 



  Now I'm writing and it may be a long ways off, but reading here helps.
