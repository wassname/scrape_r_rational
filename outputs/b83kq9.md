## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  What do people think about a parent comment in this thread where we can reply to comment on recommendations from previous weeks? Like, "rec x from last week was decent, thanks 'u/user123' " or "rec y was not to my taste", and so on. A minihub for discussion, maybe, which wouldn't interfere with the rest of the thread.

    Most stuff that gets recommended is old enough that others have read it already. In this very thread, there is a discussion about the merits of some of the recommendations (and I have done similar things in previous weeks). Basically, I think this function is already satisfied by sub threads from people who have already read/are already reading a given recommendation. These threads aren't usually so busy that there would be a big cost to adding such a sticky, but I'm not sure how much value it would add, when at least some of that kind of discussion is already happening.
    ```

  I was surprised that a cursory search didn't turn up a recommendation for the (now completed) web serial [Symbiote](https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/chapter-1-a-meeting-of-the-minds/) (and if I'm mistaken and it has been recommended before, then it's been long enough that I think it's worth bringing back up). It's a pretty interesting story about symbiotic artificial organisms that have perfect control over internal biology, as well as nanoscale construction and quantum computing. The story explores the implications of that kind of powerset and and the psychology of what humans do when given those abilities. The worldbuilding is interesting, the characters have well defined goals that they pursue rationally, and the outcomes of changes are realistically propagated throughout the world.  

  My biggest critique of the story is that the dialogue is pretty stilted and doesn't feel very natural. There is hardly a single conversation in the whole thing that feels like the way two people would actually communicate.  Additionally, it has a pretty major powercreep issue (although the author deals with it better than some other stories I have read), and the main character is an acknowledged Gary Stue. 

  Despite these issues, I think it's worth a read.
  ```

  - u/FriendlyAnnatar:
    ```
    It's probably just that Symbiote was posted a long time ago, but I'd agree it's worth a read (and recommendation).

    While you're reading farmerbob1, I would highly recommend [Set In Stone](https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/10/08/backstory-revamped-into-prologue/), which is a slow-burning downlift/uplift-in-progress story that is drastically different from Symbiote but definitely worth a try.

    The story follows a rational, innovative protagonist as he solves all his problems with his herd of swine (only partially joking). I would say reading the prologue and first chapter should be enough to give a hint whether you'll enjoy it, but if that type of story doesn't do it for you then >!be aware that the protagonist makes a breakthrough that puts him in touch with the world-governing AI that is uplifting humanity, and adds a whole new dynamic to the story!<.

    /u/farmerbob1 If you don't mind my asking, it looks like this was completed in 2015 and the site says it's the first book in a planned series. Is that still the goal?
    ```

    - u/Farmerbob1:
      ```
      Yes.  I plan to write more, but I currently make a living as an OTR truck driver.

      In fact, I recently bought a truck, and am busting my tail to get it paid off.

      And, if working 70+ hours a week isn't enough, I am still pursuing a patent, which eats up most of my free time.

      Working 12-14 hours a day leaves me little downtime to do much more than sleep.

      Eventually, if the patent doesnt pay off first, I will try to have both a truck and house free and clear, and only drive 8-9 months of every year.

      The funny thing is that despite working more hours per week than just about any time of my life, and having little time to devote to writing, I am happy.  I enjoy driving and am good at it.

      The beauty of the great open rural spaces in the US is breathtaking.  I'm afraid driving is now something of an addiction.

          I eat reasonably well, but I have never been one to exercise much, since I left the Army.  Between stopping smoking a few years back, and discovering the joys of middle age, I am more than a bit overweight, but I can still move around easily.

          That said, yes, I need to lose weight before I develop unpleasant side effects.

  Here's some anime recommendations you fellow r/rational dwellers might enjoy!

  &#x200B;

  ***The Promised Neverland*** season one has just finished airing and I found it to be really intriguing and genuinely clever and engaging. I highly suggest to go in blind! I haven't read the manga, by the way, which I heard is also really good. (Rational)

  &#x200B;

  ***Shin Sekai Yori*** is a series I've already recommended in the past, but since it's one of my all time favorites and among the most rational in its world-building I think it's fitting to mention every now and then. Amazing atmosphere and a chilling and superbly constructed plot in a utopic/dystopic post-apocalyptic setting with psychokinetic powers. (Rational)

  &#x200B;

  ***Psycho Pass*** also counts as an amazing morally grey dystopic cyberpunk thriller. Absolutely recommended if you're into the genre. (Rational)

  &#x200B;

  ***Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor*** deserves some mention as the most thrilling high-stakes gambling anime out there. The pacing is agonizingly slow at times, but if you enjoy mind games and strategy you will most likely have a great time binge-watching this. (Rational-adjacent)

  &#x200B;

  ***Made in Abyss*** is a hauntingly beautiful show about the descent of two children into a mysterious and dangerous giant chasm, i.e. the titular abyss. The setting is really intriguing and some of the scenes are quite emotional and disturbing. Still waiting for a second season, so proceed at your own risk! (I wouldn't call it rational, but the world-building is fantastic)

  &#x200B;

  &#x200B;
  ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    Seconding *The Promised Neverland*. I binged it this weekend and was really impressed. Great premise, great execution, great tone, and smart characters. (Also seconding going in blind.)
    ```

  - u/Dent7777:
    ```
    In what world is Psycho Pass rational?

    For one, the guns are laughably irrational. They take a rediculous amount of time to lock target, and an equally rediculous amount of time to fire.
    ```

    - u/Golden_Magician:
      ```
      My understanding of rational fiction is that it doesn't have to be realistic necessarily, but rather consistent. There are also in-universe reasons for the guns to be a bit slow, which I won't go into here for fear of spoilers. (It has to do with the target scan they perform in real-time)

      &#x200B;

      If you look at the sidebar, I would argue that PP satisfies at least some ratfic criteria:



      * Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.  (although this one is a bit forced, since I'd argue the characters are generally competent and intelligent but don't display particularly creative solutions)
      * Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
      * Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

      Still, I suppose that a case could be made that PP is just rational-adjacent as opposed to rational. It's a matter of interpretation.

    Really good anime, and I second the recommendation.

    ... for the anime.

    Don't read the manga. It's smut (mixed with horror). The only interesting part to it was seeing the differences between the manga's story and the anime; it made me wonder how much else was cut/changed. 

    > ***Made in Abyss***  is a hauntingly beautiful show about the descent of two children into a  mysterious and dangerous giant chasm, i.e. the titular abyss. The  setting is really intriguing and some of the scenes are quite emotional  and disturbing. Still waiting for a second season, so proceed at your  own risk! (I wouldn't call it rational, but the world-building is  fantastic) 

    I'm a bit on the fence about it. I liked the worldbuilding and the animation style (the characters reminded me of the characters in Final Fantasy Tactics), but the story's mood could vacillate wildly. It starts out feeling like a shounen anime but has some straight-up seinen scenes involving torture and body horror. Really inconsistent tone. And it was really uncomfortable how the author for this seemed to revel in getting a \~10 year old girl naked, tortured, or both. I felt like I was watching someone's fetish brought to animation.
    ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    Didn't really like Made in Abyss, world building was quite poor, the rules they establish don't seem like they would at all result in what it is presented.

    I don't know how anyone in the rational community can think that the world building was fantastic. It was a classic this looks pretty or seems nice so we'll have it and pretend it has no repercussions on anything (it reminded me most of Harry Potter, let's have a school with kids and not think about what that means for the wizarding population). It's been a while since I watched it but I remember that I really struggled to finish the show. Also I don't think it changes how good the show is but it is basically abuse porn so if you don't like that you'll also not enjoy the show.

    Pyscho Pass is the only other one I've watched and that was good.
    ```

  - u/Palmolive3x90g:
    ```
    I am not sure how I felt about made in Made in Abyss. (minor spoilers) >!It had the same problem as a lot of shows that pretend to be one thing and then filp the tone for shock value. The mc's going down the hole is a really stupid decision but I extended my suspension of disbelief becuse that is the type of desion people make in cute adventure shows in order for the plot to happen. Only the anime it's self let didn't that fly and had the mc's punished for that decision. Now I think that the mc is a moron!< and feel like I wasted my time watching one thing only for it to be change into something I don't like. Also that last episode with >!the fucking elevator scene!< pissed me off and then the show ended giveing me no closure. On the other hand the bit I did like was good. I would recomend not watching the last episoded untill the next seson come out as the second till last was a better ending point.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      It's heavily implied that >!Riko has essentially no choice in choosing to go down the abyss-- everything from the abyss eventually returns to it, and it seems like there's some kind of compulsion driving people down. Also, Made in abyss telegraphed that it was going to be fucked up pretty early on. A little girl finds praying skeletons and get attacked by fuckhuge monsters on the very first level, and we're explicitly told it gets more dangerous as you go down.!<

      Also, as for watching made in abyss and expecting to ever be satisfied... Fluffy moments are plentiful, but ultimately transient instants between nonstop emotional fuckery.

  Some traditional book recommendations, for once!

  1. [Ash and Sand series, Richard Nell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35994830-kings-of-paradise?ac=1&from_search=true). Not rational, but a very good "gritty" fantasy. Although it's dark, the story is about overcoming this rather than revelling in how grim and depressing everything is so I'm not calling it grimdark. The first book is low magic, although with some clearly impossible things, while the second book ramps up the fantasy elements a lot. I've just been watching Sanderson's lectures on writing which are linked in the wiki here, and one element he mentioned as important is a sense of progression throughout the story. That's one thing I personally also find very satisfying, and this series does it extremely well. The characters are interesting, the world is not a carbon copy of medieval Europe and has a genuinely different culture which makes sense based on the physical situation, lots of elements really work. Highly recommend.

  2. [Commonweal series, Graydon Saunders](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21801573-the-march-north). This has been recommended here before, but I thought I'd bring it up again because it's so unique and seemingly under-appreciated. I'll mention first, it's rational. The March North (linked) is the first book, but you can also start with the second book [A Succession of Bad Days](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25635541-a-succession-of-bad-days) which IMO is the best of the series so far (they are very different books however.) The setting is a ground-up imagining of a world with "the Power," which is magic that can do almost anything. People's ability to do things with Power is inborn, determined by their "Talent" which, the characters in-story note, is on bimodal distribution; normal near 0 but the tails follow a power law. So every once in a while there is an extremely powerful sorceror that can do almost anything. But because of [Hobbesian trap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbesian_trap)-type logic the choice for a powerful sorceror is to either build up an army by enslaving other lesser sorcerors and the general population (most of whom can use magic to some extent, or at least are useful as sacrifices in rituals) or be enslaved or killed by those that do. Where the story starts, this has been going on for thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, while the story is set in a relatively new polity (the Commonweal) that is organised like a parliamentary democracy. The story, starting with the second book after the first makes the violence very clear, follows a group of new, very powerful sorcerors that are all completely untrained and thus will die if they don't learn to control their magic. The great (and rational) part about it is that they get extremely good tutoring from experienced mages and work hard, and...nothing particularly goes wrong. So why read about them rather than the violent establishment of this new government, or some other rocky period in the Commonweal's history? The story emphasises things like building, creating, cooperation, law, equality, choice, and so on. It takes these people with this immensely destructive power (like, annihilate everyone within square kilometres with a thought+) and they only use it on creating works of public good. It's so refreshing compared to pretty much everything else where fighting would be front and center. Plus, the magic is just *damn cool*. If it sounds at all interesting, have a look at some of the reviews on Goodreads and pick it up.

  3. [Version Control, Dexter Palmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733442-version-control?ac=1&from_search=true). This is more on the literary fiction side, but it's also sci-fi. Not rational, but it's sort of a deconstruction slash homage to magical-realism so I'd say that being rational isn't the point, and wouldn't improve the story. Overall, it's the best book I've read in years. It doesn't do anything amazingly out-there, but it's *incredibly* well-constructed. I struggle to say, "This was what was great about it," because the real magic is in how everything combines together. It kind of hits all the checkboxes, interesting concept, great characters, interesting ideas/extrapolations, good philosophical discussion/moments that actually make you think without being in-your-face or preachy, and importantly a solid plot with great pacing that makes the story easy to read, almost a page-turner. I would recommend paying attention as you read, as some things you might think are a mistake are actually not, and details matter. But you can also just read it for the story and enjoy it. Can't recommend it enough.

  I recently read [Your Story](http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/176254611660/sugaru-miakis-your-story-part-1), a japanese novel by Sugaru Miak that takes place in a world where people commonly purchase fake memories to make up for their various deficiencies in life. Fake familes, honeymoons, childhoods, lovers, you name it. 

  The story is about Chihiro, a man who abhors the practice of implanting fake memories, who unintentionally finds himself burdened and tormented by incredibly realistic fake memories of a childhood friend. To make matters worse, he then meets her in real life, even when all signs point to her being a fabrication.

  It's a story that'll leave you wondering what is real and what it is that even defines the word "real". Are artificial feelings and memories any less meaningful if they've been so perfectly manufactured that you can't tell the difference?

  Might be interesting for folks here: Recently someone on the /r/parahumans subreddit [asked about](https://old.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/b5rc2n/works_that_wildbow_has_recommended/) which works the author, wildbow, has recommended.

  [The man himself answered](https://old.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/b5rc2n/works_that_wildbow_has_recommended/ejg0lgu/), and recommends the following:

  * Onepunch-man

  * Made in Abyss 

  * Goblin Slayer

  * Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai 

  * Baby Steps 

  * Yakusoku no Neverland

  * BeastarsKusariya no Hitorigoto

  * Dungeon Meshi 

  * Dad, the Beard Gorilla and I 

  * Binding of Isaac

  * Into the Breach

  * Celeste

  * Warframe
  ```

  - u/DraggonZ:
    ```
    I second Kaguya-sama, Baby Steps, Yakusoku no Neverland and Celeste.
    Made in Abyss was a very big miss for me, but many people like it.
    ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    I really recommend Binding of Isaac Rebirth, and I will add Dead Cells and Risk of Rain 2 fill a similar niche of constant improvement and cool items, with the latter having some excellent multiplayer. Celeste is also great.

    Into the Breach was a bit too cerebral and repetitive for my tastes though, it's a bit like chess, too much like work for what I look for in a video game.
    ```

  - u/IV-TheEmperor:
    ```
    After the recent anime announcement, I've read the Beastars manga and would recommend it to anyone. Great characterizations and worldbuilding. I have no doubt it would be a serious contender for the AOTY title if the anime can manage two third of the manga's quality, 

    Only weakness I could think of is that there is one part where it really pushes the suspension of disbelief, but it's early on in the story and the chapters after have consistent quality.
    ```

- u/GlimmervoidG:
  ```
  Can anyone recommend any gamelit/litrpg stories like Worth the Candle? Key points would be long, well written and interesting.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The most similar in terms of genre/meta-awareness and fitting your points would be would be [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/) (NSFW!) which is a porn quest where the litrpg aspect is based on eroge rather than standard fantasy RPGs. I don't rate it as highly as WtC but it's better than every other litRPG I've read. If you can get over the NSFW nature of it (or if that isn't a problem in the first place) it's pretty good.

    Here's a list of other litRPGs I've read recently. None of these are rational at all unless specifically mentioned:

    Books:

    * [Character Development series, Aaron Jay](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36431054-beginner-s-luck). This one has a slightly different concept I guess, it's not really believable but whatever, it's essentially just background detail. The actual story was fairly competently written (at least better than what you typically find on Royal Road) but had some lengthy political rants which could be a turnoff. Otherwise it's just mindless entertainment like most LitRPGs.

    * [Completionist Chronicles series, Dakota Krout](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38739408-ritualist?ac=1&from_search=true). Utterly standard. Dropped it about a third of the way through the second book because there's no plot.

    * [Underworld series, Apollos Thorne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36483019-level-up-or-die?ac=1&from_search=true). [RoyalRoad preview](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8397/underworld-level-up-or-die). It's just a group of people summoned to a dungeon and they proceed to grind levels. Despite that, it's kind of engaging, particularly if you're the kind of person that likes incremental games, like me. Dropped it somewhere in the third book though.

    * [Level up series, Dan Sugralinov](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39908465-restart?ac=1&from_search=true). Barely got started, the start seems boring. Maybe it's better later, but I have other stuff to read.

    * [Polyglot: NPC Revolution, D. Richardson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43308857-polyglot?ac=1&from_search=true), [Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20247/polyglotnpcrevolution). Have read about 6 chapters, might continue when I run low on other things. Nothing earth-shattering so far.

    Royal Road (ones I have bookmarked):

    * [Everybody Loves Large Chests](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests). Very long, reasonably entertaining. Writing isn't great, but it's not the worst either. As mindless entertainment, you could do worse.

    * [Skyclad](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21361/skyclad). Was good enough that I read up to the latest chapter at one point, but I haven't gone back to it in a month or two. Take from that what you will.

    * [The Outer Sphere](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21178/the-outer-sphere). Same comment as Skyclad.

    Tried a lot more that I couldn't get into and can't be bothered digging up the names/links.

    Worm litRPG fics (in order of "recommendation"):

    1. [A Bad Name](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/#post-32256937). The best of the Worm/Gamer fics. I actually keep up with this one as it updates.

    2. [The Paragamer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-paragamer-worm-the-gamer-w-ocs.496126/). Not Brockton Bay based (yet), which is nice. Read A Bad Name over this in general, but if you're looking for more, this is OK too.

    3. [Siren Song](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/siren-song-worm-x-the-gamer-oc.633613/). Similar as previous.

    999\. [Brockton: In Venatus](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/brockton-in-venatus-worm-gamer-oc-taylor.451374/). I hardly even want to admit to reading this, but if you have a weakness for the occasional OP SI stomp fic then go for it.

    I've also read Wandering Inn to a point (2.5ish?), but gave it up after a while as it was no longer holding my interest.

    I wouldn't exactly *recommend* any of the ones I've listed, but if you're not picky, have a look.
    ```

    - u/jiffyjuff:
      ```
      I second Siren Song. It's technically well written and most importantly original. The protagonist is an OC outside of Brockton Bay, but it managed to still be captivating even for me, who can't usually get into original characters and settings in Wormfic. The powers and villains are original and fresh, instead of the typical level grinding and overwhelming firepower versus generic brute/blaster enemies many choose to go with.
      ```

    - u/VilhalmFeidhlim:
      ```
      Another Worm litRPG fic I'd recommend is [A daring synthesis](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-daring-synthesis-worm-the-gamer.607375/), which focuses on Greg Veder as a protagonist. I rate it up there with A Bad Name in quality, though it has a somewhat different focus - Greg is very much a flawed hero, portrayed here as something of an edgy 4channer. Much of the story focuses on the comedy that comes about with someone so socially disconnected being forced into social connection. That being said, it gets more serious as it goes on.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Thanks for the rec. Just read it all and it's very good, had me giggling a lot, though you're right that it gets more serious. Which is a good thing since the humour could have gotten tiresome after a while. It becomes an actual decent story/character growth arc.

        Agree with your rating, and in terms of pure entertainment value I probably enjoyed it even more than A Bad Name. Will be following this one.

    The only litrpg not on this subreddit that I found worthwhile was change:new world in royalroadl. Its an apocalyptic litrpg.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      I'm going to argue against change:new world. I read it years ago and it just didn't work for me. Let me see if I can dig up my review from back then... [ah, here we go](https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/63mxkf/monthly_recommendation_thread/dfwn1ir/):

      > [change: new world](http://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/chapter/14075): Avoid it. *Eventually* you might get drawn into it, and it does improve as time goes on, but the writing isn't very good, the power jumps and rules are seemingly  arbitrary, and the author seemingly has no concept of measuring time or distances (I don't care how big your school is, it shouldn't ever take ten minutes to run down a hallway). The world is interesting but basically a trope by now (the world turns into a game and most people die but the high schoolers survive!). I get the impression that the  author began this while in high school so there's some amount of wish fulfilment involved. Read about 100 chapters, and it wasn't worth it. 

      I remember there were some concepts which were creative (like flooding gas into a room to knock out enemies), but the entire thing struck me as a first attempt by a person who played a lot of videogames but hasn't written all that much before. Keep in mind my review was only of the first 100 chapters and that was two years ago; no idea if it's improved or been rewritten since then. But it wasn't even above mediocre from my recollection.
      ```

      - u/Ih8Otakus:
        ```
        I agree with some parts of your statement but not above mediocre? I read alot of stuff on royalroadl because there are only so many rational stories on this subreddit and let me tell you the stuff on royalroadl is all together below mediocre compared to the RT stories on this subreddit.

        But, apocalyptic litrpg is it’s own genre which is prevalent on royalroadl and I can say with no doubt it is the best apocalyptic litrpg on the website. 

        Compare change:new world with the statistically most popular apocalyptic litrpg on royalroadl, Randidly Ghosthound. Randidly ghosthound is trash incarnate. The side characters of randidly have no motivations of their own or substance while change:new world has a solid cast of side characters. Randidly tries and fails to make a new interesting society with the unrealistic game elements while change:new world has a society yet explored giving in to the more apocalyptic feel.

        As for wish fulfillment...they both suffer from the OP wish fulfillment MC but I like to think the OP MC wish fulfillment from change:new world is more “believable” due to the hard circumstances.

        But, I also concede the fact that it looks like the MC from change:new world [Is the only one with the identify skill which is beyond broken.](/spoiler)

        Also, can you guys believe that the author of randidly ghosthound makes $5-7k a month from patreon?

          I have no opinion on the work in question or the rest of the genre, since I've never read any of it, but I'm not sure we should be recommending stuff just because the bar set by the rest of the genre is so low. It sounds like that means maybe the genre as a whole is, at least for now, worth avoiding. We should expect quality no matter what genre or type of media we are consuming. Being the best of a sub-par bunch is still not great.

            While the genre does have its problems, there do exist several high-quality LitRPG stories. OP’s problem is using royalroadl as his measuring stick.

      (spoilers)

      Only 26 chapters in, and the story’s already jumping the shark. It’s not really a good and dedicated-enough LitRPG, it’s a story that uses LitRPG as an excuse to justify all the silly events and decisions that keep happening to satisfy tropes that the author / audience feel appealing (the Japanese variety of a protagonist with a harem, asocial protagonist somehow managing to become a leader and save everyone, "quirky" and jealous female characters, etc).

      Tampa’s criticism of "no concept of space" is especially accurate. The inconsistencies are absurdly ridiculous. In one scene, an entire pack of 60, 2-meter tall werewolves is described to be sleeping in one single school computer lab. Later on the character of lv22 manages to fight off against 16 of these werewolves that are lv23–37 in the same room and defeat / kill all of them without dying. In a later scene, a hallway "that was barely 5 arm’s width wide" hosted 50 or so boar-like creatures that were in size "akin to a small smart car", "towered a good 7 feet tall, while they were just as wide", and had tusks "about 2 feet long". 

      Moving on to decision-related non-rational criticisms about this story, the characters get penalised as being irrational and/or zombie-int for the following:

      * deciding to kill the whole pack of the werewolves in bulk, without even first testing the principles behind their plan on one single captured werewolf
      * not proactively hunting down and killing the player-killing character and his gang after learning about them, and after these PKers keep causing problems for them. The amount of OP power-ups and skills that said PK-character receives is also an example of Diabolus ex Machina.
      * after learning that killing "special elites" prevents further spawns of that entire mob class, not only not locating and protecting these special elites from being killed, but actively going out of his way to kill as many of them as possible. His reasoning? He couldn’t get stat points and level-ups fast enough, so he decided that hunting down the less than 10 special elites was the way to go about increasing his stats.
      * after learning that the food-type mobs have become a non-renewable resource, not controlling and limiting the distribution of food to either only high-level characters, or those characters who were at least willing to start levelling up and contribute to boss-killing efforts.
      * deciding to proceed along an unknown path after discovering the xenomorph-[expy’s](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy) boss’s skull carapace on that path. By this point they have just recently barely avoided getting a few of their party members killed by a group of "regular" xenomorphs. There’s also a possible plot hole here, since the matriarch was somehow dragged by a stronger monster *through* a closed and painted over entry.
      * 4 idiot balls taking effect at once for their group to end up stealing an egg from a boss monster that was using other boss monsters for food.

      TL;DR: There are a few interesting ideas in this story, but if you’re looking for a good LitRPG to read, there are many better alternatives to exhaust before having to compromise with this out of lack of further choice.

      edit: in the later chapters, there is some interesting (experimental, I would say) attempts of examination of problems like control, trust, loyalty, etc. There’s also some character development, even if it feels somewhat incongruent with the past profiles of those characters.

    I've mentioned this earlier, but the translated chapters of "The Amber Sword" radiates an overwhelming sense of played-straight CHIVALRY and HONOUR that leaves the reader feeling he's sweating behind a visor on horseback himself. The translator also helped edit the work to make it more fit the taste for western audiences, your mileage may vary.

    The MC's also really good at motivational speeches, which I recommend aspiring writers take inspiration from. Trigger warning: include Japanese/Chinese RPG elements, points-don't-matter stats and items, and unashamedly ripping off Magic the Gathering card game mechanics. 224 chapters translated out of 1200+, the original webnovel is finished.

    There's "Everybody Loves Large Chests" on royal road.

    It starts as a random smutty litrpg based solely on a pun, then the author goes, "woah wait I've accidentally created a really interesting world!"

  I mentioned this a few months ago, but I think this is a good time to reiterate: Go watch/read **Kaguya want's to be Confessed to**. 

  The basis gist of the story is of two highschool students trying to make the other confess. It's funny, heartwarming, and has strangely good worldbuilding/lore for a romcom. It is not rational, and the two MCs are more "Death Note" geniuses than *actual* geniuses, but it's still very good. 

  The anime has just finished and it's a good way to jump in (be aware that the anime doesn't adapt everything, so make sure to read any skipped chapters when moving onto the manga). 

  I highly recommend the work, and I know that several people on this subreddit have already picked it up.

    I prefer the manga more as it had some important details the anime skipped out on, but the show is pretty good.

    I agree that the consistency between episodes and all the callbacks are part of what makes it so good. Aka Akasaka is a genius of love and brains.

  Request: 

  I'm hard to please, and I don't know why. Some stories absolutely grab me and some stories bore me to death, despite being popular with the same people who love the stories I love. 

  So, I would love it if people could recommend me stuff I might like based on stuff I like and don't like. There's more stuff I don't like, but this is examples of stuff I don't like that I feel I *should* like given my cultural milieu or whatever.

  All in no particular order

  LOVE LIST:

  - The Martian (book + film)
  - Crystal Society (all three books)
  - Pretty much everything in the Friendship is Optimal universe
  - The Marteian (MLP/Martian crossover fic)
  - Animorphs: The Reckoning
  - Prime Intellect
  - Passages in the Void
  - Asimov short stories, but not Foundation 
  - The Hatchet series of books
  - The Hunger Games series of books
  - Death Note
  - Three Worlds Collide
  - Handmaid's Tale
  - Stargate (SG1, Atlantis, and Universe)

  SHOULD LOVE BUT DON'T LIST:

  - LOTR (books + films)
  - Rendezvous with Rama
  - Player of Games, Consider Phlebas (I really want to love the Culture so if people think there's Culture books I'd love that'd be awesome but I think these are meant to be the two best ones...)
  - The Pride of Chanur
  - Blindsight
  - Foucault's Pendulum
  - Superheroes in general
  - HPMOR
  - Foundation 
  - Star Wars
  - I tried reading Ra on qntm and it never grabbed me

  I think there's more stuff I could include, but this is what I happened to write down right now. Would appreciate it if people could help me figure out what makes the second list different from the first.

  The first list will also serve as a recommendation list, I suppose!

      I appreciate so many recommendations, but I'm not sure where to start, especially because none of them really grabbed me with their descriptions. 

      The only one that really grabbed me was Feed, and that was only a little, and probably only because it seemed to have a vaguely decent sci-fi premise (even though the premise seems to be... bloggers stopping vampires?). 

      The rest all seem very high fantasy or space opera-y, both of which I don't seem to like (another one on the "should love but don't" list: star wars!, but I do LOVE Stargate which is also pretty space opera-y too...). 

      I'm sure since you took the time to recommend them there must be a reason, so I'd love some more detail?

        I haven't read all of the books you listed as liking or disliking but it seems like you enjoy books that are thought provoking and lean rational with a decent pace. What you dislike seem to be books where the prose itself drags down the story or pacing or is full of itself. I am not surprised you didn't like Star Wars, which I've always thought kind of slow. I am surprised you like Stargate, though - what I've seen of it seemed to be pretty formulaic.

        I'm not the best at describing things so I figured I'd see which summaries and reviews grabbed your attention.

        Since you didn't specify genres, I just tried to give a broad range of sci-fi/fantasy series that fit the above and would have broad appeal. There are two on there I would call space opera or military sci fi (the first one and the Vorkosigan Saga, though they're rather different). The first I find amazing because the author managed to convincingly have a character be basically omniscient, but still have a story. The second is just a good fun romp in the early books and gradually add more and more thought provoking / hard sci-fi themes. If you're not a fan of space opera I would probably skip the Jon and Lobo one too, as that one has a lot of similar elements to space operas (Sentient outlaw space ships just do not fit in what I'd call Space Opera but looking at that Goodreads page, apparently others would.)

        Death Gate Cycle is high fantasy but I recommend it over something like LOTR because it doesn't take itself seriously in the least and the overarching story and background setting are interesting. Written the nineties, I believe, so some elements have become played out over the years if you read a lot of fantasy. 

        Garrett PI is a mystery/urban fantasy with a smart and witty MC. _On A Plane Horse_ is the first of a series half urban fantasy/half regular fantasy about what it would be like if major aspects of reality were embodied (think Greek gods) - death, war, time, fate, etc.

        Beyonders is one of the better YA/children's regular fantasy seriee, if you like that sort of thing. Very readable as an adult. The Corean Chronicles is in a similar vein, but  geared for adults. Probably the most "traditional" fantasy series on this list aside from Death Gate Cycle. It has a cool magic system, world building, characters, etc.

        Feed is a zombie apocoplypse book with at least one great twist. I usually dislike zombie & vampire books but I like Mira Grant's (aka Seanan McGuire's) take.

          > I am surprised you like Stargate, though - what I've seen of it seemed to be pretty formulaic.

          It is, and maybe I only love it because I started watching it at about age 14 or 15? The worldbuilding is fun, the show is fun, the characters are fun. 

          Thanks for expanding on your thoughts! That's very helpful. 

          >  The second is just a good fun romp in the early books and gradually add more and more thought provoking / hard sci-fi themes. 

          I think that might be the "problem" I have: I like books that lay it all on the table pretty quickly, and I really don't like the thought of "getting through" the first books because it really gets good in the third book, you know? Like I watched the original star wars movies, the first two, and didn't watch the third. I've had people say "you have to watch the third! it's the best one!" and I'm like if the first two did nothing for me I don't think the third is gonna suddenly be my favourite film, y'know?

          I read almost no fantasy, but I haven't really liked high fantasy - but I think I also haven't really given it a chance. I might see if I can get a sample for that on Kindle (doesn't look like I can...). I'll try Beyonders Book 1 since I can get a sample delivered! I'll also get a sample of Feed. 

          Thanks :)

  I am currently listening to the 'Threadbare' LitRPG series by Seiple.

  At first glance, it might seem to be a young adult series, but it is actually quite well-written from the evolving point of view of the protagonist.

  The protagonist is a teddy bear animated as a greater golem, allowing it true sapience, and the ability to gain levels, stats, and skills.

  It's a interesting take on an alternate intelligence, and, surprisingly, it all holds together pretty well - at least through the first book, and halfway into the second.  The protagonist mostly seems to demonstrate believable mistakes.  There are a few instances where certain characters can be seen holding an idiot ball, but the protagonist is actually enjoyably rational, to the extent that he can be, based on his evolving intelligence and abilities.

  Does anybody have any idea what happened to Jukepop Web Serials? The old site went down and was replaced, most of the stories on it weren't archived properly on the wayback machine, and there doesn't seem to be any hints or indications about what caused this.  I remember it being an extremely active site several years back, but it seemed to drop off the face of the earth at the end of 2016. My guess is a lawsuit, but idk.

  &#x200B;

  On a side note, does anyone remember reading Gentleman's Guide to Hunting Fantastic Beast by Serji Perjes? I've only been able to find three of the archived chapters, and would gladly take any similar recommendations.

  I would like to point folks at some books I recently listened to.  Dennis E. Taylor, his Bobiverse series.  Strongly rational, and even touching on some basic rationalistic concepts rather than simply making sense.

  I must admit to having a soft spot in my heart for fictional characters with the first name Bob.

  Bob is the result of corpsicle technology being abused in a dystopian future.  However, he plays along as a good little recorded brain in a box, until he decides to stop playing by the rules.  Then the fun begins.
