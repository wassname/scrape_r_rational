  That backward jump was a little confusing at first... thought for a moment there that we were about to get either a Groundhog Day style loop, or to find out that Nic had been in an Arcanum induced dream or demon-run simulation of events unfolding, only to be brought back to the beginning for another go-through.

  But no, just filling in some recent history. That's fine too.

  Glad Simole's not entirely dead after all, although walking through mysterious demonic doors seems a bit ill-advised.

    Heh, the jump backwards confused me too, but in a different way - I thought the author accidentally reposted an earlier chapter, and went back to check for sure.

      But thanks to that those who wanted Simole 
       not turned out to be alive can not complain, because her body is dead, and those who wanted Simole alive can be happy because her spirit is alive.  And Nic doesn't know anything about it, what is great, because of the inability to save a friend change him. 
      Of course, someone can complain about character development, 
      but this is a matter of preference, I like it, someone, not, simple.

  The Chapter at least solved some Problems i saw comming with the level of storytelling, now we know that part with the demon and the weird teacher etc. is finished in a way, and not him suddenly having the capabilities of stoping a demon/disrupting arcanum etc.... to save his friend , no matter in what way. So its more likely to go back to what the story was about before , his school life and well him being a book worm, not the op mc , newly awakend master of arcanum or some bullshit. Almost like dodging a bullet ^^
  I really hope this story goes back to his more mundane problems and lifestyle and also back to the writing style showcased in the first 14/15 chapters. Basically before it went nuts. I think the Story is very refreshing in a way ,and I hope that the author takes his time in developing the story and the world.
