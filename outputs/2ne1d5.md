  I found the opening sections on the geography and ecology of Antarctica interesting but I don't find the society plausible. It seemed more like the author was trying to justify having as dark of a society as possible than trying to consider what kind of society would actually result from the premise. In real life you see people do horrible things to people they consider outsiders, but they naturally care about one another. Even societies that practiced cannibalism in real life mainly did it ritualistically and only on those who were already dead. In the Tsalal society in this story it seems that antisocial behaviors, including killing members of one's own family, are considered admirable. I was able to suspend my disbelief during the initial sections of the story when the humans were struggling to survive without agriculture, but after that it was just laughable.

    Later scenes where there is a Western tourist/journalist exploring the continent appear specifically written to disturb and disgust (one example was about torture as an admired art form). This is where I had to stop reading.

  Alternatehistory.com has a lot of stories and writing that while not rationalist per se are often striving for accuracy in terms of real world people (in charge of countries) with motivations of their own reacting to something abnormal (Great Britain teleports to beside the USA), or a normal point of division (Archduke's driver goes down a different street)
