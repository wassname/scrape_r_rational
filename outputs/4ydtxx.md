  Nice.

  It's a rational-ish adaptation of the MCU, which goes through the stations of canon HP:MoR style: fast, out of order, and with extreme prejudice.

  Toni Stark is funny, witty, and true to canon. The universe is more or less consistent, and feels like the Marvel Movies, except with more details and a somewhat stronger continuity.

  One thing that bugs me is the portrayal of the western militaries and weapon manufacturing in general, as the fic seems to imply that basically every bullet that ever goes out of a factory *will* be put in an innocent cancerous orphan's head, or, failing that, in his adorable puppy. In real life, gun traffic is a really complicated issue with lots of ugly aspects, and collateral damage is only one of them. Stark Industries weapons probably kill more dissidents in banana republics than Afghan civilians.

  The thing that bothered me most, though, was how liberal everyone was about joining a super-secret terrorist group without requiring any proof of its good intentions or even having an idea of what the group does. It sort of fits Toni to do this on a whim, but I'd expect Pepper to say something about how people who send a super soldier to murder people they don't like on a regular basis, have no oversight of any kind, perform regulatory capture, shoot witnesses and won't let you see any of their leaders... aren't exactly guys you should join two weeks after you decided you hated violence.

    [spoiler](#s "Rumlow's comment at the end, that AWI likes to say 'Cut off one head, two more shall take its place' is such an obvious Hydra reference that I'm hoping we're going to find out, in the next story, that Tony & Co. did in fact fuck up and they're working for Hydra, especially since MCU!Hydra did say they were trying to protect the world through authoritarianism or something like that.")

      [Spoiler](#s " It is almost certain in my mind that AWI is actually Hydra. This is clearly the hook for the second story! That AWI seems weird is in fact supposed to jump out a bit at the reader, I believe.")

  Every time someone implants a nuclear reactor in their chest, I feel like this should be a prelude to an important and valuable lesson about neutrons.

    Honestly, even implanting an aneutronic fusion reactor in one's chest isn't a superb idea.

      At least the superheated plasma keeps the user warm.

  Ozymandias finished it today (with a sequel planned to launch next month). 

  Heavy doses of Effective Altruism.

  Story needs a proofreader, but it's not too bad.

      Yup! They also have a wordpress blog and a tumblr.

    Question about AO3, since you've used it: if you upload a chapter with hyperlinks in it, what do you get out?
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      Assuming that the html checks out, the chapter will have links in it, exactly where you'd expect them to be. I remember one story where every mention of a character turning on music or otherwise hearing some important noise was a hyperlink to an appropriate youtube video. 

      You can also embed images, change font colors (and make use of a couple of different types of font), and do some other minor formatting tricks. When you add tags, the ease with which anyone can respond to anyone else's comments on a chapter and others can follow the thread of each conversation, the myriad ways to search for stories, and the overall cleanness of the site, I cannot think of a single thing that FFnet does as well as Ao3, let alone better.

        > I cannot think of a single thing that FFnet does as well as Ao3, let alone better.

        I agree with you that A03 is objectively better about tags, HTML, appearance, and a bunch of other things.  Most importantly, it lets you reply to comments, which is an ENORMOUS problem I have with FFN.  There's two things that FFN does better, though:

        1. It has a larger audience.
        2. It gives better statistics.  

        AO3 will tell me how many views the story got.  FFN will tell me when they happened, what countries they came from, and a whole lot more.  There's something really thrilling to me about knowing that people from very far away are reading my work, so every time I see the Isle of Man, Serbia, Korea, etc, I get a tiny shot of "I need to keep doing this!"

    ```
    Because gender bending in a fan fiction adds extra layers of detail to work with and makes the story more interesting. What would a 'genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist' dude behave like as a woman? What parts of the character stay the same, and which ones get left by the wayside?

    This is, of course, assuming it was well written.
    ```

- u/somnolentSlumber:
  ```
  Pretty good. The way the author writes dialogue was consistently delightfully sarcastic and this Toni makes for a very good unreliable narrator.
  ```
