  New chapter - took me a while more to write this time, sorry. Also, thanks to /u/Caliburn0 for helping me as a beta reader! 

  As I'm writing the next chapters, I realised this arc might end up being slightly longer than I originally planned. Probably another 5 or 6 chapters. Still, while it won't match exactly any of the original Dragonball arcs and will have lower stakes, I hope it'll contribute enough to the overall world-building to feel necessary.

  So I'm guessing that their looking to hire ki users living in the city will be how Yamcha is brought into the story. That's been a plot point waiting to be picked back up ever since he decided to move to West City.

  About the two chakras in the head that didn't activate. It reminded me that I've always been kind of curious in canon DB of the distinction between ki abilities that it seems anyone can do if they're strong enough, and various magic abilities that didn't seem to corolate to strength or were unique to certain induviduals. Things like levitating objects, materializing things like clothes, telepathy, or transforming yourself. (And all the magic items too) Of course I never expected canon DB to get into it or explain these things, it's just not that type of story, but didn't stop me from thinking about it! It seems like you're going to have it all run on the same system instead of the original where it was left vague how ki and magic were related and differed, so I'm looking forward to this research/world building arc, and the rest of the story too!

  (Also I'm writing this comment on my phone at 4:30 in the morning, so sorry if any of it is unclear)

    I'm sort of going by the "related but different" road too, in the sense that they spring from the same source, but are in some ways complementary. More detail to come in a few chapters.

    And of course [spoilers](#s " you're right about Yamcha!")
    ```

- u/MaddoScientisto:
  ```
  Oh no I want more
  ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  In canon Goku copies the Kamehameha by seeing it once, while here he invents it on his own just by practicing ki control (with some help from Bulma). I wonder if he will figure out how to fly on his own as well, or if he will see someone else do it first. Probably the latter, since they're bring in a bunch of ki-users. Then again, maybe only a few doofuses like Yamcha will show up and not the more serious and talented people like the crane school students.
  ```

  - u/failed_novelty:
    ```
    To be fair, this doesn't read like a Kamehameha wave, just a basic ki blast.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Yes, pretty much, though the power is similar. The Kamehameha is a specific technique of the Turtle School, so right now only Muten knows it.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        I never really understood the difference between all the various named ki beams and blasts versus just "basic ki discharges". I mean some are special because they home or because they keep a distinct form like a disc, but Kamehameha is just a blast with a charge-up, no?
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          Pretty much, yeah. But it's got a pose and shit. Guess you could argue that the charge-up makes it more powerful? Consider that back then they didn't know much about generic ki blasts, so perhaps whoever first discovered the Kame-Hame-Ha found that it was easier to focus energy with the hand-cup gesture or something.
          ```

          - u/JulianWyvern:
            ```
            I think the term fandom uses for the kind of attack the Kamehameha is is Beam Wave. I'm guessing the difference between them all is pretty discreet, but maximum chargeup is probably a thing.

            Most obvious I guess, is that during Cell, the Kamehameha was never a threat to him, but Vegeta's ridicously long charge up for the Final Flash Attack would have very much destroyed him, despite him being weaker then Goku
            ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              What I've seen that's cool about Kamehameha that noone else seems to be able to do for a long time is its flexability. You can shoot it from your feet, you can curve it, you can use it on a time delay, you can supercharge it, etc. Whenvegeta manages to curve the final flash, its a huge deal; the special beam cannon is straight, dodonpa is straight, double sunday and galic gun seem to be straight, vegeta's blasts vs final form freezer, racooome's eraser gun, and freezer's point beams don't seem to be able to do that. I don't think it's ever shown for certain in canon, but I've always headcanoned that the reason it took Master Roshi so long to design (as opposed to how quick it is to learn) is that he's been optimizing it all this time for better and better performance.
              ```

          - u/Ulmaxes:
            ```
            I've pictured it as being something akin to how you make an atomic bomb- you don't just cause the reaction, you also compact it as long as you can to build up pressure. The KMH is similar- Goku projects the ki into a space, then keeps compacting it more and more densely, then finally pushes it all out in one controlled direction.
            ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    The Kamehameha is a **guided** attack.  The beam's path can be altered by the user.

    This is, at best, a really powerful *ki blast* that might serve as a sort of 'prototype' to it.  Maybe he will attempt to alter it and find out that he can bend the beam.
    ```

- u/Hust91:
  ```
  Yussss!

  Not read the new chapter yet, but I love the "doing science to understand the magic" stories so do keep going!

  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Shit, are we going to be seeing the Crane School students? Turtle school is a no go since Gohan is dead, Ox King out of practice, and Roshi is a hermit, but the crane school crew aren't averse to using their KI to turn a profit.

  Other potential sources are maybe Yamcha, if the Wolf Fang Fist is actually something, Taopaipai (Might not be with red ribbon, actually, since piccolo goons work with red ribbon here and TaoPaiPai remembers Piccolo), Kami / Korin / Popo (definite nos), and maybe Baba but probably no? I'm struggling to remember any other source of supernatural knowledge / abilities at this point, although minor talents we didn't see in canon are far from impossible.

  I scared my dog from laughing so hard. Loved this chapter and I eagerly await more.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    You know the scary thing? A few days *after* I wrote that line, I was contacted by a user of my software about how some results they got weren't quite right. I had to do a thorough review through hundreds of lines to pinpoint what, exactly, was wrong, confronting them with reference formulas from multiple books.

    It was a missing sign.

- u/RynnisOne:

  I like this story, but there are a couple of hang-ups I have with it on this update.

  1)  In the Dragonball world, *Magic* and **Ki** are two separate things.  This one seems to be combining them into one.  While it's your story and you're welcome to do so, it just seems... wrong.  You can have magic users who have no ki, ki users who have no magic, and some with both (Fat Buu comes to mind with his ki attacks but his magical ability to turn people into food).  I'm hoping this frequency is just where "weird things" interfere with normal physics.

  2)  You want to draw in more Ki users?  People with *real* martial arts power while also being able to study them?
   You host the **Capsule Corporation First Annual Martial Arts Exposition Tournament** and make sure to televise it.  Prize money, fame, and **science** all rolled into one.  All who wish to participate undergo some basic tests (which determine if they can use *Ki*) and if they pass them are able to enter so long as they sign paperwork (including NDA's for the research results) that permit them to be observed and studied during the event.  Make sure to note that this is the *first* Expo of its kind in the world and that it will be repeated next year, where the winner of this one will automatically be designated as one of the finalists in the next.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    About 1), I disagree, in the sense that it's never cleared up, but a lot of simple magic-like abilities can be learned (like fusion, or instant transmission), and still use up ki. Whether the two things are just a manifestation of the same underlying phenomenon is never made clear, and I don't think it's a big stretch for me, as long of course as I keep them separate enough to allow for the variety that we observe. Like electricity and magnetism, they just are two sides of the same coin.

    About 2), I won't say anything except... have patience :D.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      1) Never cleared up?  They are treated as completely different systems.  Fusion is magic when it comes from the earrings, Buu's food transformation is another form... and none of the Z-Fighters learn anything close as a martial arts (ki) technique.  If it *was* Ki-based, someone could use the process to turn people back, but it clearly doesn't work that way.  I mean, hey, it's a fanfic and all and you can do with it what you will, but it's just... weird.

      2) Awesome. :D  I mean, this might be one of the few instances in rational fiction where holding a massive martial arts tournament *actually makes perfect sense*.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Vegito is able to partially resist Buu's transformation. Gogeta (ok, not fully canon since it's the movie, but) shows a magic-like ability when he uses that rainbow sparkly attack to purify Janemba. Gotenks has the Ghost Kamikaze Attack, which he came up with, and that forms semi-sentient copies of himself - hardly just a brute-force ki attack. I can go on, Piccolo has his "clothes beam", Ginyu has the Body Change, Guldo can stop time... for me the clearest example though are the Namekians: it's said outright that they basically specialise in either of two things, fighting (like Nail) or magic (like Dende). Magic users are healers and can create the Dragon Balls. Warriors supposedly can't... except Kami created the Dragon Balls but also was a decent warrior. It's even more interesting because only *Kami* could; Piccolo can't. And we know it's probably not just a matter of 'purity', that was more about getting accepted as the next Kami, but creating Dragon Balls is a Namekian prerogative (again, this is said by the Old Kaioshin: that Namekians alone were afforded the privilege to create Dragon Balls as they were recognised as the wisest race in the universe). 

        So I don't think it's that outlandish. Someone either has magic, or ki; but the two aren't completely mutually exclusive, it's more like they're different specialisations. Like you're either a scientist or an artist, but it's unlikely you'll have the time and talent to reach an absolute peak in both, and win both a Nobel Prize for physics and one for literature. Plus there's a strong natural disposition factor - some races or individuals are clearly born with a higher disposition to magic. I'm not going to discuss this much further here, or I'll have to spoil future plot points; but hopefully at the end of this arc already my view on this should be a bit clearer.

  > It's so perfect though I don't think there's a real chance of him being caught off guard by hitting before he can put up his defensive barrier. 

  I found this line hilarious with what happens repeatedly in Dragon Ball Super. 

  Love this story, can’t wait for more!
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    If you're referring to that Frieza goon shooting SSJ Blue Goku in the back with a freakin' laser beam, that didn't happen, will not happen, and will in fact be erased from my memory starting from this moment.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Thank god, that was probably the dumbest thing I'd seen in dragonball in a long while.
