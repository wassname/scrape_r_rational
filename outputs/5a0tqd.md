## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are able to meditate to create ex nihilo any device you have ever taken apart and meditated upon.

  The time to create these devices is, in hours, the logarithm (base 2) of how many "parts" the device has. So if your device has 1024 parts when fully disassembled, it would take 10 hours. This means that creating one very complex device is much faster than creating its components individually.

  During a creation you may not do anything but meditate. That means no eating, sleeping, or using the bathroom. Your trance state prevents any urges you may have from forcing a response, but will not negate the physical effects (e.g. you may starve to death, but you will not suffer hunger pangs). You may still wake yourself manually if you wish, but your awareness of the world will be greatly reduced. Partial meditations have no effect.

  Disassembly is only necessary for parts you have not already disassembled and meditated upon, and can be assumed to stop at a "reasonable" point (e.g. you'd only have to separate the blades and handle of a pair of scissors, not decompose the parts into atoms). This familiarity does not affect the creation time, only the examination time.

  The examining meditation requires you to form a good mental picture of the object, so you would have to have seen it from all angles. This meditation always takes exactly one hour, not including the time to form the mental picture. You can do these meditations one part at a time.

  Lastly, there is a well-resourced intelligence agency out there that is aware of your existence but not your identity or location. They want to kidnap you so they can take advantage of your power themselves.

    The agency aside, this power is completely and utterly broken if there aren't any size restrictions.  Just obtain a relatively valuable material like a gold bar (one part).  Make a couple of copies, then melt them together to make a "large gold bar".  Make a copy of copies of those, make a "larger gold bar" etc.  You have exponential growth until size restrictions start making it harder to melt them down.

    You could also do something similar with more complicated objects that can't be melted together.  If an object has n parts, then if you just tie or weakly glue m of them together into a "n-object", just give it a stupid name and copy your new invention.  Then you can make a copy in log(mn) = log(m) + log(n) time.  Then disassemble the n-object into its useful components.  As m gets larger the ratio of objects to time goes to infinity.

    So basically you can mass produce anything with ridiculous efficiency as long as you do it in bulk.  Definitely enough to break the world economy.

    Hiring bodyguards should be relatively simple with your ridiculous newfound wealth.  The only question is when the government finds out, can you make a good deal with them to let you be rich and wealthy while producing whatever they want, or if they'll just force you to do it trapped in a lab somewhere.

      Originally I was working with a mass-based concept, but that biased things towards complex devices.

      Then I considered a time function that was harsher than logarithmic, which meant that you would effectively never be able to create any complex device at all (or creating something simple would be virtually instant).

      And using a hybrid was far too complicated for this sort of thread.

      With the current system, creating a CPU alone would take more than 30 hours (assuming 1.4 billion transistors). A full computer I'm guessing would take maybe 35.

      I could scale it up and say that it's 4 hours per log 2 of parts, which means you start running up against human limits of endurance. ~6 days to build a computer would mean you'd have to solve the food/water/excretion problems. 10 days (1*10^18 parts) and you would have to sleep, which would be the hard limit I think.
      ```

      - u/zarraha:
        ```
        I think log is fair in terms of complexity.  You've succesfully shielded it against complexity-munchkinry, but not against size munchkinry.  Again, making large but simple objects can be worth massive amounts of money simply as raw materials.  People will never actually make a computer, they'd just make a huge block of gold, or something inherently valuable like printer ink, sell it, then just buy a computer.

        Maybe a combination would be appropriate, like the time cost is m * log(p), where m is mass (up to some constant, like 30 minutes per kilogram or 1 hour per kilogram or 2 hours per kilogram)  and p is the number of parts.

        It's certainly more complicated than log(p).  But the exact times aren't important for the munchkinry thread, what's important is how it generally behaves: m * log(p) grows linearly with m, and diminishingly with p.

        Even then this will still incentivize creating blocks of pure valuable resources rather than anything genuinely complex.  It might be more interesting if people had this power in an environment where they didn't have access to a global economy, such as a medieval (possibly fantasy) world, a place with no humans where they have to survive against the environment, or just have all humankind as their enemy so they refuse to trade.  Or they fail if anyone finds out about the power so they have to be careful about selling too much of something they can't reasonably explain

    "Part" is not a concept which divides reality at the seams and is like magic that can't create food or gold, magic that only works on "objects", etc.  "Part, stopping at a reasonable point" is as bad, except that you've separated out the problem from the word "part" into the word "reasonable" instead.

    A big part of munchkining this will be trying to figure out exactly what counts as a reasonable disassembly into parts.  How easily you can munchkin it depends on where the power is on the lumper versus splitter scale.

    Also, can you create a thing with information content, such as a book or computer drive?  (And if you can't, does that mean that if you try to create an object with lots of fine but irrelevant detail, such as the microscopic bumps in a sheet of paper, you also can't?)
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      The point of "part" is to represent complexity in a sense. Because the time to create is logarithmic it isn't critical what constitutes a part; if you're off by a factor of 10, it's only a difference of around 3 hours and 19 minutes.

      Disassembly is more complex. It isn't strictly necessary for the power, provided you can get a visual of each part. If the interior of a part is meaningful, you'd need a visual of that too.

      You could create something with information content. If it noticeably affects the appearance of the part you'd need to visualise it as normal, but hard drive platters (for example) would all be reproduced as is.

  You are made of molten rock, you constantly generate enough heat to keep your form molten, but can theoretically be put out, which will kill you. You are also able to designate portions of you mass as human organs ('bones' will stay congealed despite being liquid, 'skin' will with keep the rest of your mass contained, 'eyes' are sensitive to light...) , with 'brains' only contributing to you multitasking. You can add other molten rock to your from. 


  However, you are dumped on a world in the middle ages which is  constancy drenched in rain, plaged by creatures powerful enough to shrug off your heat, and conveniently speaks english. How do you uplift the people of this world?

    Heh, I have more clarifying questions than ideas.

    -When you say the world is plagued by powerful creatures, do you mean that there is a human-equivalent race plagued by these creatures, or are the creatures themselves the "people" we're trying to uplift? If the former, how intelligent are the powerful creatures?

    -What is the local landscape/geology like?

    -Are you able to cool and/or detach parts of your mass?
    ```

    - u/Igigigif:
      ```
      No problem:

      * There are human equivalents you need to uplift
      * Let's say your immediate area contains a bit of forest to the north, an inhabited cave system/valley southeast and otherwise non-descriptive terrain. Overall the planet is reasonably earth-like, and probably has a molten mantle, but good maps are rare.
      * You can cool your external surface, but it starts out irritating, and become outright painful after a few hours. You can remove mass without issue, but can't control it without physical contact, and it loses any properties you've given it. If you somehow manage to perfectly cut yourself in half, a random portion retains your identity, otherwise the more massive part counts as you. You can choose to remain in the smaller part though.

  Munchkin: You exist in a world full of almost entirely mental superpowers. Precogs, mad genius inventors, memory-manipulators, mind-controllers, mad science researchers, detectives, and magnificent manipulative Bond villains abound. Your power simultaneously allows you to identify whether any individuals within your line of sight are super-powered, and passively prevents anyone from realizing you have this superpower. It does not tell you what their powers are, how to beat them, etc. Just that they have powers.

  Your power actively prevents anyone from realizing you have powers. If they by some fluke realize this fact anyways, their memories will later be retroactively altered at the earliest possible convenience. This aspect of your power doesn't give you a "secret-identity." That is to say, if you go out in disguise and claim that you have superpowers, your power will still activate, and everyone will think you're lying, despite any and all evidence supporting your claim. In addition, they'll still be able to make associations between any and all identities you cook up, just not any associations between any of your identities and superpowers. 

  Reverse-munchkin: (Set within the same universe)

  You have no superpowers. You're absolutely certain. Despite that, however, you keep having these weird night terrors in which Student, the world's most dreaded power-copier, tries to hunt you down for some reason. Student's collected a plethora of powers over the years. Due to your dreams, you tried looking up some of his powers online. While the vast majority of his powers are unknown(for obvious reasons), some of his more prominent, well-known and oft-used powers include:

  Ability to abstain from sleep indefinitely, with no negative effects.

  Perfect memory. Seamlessly integrates any and all information learned perfectly. Does not improve muscle memory.

  Hyper-awareness, optimized mental faculties and multitasking. Is constantly running on full-throttle, mentally. Can split his attention 10 different ways with no loss in competence. Uses these in concert to constantly be fully aware of his surroundings at all times as best he can.

  Rewind: He can designate a 1 hour period of time as a loop, choose a number less than 100, and then relive it that many times. Once he finishes reliving the time loop the designated number of times, he "exits" the loop, and time continues as normal until the next loop. He cannot use this ability again until that number of hours has passed. (ie. If he chose to relive the loop 48 times, then he would not be able to create another loop until 48 hours had passed.) A side effect of this ability is that Student effectively lives twice as much as everyone else due to these loops.

  That last power is especially worrisome. It's almost like he's trying to kill you in your sleep, and is using his time loop power to help him get a read on you. But that's crazy talk, right? After all, if that was the case, you wouldn't remember what happened in those loops, let alone have dreams about it. After all, you don't have powers. But what if he really *is* trying to kill you?

  Oh, well. You should probably come up with some preparations, protocols, and plans to protect yourself against him, if only for peace of mind and sweet dreams. Knocking on wood can't hurt to try, after all.
  ```

  - u/zarraha:
    ```
    For the first one, can you convince people that you are able to determine if people have powers if you give an explanation other than the real one?  Like, if you go around claiming to have invented a device that detects powers, will they believe it because it's not a superpower?  Or will your power alter that too?  Similarly, if you try to become a detective or something that investigates superpower crimes, could you gain a reputation as "that guy that has hunches about people that somehow always end up being right."  And go up the ranks that way?  Or would the power make people not notice the trend of how good your guesses are?

    For the second one, am I right in understanding that because you're experiencing these over several nights, that means he's looping to practice killing you, but then when the loop ends he doesn't follow through with it and just waits for the next night to loop again?  What happens if he loops during the day?  Do you seem to black out and interpret it as a dream?  The distinction is important because it determines whether or not you know if you're in a loop.  If so, then my suggestion would be to make secret preparations outside of loops, acquiring a gun, finding safe escape routes and hiding places, etc.  But during loops don't reveal any of it, don't reveal that you know he's looping, and behave predictably and weakly during every loop that has the same start point.  If he thinks he can kill you incredibly easily then he won't prepare as much and then when he tries to do it for real you can surprise him by having a gun or bomb or something that he didn't know about because you never used it during the loops.

      > Like, if you go around claiming to have invented a device that detects powers, will they believe it because it's not a superpower?

      Being a mad genius inventor with clarktech would constitue a superpower, so that won't fly. You could, however, pass it off as a gizmo that your superpowered friend made.

      > Or would the power make people not notice the trend of how good your guesses are?

      Oh, they'll notice the trends, alright, it's just that they'll rationalize it any way they can. Do you wear glasses? "Probably a gizmo his mad genius friend made that feeds him the info." Can you come up with a plausible explanation for how you solved the case? "Probably just a superhero wannabe that did his homework." If you can't? "Must've been a lucky guess."

      As for the second one, I left it deliberately vague and open to interpretation, especially with an unreliable narrator. You can interpret it as a reverse of previous power in the sense that it actively prevents you from realizing you have a power. You can interpret it as the dreams being prophetic, in which case Student never actually succeeds in killing you in his time loops due to your advance warning, and therefore backs off the final go around of the loop. Or, you can interpret it as your power allowing you to remember the time loops, in which case the dreams are just memories of getting woken up in another timeline. If this is the case, then Student attacking you in broad daylight like an idiot would cause you to suddenly get hit with deja vu and false memories of the other timelines. Open for interpretation.
