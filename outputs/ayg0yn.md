## Looks like the Mentally Advanced Series was added to the rational TvTropes page

Didn't see that coming. After some thought I do agree with the addition as a major rationalist work, though if anyone here wants to start the series I'd advise beginning with either episode seven or episode negative seven and continuing from there.

  Too bad NAS got only 2 episodes. It was starting to grow on me.
