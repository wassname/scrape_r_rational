## [RT][MK] Erfworld Part I: The Battle for Gobwin Knob: "One world's game rules can be another world's physics. One world's 'cuddly' can be another world's 'deadly'. And one world's misfit, misshapen loser can be another world's perfect warlord. At least... he'd better be. The enemy's on their way."

    As a point of pedantry:

    "Will not be completed" is overstating what the author has said.  It's been "permanently discontinued as a webcomic," which does leave open the possibility of it being revived and completed as a print comic, or as something else.

    From the page you linked:

    > * Future updates (should they occur) will be accessible only by Date-a-mancy [to our extended family of supporters and friends]
    > * Future books (should they be made) will be published and sold by traditional channels

    That said, "will not be completed" does seem to be the most likely outcome.

    I'm actually kinda annoyed the forums are gone. That was where I first found my taste for webfiction, where I got linked to the Wandering Inn off of someone's fanfic, and ultimately why I started writing my own work.  Erfworld and its community were hugely influential to my creative life.  

    I understand that the decision to pull the forum from public use is their call, certainly, but I do still wish they hadn't.  Even if only just to make all the amusing fanfic stories public.

  _Erfworld_ is the story of Parson Gotti, a typical loser protagonist with a dead-end job and a dump of a home who is obsessed with tabletop wargames. One day he gets isekai'd to Erfworld by Wanda Firebaugh, a spellcaster in the city of Gobwin Knob, as a last resort attempt to stave off defeat at the hands of the Royal Crown Coalition. Luckily for Parson, it turns out that the physics of Erfworld run like a tabletop wargame, so his expertise is exactly what is needed. _Unluckily_ for Parson, he has never played this particular system before, and the coalition's armies outnumber Gobwin Knob's 25 to 1. Now he must quickly learn the rules and find as many exploits as he can if he is to have any chance of fulfilling his role as the perfect warlord.

  _Erfworld_ was been brough up on LessWrong twice. Eliezer Yudkowsky read it after hearing it compared to _HPMoR_ and declared that, while not exactly rationalist ficiton, _Erfworld_ was Munchkin fiction, which is close enough that I think deserves to be posted. Unfortunately, as discussed in those links, _Erfworld_ jumps the shark _hard_ after the first volume. Hence why the title only refers to part 1; that's the only part I'm recommending. In fact, I'd avise against even reading the epilogue to book 1; [the comic's original run](http://web.archive.org/web/20190720093819/http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf.html) on _Giant in the Playground_ ended with >!Parson throwing the sword into the volcano after declaring his intent to be a player!<, and I think that's the perfect place to finish things. Just let it end on a high note.

    Why do you say it jumps the shark?

    - u/kraryal:
      ```
      I'd say it jumped the shark just because of how many expectations it violated. The medium was different, the pacing became much different, the themes changed, the protagonist lost a tremendous amount of agency.   


      It just felt like a completely different experience than before.

      Book one is a single scenario with a narrow scope and pretty clearly defined stakes and characters. There's a big moment at the end that feels earned and properly led up to.

      Books two and up have a lot of play and counter-play, but it's never clear that any of it means anything or is actually working towards anything. There are so many moving parts that there aren't 'big moments' anymore so much as just the resolution to whatever the current crisis is.

      And boy there are a lot of different crises going on, all at the same time.
      ```

    - u/erwgv3g34:
      ```
      * As early as book 2, the "comic" becomes a text novel with occasional comic pages.
      * The art for book 3 is awful.
      * The story keeps introducing ever more characters I don't give a shit about.
      * The plot slows down to a crawl; Parson takes 80 pages to get through one goddamn door.
      * The metafictional angle gets dropped.

      Need I go on?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        There are lots of small and medium sized problems as the story moves on.  But there were two parts that seemed like big problems to me.  One problem with is that Parson becomes increasingly aware of the atrocity of war, but his motivation is not explored after that.  >!He embarks on a campaign that destroys entire kingdoms, and brings them back mind-controlled.  !<And his motivations and doubts are never really explored.  >!He destroys the sword, and then acts exactly as he would if the sword were still around.!<  We don't really see the main antagonist's motivations either, and we really need to even if Parson doesn't.

        &#x200B;

        The other is that entire arcs seem superfluous.  The Olive Branch story, the Transylvito Arc, and the latest stories just don't seem necessary.  I really enjoyed the one with the Hippiemancer talking about language, but as an editor I would cut the lot and tell him to publish supplemental materials later.

        I didn't notice anything particularly bad but I guess it's just a matter of taste, none of these things were that big a deal to me because of what I was looking for in it but I see how those things could be a big issue with it to someone else.

        The world-building and concept were great.  This is an isekai game world with an actual hex map, turn enforcement, production mechanics, and so on.  It had enormous promise to start with.

        Fate shenanigans and mechanics that were kept obscure from the readers resulted in a series of deus ex machina plot developments.  The story became increasingly frustrating to read, especially as additional characters and settings were introduced without original plotlines being resolved.

        There were some occasional moments of heroism and brilliance.  This webcomic had a lot of potential.

        Tone down the negative criticism. There are better ways to say the things that you're saying.

        - u/Ozryela:
          ```
          What's wrong with criticism of a story's flaws? I think we just had a meta thread about this, a balanced discussion of a story should mention the good and the bad. If you only ever post positive things about stories, then even the worst stories will look good, and the recommendations become meaningless.
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:

            There's nothing wrong with criticism of a story's flaws, the problem here is in the delivery. "The art is awful" is low value criticism delivered without much apparent thought or insight. It *barely* informs the reader whether or not they'll think likewise, and it certainly wouldn't be constructive to the person who did the drawing. Similarly, the tone isn't what I want from negative criticism. [See this comment for contrast](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dwd5lp/rtmk_erfworld_part_i_the_battle_for_gobwin_knob/f7il51k/), which gets many of the same points across in a much better way. Some of *my* takeaway from that meta thread:

            > Maybe this post could be described as, "criticism tends to skew negative so try to adopt a moderate positivity bias to counteract that when writing critique"? Good negative criticism is important, especially to newer authors but framing the delivery can make a huge difference.
            ```

              > There's nothing wrong with criticism of a story's flaws, the problem here is in the delivery. "The art is awful" is low value criticism delivered without much apparent thought or insight.

              Would you also ask someone to tone it down if they said "The art is great". Because that is exactly as valuable and contains exactly as much apparent thought or insight.

              I'd argue that while remarks like these (positive or negative) would be even more valuable if they went into greater depth, they are still valuable as-is. They still help me form an opinion about a story.

              There's strength is numbers too. If everybody had to write at least 10 pages of detailed analysis before being allowed to post an opinion, the numbers of opinions we'd see would be extremely limited.

              In other words: While the value of such criticisms may be low, it is still positive. While it is good to encourage more detailed criticisms, simply asking people to stop altogether doesn't increase utility, it decreases it.

              > and it certainly wouldn't be constructive to the person who did the drawing

              > Good negative criticism is important, especially to newer authors but framing the delivery can make a huge difference.

              I think you're barking up the wrong tree here. Story recommendations, or dis-recommendations, aren't aimed at the author. They are aimed at potential readers. The author already knows their own story, and if they are looking for writing advice they are in the wrong place, there are other threads for that.

                > Would you also ask someone to tone it down if they said "The art is great". 

                Writing detailed reasons why you like something is so much harder than writing detailed reasons why you dislike something that it's worth saying what you like even if you don't have anything insightful to add about it, just to balance out the inherent negativity of an insightful-only comment policy.

                I didn't ask anyone to stop. I said:

                > There are better ways to say the things that you're saying.

                Replying to your other point:

                > I think you're barking up the wrong tree here. Story recommendations, or dis-recommendations, aren't aimed at the author. They are aimed at potential readers. The author already knows their own story, and if they are looking for writing advice they are in the wrong place, there are other threads for that.

                It won't be the case for this particular story, but authors definitely do read whatever is posted here about their stories, sometimes because it's mentioned in a comment, sometimes because they track back a spike in traffic, and sometimes because they posted the story themselves. I think a general principle should be that you should speak about *anyone's* work as though they were a real person on the other end of a keyboard somewhere in the world. You don't need to not say negative things, but if you're going to say negative things, then you should try to be kind about it.

                So yes, I hold negative criticism to a slightly higher standard. I probably wouldn't have mentioned anything here given the above comment, but it strikes me as the unpleasant, needless negativity that I would rather not have in the community, especially when set beside similar comments that don't have the same stink.

                    I think "deserve" is the wrong framework. 

                    Authors are going to read discussions of their works, and be hurt by some of them; that's just a fact about the world. You have to consider the predictable consequences of your actions, even when those consequences are also caused by other people's (predictable) mistakes.

                    In other words,

                    > "Of course it's my fault. There's no one else here who could be responsible for anything."

                True. Kind. Necessary. Try to hit at least two of those.
                ```

- u/ansible:
  ```
  As OP mentions, there were a lot of changes in direction, tone and focus after Book I.  While I still enjoyed Book II, my interest in Erfworld overall faded with time.

  I kind of understand why this all happened.  I think the intent was always that the main story-line of Parson Gotti was intended to be a comic.  With the loss of the original (super talented!) artist and trouble recruiting another, it became hard to continue.  So the author instead turned to some of the other characters, filling in their backstory (hinted at in the  original storyline) to try to keep the content production going, and giving the fans a reason to stay interested (and keep subscriptions going).
