## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  tl;dr: Anathem is a great novel which you'll love if you're a patient reader who appreciates intelligent characters(who take no shortcuts of thought) and deep af worldbuilding, and doesn't mind (very) slow burn plots front-loaded with a lot of exposition. 

  The one sentence blurb of Anathem would be: a modern society turns on their smartest and most curious people(think genius level) and sequesters them all into isolated monasteries/fortresses in which they're not allowed any possessions, to procreate, or to do any science but the most abstract. Thousands of years later the book starts.


  ------------------------------


  I'm going to re-iterate a recommendation for [Anathem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2845024-anathem) by Neal Stephenson, which I consider like a black swan in science fiction, in the sense that there is nothing out there quite like it. It's a hard SF story which is closer in feel and style to a high-fantasy, hard magic story, with an immense emphasis on ambiance and worldbuilding. Besides the setting, another focus of the story is on intelligent characters trying to solve problems and understand their world and each other through their knowledge and intellect.  

  The early parts of the book are somewhat reminiscent of the parts in HPMOR where Harry is figuring out magic, only without the magic. 



  Here's the official summary:

  >Fraa Erasmas is a young avout living in the Concent of Saunt Edhar, a sanctuary for mathematicians, scientists, and philosophers, protected from the corrupting influences of the outside "saecular" world by ancient stone, honored traditions, and complex rituals. Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls. Three times during history's darkest epochs violence born of superstition and ignorance has invaded and devastated the cloistered mathic community. Yet the avout have always managed to adapt in the wake of catastrophe, becoming out of necessity even more austere and less dependent on technology and material things. And Erasmas has no fear of the outside—the Extramuros—for the last of the terrible times was long, long ago.

  >Now, in celebration of the week-long, once-in-a-decade rite of Apert, the fraas and suurs prepare to venture beyond the concent's gates—at the same time opening them wide to welcome the curious "extras" in. During his first Apert as a fraa, Erasmas eagerly anticipates reconnecting with the landmarks and family he hasn't seen since he was "collected." But before the week is out, both the existence he abandoned and the one he embraced will stand poised on the brink of cataclysmic change.

  >Powerful unforeseen forces jeopardize the peaceful stability of mathic life and the established ennui of the Extramuros—a threat that only an unsteady alliance of saecular and avout can oppose—as, one by one, Erasmas and his colleagues, teachers, and friends are summoned forth from the safety of the concent in hopes of warding off global disaster. Suddenly burdened with a staggering responsibility, Erasmas finds himself a major player in a drama that will determine the future of his world—as he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey that will carry him to the most dangerous, inhospitable corners of the planet . . . and beyond.

  Like before, I'll warn people that **Anathem is hard work initially,** and **not for everyone**. It starts glacially slow and for the first couple hundred pages(the book is humongous, almost 1k pages) it's almost entirely exposition, where you're slowly getting familiarized to the protagonist, the world, and most importantly, the vocabulary. 

  Yes, Stephenson introduces dozens of words, but it's not a made-up language like tolkien or a pidgin like Cloud Atlas(which I disliked), it's almost entirely portmanteaus and cognates of existing words, mostly english and a bit of latin(as an example: Anathem= anthem + anathema), and this is the major sticking point for most readers. From experience I would say if you find the made-up vocabulary annoying and distracting at first(i certainly did) you need give it 70-100 pages for it to feel more natural, and a bit more to get fully engaged with the plot. 

  The entire reason I'm writing this long-ass comment is because I think this book is really worth it, especially in the context of r/rational's tastes, but if you don't trust the author (or the recommendation ;D) it can be hard to get over the hump to the good parts of the novel. But if you do you'll be searching for a novel like this for the rest of your life(search anathem on reddit and you'll see).

    Great book, I second this recommendation. The audible version is quite good as well, if audiobooks are more your thing.

      I re-read it recently because it's one of my favourites and was shocked once again at how good it is. I wish I hadn't waited so long, as in my experience it was even better this time. 

      Anathem actually reminds me a bit of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, in the sense that they're both spectacular stories which have a rough start that scares a lot of people away, and which are immensely rewarding if you get past that. Malazan is several times worse than Anathem, though, as the hump can be the entire first book rather than just a few hundred pages.
      ```

      - u/Dent7777:
        ```
        I really loved the beginning of Anathem. I thought all the information about the world of the Maths, the details of Mathic society, was the most interesting part of the book.

        But the other part, I feel very deep empathy with.

        I am listening to the audio of Gardens of the Moon more than a year after finishing the series in print. The book is sooooo hard to get through.
        ```

        - u/GlueBoy:
          ```
          Isn't it though! It's actually pretty impressive that the series has managed to garner the popularity that it has with such an obtuse start off point. 

          I remember it took me weeks to read the first book, and the second book wasn't much better. I think I only kept going back because of sunk cost falacy; I was young and poor and I had bought the first three books all at once. 

          I'm glad I did because Memories of Ice is still one of my favourite books all time. That ending...

        I’ve come to think of it as the (currently) most adaptive memetic evolution of the Naruto’s exam arc combined with [Groundhog Day Loop](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogDayLoop) / [Groundhog Peggy Sue](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue) trope / motif: Naruto → Chunin Exam Day → Time Braid → Mother of Learning.

        1. [Naruto](https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Ch%C5%ABnin_Exams_\(Arc\)#Chapters) (2000–2002) — it was a popular plot arc, but ultimately not the focus of the overall story, so the story moved on. And the amount of artificially stretched out pacing (e.g. how much Orochimaru / Sarutobi confrontation was milked) harmed its objective quality as well.
        2. [Chunin Exam Day](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day) (2007–2010) — many fresh interesting ideas, but the almost-deliberately crackfic nature of the story, its [Author Appeal](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal) contents, and lack of self-censure harmed its popularity.
        3. [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) (2009–2011) — the story arcs and plot still have some unpolished edges to them; and again the author doesn’t try to self-censure for the sake of increasing the story’s marketability. It straight out was purged from TVTropes, partially [because of fear of  losing advertisers.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent#Five_filters_of_editorial_bias)
        4. [Mother of Learning](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/best-rated) ([2011](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning)–2019) — the story’s not only made into a stand-alone work by now, it’s been designed to appeal to a much wider common denominator and manages this without sacrificing in quality.

    You should probably widen your search to include LitRPGs in general, not only The Gamer fanfics. 

    For Gamer-specific ones, maybe try [the relevant TVTropes page.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/TheGamer)

    These also have mechanics that more or less feel like that of The Gamer:

    * [*Gamer of Sunagakure, The*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11141738/1/The-Gamer-of-Sunagakure) — abaondoned
    * [*Ramen Days, Naruto:*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7820743/1/Naruto-Ramen-Days) — abandoned, the setting mechanics literally forces characters to behave like NPCs under certain conditions.
    * [*Son of Gato*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12794658/1/Son-of-Gato) — crackfic; charisma-heavy build; pop-culture "psychopath" protag; some Hollywood- / anime-zombie characters.
    * [*Root of darkness, The*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12314675/1/The-Root-of-Darkness) — the plot gets all over the place, abandoned.
    * ~~Shinobi, the RPG~~ [*SHINOBI, THE RPG*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12433631/1/SHINOBI-The-RPG-Act-1) — complete; the plot is all over the place; some elements from Fallout; some idiot balls and other plot devices to handicap and hinder the protag.

    None is top quality, but I’ve trimmed away the really low-quality and boring titles.

    There are also [*Game Theory*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7485060/1/Game-Theory) (Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, compelete) and [Percy Jackson and the Game](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697391/1/Percy-Jackson-and-the-Game) — maybe someone who has read them will give a review on those.

He only starts leveling up after the timeskip even though it was introduced to the MC as a 2 year old. I called the author out on this glaring plot hole and he even responded "yeah my bad just ignore it"

    I wouldn't exactly call it "good" because the pacing is truly horrendous, and the way the videogame aspects of it are formatted make it very obvious this was an author treading new ground without a good idea of what works well in litRPG fiction, but it's definitely good for a laugh, and a "historical" look at what very early litRPG fanfic was like.

    [Multiplayer](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11992573/1/Multiplayer) is another good RWBY/Gamer story where there are multiple competing Gamers and every time someone dies, the game is 'reset' with no clue of how to reach the final ending to stop the eternal looping.

      I *really* wanted to enjoy Forged Destiny but I gave up on the story because I just couldn't stand Jaune's character anymore.

       words in, he continued the make the same stupid and childish mistakes he was making at the start of the story. He never grew as a character and reading about him was just a slog. The breaking point was when he killed an enemy solider for executing another soldier. His idealism and naivety was just frustrating after awhile.

      It looks like tvtropes agrees with me at least:

      I disrecommend Sapiens and especially disrecommend Klein. 

      Klein is a personality, not a real academic. She doesn't understand economics at all.

      Harari rarely presents evidence for his assertions and his book is more like a bedtime story than an academic text.

        Good tips, thanks. I've had that feeling about Klein from the snippets I've read, but I didn't know Harari was pseudoscience as well. It's a pity since I really like the concept of Sapiens. I have Diamond's The Third Chimpanzee on my shelf, might use that as a substitute.

        - u/hyphenomicon:
          ```
          It's not that Harari is pseudoscience, it's just that you don't really learn anything reading him, or at least I didn't. He mixes arbitrary opinion with reasonable perspective with solid fact and doesn't delineate any of these from each other or explain the evidence for any of it. Many of the claims are true, but I only know that from reading other sources that are actually educational.

          If someone told you the universe is made of atoms but didn't explain how we know that or what competing models have been discredited, and lapsed into poetic rhetoric when describing the consequences of atomism for our worldview, that person wouldn't be promoting pseudoscience per se but they wouldn't author any good physics books either.

        Yeah, agree. Harari doesn't feel very scientific. I enjoyed Sapiens if only for a few interesting ideas (I liked his concept of 'narratives' and his depiction of culture/society as a dialectic engine constantly driven by its own contradictions), but it seems like he's more interested with fitting the facts to his very elegant theories than the other way around. Certainly I think the title of Sapiens is *way* too ambitious and that truly believing it constitutes in any way an even marginally comprehensive account of human history would be a surefire way to being way over one's head in a thousand historical discussions.

    Interesting list, any favorites in particular?

    You might enjoy:

    "Predictably Irrational" by Dan Ariely, it's an analysis of perfectly rational economic model failures, the reasons behind them, and how economically irrational behavior can be predicted.

    "Guyland" by Michael Kimmel: it's a social, historical, and psychological look at the rise of "bro culture", "hookup culture", "group rape culture" and some of the current culture of modern 20 something's in the USA. It might be a kind of infohazard if you're in those groups though. I read it right before college, where I joined a fraternity, and it really helped me understand where a lot of the culture is coming from. Notably it informed me that intense hazing and a lot of awful behaviors are relatively new phenomenon which makes a big difference. 

    "Babies by Design" by Ronald M. Green is an ethical look at human genetic engineering. It's not much policy or execution but mostly what we should do and how to think about the issue logically.

    In order of engagement: Babies by design, Guyland, then predictably irrational. I had to take notes throughout Predictably Irrational to make it more engaging for me, this improved Guyland also.

    I'd say the top 5 (excluding Mother of Learning) would be: 

    * Worth the Candle
    * Practical Guide to Evil
    * Origin of Species 
    * Worm
    * Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality
    ```

  I'm new to r/rational and I just wanna know some must-reads that I should go through before diving through other titles. 

  There are a few of which I'm already aware of.

  For starters, I've attempted reading Worm (learned about it from r/noveltranslations) twice now, both tries ending around arc 12 iirc. Not sure why, I think I just got bored.  >!I think that's post-endbringer, i remember Skidmark and the mall fight. its a big change, so maybe thats why? Idk not sure tho!<

  I know about Mother of Learning from that subreddit as well, and I've just decided with the release of the most recent chapter that I'd like to wait until its completion to binge it all.

  Also just found out about HPMoR which I plan to listen through the podcast on spotify.

  I'd just like to know of any others

  Thanks!

    You might try listening to it through the Worm Audiobook podcast. I think the voices and conversions are generally well done, but the forum sections don't work for me. 

    You also might enjoy going chapter by chapter listening/reading then listening to the "We've Got Worm" podcast, where one host is reading it for the first time while the other rereads and helps explain it. They do a good job of avoiding spoilers and try not to over predict the story. I found the two very entertaining, and just listened to them alone as a refresher for when the sequel came out.

    Obviously I'm a Worm shill, but it's not to some people's taste especially now that "dark realistic superpowers" is a less novel idea. If you don't enjoy it don't try to force your way through, it's far too long for that.

    "The Cambist and Lord Iron" is a good shorter read.

    Everything by AlexanderWales is highly recommended, the Dark Wizard of Donkirk is a hidden gem, and I'd recommend Shadows of the Limelight last. You need to enjoy the analysis of story concepts and such to enjoy it past a certain point, which the next story does a better job easing into it in my opinion.

    Worth the Candle by cthulhuraejepsen is a great story with litrpg elements. The beginning didn't hook me, but now I can't resist staying up to date on it. 

    The Waves Arisen by Wertifloke, and certainly not Eliezer Yudkowsky, is an excellent Naruto deconstruction. Crazy Naruto world powers treated and used rationally.
    ```

    - u/XavierMiles:
      ```
      Seeing as i turned to the text version of HPMoR 2 chapters in, I think I'm going to avoid audiobooks for now. But that podcast sounds really interesting. I'll definitely check it out
      ```

  - u/rationalidurr:
    ```
    That is completely ok. then entire /r/rational group cant agree if Worm is rational or not. 

    Some people like me are on side of good and say it's not and others are the enemy and must be destroyed without prejudice! Curse them! CUUURSEEEE THEEEEMMM.

    Anyway I recommend Saga of Soul. Praise it! PRAAAAIIISSSSSE IIIIT!
    ```

    - u/XavierMiles:
      ```
      I plan on giving it a third try, but this time going a bit slower so I dont burn myself out
      ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Was it ever continued/completed then?
      ```

  - u/Mason-B:
    ```
    I think HPMOR is a definite must read (as it provides a rational take on a well known universe... it's more like an allegorical tale using your expectations of the Harry Potter lore; this provides a strong contrast to the original works and allows a better understanding of the tropes of rationalism).

    Personally I would follow it with either:

    * Worth the Candle: An original work based on a mashup of table top role playing games, with an "external" rational character (aka litRPG).
    * Practical Guide to Evil: An original work with in-universe rationalist characters and classic fantasy tropes (e.g. rather than the conceit of HPMOR or WtC).

    So, apart from being bored with Worm, I'm not sure which stories you actually enjoy, as a guide to what else you might like.

    However, if you want an alternative world-of-superheroes story, there's The Fall of Doc Future. Books one and two are complete, and I think book three is mostly there. Much less dark than Worm, and Flicker's power is awesome, but the psychology can sometimes be heavy going.
    ```

    - u/XavierMiles:
      ```
      Thats a really good suggestion tbh

      Because now that I've thought about it, rather than getting bored of Worm, I was kind of burnt out with how dark it constantly was

      Thanks again!

  TL;DR: Complete works?  
  There's a lot of RatFic updates being posted here, but it's really difficult to keep track of them all. I'm interested in completed works. Do you know of any, besides the ones in the wiki? I read all of the defining works and I think all the recommended complete ones.  
  Thanks!  
  EDIT: Ok, just noticed the \[C\] tag. Nevermind!

  Is there any good non-crackfic crossover stories you would recommend that are full on two worlds colliding crossovers as opposed to a single character or power set or whatever being transported into another universe?

  I especially want to see societies from one story dealing with all the repercussions of meeting a completely different one

    It sounds like you are looking for [fusion fics](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FusionFic) where the backstories of two or more series are merged.

    Good examples are [Child of the Storm](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChildOfTheStorm), [Children of an Elder God](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChildrenOfAnElderGod), [My Huntsman Academica](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyHuntsmanAcademia), or [Neither a Bird nor a Plane, it's Deku!](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/NeitherABirdNorAPlaneItsDeku)
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Not the ones where they seem to always have been merged from an in character viewpoint though.

      I'll look at what you linked.

      Edit: Maybe Child of the Storm gets close. But not exactly. Do you think it would appeal to someone who mostly reads ratfic lately?

    Hybrid theory by blade and epsilon is the mega crossover version of this.   Also, a whole lot of first contact stories in classic science fiction, such as the Mote in God's Eye.

      > Hybrid theory by blade and epsilon

      Are you honestly suggesting that a Linkin Park-theme-named anime megacrossover fanfic isn't a crackfic?
      ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Not looking for first contact stories. Looking to see two cultures clash that I either already know or can get to know from another context.

      One example would be a Star Trek/BSG crossover I once read. It's so long ago though I don't remember if I stopped reading it because it was dead or because some canon unfaithfulness or idiot ball turned me off or if it just became boring over time

    Is your name a reference to Wildbow? If so, you might apprechiate [Aspects](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/aspects-hp-twig-worm-pact-au.724264), a four-way crossover where post-canon protagonists from Worm, Pact, Twig, and Harry Potter are inserted into an alternate world of HP which starts to... *meld* with Pact's world. The most recent chapter had >!a group of Aurors visit the Library part of the Abyss!<. Also it's one of two fanfics that have Sylvester in them.

    - u/Bowbreaker:

      It is not. I had it before discovering Worm.

      I read Aspects. It's pretty cool, though I feel he didn't get Harry right at all. In fact I didn't read the last chapter due to a bit if dialogue that was so jarring to me it immediately made me drop it. Specifically, >!Harry tells Rose senior that Albus is gay. Something he shouldn't know or, if he did, would never have revealed that way.!<

      After a bit I thought of simply skipping that chapter and simply reading the ones with the much more enjoyable PoV characters. Which is when I found out there wasn't anything there to skip to yet.

  Can anyone recommend books similar to [Math Girls](http://bentobooks.com/mathgirls/)? It's a phenomenal read about introducing mathematical concepts in a way that helps you truly understand the intuition and pattern behind the formulas. It goes from basic elementary math problems to college level or above and show how it's all related, while at the same time illustrating the process of discovery and proving the theorems. There's also a romantic plotline between the three main characters, but who cares about that? /sarcasm/

  [An Ever Fixed Mark](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8523001/chapters/19536781) \- A deconstruction of the “soulmate identifying mark” trope, using “Pride and Prejudice.” As some of you here may remember, I was asking questions before about how people here would envision soul-marks working, to work on a story that would subvert the standard tropes around soul-marks. Well that plan's now Dead On Arrival since this story did it damn near perfectly.

  [Exhalation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Exhalation-Ted-Chiang-ebook/dp/B07P5CS7Z4) is now available in the UK u/MagicWeasel!

  I'll be on an eight hour plane flight to London. If you were in my shoes, what would you choose to read for those eight hours?

    If you like fantasy and lots of world-building, as well as clever magical solutions to problems, then check out the *Codex Alera* series by Jim Butcher. Short summary (by me):

    > A Roman legion plus camp followers stumbles into a magical world where they can control the nature spirits, or furies, leading to unnatural powers. Thousands of years later, the pseudo-Roman realm is gripped by a succession crisis. Too many plotters and too many plots all converge on the only man in the country with no furies of his own, an apprentice shepherd named Tavi.

    I'm trying to avoid spoiling anything, since a lot of the major components of later books in the series (there's six total) would massively ruin the earlier books. The first book, *Furies of Calderon*, is good but the other five are better.

  I recently read [He Who Fights Monsters](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6942921/1/He-Who-Fights-Monsters) and was looking for something similar. This can be in several categories:

  1. Whether it be in the Rosario world

  2. Whether it is with a character having to make morally questionable choices to survive

  3. The MC starts slowly down a darker moral path (doesnt have to be for survival)

  Also, as always, looking for more Bloodborne stories to read. I've read Fear the Old Blood, Hunter, and Bloody Tinkers.
