## Worth The Candle: A Major Unanswered Question

### Post:

Since the government of Anglecynn has reappeared in the latest chapters, it seems like a good time for me to get closure on a major piece that appears to be missing from the story. Maybe I’m being a moron, and this is actually explained somewhere early on and I’ve simply missed it. But, just in case I’m not—

What did Amaryllis actually *do*?

She and Juniper were sent to the Risen Lands for a Trial By Adversity. They were both, presumably, accused of major crimes, the kind that justify what is basically capital punishment. For Amaryllis, this means that she’s being charged with a crime so major, and so overwhelmingly full of evidence against her, that her political opponents can send the most direct heir to Uther Pendraigg off to be eaten by zombies.

Did she commit this crime? Was she framed? And, more importantly, *why hasn’t this come up in the story so far*? The fact that Juniper and Co. haven’t asked about this yet is so insane to me that I have to wonder if there’s some kind of in-universe memetic effect governing their ability to ask questions about Amaryllis’s past. 

It’s not like this stuff is irrelevant; if Amaryllis is charged with eating a baby on live TV, that’s critically important to their goals. Can she be cleared of the charges fully, beyond merely passing the Trial By Adversity? Can they find proof that she was framed of whatever it is that she supposedly did? Why has Juniper not even tried to figure out what’s going on?

If these questions have been answered already, kindly ignore this post. Or just tell me what I’m missing, because this has been driving me crazy.

  It has been represented as a complex political attack on her, (spearheaded by Larkspur?), where the legal aspect was only a small part.

  As far as I remember, Joon has never looked deeper into it, because this description has been enough for him to file it as blah, blah, politics.

  See for example the bio in ch. 15:

  She was once a keystone member of a bloc of power within the Lost  King’s Court, but now she has been cast out through means both  semi-legal and downright nefarious.

  This is enough to explain why it hasn't been discussed, but yes, it does leave the door open for the specific crime to be interesting.

  Due to the way people inherit magical items, Mary is the closest living relative to Uther, which puts a huge target on her back.

  I don’t know what the actual “crimes” she was accused of, but I suspect that it doesn’t matter.... her rivals need her out of the way so that they can “inherit” her land and entads

  Kind of a tangent: how the fuck was Mary able to randomly make a void pistol immediately after landing in apocalyptic zombie land? Did they have lots of void pistol parts just kind of lying around? That part always felt to me like Minecraft, where after punching trees for a few minutes you can make a crafting table and stairs and shit.

    My impression is that when you bang against one side of a void crystal, it sends a packet of "void" flying out the other side. 

    Therefore, a void pistol is literally just a trigger mechanism attached to a crystal. Press the trigger, the hammer bangs on the crystal, you get a hole in the distance. 

    Keep in mind that Mary was in a machine shop when he found her - a competent scavenger should be able to make a simple "pull lever, bang crystal" apparatus out of the scraps in your average garage.

      It is probably electricity that does it, at least that's how you get them to explode. ch 60:

      "All you really needed to make a void crystal explode was a  sufficiently powerful electric charge, which would cause it to radiate  void out in all directions, eliminating matter from existence."

      It would stand to reason that shooting works with a smaller charge. But yes, very simple to do once you have a crystal and a machine shop.

    Not many people go to the apocalyptic zombie lands to scavenge, and void crystals are cheap. After you get a void crystal it's child's play to turn it into a bomb or gun.

  ... Do we know why Aerb!Joon ended up in a trial by adversity? I honestly can't remember. I do remember Earth!Joon consciously choosing not to pull those threads when they popped up, which meant he didn't pull on Mary's trial by adversity threads either.

      That's a pretty low bar to warrant such a roundabout death sentence, but if Mary's crimes were of a similar nature, then I'm not surprised it was glossed over.

      Interestingly, this is what he claims when he meets Mary, too.

    I thought it was because of what happened with Maddie.

  ```
  Literally the first thing we learn about her is that she was party to the coverup of the failed anti-existential threat research that created the risen lands and that this resulted in her fall from grace.
  ```

  - u/LupoCani:
    ```
    To be perfectly clear, it has not at all been stated that the crime for which she was officially convicted had any relation to the illegal research station. I'd say it's unlikely, given that the existence of the research facility was supposedly still deeply classified.

    I thought they were researching the risen lands, not that they had created it.

    What chapter is this?

      Like chapter 4? It's why she knows about the port key in the first place.

  ```
  Considering what the DM said about manipulating events so anagrams could work, "for the sake of plot" is a valid reason.

  Edit: I dislike "flashback revelations" in stories, if Amaryllis' past crime becomes a major plot point now 160+ chapters in when it wasn't even mentioned in detail earlier. It feels like a cop-out instead of properly foreshadowing things.
