## Fantasy or Time Loop

### Post:

I'm looking for Fantasy and/or Time Loop stories (preferably time loop, but didn't want to make two threads). I don't have requirements per se, but I do have preferences:  

1. I dislike overpowered protagonists: OP protagonists are very hard to do in a way that there is *meaningful* conflict (which is important for my enjoyment of a story). Overpowered is relative, and a protagonist can be able to bust planets as long as the antagonists are up to par.   
2. Sane cast: The cast of the story should be sensible characters with organic motivations and characterisations. They should be reasonably competent (I dislike plot and character induced stupidity) at what they do.   
3. I read fanfiction of only some franchises, and since I expect fanfic recommendations franchises I think might be recommended but which I don't read (Harry Potter, My Little Pony, DC/Marvel, Transformers, Animorphs).  
4. I generally like prefer rational fiction, but it's not a requirement.    
5. I have other preferences I would decline from mentioning as I expect them to receive negative feedback.   

Time Loop books I('ve) read:  

* Mother of Learning.  
* Utsuko Hako to Zero no Maria.  

Time Loop books I'm aware of but haven't read:  
* Time Braid.  

The above is off the top of my head.  

All assistance is appreciated.

  Have you watched Primer? In my opinion it's the best time travel movie ever made, possibly the best time travel media of any kind. Go in without reading anything about it, then read as much as you can after.

  As far as fantasy, have you read Brandon Sanderson? His characters are extraordinary, and many of them act rationally in the exploration/exploitation of their powers. Definitely not rationalist, but generally well-regarded on this sub. His worldbuilding & magic systems are also consistently brilliant. Start with Mistborn.

    Does Primer have a book? I don't do movies (except cinemas or with friends I guess).
    ```

      Primer is a movie only, but it is an indie movie that was made on a super tight budget (the director is also one of the main characters, and they shot on film offcuts from other projects, etc). Added to that, they use the medium of a movie really well and I don't think it would be close to the same with a novelisation. 

      Invite some friends over and watch it! Puzzling out the plot together is a great activity.

      I gotta say I think that's a crazy attitude about movies! There are so many amazing films out there that limiting yourself to what's in cinemas or what your friends want to watch is a huge waste. 

      You're entitled to your opinions and I don't think downvoting you was necessary, but that's an awfully restrictive mindset.

        I wouldn't watch a movie of my own volition. I'll probably find many other things more entertaining (I don't normally watch TV if it helps), and I guess watching it with others is a huge part of the experience for me.

    Well I'll take a look at his works then.

      He's got a pseudo-timeloop story called Snapshot out there

  Time Travel:

  - I liked [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) quite a bit. The characters quickly become unbalanced, but it's slightly mitigated because their opponents tend to attack them in ways that bypass their defenses. The fic does contain some sex scenes, though not in a way that bothered me.
  - [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning)
  - [Branches on the Tree of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time) is a short (16 chapters + epilogue) terminator fic.
  - [Dangers of Foresight](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10017610/1/The-Dangers-of-Foresight) is a Star Wars fic. There's a prequel, but it's not a must-read before starting with Foresight.

  Fantasy:

  - [A Hero's War](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War) is not a time travel fic, but it contains many of the same elements of incremental growth that you find in time travel fics. I've never read a fic that was this detailed in describing how its technology works.

  The first fifteen lives of Harry August.

    If we're doing actual novels, I rather enjoyed https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341735.Replay
    ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    Oh, actual novels! "The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O" and "To Say Nothing of the Dog" are both at least adjacent to your request. 

    At the other end of the length scale, there's also [this](http://escapepod.org/2012/04/05/ep339-run-bakri-says/).
    ```

    - u/notjustlurking:
      ```
      To say nothing of the dog is probably my favourite novel. If general time travel is the theme I'd recommend a bunch of Connie Willis. The Doomsday book, Fire Watch, All Clear and Blackout are all fantastic.


      And thanks for the rise and fall of d.o.d.o. Hadn't heard of that and now need to go pick it up!

    This is more in line with "Books like Harry August" than what OP is asking, but I'd recommend Boat of a Million Years by Poul Anderson.

  I know you've said you don't read My Little Pony fanfiction, but I'd heartily recommend [The Best Night Ever](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/18087/the-best-night-ever) anyway. It's my favourite MLP fic, exactly what you're looking for, and doesn't require knowledge of the series. If you do like it I have more MLP time loop stories to recommend, but The Best Night Ever is the best one in my opinion.

  Not a book, but if you haven't seen Groundhog Day you should see it too. I know you said you don't watch movies, but Groundhog Day is *the* definitive time loop story and all around great.

  https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/purple-days-asoiaf-joffrey-timeloop-au.450894/ is ASOIAF time loop story, I haven't read it yet myself but I've heard it's good.

    Seconded Purple Days. It's a bit rough to get into, since the MC is a little shit at the beginning. It gets better as the author skills improved. Character development is excellence.
    ```

    - u/JackStargazer:
      ```
      Purple Days is actually quite good, I read it over a three day period. 

      It's one of the best examples of real believable character growth that I've ever seen in fiction.
      ```

    Hmmm. Personally, I'd have gone with [Hard Reset](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/67362/hard-reset) if I were recommending MLP fanfics - but that's just a matter of taste.
    ```

    - u/erwgv3g34:
      ```
      [_Hard Reset 2_](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/145711/hard-reset-2-reset-harder) is even better than the Eakin novels. The original _Hard Reset_ only has one trick; iterate until you solve the problem, then move on to the next problem. _Hard Reset 2_ is more complex because there are additional time travelers, so the fic also deals with cooperation and combat between loopers. Shame it is dead.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Yeah, the big downside of it is how it just ends.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Hard Reset requires more MLP knowledge I think, and personally I didn't enjoy it as much.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Fair point. I might just have a soft spot for it because it was one of the first MLP fanfics I ever read.
        ```

  - u/DragonGod2718:
    ```
    Thanks for Purple Days, I'll check it out. I seriously doubt I'll read MLP fanfiction, but I would try and get some friends to watch Groundhog Day.

  ```
  Replay, by Ken Grimwood, has a kind-of-sort-of time loop going on. The main character has a heart attack at 43 and wakes up in his 18 year old body. He uses his knowledge of the future to get rich, live an awesome life, and then has a heart attack at 43 and dies again. He wakes up in his 18 year old body once more, but a few days later this time. I won't go into more detail because I'd have to basically spoil the whole book, but it's pretty cool.

  Generally I would recommend royalroadl.com as a place to look. There are some fics you could enjoy.

  Metaworld chronicles is one of my favorites atm. It is basically modern fantasy with our world but with magic. Main character is transported there in her younger body. She becomes steadily stronger but is nowhere near the top. There are uncounted stronger oppositions. It plays mostly in magic Sydney. 

  If you don't mind litrpg you could read threadbare main character is a sentient golem made out of a teddy bear. It is better than it sounds. And don't let you turn of because of "supposedly" stereotypical evil characters. 

  A goblins teeth is very popular. Great read and very funny. Told from the view of a goblin that gets captured by bandits.

    Have an active Royalroadl account, but haven't found a new book that caught my attention yet.
