## Can we gather some helpful reading materials for authors of rationalist fics?

### Post:

As someone who's trying to start one and epically struggling... Yeah, any helpful links in general would be awesome. Maybe I'll put this thread in the sidebar for future reference.

    [The Fun Theory Sequence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/) might be particularly useful for a writer interested in science fiction or fantasy writing. It's a guide on how to build Utopia where people would actually want to live for a long time. Friendship is Optimal was partially guided by these rules. [Building Weirdtopia](http://lesswrong.com/lw/xm/building_weirdtopia/) is especially interesting.

    Of course, before you can write **good** rationalist fiction you have to first know how to write so maybe [general "how to write" self help books](http://www.amazon.com/Self-Editing-Fiction-Writers-Second-Yourself/dp/0060545690/ref=tmm_pap_title_0) might be more useful. That said, there's nothing stopping you from learning how to write by writing rationalist fiction.

  I'll start out with [the TV Tropes page on how to write realistic space travel](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/WriteAHardScienceFictionStoryWithSpaceTravel); I find that the tags of realistic scifi and rationalist fic often overlap.
