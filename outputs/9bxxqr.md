  Whoever read this did a good job! The content didn't feel very suitable for this sub, though. It was just kind of medium-grade sci-fi, like the author played Mass Effect and then read some Heinlein.

    Yes, but if you've watched exburbia's other stuff, a lot of which is posted here, you'll understand why it's posted.  I don't know about you but I guessed the ending about half way through and found it a fun look at one idea of time similar to the diagram at the end of *To save her*.

        No big tie in, just he writes slightly thinky good videos: like 27 (ai testing scenario), genocide bingo (existenial risk discussion) humanity good ending, now you happy allways maybe, regret in heaven(simulation torture), and a song about rockets to name a few.
