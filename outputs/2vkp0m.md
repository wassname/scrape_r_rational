## [TH] Inheritance - a 7-player Theater LARP

### Post:

(I'm not sure how well this fits this subreddit, but you folks seem like a good target audience for transhumanist themes.)

[*Inheritance*](http://www.paracelsus-games.com/theatrical-experiences/inheritance) is a theater LARP written by my friend, Warren Tusk. I was in its first run, and it has since run multiple times at various conventions in the New England LARP community. It has now been cleaned up, professionally laid out, and offered for sale.

The product page explains the premise of the game much more elegantly than I might, but I would like to say that I found it a very compelling exploration of what identity means when many of the constants of human-life-as-we-know-it have been made mutable. My character was a mass mind. Another character is a software simulation of a fictional character, and knows it. Another is a Friendly AI. There are two relatively "vanilla" humans, who provide a useful baseline for the cognitive weirdness of everyone else, but their goals and motivations are fitting for the future in which they find themselves.

I'm very fond of this game, and I hope someone here might similarly enjoy it.
