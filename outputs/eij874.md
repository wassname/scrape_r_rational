## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  The ancient Egyptians had a concept of 'shabti', little funerary sculptures that were inscribed with a shabti formula that specified their function in the afterlife. So the idea is, when you die, you would appear in the afterlife with your shabti that had been made for you in life. I think the idea is Neat, so am trying to figure out a way to appropriate it.

  The first thing is to replace "death" with something else, maybe which works as a thematic parallel, but which isn't as blunt and obvious, and doesn't have all the overtones of theology and existentialism. Instead, maybe veils between worlds and one world that's subordinate to others, e.g. a prime world where you make the shabti dolls and a secondary world where they take on life, flavored not like the land of the dead, but like, say, typical colonial exploration/exploitation that you tend to find in portal fantasy.

  In terms of "natural story", you would then have a brief run-up as someone is saying their goodbyes, and an adventure in the other world with the shabti and everyone else that has gone to the secondary world, and *their* shabti. I like the idea of a secondary world that leaks almost no information back, and an expedition/colony that's gone badly wrong for unforeseen reasons, or foreseeable-in-retrospect reasons, but maybe I just watched *The Terror* too recently and have been thinking about a fantasy version of that (the real life aspects, anyway). I'm not sure how the Egyptians thought they knew that their shabti would do, but obviously there's limited mechanisms for testing something that's only going to work in the other world.

  In terms of how I'd going about constructing the shabti on a mechanical level to work within the story ... **that's where I'm a bit stuck,** since obviously I could do programming analogies (I'm a programmer by trade), but seems better to me to have higher-level rules for what shabti can and cannot do, if the intent is to have those higher-level rules play into the plot or inform character decisions. (This is also an ongoing problem in my robot wizard vampire story, which is stalled out because high-level rules about what magic can and cannot do are easy, but making sure that they work on a lower level without breaking the world is hard, especially if you want those lower levels to be exploitable to create higher-level effects or break apparent higher-level rules.)

  (I really like looking to other cultures for worldbuilding inspiration, partly because it makes me feel like I'm learning things, partly because there are a lot of neat ideas that have stood the test of time in some capacity.)

    Maybe instead of having parallel worlds, you can set this in an outer space story where the characters are going from a more primitive world to a more advanced world.

    The shabti is what they are receiving as a reward/adjustment of sorts for coming to a foreign culture/world without any allowance to ever return home. The shabti will be a way for the immigrants to better fit in with some(one) who is reminiscent of home but is also very aware of what the new world is like and how to adjust from one culture to another.

    Sorry if that's not what you were asking for, but I wanted to suggest what I would replace "death" with.

    The premise you've framed up here makes me think about the (overblown?) concerns that were raised in some quarters when the LHC went into operation: that the existence of mass was predicated on a local minimum rather than a global minimum on some set of constraints, and that efforts to isolate the Higg's boson would provide activation energy to send the universe sliding into a totally new configuration with different (catastrophic-for-us) physical laws.

    In a universe where something like this has happened, but for some reason you have  two "universes" with distinct physical laws share a (hyper)spatial boundary instead of having one version of physics overtake the other at lightspeed, I think the determining how the boundary works and how it is maintained would do a lot to describe what is known or understood about how shabti would work, and perhaps about how they actually work.

    Narratively speaking, it's presumably difficult to send anybody through a barrier like this, and more difficult to send anything through and have it be anything like what it was on this side.  I imagine that plus the informational asymmetry could set up all different sorts of "expeditions" sent with all different sorts of agendas, which get scrambled or preserved in all sorts of interesting ways by what's on the other side.

    The primary function of shabti in this formulation would be to try to ensure that explorers continue to be the agents you sent off, or at least continue to meaningfully share your original goals and possess the means to at least attempt to achieve then it send information back.  Being on the other side of that activation energy barrier, and the presumably imperfect nature of the shabti would be significant here.

    Personally, I'm a sucker for bastard platonism, and since you have emanations from one world into another here, you might fiddle with that somehow?  Since these shabti are effectively probes going into The Cave.  The big question I would have is why the shabti are necessary if people can go there directly; presumably the shabti would have special capacities humans do not, it's easier to send a dozen shabti than one human, or the shabti can act as flight recorders if it all goes to hell, etc.  I'd nail down their intended role, and define the rules from there.

    (I used the term shabti for something in PB, as it happens, but mine fit the original concept only in the very broad sense of "artificial magic slave"; they play a limited role in the story and don't work as described here)

    How's this: the world is like a prison colony, similar to Brittish Australia. If you do something terrible you can choose shabti over death, where you're auctioned off for a job, and sent to the other world to perform that job. Shabti have weekly deadlines where they have to turn in a certain amount of ore/food/other-thing-special-to-shabti-plane that they were assigned to, and the better you do at your job the quicker you're able to get out. The more below you're deadline the more years are taken off your life (unsure about this part, but there should be something motivating not slacking off). Due to the lack of organized power structures and typical habits of criminals, this creates incentive for piracy, and a general wild west vibe. Weak coalitions soon form between groups hoping to avoid getting stolen from, and others hoping to steal more effectively. Some, smarter companies are trying to organize their shabti into more official coalitions, but this proves difficult as people can't bring any objects with them when they choose shabti, thus the companies lose enforcement mechanisms. There are currently lobbying efforts to allow high paying companies to train their shabti on enforcement and management tactics before they go in, but this is opposed by the general public who feel that it is generally a bad idea to teach murderers and rapists easier ways to murder and rape people. 

    Death is impossible unless it's done by not performing your job, those stuck in fatal situations are left to suffer until the deadline. These conditions are kept economically feasible because 10 years in the shabti plane is 1 year in our plane. 

    Hope these ideas will fit with the rest of your narrative. I'd like to know what you think.
