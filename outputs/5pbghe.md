  damn, the projected update time for this chapter was 17 days since the one before it and instead it was months and months. I hope this story isnt about to go on permanent hiatus like I thought it was before this chapter was posted. I really like Hogwarts Battle School.

    Don't get your hopes up

      ```
      Author notes a few chapters back suggest there's only a few to go now anyway, so as long as the metaphorical zombie can get over the finish line...
      ```

        ```
        We end book 4 and wait a decade for book 5â€¦

        Sounds familiar
        ```
