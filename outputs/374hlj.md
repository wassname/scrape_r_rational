    In chapter 17 the matriarch notes that Zorian is hard to read covertly as he's open and that he has impressive discipline with his surface thoughts. I suspect that applies. His teacher might catch the odd surface thought but invading his innermost memories would be obvious to him and as such his teacher avoids doing that. After all his training and practice this would be even more true.

    Plus he has an alien mind, being human, so his mind is hard to read. 

    I'd also note that he is very obviously a dangerous and deadly wizard. Aranea are likely very nervous about deliberately pissing him off.

        If he had indeed spent weeks in constant contact with a psychic that would mean he would be likely to spill the secret but in actuality he just had daily lessons where he spent a short time with his teacher, and then collapsed later in a headache away.

        At the start of chapter seventeen he notes the issue. As a mage he has had years of training to clear his mind of stray thoughts and can already do that well, but doing it for extended periods of time is tiring and leads to failure. He had short bursts with a psychic.

        The alien mind issue also can't be discounted. Suppose after his defences were crushed he let out an involuntary thought "Next time in this month's loop I'll crush her back."

        She isn't a human expert, she doesn't know human idioms or language that well. The idea of a time loop isn't even on her radar, unlike with the matriarch who was considering it due to the invaders. Many random emotions or thoughts aren't going to be clear enough for her to have any sort of idea of what he means. She's  more likely to think "Hah, another uppity student. He won't be anywhere close to that in our next session this month. If he feels like it's getting repetitive though maybe I should call in another teacher to spice things up."

        Suppose you heard someone say "This day feels like it never ends." would you think that meant they had a temporal stasis machine?

    It seems like the last 10 chapters have been a series of training montages. With some before then as well. Given that, I'm surprised that I actually love this book as much as I do.
    ```

    - u/jalapeno_dude:
      ```
      Aren't training montages basically the point of a Groundhog Day-style time loop story?
      ```

  - u/Jon_Freebird:
    ```
    Well, even without teachers he has been improving his mind magic. He can pluck out specific thoughts from people with relative ease so it'd make sense that he can hide things better too. Not to mention that he should be able to detect any intrusions.

  Think this chapter had big hints towards the Bakora gate stones.

  Bakora gates an ancient teleportation network ... more like an ancient network of recall anchors.

  Am thinking the Bakora gates as a recall network were abandoned as inconvenient once teleportation magic became widespread. Also, thinking they are the height of recall magic and will work much better than the current recall stone he just figured out.

  > He found it interesting that River Navigators had a room in their settlements that was clearly intended for humans - it meant they received human visitors often enough they felt the need to make a guest room for them. He should probably ask about that later.

  Does anyone else think this is probably a Checkov's Gun?
  ```

  - u/gommm:
    ```
    I'm not sure if Chekov's guns actually work for Mother of Learning... For example the little girl in Cyora who lost her bicycle is mentioned completely at the beginning but nothings comes out of this and I don't think it will have an impact...

    Actually what I like about this story is that a lot of little details are mentioned but contrarily to other work where details always end up having relevance to the story at hand, here it's not always the case. It makes it harder to guess what will happen...

        In 2020 it'll be revealed it was all the girl's plan to get her bicycle back that got out of control
        ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      I remember that there was a small impact. She was a device to show how small changes in behavior each loop can have huge repercussions. Specifically he decided to not go the path where he met the girl in most of his repeats. Then in one of the loops he passes the bridge and there is a scene where he notices a cat sadly looking out to the river or something like that. I took it as meaning that the girl tried to get the bicycle on her own and... failed. Actually gave me an emotional twinge.
      ```

    - u/MoralRelativity:
      ```
      Great point. I had forgotten about the girl and bicycle. I recall at the time thinking that scene served to better understand Zoran as a bit selfish but ultimately nice.

      I wouldn't be so certain about that.

  A really excellent chapter, I'm looking forward to the part where Zorian eventually sees Xvim again though I imagine that that's some time away.
  ```

  - u/FTL_wishes:
    ```
    I'm looking forward to him meeting all of his classmates again, as well as Zack.
    ```

      ```
      Taiven for one, can't help but think that she'll be really annoyed that "Roach" can consistently beat her in a fight. 

      Btw, did it take anyone else ages to work out that she means the small fish rather than the insect?
      ```

      - u/Cheese_Ninja:
        ```
        Really?  I didn't realize at all.  When should I have figured that out?

        Tavien's not the only person who will be surprised when Zorian starts showing off his abilities, but I think you're right that she'll be the most annoyed.
        ```

        - u/Jon_Freebird:
          ```
          I honestly can't remember the exact chapter/moment but I've reread it a couple of times now and there was a moment where it just clicked. Calling him a cockroach is a bit harsh even for Taiven.

  Another fun chapter, I really like this series.  Wish it updated more often, but I'll take what I'm given and be happy with it.

  At this point it looks like I was wrong about the Sword Divers just being overly cautious/suspicious of Zorian, and that they're more likely just assholeish. Then again, even the IGC matriarch stated that there was no way to be completely sure of their motivations. The YCG are suspicious for their immediate denial to Zorian, but I'm wondering if they've been targeted by the invaders or Red Robe, which could be significant.  Or it could be nothing.

  It's amusing how easily the River Navigators accepted his offer.  I wonder how many loops he'll spend in Mind Like Fire's tutelage before he decides to move on up to the Luminous Advocates for top tier training.  I wonder if the story will start moving faster once he's able to read the minds of any invaders or other enemies he encounters.

  Given Zorian's personality, if he makes it out of everything alive, he's going to be spending the next few years paying back people for assistance they gave him within the loop which they'll have absolutely no knowledge.

  Are you the author? I found a typo: ""Motherfucker," Zorian swore loudly, massaging **her** temples and not even bothering with telepathy to express his displeasure."
  ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    It seems mindcrush crushes more than the mind.
    ```

  - u/acinonys:
    ```
    /u/nobody103 is the author, I think.
    ```

    - u/nobody103:
      ```
      Yeah, that's me.
      ```

  - u/nobody103:
    ```
    Thanks for the notice, though actually that particular typo has been pointed out to me twice by now - I just haven't got to correcting it yet.
    ```

- u/elevul:
  ```
  Very nice chapter. I wonder if he'll be able to dedicate enough restarts to Mind Like Fire to hone his mind magic to perfection, or if something will interrupt him midway.
  ```

  - u/world_is_wide:
    ```
    Got to train until he can at least open the memory packet from the Cyorian matriach
    ```

- u/2-4601:
  ```
  Honestly, I'm still betting the scholar Zorian took the incantation to for research is involved. At some point he's going to be sufficiently leveled up and give it to him again, then trace the information as it passes through a higher-up and back down to an assassin.
  ```

- u/chaosmosis:
  ```
  Remember how he awoke from a coma midway through the loop one time, after taking an injury? I hope "falls unconscious" is well-defined. Otherwise, he could end up in a loop of exploding onto his little sister over and over and over again.
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    The devices wouldn't persist between restarts.
    ```
