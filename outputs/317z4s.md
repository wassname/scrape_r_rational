  I have to say, having the narrative simply go "Ginny would totally be okay with sacrificing all of her classmates to break the Interdict, except her moral sensibilities disagreed" is certainly not convincing me that Ginny cares about any of her classmates at all, as a classic example of telling rather than showing.

  In fact, I've never really gotten the impression that Ginny is a good person, at all. Regardless of whether horcruxes or lingering remnants of Voldemorts or whatever are involved, it seems that Ginny's base-state is just Not Very Nice. The narration keeps *telling* us that she's a normal person, but all the actual events that we see indicate that Ginny has an appreciation of the inherent value of other people somewhere between Quirrell and Lucius Malfoy.

    Ginny is possessed, acquired accompanying dark side.

    Or, coldly utilitarian calculation. In the long run magic stagnating and being lost is a pretty big deal for humanity, and if we'll admit it to ourselves probably more than 1000 students.

    (Though, it's unrealistic that all children aren't taught the reason merlin purposefully put up an interdict, and Ginny never refuted the logic of it.)

    Yea, that earlier bit where she lit all her classmates... Just light up a desk and tell others to do so too. Don't make dangerous pixies hurt your classmates.

    Wait, we were supposed to think Ginny was normal? I thought this version of Ginny was rebellious and a stereotypical Slytherin, in addition to being a bit of a lesswronger.

  Almost surprised Ginny didn't draw a Tower-of-Babel connection to Atlantis. In any case, the Bible study bit presents a believable picture of the wizarding take on Christianity. It seems to have a lot of support from Atlantis and the history of magic, which of course makes sense.

  Still no idea how this whole religion plotline is gonna wrap up, though â€“ with all the time devoted to studying the Bible, it seems more likely to be Christian; whereas relying on fictional justification for it would suggest an atheistic slant. Or maybe, in MoR-verse, Christianity is just *true*. Yknow, with the souls and all. That would be interesting.

  Seems like Ginny didn't carve the words into the wall? Note that the spells are so ancient, they'd be blocked by the Interdict, so Tim either learned them from the Basilisk or he's a Horcrux of someone much, much older.

  Or Ginny did carve them into the wall, and she was possessed and mind-wiped after, and she seriously needs to end that contract like *yesterday*

  In any case, I'm glad everyone's decisively anti-Interdict.

  I thought Quirrell killed the Basilisk? Huh.

  It seems somewhat anti-/r/rational that Chrissy figured out that Slytherin's Monster was a basilisk in about 5 minutes, and yet Dumbledore-and-Co still concluded it was an Acromantula during Riddle's day. Whatever.

  But the most important question of all: **Which Cedric Diggory got petrified?**
  ```

    To be fair, it sounds like no one of any intelligence really believed that it was an Acromantula, and Dumbledore certainly never did even in canon.

    OH! Huh. 

    Either TSI!Quirrell lied or was wrong during the events of HPMoR, or there's no basilisk this time, and someone, probably diary!Riddle, is just petrifying people by other means hoping to pose as a basilisk?

  Off-topic: Might I suggest condensing future discussion by linking to the fic on /r/HPMOR, and then linking to the /r/HPMOR discussion thread here? That doesn't seem to have any real downsides.
