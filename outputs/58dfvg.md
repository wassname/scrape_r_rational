## [Biweekly Challenge] Androids

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/562p2g/biweekly_challenge_elves/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Elves". The winner was /u/fuguofanotherworld with their story, [On Elves: An Enduring Culture](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/562p2g/biweekly_challenge_elves/d8ifwlj). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/fuguofanotherworld!

##### This Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Androids**. Here I'm using the term to mean "humaniform robots". [TVTropes has this page, which provides a good overview.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndroidsArePeopleToo) There are a couple of challenges if you want to make these rational, but mostly they have to do with aspects of world-building, which I think are sometimes skippable when writing rational works. This challenge topic is somewhat obviously prompted by the recent premiere of Westworld.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, November 2nd.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, we're going to tackle ~~spiders~~ **Politics**, just in time for the U.S. presidential elections. I would strongly prefer a *smart*, *sane*, *thoughtful* look at the subject; in other words, do not take this as your opportunity to write about how your political tribe is better than the other political tribe, or about how some political position is superior to some other political position. Ideally I would like to see some stories about politics as compromise between people of different value systems, or politics as power dynamics, or failure modes of political systems. Or just write an episode of West Wing that deals with regulations in regards to outside context problems.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 11/2.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread [is available here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/58dsem/challenge_companion_androids/)

    I'm very confused by the last few lines. You suddenly switched from third person to first person and I don't understand why.
