## [Biweekly Challenge] Dangerously Genre Savvy

### Post:

**Special Note: We are switching the challenge to once every two weeks instead of every week; it's possible we'll switch back if this causes problems or participation picks up. All other rules remain the same.**

##### Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3l8fkc/weekly_challenge_blue_and_orange_morality/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Blue and Orange Morality". /u/blasted0glass is the winner with their story ["Tepid Parole"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3l8fkc/weekly_challenge_blue_and_orange_morality/cv7o4yv), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/blasted0glass!

##### This Time

The challenge for the next two weeks is **"Dangerously Genre Savvy"**. It's hard to believe that we haven't done that before, I know. Here's the [TVTropes link](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerouslyGenreSavvy). In short, this is the person that defies genre conventions whenever those genre conventions would put them at a disadvantage. They know how things go in horror movies and don't want to end up as the next victim. They've seen too many heroes escape from elaborate death traps. And they're definitely not going to tell you their plans if there was the slightest possibility that you could change the outcome. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, October 7th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

The next challenge will be **"Precommitment"**. In the classic game theory sense, precommitment means that in a game of chicken, you throw your steering wheel out the window so that there's no element of choice involved and any rational actor will know that you're incapable of changing your mind. In essence, it's a strategy of removing options in order to strengthen a position in a conflict. This is one of the more rationalist concepts we've had for a challenge; I'm curious to see how it does.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 10/7.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

    Great twist and great ending.  I laughed pretty damn hard.

    Meant to comment on this forever ago.

    I really enjoyed it, and thought it was a pretty great rendition of genre-savviness. What I REALLY found funny, though, was that [](#s "the organization that's bringing protagonists in was ITSELF genre savvy, as it learned from its mistake with Gaia's Widow, what with the questioning and the poison gas set up. Still a fairly one dimensional test, not surprising for a world stuck in tropes, but it probably has saved them a few times thereafter.")
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      Yep. In fact [](#s "the only character that isn't really genre savvy is the protagonist. He gets caught up in the narrative, and his subversions are superficial. This is understandable, since he's new to a universe where 'the idiot ball' is a huge threat. Gaia's Widow is the only person to materially change the narrative to suit her own ends.")

    So he's a Mad Scientist in [a universe with ](#s "Shakespearin-style monologueing")?

    I felt really clever for figuring that out, then I realized you all but said it right in the title.

    [Now I sorta want to ](#s "see that play, though.  I'm picturing a division something like Into The Woods.  The first half looks like your normal Shakespearin play, albeit short.  And there's that one character who only gets one monologue, near the end, and with their backs to the audience.  Second half, they get revealed as a **Mad** Scientist and monologue once or twice more, still with their backs to the audience.  _Meanwhile_, other characters have monologues in which they refer to monologues that happened while they were off-stage.  Not sure what the payout is.")

    I'm proud of myself for figuring the trick out in the first paragraph or so, although I wouldn't have if I hadn't read last week's prompt and submissions...
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Yea, it's meant so that it's subtly hinted at, and the hints become more and more pronounced as the story goes on. By the end, even those who didn't read my previous story should catch on. Assuming they've been following the weekly contest thread at all.
      ```

    >“It’s not just sentiment. It makes evolutionary sense. In animals with such a protracted reproductive cycle, you have to treasure your breeding tools. A lot can happen in the nine months it takes to birth a baby. Even more can happen in the years it’ll take for that baby to reach sexual maturity.”

    Imma punch this guy.

    Also, I don't actually get who the bolded voice was.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      The bolded voice was [](#s "A personified form of the writer's negative emotions, specifically things of a self deprecatory nature. Such as low self esteem, self hatred, etc. Taken Up to Eleven for the sake of story, of course. The supposed point is that the writer is too Genre Savvy to let it corrupt him.")

      EDIT: also, lmfao, which guy were you referring to punching, and why?
      ```

      - u/MadScientist14159:
        ```
        Huh.

        For most of the story I thought it was a hallucinated voice conjured by schizophrenia.

        When you told the voice to "just shut the fuck up and play" the computer game I thought it was a malicious AI that had somehow taken over your computer and was talking to you over a text to speech program.
