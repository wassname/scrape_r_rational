## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Superheroes are great, and therapy is important.  But how often would a superhero be able to go to therapy?

  Like, in a world where superheroes are a known and established phenomena, I imagine that the Justice League or Avengers could routinely hire therapists for superheroes in uniform, with appointments paid for by Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark.

  But what about worlds where superpowers and the like are virtually unknown, and/or characters that haven't "put on the cape" yet and are trying to keep their powers on the down-low?  If they had significant emotional or interpersonal problems, would therapy be justified given the (perceived) risks of:

  A)  Being insufficiently honest to make effective progress,
  B)  Coming across as highly delusional, 
  C)  Saying too much and accidentally outing themselves and others?

    [Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593) is a Good Omens fanfic that touches on this. Not superheroes but hitting a lot of the same notes in terms of trying to get therapy while dancing around the supernatural elements.

      Seconding this recommendation. One of my favorite fanfics.
      ```

  - u/red_adair:
    ```
    If the character is willing to be open with the therapist about having powers, the therapist's willingness to believe probably depends on the type of superpower. If it's something that is demonstrable to the therapist, like Minerva McGonagall's ability to turn into a cat, then belief is easy. If it's internal, like many sensory powers, it may not be easy to demonstrate to the therapist, and would be riskier.

    If you are not familiar with worm you should read it just so you can read the Jessica Yamada interludes, she's the one named therapist in worm, and services so many hero's there's a series of memes about her therapy being a super power.
    ```

    - u/TheTrickFantasic:
      ```
      I have read Worm and remember those interludes.  They might be worth rereading, although Worm is another example of a world where superpowers are an established fact, and IIRC, lots of Jessica Yamada's sessions where paid by the Protectorate?
      ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:

      I think he is trying to imagine situations in worlds where superpowers are new or secret or otherwise not known by the mainstream.

  Just saw The Last Action Hero movie, and it was pretty great. I loved the self referential humor and the writing is really clever and ahead of its time. A lot of jokes felt like something Dan Harmon would write in Community or Rick and Morty. The movie really went all out with its premise (Arnold meeting real life Arnold) and I the move made some rational smart choices - like the villain Charles Dance planning to release villains from other movies. His motivation is very clear - that the real world is the only world where the bad guys can win. And the kid makes rational decisions and observations of what would happen in a real movie

  It's a great concept and a lot of potential with that universe in general.

  How does fiction that's hosted on blogs or personal websites gain popularity? Stuff like Worm or PGtE. If it's on aggregater sites like RoyalRoad, I can see how it works - but individual sites? Do they just post their work and hope to get lucky?
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    Worm in particular benefited early on from a recommendation from Eliezer Yudkowsky when HPMOR was at its popularity apex, as well as some TvTropers benigningly spamming the site with Worm tropes.

    Another factor is topwebfiction, though that has been less popular lately.
    ```

    - u/sohois:
      ```
      Seems like most of the self hosted web stories were started long enough ago that royal road wasn't a big draw. The likes of PGtE, Wandering Inn, Zombie Knight Saga are all 4 or more years old, while stuff like Wildbow's work or Gods are Bastards are even older. Things like topwebfiction and webfictionguide were probably the main aggregators back then.

      TWI and TZKS both now cross post to Royal road and other authors will post to every web fiction site, so I guess it's becoming more and more homogeneous
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        I think Worm is even older than topwebfiction. It definitely isn't the first web serial of its kind, but it probably was the first with this kind of success. [Tales of MU](http://www.talesofmu.com/book01/1) (strong NSFW and extreme kink warning) is older, but also definitely more niche.

  Can anyone recommend good fiction on copy-clans? Something in the vein of the Flower Prince trilogy, Glass House, Hanson's Age of EM, or the Bobiverse, and U/DataPacRat 's good works.  Current and personal events have me more down than my curmudgeon mean, mode, and median, so I'm looking for something to indulge long term or escapist thinking.
  ```

  - u/DataPacRat:
    ```
    Well, off the top of my head...

    Schlock Mercenary's versions of Gav, plus a couple of Kevyns; the radio version of the Hitchhiker's Guide has a half-trillion Lintillas; maybe David Brin's Kiln People; some of the Daves in Homestuck; the 90's CGI cartoon has at least one character get an extra copy made from their backup; Gold Digger has Array... Calvin once turned his transmogrifier into a duplicator... the Vortas in Star Trek DS9 do a serial-immortality thing, while Ba'al in Stargate ran some duplicates of himself for a while... RPG-wise, there's Eclipse Phase and Paranoia... in one of the Ah My Goddess things, Urd made a few copies who wanted the same things she did... there are a few perma-clone techniques in Naruto... the protagonist of Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka gets a little weird with her mental duplicates... I hear that when they planned to film the never-made Matrix sequels, one of the villains was going to do this <ahem>... The Stainless Steel Rat Goes To Hell has it as a major plot point... I think it was available to some in The Rapture of the Nerds... there are undoubtedly a few SCPs which involve such shenanigans...

    ... and I'm positive there are many more I'm missing. :)

      Thank you: Rapture of the Nerd (surprisingly, but I mainline text to speech and audiobooks these days in recreation time) or Stainless Steel Rat are the only two I havent allready stripmined for hedons.
      Edit: correction googling Gold digger and Kumo Desu Ga Nani Ka

    Accelerando by Charles Stross has a copy-clan that people can join. It's not much a spoiler to say that, and it is free online: https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html

    It's also multi-generational and very big on the potential "wow" factor of technology. It doesn't shy away from potential downsides but I think it is still good for both long-term and escapist themes.

  What's the best rss feed for phones? Play store makes it hard to find something that isn't as filled shovel ware.
  ```

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    I use the [feedly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly) app on my android phone.

    The Play store describes it as a 'news reader', but it's really for tracking and displaying RSS feeds. I use it to keep up with all of the webcomics and web serial novels that I follow.
    ```

  - u/DataPacRat:
    ```
    If you dislike the Google Play store, then you might want to consider what the F-Droid has to offer, such as at https://search.f-droid.org/?q=rss&lang=en .

    For example, do you have access to a webserver on which you can run Docker or LEMP? Then you might want to run Tiny Tiny RSS on that server, and TTRSS-Reader on your phone.


    (I've become somewhat spoiled on my desktop by how well [RSSOwlnix](https://github.com/Xyrio/RSSOwlnix) just works, and have yet to find a phone-based RSS reader that works as well.)

      Is the attraction of F-droid having the copyleft?  If so what device do you use, and how's the experience on it?
      ```

      - u/DataPacRat:
        ```
        It's part of the attraction, but not the only one; F-Droid lists apps which have what it calls 'anti-features', and lets you install them. But it is nice that it focuses so much on the Open Source & Free Software idiom. :)

        My phone's in the Moto G7 family, and F-Droid has been entirely painless to use. Some of the apps I've snagged from it include: AnkiDroid (study aid); AntennaPod (the best podcast app I've yet found); FBReader's TTS Plugin (turns ebooks into audiobooks); Hacker's Keyboard; K-9 Mail (multi-account email app); KDE Connect (lets my laptop talk to my phone and vice versa); OsmAnd (Google Maps replacement); Puzzles (the collection by Simon Tatham); RadioDroid (stream internet radio); Simple Solitaire Collection (card games); Slide (reddit app); Telegram (chat app); VLC (video/audio file player). I've installed some others, but I've actually used all of the above within the last few months.

    I use inoreader on desktop and mobile, switched from feedly years ago and no complaints. I have the lowest premium subscription because it's absurdly cheap during their black friday sale, so I just refresh it each year then.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      Just out of curiousity, what led you to switch apps? Does inoreader have different features or an interface that you like better?

      Since feedly is free I've never considered switching to a service that requires a subscription, and I wonder what might justify the cost.

  How would you imagine a fight between a rational Time Looper (Groundhod Day style, but can be turned on and off) and a rational Precog?
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Depends on how the precog works.

    1) Precog through extrapolating from the real world. Precog is surprised and massively confused by looper. His power may or may not recalibrate as the loop runs its course. Looper can defeat him by following original actions and then ambushing precog out of nowhere.

    2) Precog knows the future by fiat, but works on linear time only, the loop superceding him. At the start of the loop suddenly all of his predictions change in an unprecedented way. He can see the whole loop, but isn't necessarily aware that it is a loop, so will not hold back. Looper has to use the loop to learn about precog and then defeat him at a start of a loop where precog is most vulnerable and unprepared. This splits into two depending on the precog's spacial awareness.

    2a) Precog is aware of his own future and the looper can keep away to confuse him or keep him in the dark.

    2b) Precog knows stuff that's happening in the world even if it's unrelated to him, to varying amounts of resolution. At it's most extreme he will immediately know the cause of his sudden change of visions, because at the precise moment it happens there is only one variable behaving differently.

    3) Precog is aware of the loop, but still limited by it. Essentially his power works the same as in 2, but instead of seeing some parallel post-loop timeline that will never actually happen in each loop and be fooled by it, he sees his visions cut off at the end of the loop, or some other crazy and unprecedented thing. He might be more prepared for shenanigans and, depending on setting and intelligence, be able to deduce the fact that he is in a loop more frequently and act accordingly (by holding back in timelines that remain within the loop). This one also has the same sections a and b as the previous one.

    4) Precog works on overtime. He might or might not know the content of the whole loop sequence itself, but knows everything about the current instance, the fact that he is in a loop and, most importantly, the end results of the last loop and all its consequences. He will fiddle his thumbs during the loop, maybe amuse himself with cryptic communications towards the looper. In the last loop he will do what most benefits him. The looper is as screwed and outmatched as if he weren't a looper at all. Maybe the existence of a loop centered around the looper was all part of the precog's master plan in the first place.

    5) Precog knows everything, including the results and consequences of him knowing everything. The universe is deterministic. Nothing matters. There wasn't really ever a fight to begin with.

    I think 2 or 3 would make for the most interesting stories for a true contest. That said, given infinite determination and mental endurance the looper will always find the path to victory, if such a path is physically possible.
    ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    Looping basically allows you to act with precognition, so I would think it would largely depend on how well you can replicate your actions and their consequences.  If it's similar to the Groundhog Day loop in that events will proceed down their original path unless severely disrupted, then the looper has basically an eternity to figure out exactly how to get around the precognition.  If events proceed chaotically, with events sensitive to even small changes in the initial conditions, then the precog would have an strong advantage in knowing how things are about to happen, where the looper has to guess what happens next. based on previous iterations of the loop.
    ```
