## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I'm working on a setting that's an archipelago.  Tech level is roughly age-of-sail.  People can travel between islands for a few months during the summer.  The rest of the year has harsh and unpredictable storms that make open-water sailing extremely dangerous.

  What sorts of cultural consequences would flow from this?

  I have the details of the trade and government set up, but I'd like to add more touches about how every-day life would change due to the relative isolation.

    Once the stormy season comes, trade is cut off, so people are always eager to get as much of whatever perishables they can before their supply is gone the rest of the year (assuming some amount of comparative advantage on that front). Most of the perishables get preserved (pickled, salted, sugared, honeyed, dried, etc), and even those probably need to be rationed out for the rest of the year. This might be the case for some goods even without strong comparative advantages, if there are economies of scale that only function when you have trade access to all the islands.

    You need sailors to do the trading, but what do those sailors do when the storms come and they can't go out on the seas? That's probably going to define a fair amount of your culture. Do they become shallow-water fisherman? Do they have culturally-standard off-season jobs that play on their skills at sailing? The calm season overlaps with summer, which is prime farming time, so that's a definite stressor on the labor supply, which in turn probably has some cultural artifacts.

    I think I would look for some quiet, labor-intensive activity for people to do as a social activity, which will probably be one of the things that defines the isolation period. Quilting groups, Bible study, things like that, likely related to textiles (since those aren't perishable and are usually labor intensive) or pottery (same reason) or something else, depending on tech levels, some of which is in service of getting goods ready for the next trade period.

    So on an average night in the "winter", you have a group of people sitting in a circle chattering away as they weave the fibers left over from the summer's harvest, eating candied fruits that come in from the next island over and are in dwindling supply. People are cooped up and irritable, but trying to take their minds off of it, listening to the same story being told a fourth time.

    The storm latitudes are a brutal place in a variety of ways. Jungle conditions dominate, with high biodiversity and (as conditions outside the body tend to resemble those inside) lots of bacterial and parasitic diseases. Expect almost constant precipitation outside of the summer months, themselves still so hot and humid as to be nearly fatal. The universal mid-day nap is a common cultural standard, and night it the time for social engagement.
    ```

    Just as an aside, summer is the rainy season in lower latitudes, winters are dry.

    So it should be the opposite of what you have there.

    &#x200B;

    I guess it would depend on the distance between the islands. Age of sails is very vague, is gunpowder invented? printing presses? manufacturers? steam engines? steel? telescopes? Is science already a thing? or do people just invent things and have silly theories as explanations? Is tradition important to your people? because that can lead to technological stagnation.

    &#x200B;

    Have you researched archipelagos and how some islands have metals, others don't, some have forests others are barren rocks. Your societies would work and have it's dominance defined by the resources their islands had available.

    &#x200B;

    New Zealand for instance is a continental island, it's large, has metal, forests, rivers etc. So it could develop large populations, metallurgy, shipbuilding and become the super power in it's area.

    &#x200B;

    Other islands had so little fertile land that they basically farmed fish, i.e they raised fish in artificial lakes for food. Some fished, some developed highly efficient pig / chicken farms etc.

    &#x200B;

    Check chapter 2 of the book guns, germs and steel. It has a lot of useful information for this topic.

    &#x200B;

    Try to stay away from the generic stuff, and don't assume you know how things work, double check your facts. Else you'll ruin your story for anybody with a bit more knowledge than you.

    &#x200B;

    PS. it's unlikely for a rainy season to stop ships altogether, unless you go full stormlight archive, if their ships are so bad that this is the case the rewards for the first person that invents more resistant ships are immense. It's also an obvious problem with an obvious solution, so you can bet that it would have happened quickly.

  I spent too long making a new Wizarding Europe for the Harry Potter stuff I've been writing. What I've got right now is a work in progress buuuuuuuuuut if anyone's interested in a starting place to jump off from for their own fics, [here you go](https://i.imgur.com/eu07frE.png). 

  This is meant to represent Europe as it stands in the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union (some Russian wizards saw what Grindelwald was doing with Hitler and had the bright idea to try it with Stalin, only they thought too highly of themselves and too little of the muggles, and came out of it rather the worse for wear).

  The Statute of Secrecy was signed in 1689, so I started with the assumption that wizarding countries in Europe were more or less identical to their muggle counterparts at that point (indeed, there arguably wasn't any such thing as a "wizarding country", with few exceptions) but then began to diverge.

  The major powers of Europe are the Kingdom of France, still ruled by a cadet branch of the Bourbons; the Wizarding Roman Republic, which was built from the administrative structure meant to oversee the Holy Roman Emperor's magical subjects; and Iberia-Sicily, which has not been ruled by the Hapsburgs for a very long time but has remained intact to be a counterweight against France and the W.R.R. when necessary. "Divided we fall" and all that.

  Checkered areas in the W.R.R. represent "free states" (placeholder name) which have considerably more autonomy. Many of them are centered on particular cities but, given the low population of the magical community and their penchant for teleporting around, are larger in territory than a muggle version might be.

  This is the core element for how magic works in a story that I'm working on.  I'd really appreciate it if people could offer some critiques or ideas regarding it.

  ESSENCE

  Essence is the way that magic expresses itself in the world. It is the force that enables warriors to lift a ton of steel in one hand and it is the force that enables a mage to throw lightning at his foes. Essence exists in faint concentrations in the air but is mostly concentrated within individuals. Whenever something dies, it’s essence is released. Most of that essence will disperse back into the world, but some of it will remain in some form. Usually the remains will be in the form of a spirit core of some type, but occasionally a different echo of the creature might form. The essence inside of this spirit core can then be absorbed by another individual in order to improve their abilities or develop new abilities. Essence is never absorbed as a generic increase in all of something’s abilities. It can make you stronger, faster, smarter, it can improve the strength of some magical technique that you have, but a single spirit core can never do all of that. Whenever you absorb a spirit core, you focus on whatever you want to improve or develop and when you have finished absorbing the core, you will have obtained some amount of the improvement or developed some amount of that technique. For most people, this is done via a status screen. There are hard limits to the amount of essence that a person can have; these are known as circles. Additionally, there are hard limits to the amount of essence that any given attribute, skill, or technique can have within a circle. Generally that limit is 10% of the total essence limit for the circle in question. In order to advance from one circle to the next, you need to have some limiting conception of yourself. For example, to move from the first circle to the second circle, a person might have a conception of themself as a warrior. If they broke through like that, then they would find it easier to accumulate essence for fighting aspects and harder to accumulate essence for crafting or social aspects. Then, in order to advance from the second circle to the third circle, that person might have a conception of themself as a swordsman, and this would have a similar limiting factor. A person’s conception of themself is called their class and aspects which are easy for them to improve are known as their purview. The following is the most basic status screen that exists:

  BASIC Name: N/A Class: N/A Circle: 1 Essence: 0/1000

  ATTRIBUTES Strength: 1 Charisma: 1 Intelligence: 1 Dexterity:1 Manipulation: 1 Cunning: 1 Vitality: 1 Composure: 1 Wits: 1

  SKILLS N/A

  TECHNIQUES N/A
  ```

    This seems like experience points, D&D classes, and gamer-style status screens.  D&D came up with these elements to approximate the real-world dynamic where people specialize, and then get better at their day-job with practice.  It's already true that playing a bunch of tennis will make me better at tennis.

    So, I'd suggest making the magic system less realistic and focusing on the things that seemed really epic about the original idea.   Right now, it seems like the big consequences are:

    1.  You get stronger by killing things
    2.  People specialize in professions
    3.  People can see status screens

    If you push hard on #1, you get a world where the guy at the beef slaughterhouse is terrifyingly strong.  And adventurer might kill a monster every couple days.  But slaughterhouse guy kills a cow every 90 seconds for 8 hours / day.

    Push hard on #2, and you get a world where my skills depend on my *self-conception* rather than any kind of real-world practice.  I'd pay story-tellers to invent useful-archetypes for my kids.  Therapy, to shift my self-conception, would be super-useful.  And people who are skilled at self-delusion would be incredibly versatile.

    Push on option #3 and you get interesting consequences, too.  I can imagine a story where the ROB gives a free gift of 2000 essence to some protagonist.  His friends and family notice the sudden jump and draw the reasonable conclusion that he must have murdered a *lot* of people in the last 24 hours.

    And Free-Will gets weird in a world where there's a Charisma stat.  Does everyone agree that Charisma-10 Bob is a better guy than Charisma-9 Dave?  Like, not just that Bob is a better salesman or public speaker, but that literally everyone would rather be Bob's friend than Dave's?

    If so, you'd get a fascinating social dynamics by making 1 character an "anti-gamer" who's just indifferent to mental stats.

      This technically happens IRL already. Few people want to be friends with bums, hobos and addicts, lot's of people would like to be friends with elites of all kinds: athletes, actors, politicians, wealthy, models, youtubers, professional gamers..

  I'm curious what y'all think rational satanic witchcraft would look like. I've seen so many different takes on magic but I don't think I've ever read anything that presented magic as something bad/evil or similar to what inspired witch hunts. Moreover, I'm having trouble thinking of how this would work, so let's say these witches have to make some sort of deal/s with the devil or demons. What would they (Satan/demons) want, why would they want it, why would they need to make a deal with a human to get it, and what is it they can offer in exchange for the deal/s?

  The problem I'm seeing is that if demons can transmit anything other than information from their world/dimension to the human world then they wouldn't need to grant humans magic. They could just cull anyone with both a low probability of reproducing and a high probability of going to hell in the event of their death to ensure a steady flow of incoming souls. But I guess this all depends on how you design hell. Like maybe the souls of bad people go to some location of hell to be snatched by the first demon that happens upon them, but if the person sells their soul to a specific demon then that persons soul will be delivered directly to said demon once they die, which would give demons an incentive to bargain for souls. Conversely, if a person wants magic but doesn't want to sell their soul they could do favors for demons, like killing someone (that's likely to end up in hell) at a specific location so the demon can make an educated guess as to were their soul will arrive in hell. But if you're doing favors for demons, you're probably going to hell so that doesn't really make sense  (unless you can literally just repent at any time and earn yourself a one way ticket to not-hell).

    For demons, satanic pacts are a form of force multiplication. They have *some* power on Earth, but they have more power if they have a supplicant to channel that power through or do their workings, and even more than that if they have multiple supplicants working together in concert. Usually the demon is working with their supplicant(s) toward some kind of escalation; it *starts* with cutting the head off a dead sparrow to bring humiliation onto a girl in class, but by a gradual process of desensitization, it ends with human sacrifice. Some of the things that the demon requests will be to increase its power on Earth, but some will simply be to activate human cognitive biases (especially sunk cost fallacy) in order to increase the hold over the supplicant and/or expand the cult.

    How it goes from there depends on what kind of rules you set up for your demons and witches. Are rituals static things with repeatable effects, similar to programmatic function calls? Or are they unbreakable contracts for service by agreement of both parties (with or without fine print or interpretation)? What, precisely, can demons do, and is it mathematically defined, utility defined, memetically defined, et cetera?

    Daedras in TES, GRR Martin's magic, and Lovecraft stories follow this trope.

  Had a weird dream where a person showed up at my front door, screamed in pain, and had their arm pop off, and a torrent of luminescent water spewed forth from their arm socket.

  Separately, I've been kinda working on a story that involves travel to multiple bizarre worlds, inspired by David Friedman's [Legal Systems Very Different From Ours](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Course_Pages/legal_systems_very_different_12/LegalSystemsDraft.html).

  So, this makes me want to posit a world where a dark, dry cave is populated with people who, when their limbs are forcibly removed, gush out a huge amount of luminescent water, sufficient for agriculture if taken advantage of properly. I'll have to figure out the specific math, but removing an entire arm should be enough to feed \~10 people for life if none is wasted. To match my dream, it should come out at about a rate of 1000 gallons per minute, and come out for at least ten minutes, but it never ends in the dream so it could be virtually for life.  


  What kind of culture might you expect to come out of this?
