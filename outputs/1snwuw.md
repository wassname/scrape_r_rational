  _Oh, what would Slytherin Harry do,_

  _if he were here right now?_

  _He'ld probably kill the LOT of you,_

  _that's what Slytherin Harry'd do._

    Probably not. But hilarious and worth a read nonetheless.

  I liked the way Harry kept control of his classmates; very realistic. But the loophole Harry exploits is retarded. In the real world, if someone as powerful as the ministry wants to screw you over, they will. If you want to survive, you need power of your own, not a clever little word twist that any legal apparatus under Fudge's influence will be happy to throw out.
