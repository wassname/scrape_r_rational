  > [Sam Hughs - "](#s "It was a very open secret that I was hoping to bring the Antimemetics Division story to its conclusion by the end of 2015, and I was only one day late. It was also an open secret, and heavily foreshadowed in the Tales, that I was going to burn the Division to the ground at the conclusion. I kind of designed this entire subunit of the Foundation so that it could credibly appear out of nowhere one day without ever having been mentioned before, run for a fixed length, then disappear without trace at the end of the story and never be mentioned again. I don't have any plans for more Antimemetics Division stories (although a LOT of stuff wound up on the cutting room floor). ")

  > [ ](#s "Naturally, it's been established that there were Antimemetics Divisions before this one, so there's no reason why a new one couldn't be founded to replace it some time in the near future. Maybe, with their more advanced technology, they'll have a better time of it? They'd better hurry up though, SCP-3125 is descending… ")

  > IN FACT: While I was working on Antimemetics Division Tales, author DreamwalkerFae had the idea that there could be a second Antimemetics Division in the Foundation right now, with neither division aware of the other one. DreamwalkerFae's version is called the Counterconceptual Division. SCP-2358 by DreamwalkerFae and SCP-2111 by sirpudding both contain references to the CCD. Where does all of this go next? Well… anywhere… "

    [Speculation](#s "Perhaps because it makes you 'forget yourself'... and then it fills in the void left behind.")

      ```
      [Well, that's a bright thought](#s " That's more than slightly backed up by the last few paragraphs (where people are looking for Wheeler and act like the 3125 got to them)... I think I hadn't considered that because it raises a lot of questions and is a significantly more terrifying explanation than simply killing them.")

      [Because if you think about it-](#s "'Seven years ago there were more than four hundred antimemetics research groups worldwide. Government agencies, military branches, private corporations, university projects. Many of them were GOIs or subdivisions of GOIs. We were allied with most of them. We were at the spearhead of an Antimemetics Coalition which spanned the whole globe and thousands upon thousands of people. None of those groups still exist. The last one ceased to exist some time in the last seventy-two hours. Three years ago, Foundation Antimemetics was an organisation of more than four thousand people. Now it's ninety.' So unless all of those people were wiped, then that implies there's a pretty scary number of mind-slaves on the loose...")

        ```
        [Also, keep in mind that](#s "3125 is a vaugely conceptual 5th-dimensional being that backs a whole host of memetic and antimemetic effects, some of which make you forget yourself, some of which make others forget you, many of which do both at the same time, and almost all of which then add a horrifying lemony twist to your nightmare pie. Said twist often involving your death. The specific incarnation of 3125 that triggers upon viewing the concept itself seems to wipe you clean, then take you over, as we saw - Marion had been gradually wiped clean, but had time to medicate and equip herself. However... probably, the other wings of the antimemetics division perished in other ways related to and derived from 3125, but separate from the breach happening in the tale - which seemed to be localized to the site.")

      [I ](#s "was still holding out hope that the bomb saved the day. Wheeler is resistant to the bomb, and 3125 might not be. The story mentioned the signal flooding the room, and it was vulnerable to the antimemetics that were hiding the bomb, so it might be vulnerable to the antimemetics that is the bomb itself. But wheeler believed it wouldn't and I take her word on it.")

  ```
  God damn, great story.

- u/TimTravel:
  ```
  It occurs to me that an antimeme story might be best told in reverse: if the main characters know the least at the end and the most at the beginning.
