  The real crowning moment of this chapter was Uriel finally getting the hang of knock knock jokes.
  ```

  - u/Arancaytar:
    ```
    He made one in Madrid that really killed the audience.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      >ALEPH YOU ARE GOING TO DIE
      ```

      - u/FeluriansCloak:
        ```
        I really enjoyed that joke, shame about the mass-murder post-punchline
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          Considering that they died to divine light, it's possible they all went straight to heaven. At least, the ones who had souls did.
          ```

          - u/Bowbreaker:
            ```
            And the others didn't really experience death anyway. Or anything else for that matter.
            ```

  - u/arlindohall:
    ```
    I got so excited! And I love how he was super insistent that the joke be made. Like not even the devil himself could stop Uriel from making that joke!
    ```

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  >There’s a new seraph in town!

  Best pun in the chapter, imo.

  On another note... the story wraps up on the 14th! Wow!

  > Do you know why videos still work, Sohu? That wasn’t Uriel. That was me. I kept it working so that every month, I could send him videos of his wife, burning. Updates, if you will. I never missed one.

  Shit.
  ```

  - u/Ninmesara:
    ```
    If he cares so much about Robin, it's strange that he's ignores Malia after she was born. But well, he's the Devil, he has weird priorities.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      He cares about making TCK miserable, not about Robin. He probably didn't think TCK had enough of a connection to Malia that hurting her would hurt him.
      ```

  - u/rictic:
    ```
    Anyone else getting that there's a parallel between Thamiel and Scott there? Scott didn't miss an update to Unsong.
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      Thamiel is his klippotsona.
      ```

  ```
  >YOU DESTROYED MY ZIGGURAT, YOU TWO-HEADED CREEP!

  Never forget the poor Ziggurat
  ```

  - u/NotACauldronAgent:
    ```
    Ziggy-chan best girl.
    ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Where were you when ziggurat was kill?
    ```

    - u/monkyyy0:
      ```
      In a heavenly host singing angel shit presumably
      ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  >OR DEATH

  Ana is about to learn the HaMephorash, and Erica is in Hell.

  RIP Thamiel, you will not be missed.
  ```

  - u/Arancaytar:
    ```
    Narratively, it seems more fitting if the whole chain is significant - which means not just Erica/Ana, but Uriel/Dylan.
    ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Erica's in Hell? Is that confirmed or just a guess?
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      Even if she isn't, Dylan definitely is.
      ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      We are assuming that the sudden sense of loss she experienced as Erica died was her going to Hell.
      ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      I guess it's not confirmed, but we can hope. Maybe killing Malia counts as murder and sends her to hell? Maybe killing Malia *instead of escaping* counts as suicide?
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        Haha. 

        I think that this is the first story that has ever inspired its readers to say, "Well, we don't know that one of the protagonists is suffering in Hell, but we can hope!"
        ```

        - u/Ninmesara:
          ```
          Most demons have left hell. There is a hostile takeover by Dylan, who has injected himself with Malia's blood and is shouting: "I am minor nobility in Hell! The blood of Thamiel runs in my veins"
          ```

          - u/SrNagato:
            ```
            Well, "I've injected myself with demon blood so that I can infiltrate the nobility of hell to pursue my own agenda" has a rather nice narrative to it, does it not?
            ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          You never know, maybe all the demons are too busy attacking Earth to torture her!
          ```

- u/monkyyy0:
  ```
  I for one quite like how parts of the bible were written, mushrooms seem like a perfect explanation for that book
  ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    Good Omens by Pratchett and Gaiman had the same theory - could be a case of three minds thinking alike, or Scott referencing Good Omens obliquely, or for that matter all of them referencing something else I don't know about.

    >Aziraphale, like many Soho merchants who specialized in hard-to-find books for the discerning connoisseur, had a back room, but what was in there was far more esoteric than anything normally found inside a shrink-wrapped bag for the Customer Who Knows What He Wants

    >He was particularly proud of his books of prophecy.

    >First editions, usually.

    >And every one was signed.

    >He’d got Robert Nixon, and Martha the Gypsy, and Ignatius Sybilla, and Old Ottwell Binns. Nostradamus had signed, “To myne olde friend Azerafel, with Beste wishes”; Mother Shipton had spilled drink on his copy; **and in a climate-controlled cabinet in one corner was the original scroll in the shaky handwriting of St. John the Divine of Patmos, whose “Revelation” had been the all-time best seller. Aziraphale had found him a nice chap, if a bit too fond of odd mushrooms.**

      ```
      I think Salvation War: Pantheocide had it too. Michael-lan gave someone a salad made from cocaine and shrooms or something just to see what would happen, and he didn't realize someone would actually write it all down. He did a pretty good job of figuring out how to actually make a lot of that stuff happen.

      Terence McKenna talks about a wonderful little theory that Jesus himself was a mushroom. https://youtu.be/WBHOumAlKhw

          Kabbalistically, it checks out. Nothing is ever a coincidence.
          ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    It actually kind of bugs me, because Revelation is reasonably clear if you understand that it's essentially a political cartoon. No mushrooms required.
    ```

- u/CeruleanTresses:
  ```
  Awwwwww! I was right about them being kabbalistically married! That is the sweetest thing ever, and I'm so relieved that Uriel is still around despite having been killed. 

  (I wonder why he made the ritual only work "properly" with opposite-gender partners. It clearly wasn't even intended as a romantic ritual, since A. that would be gross and B. he calls Sohu his friend. Maybe there's some other reason it wasn't as strong between Ana and Erica. Or maybe he could only get it to work by repurposing a marriage "framework" that still had the original RAM-conserving restrictions in place.)

  That whole chapter was badass. It was so satisfying to see all the factions we've met over the course of the story rise up against Thamiel together. And the knock-knock joke was _perfect._ 

  I groaned at "strong arm" though. God *damn* it.

    From [Chapter 23](http://unsongbook.com/chapter-23-now-descendeth-out-of-heaven-a-city/):

    > *The north and the south Thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in Thy name. Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is Thy hand, and high is Thy right hand*

    > \- Psalm 89:12-13


    > *Thou hast a mighty* **arm: strong is Thy hand**, *and high is Thy right hand*

  - u/Ninmesara:
    ```
    Ana and Aaron were granted a proper marriage, as such was the whale of God.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      No, the whale of God is Leviathan. Whom Ana is about to capture.
      ```

  - u/monkyyy0:
    ```
    I think Ana and Erica were on different sides of the holy/evil spec
    ```

  - u/___ratanon___:
    ```
    I think the reason the link between Erica and Ana was because they flubbed the ritual. Or maybe it was just one of those inexplicably bizarre bugs of Uriel's, like Boiling A Goat In Its Mother's Milk. Uriel had just a day to design and implement the ritual; he probably didn't have much time to debug it, and he probably only cared to make sure it's going to work between him and Sohu. [Wouldn't be Uriel's first flawed creation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_poor_design)

    As for whether the ritual was meant for Platonic or romantic relationship: given this exchange from chapter 52

    > “IN THE OLDEN DAYS, THE ANGEL SAMYAZAZ AND HIS FOLLOWERS FLED HEAVEN TO ESTABLISH A KINGDOM ON EARTH, WHERE THEY LAY WITH THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN. I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE DAUGHTERS OF MEN WERE SO INTERESTING. UM. BUT. UM. YOU ARE VERY INTERESTING.”
    > 
    > “Um,” said Sohu.

    ...I'm not sure if Uriel understands or cares very much for the distinction. Though ironically, this may mean that contrary to what the exchange between Aaron and Ana in chapter 5 suggests, 'marriage' really *is* 'just a word' even in the Unsong universe, of all places.
    ```

  ```
  >>“YOU DO NOT SEEM LIKE YOU ARE GOING TO SAY ‘URIEL WHO’ SO I WILL PRETEND YOU SAID IT AND CONTINUE THE JOKE ANYWAY. THE ANSWER I WAS GOING TO GIVE WAS: ‘URIEL-LY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO THINK I WOULD ABANDON MY FRIEND.'”

  This sort of thing is why everything involving Uriel/Sohu/Comet King/Thamiel is just so brilliant. They're the more vivid and melodramatic characters of the story but I love them for just that reason.
  ```

- u/AnarchistMiracle:
  ```
  What are the odds we wind up with a universal SKABMOM?  Humanity united as (mostly) single mind with all the Names might be smarter, kinder, and more powerful.  Might even approximate to 'God recarved without the facet of Thamiel.'
  ```

  - u/crivtox:
    ```
    "or may my luck dry up and my head turn green and my liver explode and everybody die, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. So help me God.” chap46 maybe foreshadowed something like that.
    ```
