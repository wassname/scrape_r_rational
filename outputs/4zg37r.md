## [Challenge Companion] Underground

### Post:

**This is the challenge companion thread. Post comments, ideas, or recommendations below.**

This is a fairly wide-ranging topic, so there's not much for me to say on the subject. I think my favorite books that took place underground were the *Wool* series by Hugh Howey. In stories that take place mostly or entirely underground, I think the isolation and oppressiveness is what I live most; an underground civilization is mostly stuck where it is and dug in tight, only occasionally peeking up at the surface or making a nighttime raid.

Of course there are many stories which take place underground and aren't about underground civilization, just about drilling down for science or mining, or exploring caves. I've done a bit of urban spelunking, which always gave me a wonderful sense of peering at the unseen underbelly of the city. It can be kind of disappointing to realize that the underbelly is mostly waterways, but at the same time it's neat to think that this enormous system was built to serve a vital function that you never need to think about.
