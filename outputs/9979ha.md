    I wonder what some of those spikes re from. The one in September seems especially odd to me.

    I *don't* wonder about a few of those spikes. I don't think it's much of a coincidence that this sub gets a lot more views when MoL updates.

      I still find it depressing how hardly anyone else reads rational fiction. Are there any other fiction genres that are this obscure? You'd think someone would have popularized the genre by now by publishing a good non-fanfic work offline. There are a lot of genuinely intelligent people out there who would undoubtedly enjoy reading stories with genuine portrayals of intelligence. It's one of my biggest passions and I can't talk about it with ANYONE out in the real world. 


      :(

        It might not be called rational fiction, but any work with good enough worldbuilding is 3/4 of the way there. I would argue that the most popular rational story is The Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss. Otherwise, we have many stories that try to be intelligent, some of which succeed, some of which don't. They're not generally found in the fantasy genre though.

          The Kingkiller Chronicles are pretty far from rational...

      I think I can mention my experience, since I joined around September:

      I found Mother of Learning trough a friend recommending it to me last year. After reading the whole thing, I went to tv troupes to see if I could find a few new troupes to search other works from. That in turn netted me the "RationalFic" troupe that mention one other fic (HPMOR) that I've read before and has this sub linked on the description. One glance at the sub wiki recommended list was more than enough to convince me that this was what I was looking for.

  Sadly I don't think the number of active subscribers is increasing. This is just a way of eyeballing if active subscribers is increasing, but the most recent top-all-time posts on this sub are all at least two months old until you go a fair way down. And the only two things that are highly upvoted lately are Worth the Candle updates and Mother of Learning updates.

  So, does anyone else want to raise an army of our subscribers, invade a small, helpless country, and install a utopian government in our image?

  ...

  No? Just me?

  Well, I guess I'll wait until 20,000...

    Conquests are a lot of work, couldn't we just pool money and hire someone else to enact the takeover?

      Well to be fair running a country would probably be a bit beyond us, but we could probably set up a pretty crackerjack municipal government.

      Hypothetically, if someone would be interested for that position, what would the application process itself be?
