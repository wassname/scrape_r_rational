    Making mistakes and being rational aren't contradictions, they're almost orthogonal. Making the same mistakes repeatedly without learning from them would be irrational, though not unexpected.

      Rational protagonists can be irrational as well. If they make the same specific mistake because of a character flaw, it gives room for growth and development.

    You nearly had me, and now I'm just leery as fuck.  I'll check it out!

    Decent enough. Hate the start with the literal "record scratch You may be wondering how I got here..." in the first chapter. Seems neat enough to continue, little worried how often you're gonna repeat the MC telling themselves about their "master class in snark" and hopefully the chemistry with the kid that saved them doesn't devolve to the two of them speaking to each other in pure 'snark' and 'banter' because that gets old and tends to make the non-MC seem less like a person and more like a stand in hype man to show off how funny and clever the MC is.

    Look forward to more!

  These chapters are kinda short, especially with us seemingly only getting them once a week.

  That aside, I'm really liking the story so far. It's giving me *major* KUSOMEGA vibes with the way that a lot of these concepts work, was that story an inspiration, or is it just a coincidence? 

  Either way, can't wait to read more.

  From Ch. 2:

  > “Grennick! What does the Inspector say about his Rank and Level?”  
  >  
  > Mr. Interrogator’s monocle began glowing a deep green. “Low stats, hardly any STR… It’s just a Stone-rank!” 

  Is this a Nappa scouter meme?

    Why are people talking in abbreviations like 'STR'?

  Neat explanation for language being the same. If her hypothesis is correct I would expect to see memes here, but maybe in a weird form if they don’t have internet. That might be too small a cultural element though.

    It's an interesting parallel development to the mememtic stuff late in _Tiraas: The Gods Are Bastards_.

  Uhh, why is "the collective subconscious" the first explanation she would get to? I would have imagined something more mundane, like contamination from other cross-world travelers (since we already established that it is possible).

    Chapter One:

    > “Who?” And then she laughed. “Oh, you mean the old Earth legend! No, that’s all fake. Earth humanity’s collective psychic subconscious wasn’t well developed enough two thousand years ago to be in tune with the shape of the greater multiverse. Only the major religions from the last, let’s say, five hundred years, are even remotely close to true.”
    >
    > “Uh… Earth doesn’t exactly have any major religions much newer than two thousand years old…”

    ...

    > “Whoa.” I suddenly remembered Seriphen’s earlier allusion to “Earth humanity,” the implication being that there were humans on other planets. Wait, not just other planets—she said “reborn in,” as opposed to “reborn on.” She was using ‘world’ as a synonym for ‘universe.’
    > 
    > And then I realized she had casually stated that humanity has a collective psychic subconscious, and people have auras that can be read, and clearly people also have souls, because holy shit, there’s an afterlife after all, and I was suddenly starting to realize just how deep into the rabbit hole I already was. It was overwhelming in the best way possible.

    It's the first explanation she turns to because it's something that the reincarnating goddess said exists.

      Oh good point, I had already forgot about that.
