  I think it would be cool, but let's not pretend the Orville writers actually put that much effort into the plot part of their stories. Isaac spends 700 years as an advisor in an alternate universe and comes back completely unchanged.

  I think one interesting path this could take is that after becoming familiar enough with all the biological life that currently exists (within easy Quantum drive range at least) to reach diminished returns on further study instigating the creation of novel biological life might be the easier source of new research materials.

  and then mass effect.
