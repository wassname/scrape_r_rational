  This is an old chapter rewritten. I knew reading it that I had actually read it before.

    It is. I did put that in the author's note.

    > Readers from a while back will notice that they've seen this chapter before. It's been polished up and made a bit nicer but the details are largely unchanged. You don't need to re-read it if you have before, though it should be noticeably better this time around.

    Edit: I suppose I cannot complain, I have skipped enough author's notes myself.
