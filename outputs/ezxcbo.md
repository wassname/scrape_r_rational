  So I don't really know much about Hune, the only notable thing being that she's an ogre (don't know what ogres look like other than being large) and isn't part of Cat's inner circle (or what's left of it).

  From what I do remember she wasn't too thrilled with dying for another woman's dream, and just wanted to finish her service in the imperial army and leave to do her own thing. This was back when cat was still with the empire, so I'm not what made her decide to continue following cat so loyally? Can anyone recap Hune's journey?

    I think Hune was mostly just a general. She's intelligent, capable, and has roots with Cat going back to Legion training. She doesn't particularly like Cat and wasn't drawn into her band of followers, but she's a capable soldier and strategist. Pretty sure she's just doing her job regardless of who is in charge of the army.

    Yeah, I've wondered about her for a while. I mean, the girl straight up told Cat she didn't think much of her and didn't care about her cause, and yet Cat trusted her enough to potentially appoint her as Marshall of Callow when she was mad at Juniper.

    Maybe she's in it for the money? A general's pay has to be pretty good.

  Apparently I formatted the last entry incorrectly, so upon request I have updated it to match previous updates.

  Personally, I like this update. The politics of the Terms and the Truce are already being explored, and there are some deeply personal moments for character building.  


  Edit: There is a bonus chapter as well; don't forget to click through to Kingfisher I.

  Kingfishers daddy is a real piece of work. Will be fun to see how he dealt with the man.

    Did the Kingfisher Prince get his name when he charged the undead dragon? If DK had any part to play, I'm going to be extremely suspicious.

  All of the tension and life of this story had been drained out for me because of this two year time skip. 

  There were so many things set up to come to a head:

  Heroes and villains finally getting started on working together. 
  The grand alliance and dwarven and drow nations poised  to strike at the dead king together. 
  Malicia mind jacking the legions and setting a trap for black. 
  Black heading to Praes as a claimant to the tower.
  The 3 month cease fire with the dead king coming to an end. 
  Unstable politics in Procer, Callow, Praes, and the Free Cities. 
  Twilight ways just got made and had yet to be used against the dead king in a major way. 
  Cat is planning "something" for Akua.

  CAT HAVING AN INCIPIENT NAME!!!

  And so much more. But then we just skip... two... years? Two utterly unremarkable years of campaign against the dead king. 

  What happened to cat's Name? What did the drow and dwarves do for two whole years? Tombmaker promised to kick down Keters door by some deadline, and we're two years closer to that. Why hasn't Akua gotten her just deserts? Black went to Praes to do... politics?... for two years?

  The dead king is supposed to be incredibly genre savvy. How is he bogged down in a two year stalemate as the only opponent of a grand alliance/crusade? Is malicia defeated so thoroughly that her only contribution is some barely mentioned lines about politics in the free cities?

  And what about the Bard? Effectively gone from the story. She does absolutely nothing for two years, so she either works on a timescale that makes her no longer a relevant threat for the remainder of this story,  or she's been doing background stuff this whole time and is going to Deus ex Machina her way cheaply back into the story. 

  Two entire years where it seems like none of the conflicts have progressed appreciably.

    So, because I'd estimate that people who don't like something are more likely to write a comment than those who do, I'll say that APGtE still consistently makes some of my days a little bit brighter, and that I like the current book a lot.
