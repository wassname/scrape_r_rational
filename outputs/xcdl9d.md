## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I'd [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/x9wakv/d_friday_open_thread/inqokfp/) wanting to recommend the fanfic [Pound the Table](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pound-the-table-an-x-men-self-insert.951637/#post-77387485), a legal drama set in the Marvel comic universe. The author is ~~an attorney~~ a recent law grad waiting for Bar Exam results, and each arc of the story focuses on a specific court case while more typical Marvel plots unfold in the background. The provided blurb is:

  >"If you have the facts on your side, pound the facts. If you have the law on your side, pound the law. If you have neither the facts nor the law, pound the table."

  >Mutant law was an emergent field, more or less the wild west of the legal profession, and on a good day, you're lucky if the law and facts aren't all dead-set against you. And when your list of recurring clients includes the Wielder of Cerebro and the Master of Magnetism?

  >Well... suffice to say, there is plenty of pounding the table to be done.

  And the [tvtropes summary](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PoundTheTable) reads:

  >Finding oneself transported into a fictional universe is hard enough, especially when it's the Marvel Universe. Being thrown into the Marvel Universe in the 80s, decades earlier than you were born, is even worse. Add in being a mutant on top of all of that? Not fun.

  >So what do you do? Join the X-Men, and become a protector of the world, trying to change the way people view your kind? Join Magneto, and fight to make the world accept mutants or else?

  >Well, if you're Noa Schaefer, the answer is neither: you get your law degree, become a legal representative, and fight for the rights of other mutants like yourself from the courtroom.

  I've read through the end of Arc 1 found it to be quite the page turner! Have also learned a number of fun facts about how criminal trials are conducted, both woven throughout the narrative and in Authors' Notes / brief educational digressions. Personally I prefer its handling of these knowledge drops to that of many "rational*ist*" fics, but that may just be due to my own personal familiarity with the topics covered (I know very little about US law). Characters also behave realistically given their motivations and backgrounds, drawn from the authors' own experiences inside and outside the courtroom.

  I wasn't as into it for the first few chapters of exposition etc. but found it picked up once the court case got rolling. Recommend you read through Chapter 4 or 5 to see if it jives. Writing quality is quite good, too!

    Second pound the table, I really like the verisimilitude for both the legal world (particularly the IBM case of throwing millions of words of documents at the other team to "wait out the clock" on a court case basically creating the ultra-well paid field of modern Big Law) as well as Ashkenazi culture
    ```

  Some stuff I've read over the past few months that I'd like to recommend:


  [Covenant of Steel](https://www.goodreads.com/series/310529-covenant-of-steel) trilogy(low fantasy, high medieval, first person POV, 2/3 books published) by Anthony Ryan:

  Alwyn, a young cutthroat bandit part of a "merry" band of thieves led by an enigmatic and charismatic figure(very much so a deconstruction of the Robin Hood myth), gets betrayed and sets out on a path of vengeance. 

  I've been following this author ever since he released the excellent Blood Song(and soured on him when the sequels didn't live up to the quality of the first. It still holds up well as a standalone book, though). This series is the first of his since then that I'm actually excited by, and so far it's been tracking an inverse trajectory from his first, improving rather than worsening with each installment. 

  The first book was decent, but I was not particularly taken by it, especially not the setting/worldbuilding. It seems too much like a high medieval setting(think robin hood, england/france in the perioud around the crusades), with nothing really setting it apart. The second book was where the scope broadened and it all started to come together, and once it did the sequel rose head and shoulders above the first in every aspect. The ending especially was great, a huge reveal that completely upends the established dynamics. 



  [Artifact Space](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/56097208)(
  Hard SF, far future, space opera-ish) by Miles Cameron: 

  A desperate orphan girl with nothing to lose scams her way onboard one of the legendary Greatships, the lifeblood of trade in human civilization. 

  Starts out character driven and becomes largely plot driven by the end. Reminds me of classic, old school scifi that I used to love, where despite every aspect of the setting being clearly meant as social commentary of one kind or another, it feels exploratory rather than moralistic. I liken it to an enthusiast tinkering with the settings in order to see what the result would be. He takes current trends, beliefs, and extrapolates what they would be like into the far future. 

  If you like this book, his other works are also all at minimum good, particularly the Master and Mages trilogy(which I've recommended here many times). 

  [Chasing Dragons](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13377244/1/Chasing-Dragons)(ASoIaF , 700k words, Canon divergence/kingdom building, in progress) by MarshalofMontival: 

  After Robert's Rebellion is won, Lyanna is dead and Rhaegar has escaped across the narrow sea. Rather than take up the crown, Robert gives up the crown to his brother Stannis so he and Ned can chase after him and kill the last of the dragonlords for good. 

  I've only recently started to read ASoIaF fics, and most i've tried are absolutely terrible, mostly because so much of it is contrived wish fullfilment or wholly focused on shipping two chracters together. And even the rare parts when it's not one of these things, they try to do dozens of POVs like GRRM and fail horribly. Chasing Dragons is one of the few fics I've read(of any fandom) that has dozens of POVs, no clear main character and still manages to have a functioning plot and distinct character arcs. It's very impressive. 

  Unlike in canon, the story focuses on the strategic and tactical aspect of naval and land battles intensely. While GRRM tended to gloss over or cut away from battles, MarshalofMontival bases most of the story around it. In fact, it's pretty clear that the author is a history/war buff and much of his writing reflects that, (mostly) for good, but some small details of worldbuilding are taken from our world rather than George's and it shows. But that's quibbles from a lore nerd, overall the story is great and I recommend it to anyone who 

  [Dragons of Ice and Fire](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8346424/chapters/19120927)(ASoIaF, 800k+, Canon divergence/kingdom building/grimdark, abandoned) by Serpentguy: 

  The divergence is that Jon Snow awakens an ice dragon beyond the wall during the great ranging, might seems a bit wish fullfilment and contrived, but the story overall is anything but, it does it's work making every character earn their good fortune, and does not pull its punches towards Jon or anyone. 

  The overall quality of prose, characterization, plotting, and worldbuilding is what sets this fic apart, and why I read it to the end in spite of not generally liking grimdark stuff. Despite the fact it diverges significantly from the books and focuses on battles and particularly magic much more than canon, it does so in ways that are plausible and organic. It does not feel tacked on at all. 

  A lot of serpentguy's worldbuilding makes so much sense that I would be surprised if it wasn't close to what george has planned. He also matches a lot of GRRM's style better than any other author has ever managed, imo. His only major writing flaw is the pacing during climactic parts. I'm fine with slow pacing most of the time, but some climactic set-pieces are dragged out over tens of thousands of words and changing POVs and it was just too much, I just wanted to know what the hell was going to fucking happen already. Still, that's a testament to how he's able to set up stakes and narrative tension. 

  There is more railroading and idiotball moments than I'm comfortable with, but that's a consequence of the ambitious scope that he applied to the magic in the setting. Yes, the characters could have munchkinned skinchanging way better, if only to communicate instantaneously, yes the dragon is underutilized, and so on. Despite those flaws, despite not knowing that it was abandoned going in, I still think it's one of the best written fics in the fandom.

    I recently started listening to the first audiobook in the Bobiverse series, not sure if I've seen it recommended here before. It is I think at least rational-adjacent, and is based on one of the more popular ideas in the community - people being cryogenically preserved after death and being revived in the future. In the series, 21st century Bob is revived in 22nd century and uploaded to a probe being sent to explore the near universe, and it is imo somewhat reminiscent of the martian, though with less hard science. The book is not taking itself too seriously, but so far it is nice.

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
        ```
        As a counter point, while I agree that the early portions are perhaps the strongest, and the portion you describe is the weakest, I enjoyed the full series up through the most recent book. It perhaps doesn't maintain the initial quality, but it's not bad by any means.
        ```

      - u/GrizzlyTrees:
        ```
        Too bad, I'm only in the middle of the first book, and have been hoping for a strong trilogy. Well, thanks for saving me the money on the next two books.
        ```

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      I would have to say the first book is the weakest, by book 2 it settles into what most the rest of the series is. I'd still recommend it. 

      I will warn though that Bob never really utilizes his ability to Fork or exponentially scale up his manufacturing capacity. Even after a few decades, which is frustrating. He should have a full Dyson swarm in his own systems without Humans, but he just never does.
      ```

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        >He should have a full Dyson swarm in his own systems without Humans

        iirc this was somewhat addressed in canon:

        - Resource scarcity. Now I'm not sure how realistic this is, but in the books it's explicitly mentioned that some systems have lots of easily minable high-value resources and others don't, either being nearly completely stripped or requiring extraction from thick atmosphere deep gravity well locations. Bob often skips these sparse systems, leaving only an Auto factory and returning decades or so later for a reasonable stockpile to have been built up

        - Logistics is not automatic. Despite being digital and capable of personal time acceleration, Bob is not really an AI and the AIs in the story (notably Guppy) are not fully capable of handling every task without assistance, intervention, and oversight. Traditional Von-Neumann swarms often handwave this issue away, but with scaling manufacturing, logistics difficulty increases too. While an individual (motivated) Bob can handle quite a workload when push comes to shove, anything approaching "large scale" would likely result in Bobs that are Managers of other Bobs or even Managers of Managers, which is explicitly not something Bob wants to do or be. Imagine being "born" just to help manage supply chains. 

        - Operational security risk. Remember that when a Bob splits, the copies maintain all of the originals' thoughts, fears, and passwords, despite having some personality drift that might cause them to change their opinion. This makes creating copies dangerous, especially if one has strong feelings about a certain issue, and as such, Bobs that are working on something secretive or controversial might not want to split

        - Most Bobs are at least somewhat uncomfortable with duplicating
        ```

        - u/RetardedWabbit:
          ```
          >Resource scarcity.

          This is very weak in my opinion. The only scarce resource should be energy, therefore unless there's other reasons to preserve things everything should be refined/built to the utmost by default.

          I mean, I'd prefer to build with concrete so of course I'd start with that but once I run out I'd still use brick, then rock, earth etc.
          ```

          - u/Izeinwinter:
            ```
            Energy isn't scarce. Especially not in space. Any fixed-orbit station anywhere near a sun can set up mirrors and radiators and hey, always-on basic heat engine.  Solar cells are in fact quite a lot harder to make... but you do not need them. Just very well sealed plumbing so your working fluid doesn't bleed away.
            ```

    Your best bet for finding niche recommendations is probably to ask after specific fandoms or maybe genres.

    My go-to weird recs are *Shinji and Warhammer 40,000* (Evangelion/40k, dead) and *Postnuptial disagreements* (Fate/Sekirei, complete). Both quite expansive.

    I could also try to give more niche *Harry Potter*, *Worm*, or even *Naruto* recs, but you’d have to narrow it down. There’s just too much content in those fandoms.

    Oh, and how could I forget *At the End of All Things*, a Silmarillion fanfic by lintamande that is one of the most achingly beautiful fics I’ve ever read. I can only hope they come back from writing glowfic to finish it...someday.

    A Song for Two Voices. A complete rationalist rewrite of the The Last Herald-Mage. Knowledge of canon isn't needed. Epilogue recently began so you may have seen those posts, but otherwise I don't see it talked about much.

    And just in case we have different ideas about what the common /r/r fics are, here is a list of all the ones I can think of.

    HPMoR, Metropolitan Man, Worth the Candle (and AW's other works under his own name and pseudonym), Animorphs: The Reckoning, UNSONG, To The Stars (kinda), Pokemon Origin of Species.

    There's a ton of great glowfic. But its glowfic! So it needs a lot of disclaimers and discovery is bad and it has weird pre-reading reqs. Take for example this bog-standard isekai. https://glowfic.com/posts/3866  

    Except, you know, its written by Alicorn and Eliezer, so it just blows its competition out of the water. And its **unfinished** and will never get there. 

    Here's a gem by Apprenticebard: https://glowfic.com/posts/2371  and it'd *probably* work as a standalone but it could also do with 3 paragraphs of explanation beforehand! Or a single 100k story! It unfinished,  but at a extremly satisfying endpoint.
    ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      Lots of glowfic (including your first example) is great on setting but kind of meh on characterization. (Not surprising given the format; if you're roleplaying, your goal is to take reasonable in-character actions, not to put each other in situations that showcase major character traits.)

      I feel like one of the big exceptions to that is the [with the time that is given to us](https://glowfic.com/boards/111) continuity. Blurb:

      > if you've been waiting for a silmarillion/buffy the vampire slayer crossover where celegorm is the sunnydale high gym teacher and maglor is a catholic priest then oh boy is this the continuity for you

      This is specifically the [At The End of All Things](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3451040/chapters/7569143) version of Silmarillion.
      ```

    - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
      ```
      Can anyone explain what glowfic is, exactly? I tried following your link to the first one, and it's just like a bunch of forum posts? It seems hard to read.
      ```

      - u/Luonnoliehre:
        ```
        It's a collaborative fiction where usually two authors post back and forth, each controlling different characters. I also find it hard to read and from what I can tell, they are extremely slow paced.
        ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        Its a novel collaborative literature form, whereby two or more people write posts in an old forum style. Often trading each others off in dialogue or posing challenges (she attacks you suddenly with a spear!) but also sometimes a single author will "monologue" to set up a larger hook or worldbuilding or play out a concrete scenario they have in mind. 

        The 2000s forum style leads to usage of "facecasts" for characters; an actress might have 10 different expessions to add mimic to any specific posts (Surprised expression! Smug! Scared!). 

        Common themes:  there is wild worldbuilding going on, often alternate earths, star trek universes, different magic systems (runs on pain! runs on wishes! runs on benevolent but alien sapient magic! Avatar 4 elements style! Create matter from nothing!), deities, powerful magical beings. Protagonists are often thrown into another world and find that their specific magic system can help solve a rampant problem; glowfics are often fixfics. 

        Once one set of protagonists is established, they'll often feature in multiple, different threads (Spock in old myth greece! Spock in Star Wars! Spock in Animorphs!). 

        Two very common worlds are Ardas (Silmarillion story in lord of the rings universe, 7000 years before LOTR, centered around the Feanorians/Silmarills/Morgoth) and Daevinity setting by Lintamande. The foundational short story for Daevinity can be found here and is worth a read either way.

      **[Message in a Bottle](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/368986/message-in-a-bottle)**: Surprisingly hard sci-fi. Main Character is a linguist, and part of a human space exploration mission.

MC is suffering from a condition where nobody can remember her, and which traps her in the town of Ponyville. She's essentially an antimeme, if you happen to know what that means. The quality of this story is particularly good.

      **[The Best Night Ever](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7523099/1/The-Best-Night-Ever)**: Groundhog Day-style timeloop. Has a sequel I never read.

      **[The Moon's Apprentice](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice)**: Sci-fi. After being rejected by Celestia, Nightmare Moon seeks out Twilight in her dreams and takes her as an apprentice instead. To free her, Twilight must seek out the Elements of Harmony. If only Celestia hadn't blasted them into outer space!

      **[Fallout: Equestria](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria)**: Crossover with Fallout 3. Post-apocalyptic, with the main cast investigating what happened to cause the end of the world.

    I absolutely hate these reincarnation dungeon fics. They either are basically wish fulfillment where they beeline an avatar and now they're God or use so much numbers its like I'm staring at the mandatory SEC end of quarter financial report with similar level of literary prose.

    This fic, so far, dumps that nonsense out the window like Putin with his political rivals.

    There's none of that "oh my God I'm not human anymore" cookie cutter angst. This MC's Terminator and their first and only objective is to re-establish contact to continue whatever Terminators do, probably terminating, by any means necessary. There's no token empathy, there's no "oh my God humans, so special". Humans are resources, like grass or trees, and should be harvested as such.

    And best of all. There's none of that fucking blue box table nonsense. If I want to be staring at excel spreadsheets, I can just go back to work.

    It is such a breath of fresh air in this frankly terrible genre. Second only to Chinese cultivation novels (forgot their name).

  hey guys I've recently gotten into pokemon fanfics and I'm looking for more, I've read the Origin of Species, Borne of Caution, Pokemon Trainer Vicky, and Hard Enough, of which the first two are my favorites, and I'm about to begin reading Traveller and then maybe Eldritch. traveler is looking like it may complete my top three but to sum it up I'm looking for long pokemon fanfics that are either finished or regularly updating.

    Ever try Game of Champions? It's the Berserk (maybe Vagabond now?) of the pokemon fanfic world IMO. basically won't ever be finished, but what exists of it is absolutely *unforgettable*

      Yeah, I can't believe they stopped, they then deleted it of ff and it's currently

      It's a rare breed, it somehow expands the pokemon world to feel limitless while still grounded in reality, while still remaining faithful to the pokemon world. It has actual worldbuilding in a world we already know about. I wish we got the fan treatment of another writer taking it over, but I don't think many authors could've taken it over anyway.

    Pretty good list. Here is a few more.

    **[The Friendly Necromancer](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-friendly-necromancer.86419/)** - Original characters, original region, and definitely the best on this list. Main Character is a Shuppet named Diya who is befriended by a lonely neglected young boy, swearing to go on a grand Pokemon Adventure together... shortly before the boy freezes to death. Evolving into a Banette from the grief, Diya becomes able to fully possess the boy's body, and swears an oath to fulfill their shared dream on his behalf, and begins their adventure as a weirdo mute non-binary 'psychic' with an affinity for ghost types. It is a sad premise, but the sadness is never overwhelming and Diya quickly finds plenty of good people who support them. On top of the touching emotional narrative, what makes this fic a true gem is the author's incredible skill at fleshing out the setting with all the little details that make it feel like a breathing complex world. 

    **[Pokemon Nephri](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/pokemon-nephri.26061/)** - a SV quest following a new trainer starting on a new adventure with two classmates. Also has an original region, and modifies/expands the lore, with trainers having elemental affinities that affect their personalities, and some very very strange legendaries. MC is also genderfluid, I promise I didn't notice the pattern I was setting until I typed this out. This quest is also incomplete, and hasn't updated in several months, so buyer beware. 

    **[To Live Is To Dream](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/to-live-is-to-dream-sinnoh-pokemon-trainer-quest.979188/)** - A Sinnoh quest on SB following a street urchin trying to get off the street and become a respected pokemon trainer. The protagonist is the strong point, Mal is super tough, determined, and startlingly empathetic towards those who have suffered like she has. Ongoing and fairly active.

    **[Hyphen](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/hyphen-pokemon-emerald.9539/)** features a Ralts MC passing herself off as a human so she can become a trainer and protect her home. Specifically based off of Pokemon Emerald. 

    **[Dreaming of Family](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13202202/1/)** is flawed, but does certain things very well. In particular, it actually pulls off large-scale battles with full teams worth of Pokemon fighting simultaneously. Infrequently updating, but there's enough there to make for a satisfying read regardless.

  A couple recommendations and a request.

  **Recomendations:**

  I recently read [Piranesi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50202953-piranesi) by Susannah Clarke. It has a somewhat predictable plot, but it's such a *nice* and *comfy* ride the entire way through that I was enthralled. Piranesi is about the titular character Piranesi, who lives in a house with infinite hallways full of statues, some broken down and some pristine. The hallways sometimes flood, bringing in new wildlife. The story is told in diary format from Piranesi's perspective, as he explores the house and finds new and interesting things in it. In its core it's a story about self-actualization, but the mystery aspect of what the house is and has is handled excellently. The characters are as well done as they need to be, because this is not a tragedy or a psychological thriller. I found Piranesi himself to be such a font of optimism and positivity that it brightened my own days. Overall I would highly recommend it. 

  I recently also read [Fire Punch](https://www.viz.com/shonenjump/chapters/fire-punch?locale=en), a manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto, and whoo boy was this something. I think that this story will drive away a lot of people due to some (admittedly) big issues, but if you can look past them or take them at face value the story becomes both very enjoyable and *very good*. Firstly, this story has a lot of sexual violence. The setting is sort of the logical extreme of what a Mad Max type world would look like, except set in an ice age esque winter instead of  desert. People do awful things for good reasons, for bad reasons, or for no reason at all. This results in a lot of male side characters being token rapists, and a lot of female characters becoming (almost) victims. Is it handled poorly? Yes. I would say that the threat of sexual assault is used to sell the tone of the world, and show how shit it is, and I took it to be that way (and no deeper) when I read it. But it will probably drive away a lot of people who aren't into that type of weak reasoning. Secondly, Fire Punch is *weird.* By the first chapter the protagonist's sister wants to fuck him. One of the main characters follows the protagonist around to film him and make a movie about it. There are some people who just walk around almost naked, and nobody questions them on it. Sometimes it does feel a bit like the author is just throwing the whole kitchen sink of ideas into the story and seeing what comes out, but I will say that it all feels purposeful. In a way that I haven't seen in manga before. The story almost hit the limit of my tolerance for abstract weirdness, but I think that elevated it. 

  So what's actually good about it? The paneling in the manga is impeccable. It feels cinematic almost, like the manga is a really detailed storyboard of an arthouse film. Some of the ways the mangaka can move instantly from action to result feels explosive. Chapter 1 itself is a really good example of it, and a small taste of what you'll see later on. The characters are also very well done. The dialogue is snappy and actually pretty funny sometimes, and then the author suddenly changes to an emotional character moment and it feels natural. The characters are all insane in unique ways, but the author still finds a way to humanize them without being im14andthisisdeep about it, except when he wants to be im14andthisisdeep, lol. Which is another thing. The story sort of feels like it exists on this level of parody and irony when it's not being sincere, almost like the author is cheekily using typical manga tropes but then twisting it in a way you haven't seen before in manga. Which is why I think I could look past the sexual violence, and the cartoonish evilness of some scenes and characters. They are often used to be an allegory of some facet of human nature, but then when you think the author is being serious about the allegory he pulls back the curtains and throws a curveball, because he knows you aren't stupid. And it's the same with the powers and fights. There are no mid battle monologues, except when it would be funny to have one. Most powers get a couple sentences of description and then he shows how the characters smartly (or dumbly) use their powers. The protagonist's power is regeneration, and then when he gets set on eternal fire he punches other people (while being on fire) to spread his eternal fire to them, and eventually kill them. Thus, Fire Punch. 

  Overall, this was a 9 or a 9.5/10 for me, but it might be much lower for you if you can't look past the issues or aren't on board with the author's brand of caricature and parody. I'd say give chapter 1 a try, and if it's for you continue. It's a wild and fun ride.

  **Request:**

  Are there any stories that use regeneration as a power as creatively as Fire Punch? Seriously, I feel like fiction authors are way more conservative about how they write regeneration based powers. In Fire Punch, regeneration is used to:

  * Provide human meat for a whole village's sustenance

  * During battle people shed body parts like extra weapons. From throwing their own arms and legs to throwing whole heads somewhere else to regenerate the full body from the head at a different location. 

  * The protagonist gets set on eternal fire and thus he keeps regenerating while burning. This makes him a weapon of mass destruction, since the fire he's on can spread very quickly. 

  * It's used as a character exploration device for some people: from how it affects you over time to how it can enforce unhealthy body image issues or provide avenues of escaping them. This is something I've seen done for other powers but not regeneration. 

  The only story that gets close is Zombie Knight Saga, where almost everyone with powers can respawn from death and regenerate quickly, and it's actually used pretty creatively.
  ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
    ```
    The regeneration thing reminds me of a character from the webcomic [Strong Female Protagonist](https://strongfemaleprotagonist.com/), where a regenerator tries to imagine the most good she can do with her power, and decides that becoming a steady source of donated organs is worth more than continuing to participate in superheroics.
    ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    I read fire punch because it's from the chainsaw man author, and it's just insane. Things just escalate to points you wouldn't even imagine and it's all ok because it doesn't take itself too seriously. 

    &#x200B;

    It's funny I used to think manga was a dying medium and that japan couldn't produce anything good anymore, but this new generation of mangakas are knocking it out of the park. 

    &#x200B;

    The mangas look like they should be crap but they innovate, twist and optimize previous tropes so well it's impressive how good they can get. I honestly didn't think it was possible.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Manga was never dying, it's just that most of the popular mainstream recommended stuff tended to be kind of shit, and still are. People copy what becomes popular, and when those works become popular people copy those, leading to an endless cycle of people being inspired by the same shit over and over again and never looking outside of their echo chamber of harem isekai op protagonist bullshit, or any other equivalent in romance or adventure or slice of life genres. I think this is the case for most media out there, from fiction to tv shows to slam poetry. The more popular something gets the more it homogenizes, but as the popularity grows so do the highs and lows. The highs get higher *and* come more often, as has been the case for recent Shonen Jump stuff, where it seems like they're hitting banger after banger. 

      Before Fire Punch there was Ajin, and Akumetsu, and Freesia, and Homunculus. There was Oyasumi Punpun, Slam Dunk, Nana, March Comes in Like a Lion, and so many more. A lot of them don't hit the critical mass of a following to break through to the top, but doesn't mean there isn't good stuff hiding underneath the popular stuff.

    ```
    Ctrl+Alt Del has a reboot where one of the protagonists has respawning as a superpower.

    Captain Jack Harkness is known for being an immortal regenerator, as in being buried alive, being skinned for meat, etc.

    Tbh Jack Harkness and the protagonist of Fire Punch have a lot in common in my opinion.

    Bones of Black Marrow on Ao3 is a Homestuck fanfic that doesn't require any prior familarity and is very inventive, both in the sex scenes but also in how they're presented, like a porn parody of House of Leaves.

  I just read [Nona the Ninth](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58662507) by Tamsyn Muir, the latest and penultimate book in the Locked Tomb trilogy (the first is [Gideon the Ninth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth)).

  While I wouldn't call it rational fiction, though it's very well written and I love it a lot, there is a part of it that particularly piques my rational-fic-loving side. Specifically, God. But God is a guy... a guy who gained necromantic powers millennia before the start of the series, somewhen in a rather near-future-looking Earth, where catastrophes both man-made and not were destroying the human race. He was a researcher in cryogenics whose funding got cut while the ultra-wealthy scrambled to escape on generation ships, leaving the masses behind. But the lights went out and the dead bodies he was testing... stayed stable. 

  He thought he could save the world but the world's people really, really resisted saving. This part actually felt the most realistic to me after these past few years. Is it rational? Maybe not, but are real people?

  Everyone died. He brought some back - they started worshipping him. And he's very, very mad at those who ran away.

  (I'm purposefully leaving out tons. I think this is enough information to still enjoy it)

  The series is not about God (or, as fans call him, Jod). It's about the characters that live on a tiny dead planet centuries later, who worship him as god-emperor. Some have shadows of his necromantic power. Some are just really good at bashing heads in. The books are about them. Which is good, they're really good reads, but honestly the backstory of god is absolutely fascinating and feels like great material for this subreddit.

    Personally, I liked the first book in the series but found the second book didn't hook me, especially as an audiobook. It was confusing, a bit too angst-y, and the plot starting off with the protagonist having wiped their own memories and leaving only cryptic letters to herself (?) was annoying

  **Walking to Aldebaran**  is great, a bit of a mix of the Martian and a horror story.  


  Thats my third Tchaikovsky's book after Dogs of War and Bear Head, and I can definitely say that:  


  \- the guy can write really well, both from technical perspective and entertainment angle

  \- he can do xenofiction well

  \- he can write rationally

  Recently someone mentioned that denial was out of hiatus. Seems like it is back in hiatus again which saddens me greatly.

  I'm dying for some more cosmic/Lovecraftian horror. Manga, novels, podcasts, anything I can get.

  I've listened to and enjoyed: Magnus Archives, Old Gods, Malevolent, Call of the Void, The Storage Papers, The Town Whispers, The Left-Right Game, Lovecraft Investigations, Mistholme, Archive 81. Ai Am In Eskew, The Milkman of St Gaffs

  I did not enjoy: Limetown, The Black Tapes, The White Vault, Video Palace, A Scottish Podcast, Tanis, Knifepoint Horror, Rabbits, Out of Place, Crypto-Z, Don't Mind

  The cosmic horror stuff I've read is too long to list. Just asking for any medium really as I feel I've run out of audiodramas/podcasts for it.
  ```

  - u/Krakenarrior:
    ```
    Since you’ve probably read all of the Lovecraft stories themselves, and I’m guessing you’ve seen Katalpsis recommended, I’m gonna throw out some odd stuff that evoked the same feel:
    Book: 
    [The Night Land](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Land) is free, weird, and definitely fits the cosmic insignificance and horror vibe. Granted the prose is pretty archaic and I found it hard to get through, but the titular Night Land itself is horrifying. 


    Audio:
    I’ve also listened to some of the podcasts you mentioned and I found [The Godfrey Audio Guide](https://thegodfreyaudioguide.com/) which scratched that itch. It really leans into the weird parts of cosmic horror, but the episodes are short so it should be easy to get through and decide if you like it or not.
    ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    [Palus Somni](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25475/palus-somni) is a pretty disturbing horror fic. The world's ended, weird monsters ate everyone outside the walls of the ancient monastery. Then, one of the nuns is found dead, hanging from a tree. The first part reads like a murder investigation, then the horror starts. I think here a warning is in order, the body horror in this gets almost *gratituous* at times.

    Well, what sort of story are you looking for? Books or webfiction specifically? Sci-fi, progression fantasy, wuxia, romance? Something with good prose or good action?

    One of my favorite stories is [Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14201.Jonathan_Strange_Mr_Norrell) by Susanna Clarke. It has imaginative worldbuilding, great prose, and an excellent ending, but some find the first half or so to be a bit dry.

      I'm actually open to both books and webfiction

      I mainly just want something that's rational. Logically consistent story with none of the horrible tropes that would disqualify it from counting as rational.

    You might like Disco Elysium, it's a game but it's like 95% reading, so it'd count I think. You can play the game as rational or irrational as you like, since your stats define how you experience the world. You can be a druggie rockstar who just wants another hit and to sing karaoke to a sad song and bring Disco back, or you can be like Sherlock from the tv show and look at anything and instantly identify its history and physics and other minutiae. The main story is that you're a detective with amnesia who has to solve a murder case. To do that, you explore a city and talk with people to find clues, about both your life and about the murder. Probably one of my favorite games ever.
