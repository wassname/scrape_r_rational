  I'm glad I read that to the end. Until the end of Act One, I was underwhelmed and mentally rehearsing my five-paragraph rant about why the blue pill is the best one... then suddenly the story turned on its head and blew itself out of the water.

    Haha, same here! I realized I was into something awesome when I read 'Act 2'. Until then I was a staunch Blue Pill supporter too.

      I was gonna support Blue Pill until I saw Black Pill's description and laughed at all the other options and the original author putting it at the end.

  ```
  ha, i was just about to post this. looks like i got beaten to the punch.

  and yeah, i would agree that this is scott's greatest fiction. or at the very least, most satisfying; everything was tied together incredibly nicely and there weren't any loose ends, which is pretty rare. also enjoyed the (literal) twist, which was just brilliant.

  edit: this comment from the op -- [I’ve always loved science fiction endings that](#s " result in the defeat of entropy, the final boss of the universe. It has a sense of closure a five million word story might not match. And all we had to do was to convince Redpill to neg entropy.")

    Your final sentence here is the best thing ever, and it should have been a "AND THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS" at the end.  Better Nate than lever!

    "God" and/or the source of the pills seem like pretty huge loose ends. I briefly thought maybe it would end in Black/humanity becoming God, and Yellow's brain having shorted out because of some time paradox/infinite recursion (or total awareness of human suffering or something).

  My first thought on the black pill was that you could do exactly what Harry did in HPMOR, look at the state of the piece of paper in front of you a couple minutes in the future, then write down a version modified by some rule such that the only consistent timeline is if the state of the paper is the answer to your question.

  Scott's ambition for it turned out far grander.
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    The black pill works on a multiple-timeline model. You see a potential future, but if you resolve to do something different, that future won't come true. You couldn't use it to solve NP problems, at least not in the same way.
    ```

    - u/fljared:
      ```
      You could, actually- As long as you changed the answer before it was sent, it could work. You'd have up to X universes where it didn't work (Where X is the number of possible states the answer could be in) and an infinite number of universes with the correct answer. You should get the desired answered nearly all of the time.

      Heh, you'd be brute-forcing the universe.
      ```

    - u/Sinity:
      ```
      Actually I wonder...

      You want to make a binary decision. So you resolve to check option A. Then, future-you writes if it's a success...

      ... but wouldn't he be inclined to *lie*? Because if it's failure, he will cease to exist.
      ```

      - u/Chronophilia:
        ```
        It depends on how you value being retroactively replaced by another version of yourself. Is that death, or self-improvement?
        ```

        - u/Sinity:
          ```
          If mind state is significantly different, I think it's death.

  I enjoyed reading this. In hindsight it’s a bit of a shame that Greenpill was killed so quickly, but I can understand it for narrative reasons.

  The most obviously underpowered person here is Pinkpill. Unlike the red pill you don’t need to be pretty stupid to pick it, since shaking hands before and after a meeting is common practice. This allows you to manipulate pretty much everyone you encounter, so you should be able to work your way to being King William’s rival.

  Graypill made the obvious mistake of being too greedy too soon. His powers could easily be leveraged into something that makes a lot money legitimately.

    > This allows you to manipulate pretty much everyone you encounter

    Only if you're skilled at manipulation yourself. Because if you go around touching rich important people but lose track of all your puppet strings, you may trigger World War III or worse.

  This is probably the best fiction Scott's ever written, and it's just totally wonderful.

    Huh. I was actually thinking that it was the *weakest* (which says more about his other stories than about this story, honestly, because this one isn't crap). 

    Would you mind telling me what you like about it, or maybe what you go for in fiction in general, because this seems like an excellent opportunity to get another point of view on What Makes Fiction Great and suchlike.

  Theory: Red's regeneration was the reason Pink couldn't affect him - every time his brain-state was changed significantly, it snapped back. Possibly also the reason he seemed incapable of character development over several trillion years.

  The most interesting thing about this story I just read was the fact that all of the pills could be used to break physics and indirectly generate energy or break information entropy which is strongly related to energy creation. Except maybe Pink.

  [Red: ](#s "This is the entire ending of the story.")

  [Yellow: ](#s "As a mind-reader, she is capable of instantly gaining information in someone's mind. This violates informational entropy. In fact, this is at the heart of the paradox about [Maxwell's Demon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon), where gaining information about something without spending any energy violates the [Second Law of Thermodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics).")

  [Black: ](#s "He can see the future and this is similar to how Yellow's power breaks information entropy.")

  [Blue: ](#s "As a teleporter, she can go faster than the speed of light and it should be possible to use FLT to create energy.")

  [Green: ](#s "As a shape-shifter, Green can make a perpetual motion machine by becoming an ant where some energy is wasted to lift Green to the top of the wheel, and then Green becomes a blue whale to use the mass being created out of nowhere to generate extra energy.")

  [Grey: ](#s "He can produce electric discharges out of nowhere without using up energy and effortlessly control machines with his mind. This means that he generates infinite energy like Red and changes the information states of the world without using up energy like Yellow and Black.")

  [Orange: ](#s "With super-competence it seems as if it wouldn't be physics breaking, but the problem is in the act of gaining the enhanced competence. Orange gains a large amount of information instantly which violates the laws of thermodynamics, because energy is normally lost in the process of learning/storing information in Orange's brain (even if he doesn't have to worry about mixing up his skills). Orange breaks physics by not losing any energy in the process of learning.")

  [Pink: ](#s "This was the hardest one to figure out, because I can't be sure that the act of making someone fall in love violates any laws, but I thought about it in terms of having someone continually love you, *no matter who you become*. It's a scary power, because it means that you will never fall out of love no matter what kind of person you become years, decades, centuries, or millennia in the future. This means it has to be a continuous effect and makes me think that it breaks something here by being applicable to all possible human brains. Something, something, infinite information, something.")

  Okay, okay, maybe I misspoke when I said that they all could be used to generate energy, but according to the laws of thermodynamics, it breaks physics to be able to do things without any energy cost. Perfect energy efficiency is impossible, otherwise perpetual motion machines would work.

  For interest, the known males are Orange, Black, Red and Grey. The known females are Pink, Blue, and Yellow. I think for gender equality, Green is most likely a female.

    You are talking about some thermodynamic stuff and it's not totally wrong, but it can be made more precise. Also, Physics is harder to break than you may think.

    When you are talking about "energy costs," it isn't exactly clear what you mean. In Thermodynamics, there are many "energy functions," which are often referred to as "free energy." Each of these describes the amount of accessible energy of a system as a function of certain parameters. The common free energy functions are Helmholtz free energy and Gibbs free energy.

    The point is that the important quantity in thermodynamics is really an "accessibility cost" rather than an energy cost.

    The Maxwell's demon paradox does bring attention to the connection between thermodynamical entropy and information (information entropy). However, to get physical implications out of the paradox is somewhat difficult. It's not as simple as, "free information = free energy".

    There are many interpretations of Maxwell's Demon and it remains one of the most contentious thought experiments in Physics cannon. However, Bennett's resolution of the paradox (and I agree with his analysis) is that measurements can be made in principle without any entropy cost (and therefore without any energy cost).

    An older resolution of the paradox (Szilard's) relied on the assumption that measurements increase entropy but I think modern research has overturned them. This implies that mind-reading powers do not violate thermodynamics as they are just another kind of measurement.

    Interestingly, I don't think that Black's powers necessarily violate the second law either. There is a restriction in physics that information cannot be transmitted faster than is prescribed by the light-cone of two events. This is really just a restatement of the special theory of relativity. Of course, Physicists think about how any theory (including relativity) may be violated, but there is no known implication that such a violation would impact thermodynamics. There is actually a paper that considers tachyons (I think called the Tachyon Antitelephone) that rules out any violation of special relativity from first principles. Interestingly, Scott Aaronson has considered the informational dynamics of CTC's (Closed time-like curves) which he interprets as time machines under a self-consistency restriction. He concludes that they would have strong computational powers but not quite godly.

    I was wondering if greenpill could turn you into different looking humans, thus letting you be the ultimate spy, but its never established if its just nonhuman animals or if humans are in there too, or if you have any degree of control over how you look when you transform. If you turn into a cat, do you control the fur colour you end up with?

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:

      Good point, humans are animals too.

      On later consideration, I think a cat or a medium sized dog would be the safest thing to start with.

            Ants can fall at terminal velocity and survive uninjured. I wouldn't risk that, though, in case there are things that eat ants in the air. Tardigrades are pretty impossible to kill, do they have any natural predators? Emergency scenario could be become a tardigrade and wait for things to blow over.

  Surely pink says "can be turned off", not is turned off by retouching.

  So it's a choice. I think that could have been done better. Equally pink suddenly becomes "touch bare skin" instead of touch someone. If I grab someone who is wearing clothes, I'm still touching them. You then also totally abuse it by implying love = mind control which is not how love works in the real world.

  Blue for example, it doesn't say instant so you would expect that travelling to Alpha Centurai would take at least light years, so when he came back time would have passed. However you don't do that, so really the obviously solution to negative entropy was him.

  Also the shapeshifter guy, shape shift into ant, or something like that, easily avoid death. Or like a dinosaur of some sort. He was also available for abuse.

  So overall great, but pink was a real let down there, especially considering the really interesting ways you can go with that.
  ```

  - u/AppleJuiceBoxes:
    ```
    In bold defense of Pink!

    Yes, Pink's description notes that it "can be turned off", which is a very *helpful* little clause that I'm pretty sure Scott Alexander, of all people, noticed.

    Either he chose to blatantly ignore it and at the end, Red just learns to love Pink on his own, OR he subtly implies with the below quote (which might also have just been a joke of little importance) that Pink was just discovering that her power had always been so much cooler than she ever realized.

    > It took them a few hours of fawning over each other before she realized that nothing had happened when she touched him a second time. Something something true love something the power was within you the whole time?

    Maybe!

    I also find the power interesting if Pink *doesn't* have the ability to touch her love-slaves. Perhaps God, the creator of the pills, would rather she not used her God-given gifts for intercourse?

    Maybe!

    Anyways, next you have to define 'touch.' If you grab someone's clothing, you could say you're touching the person, but you could also say that you're merely touching fabric. If you grab someone's bare skin, you could say you're touching a 'person' or you could say you're just touching dead skin. Even if you touch someone's brain, God seems to exist in this universe, so you might not be *technically* touching a person because the brain does not *necessarily* have to hold the soul. If a soul contains who a person really is, you might not be able to touch a person at all, because of a soul's nonphysical nature.

    Sidenote: Even if touching skin wasn't required, one of the things that makes Black insanely powerful is that he can easily find out the specifics of powers by strongly precommitting to a course of action and seeing how the future looks then. If clothing didn't work, he wouldn't have done it in the first place. He would have just told Pink about his power and that if she tried to touch him, he would know beforehand and taze her into submission without warning.

    I would also argue that a strong enough love is functionally equivalent to mind control. Think wireheaded patients, fighting to be stimulated again. Except Pink's victims instead have a strong desire to make their mistress happy.
