## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Askreddit thread: [You can either get $10,000 right now or $100 every time someone lies to you for the next 2 years. Which do you choose?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h8p0kl/you_can_either_get_10000_right_now_or_100_every/)

  If 100$ appears in your hand every time an untruth is directed at you, you have the ability to be an actual lie detector. I think you could probably make money with this even if you *lost* 100$ with each lie.

    Do the lies have to be to you specifically/directly? If not I'm pretty sure the average person receives more than a hundred lies a week. Take the $100/lie and uninstall your ad blocker.

    There's also the usual type of oracle hax. Get someone to tell you the Riemann hypothesis is true and see if you get money, etc.

    Obviously choose the $100 per lie. Then get a friend to lie to you constantly. Or just lie to yourself constantly.

    On second thought the $100 per lie might not be a safe option. I'm constantly in denial of many things, and that could be considered lying to myself, so I could potentially drown in all the money that constantly appears.

  Faith.

  You can believe whatever you want, and when you believe, you really believe it, in the deepest and strongest way possible. You can create the exact description of what you want to believe in your mind and then you confirm the belief with the snap of fingers, and next second you really believe it. You just rewrite your brain and memories to think it's true and act on it.

  For example, you can make yourself believe that you just had the perfect day of your life, or that you just returned from Moon trip, anything.

  Of course, you can't gain any outside knowledge this way.

  Would you use this power, and if yes, how? Would you try to use it to attain happines? Success? Knowledge?

    Can I get rid of the false belief after I'm done? If so, there are a few useful applications here in being a better liar or becoming more self confident in situations where that is a useful trait.

    If you can't get rid of it though, that stuff becomes a dangerous double edged knife.

    If it is irreversible and there are ways to verify that you used your powers, people could force you to do a value handshake. So if that is an option, you might be better off making yourself forget you have this power in the first place. 

    As for using it for ignorance is bliss style happiness: Nope, not happening. You live in reality whether you like it or not, closing your eyes doesn't make a bad picture worse, etc.

      >Can I get rid of the false belief after I'm done?

      Sure. If you want to believe A but stop believing it at time T, then make yourself believe "It is *very* important that I make myself believe A and then, at time T, make myself believe not-A."

      Actually, that should work as a general motivation hack.
      ```

      - u/Silver_Swift:
        ```
        Wouldn't that just overwrite one unsubstantiated belief with another?

        For example, before using this power I believe that my social skills are kinda meh, but I don't believe this "in the strongest way possible", there are tons of things that could change my mind.

        After making myself believe my social skills are amazing so I ace a job interview and then making myself believe my social skills are kinda meh again, will it still be as easy to change my mind?

  You have been given the opportunity to give everyone on Earth a superpower with magnitude proportional to a measurable numeric characteristic of each respective person. Ability magnitude is then assigned based on each person's percentile ranking, with bottom 5% receiving hardly any power.    Your goal is to raise global average standard of living. What power, what criteria?
  ```

  - u/Silver_Swift:
    ```
    Can I just give everyone the same powerset by choosing a criterium that is the same for everyone? For instance, what if the criterium is the number of brains the person has? 

    As for power, how about a combination of :

    - Immortallity 

    - The ability to make an extradimensional copy of the planet you are currently on except that it doesn't have any sentient creatures. 

    - The ability to travel to and from any copied world, provided the worlds creator gives permission.
    ```

    - u/MonstrousBird:
      ```
      The problem with giving everyone on earth immortality is that this is a one off opportunity. This might mean that people still have the ability to have children, but only if they want these children to be mortal. I'm not sure I would want to live in a future world with the generation from 2020 (of all years!) as our immortal rulers...

    Super-altruism, proportionate to net worth.

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    I mean, some sort of entropy-breaking energy-for-free scheme probably. Maybe something like "everyone gains the power to draw a loop of roughly 30W @ 3A DC from the eternal elemental plane of electricity; your power rating is how much control you have over it". 

    The criteria doesn't really matter at that point, so you'd probably want to pick something that doesn't drive humanity into weird directions on its own; and in that case, it depends on how the criteria works. If you picked "height", would be recalculated at every moment? Like, would kids have to grow into their control?

    If that's the case I'd probably say something like "number of days older than 14".

    Reality warping, the characteristic is if it's me, if it's me it's 100% and I get reality warping, if it's not me it's 0% so it's no power for anyone else. Then I will use reality warping to up the average standard of living.

    The 'ability' to age faster (Or just die prematurely, Final Destination style). The ability cannot be turned off. The ability manifests in early adulthood and scales with your indifference or desire for other people's suffering.

    If we can finetune it, we could have good people age more slowly, but I don't see any room for a negative power in the rules. Faking empathy doesn't work, because it's based on your internal motivations. Bad people die, including *very* quickly everyone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder.

    Crime goes down, empathy goes up across the board, including in politics. Dictators, selfish career politicians and lobbyists disappear. Fraudulent religious leaders, teleevangelists etc disappear. Cutthroat corporate leaders and 'captains of industry' go away, replaced with less dickish successors.

    It's probably not what you were looking for, but I bet it would work.

        It genuinely didn't occur to me until people here pointed it out. I saw the OP and just wrote down the first idea I had. In retrospect, genocide was a good first try, but not the ideal policy going forward.

        >Seems like a needlessly cruel and evil use of powers

        Yeah, it does occur to me I would not have been among the winners under this particular system. Still, that's a sacrifice I would have been willing to make, and one should generally assume Rawls' Veil of Ignorance when engaging with these thought experiments.

      Interesting though I'm a curmudgeon and find it a bit of a thought police dystopia or mind control tyranny. I want to try it without the assumption that we can get utopia by just killing off enough "bad" people. What do you think of the free market version?

      Metric: your active influence to increase the quality adjusted life years of others.

      Power: regeneration toward your optimal age and fitness: reverses cancers, aging past your own desire, radiation damage, genetic defects ect.

      The more good you do, not feel like doing, or want to do, then the better you get. People who don't make things better will die off in there time, but immortality is possible, will have name recognition and make an example.  People work on thier incentives and this and the re are direct rewards to promoting eusocial outcomes and features to  assist building offworld to avoid a malthusian traps.

      This could be more or less abusable, but it doesn't resort to a dystopian universe acting as thought police, and it acts on effect vice potentially empty intent.

      This seems rather unfair to be honest. People can't really change their internal desires, They can't just arbitrarily decide to want something or not, since a lot of that is very much innate. Otherwise people undergoing torture would just adjust their internal desires to desire being tortured and enjoy the torture.

      Furthermore, just because someone desires something doesn't mean they will act on that desire. Desires can overrule one another. For example, I desire eating lots of snacks, but I also desire not becoming overweight, so I use the latter desire to curb my snacking desire and go on a diet instead.

      In the same way, someone who desires harm upon others could rationally recognize that such desires are harmful to not just others but themselves as well. Then they can use their desire to avoid self-harm to curb that harmful desire and never act on it.

      On the other side of the table, there are also people who desire other's wellbeing, but desire their own wellbeing *more,* and so regularly take actions that hurt others for their own self benefit. Under the chosen criteria, since these people *do* care for others, they won't suffer your aging curse at all despite regularly performing evil deeds.

      All in all, this is a really terrible metric to use.
      ```

    - u/CCC_037:

      So, first the least empathetic few percent of people die very quickly.

      Then, the least empathetic few percent of people die very quickly.

      Then, the least empathetic few percent of people die very quickly.

      Then, the least empathetic few percent of people die very quickly.

      In short, in a surprisingly short space of time, there will be *very few* people left - but those very few people will be highly empathetic. And the least empathetic of them would be dying, quickly.

      Also killing people who are just born cruel is not necessarily gonna benefit people overall.  People who are fundamentally cruel or greedy can still advance humanity to its destiny among the stars, which if we can harvest more resources will mean we would have a happier population.

      not really, because a great fraction of those poeple really believe that, for example, homosexuals are bad and should be stoned to death.....   
      They don't see their own belief as indifference or desire for other people suffering.  
      In their eyes, they are doing a fair judgement as God's hand.

      how would your power deal with them?
      ```

      - u/Rhamni:
        ```
        Naturally the 'power' is not perfect. If I could add more criteria I could make society even better. For example, in its current form the power would favour people with William's syndrome, which is not ideal.

        However, specifically for the religious folks you mention, the desire for 'divine punishment' or 'god's judgement' would count just as much as normal hate. It doesn't distinguish between "Stone him because he's gay" or "Stone her for not being a virgin," or "Stone him because he shot up a mall." If you hold ill will toward a group and want to see them suffer, you get docked points and fall down the rankings. Naturally, even the least cruel people can be expected to hold ill will *sometimes*, but it's graded on a curve. You only fall down the rankings if you are *more* cruel than someone else.

        We can tweak the system all day long. But as I imagined it, hateful religious folks don't get any kind of pass because of the religion part. If such a system went into effect, religious people full of hate would die off and religious people full of love would remain. You'd probably end up with about the same proportions of Christians, Muslims, Hinduists etc as we have today. Although I suspect we'd end up with fewer atheists, because clearly there is *some* kind of supernatural shenanigans killing off the baddies and cultivating a kinder humanity. Although it could be aliens, I suppose. Clearly the 'power' would not be strong evidence for any of the currently popular religions.
