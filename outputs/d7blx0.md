## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

    finally, a realistic means of throwing yourself at the ground and missing

    Strap a pen to the sword, hang it from a spring, drag some paper across the pen and receive a most convenient message.

    The sword could be a trivial source of energy in downtime. Put it on a water wheel device. It'd be awfully convenient if this sword got heavier whenever it hit the apex of the wheel...

    > A bell that provides protection from granite

    This pairs well with a granite shrapnel grenade, although you still can be hurt by the blastwave.

    >A sword that becomes heavier when most convenient

    Does it ever become lighter again?

    > A belt the produces gold whenever it would be funny

    Obvious application is getting a lot of gold.

      A massively important question.

  * How would you fight a Big Bad who can take possession of large crowds of people? Possessed people are easily identifiable by their glowing eyes. You have access to a portable mind shielding device which creates an anti possession sphere with a 120' radius and are able to temporarily inoculate small numbers of people against his influence. You are in 5e Forgotten Realms setting and have a motivated population willing to help high level adventurers to deal with this existential threat.

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Use protection against good, find some kind of magic that makes your eyes glow, walk up to the big bad and backstap him.
    ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    Does entering the sphere remove possession? If so, just haste a monk (or other person polymorphed to something fast) and have them zip through the crowd, freeing half a football field or more from possession per turn.
    ```

  - u/Trew_McGuffin:
    ```
    Wizard lv 17 Sorcerer lv 3. Use Heighten Spell metamagic, cast Feeblemind on BBG. Use Etherealness to get in close and escape with multiple casts of Fly, Polymorph and Invisibility. Rinse and repeat until Feeblemind takes hold.

    Before hand figure out the BBG plan (or just ask them) possibly join them for the lols.
    ```
