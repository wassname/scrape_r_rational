  Saw other stories by Alicorn being posted, so just wanted to make sure people enjoy this one too. It's particularly relevant to those of us who write and enjoy fanfic :)

    I was kind of slow to cotton on. I thought that it was referring to spec fic in general, and not fan fic in particular, until "earthfiction.net" was mentioned.

      What's 'spec' fiction supposed to be about?
      ```

        Speculative fiction. Catch-all term for fantasy, science fiction, and everything else as well.

          Oh yeah. It was hilarious when I realized that the earthfiction is a parody of fanfiction with the copied work being real life.
