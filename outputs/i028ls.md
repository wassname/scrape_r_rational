## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Related to worldbuilding: does anybody here use mapmaking software?  I'm looking at Wonderdraft; the free version of Inkarnate is junk and I don't want to pay a monthly fee for something I'd be using sporadically.  Wonderdraft, you pay and you're done, it's yours.  There's also something called Campaign Creator (I think?) but I've read that it's fiddly and tends to crash a lot.

    I've used the RollForFanasy map creator in addition to MS Paint to great effect. Searching up 'dnd map creator reddit' showed a couple results with people asking a similar question to yours.

  [I've been working a lot on world-building a fictional country](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17XdKfhcpd9xnfjPEwRIEQZXmxF42gW2ImOcqBrsyBp0/edit?usp=sharing) for the past few weeks that utilizes many certain obscure government institutions like Futarchy, and actually solves the low hanging coordination problems described in [Inadequate Equilibria](https://equilibriabook.com/toc/) and various writing in the rational blogosphere. It ends up being if not utopian then far better than existing governments, though that is a _very_ low bar.

  I'm interested to hear feedback on this and ideas to further extend it.

  Essentially it started out as an exploration of a parallel timeline Venezuela that invested its natural resource wealth like Norway. Though it ended up pretty starkly different from any existing government, especially shortly after the regime came to power in the 60's or 70's. This period is also one I'd like to flesh out far more because it's the weirdest, due to how big of a cultural change the dictator is trying to impose. I also haven't thought very much about how much world history is going to change in this timeline, just due to the culture of this timeline's Venezuela bleeding over to other countries (even if the government doesn't meddle with other states like say the US).

    From your description:

    "So instead higher education would become primarily focused around studying to pass public or private professional exams."

    When a measure becomes a target of optimization, it ceases to be a good measure.

    Also, now you have exams holding exactly the same place as college degrees.

    Not sure what to do about that.

  How would a society function if there was a taboo *against* monogamy and jealousy? (in other words, if all people were expected to be in open relationships, at least sexually, but preferably completely poly, and monogamists were considered creepy weirdos at best).  


  What would be the social, cultural, economic and political implications of it?

    ```
    there would be less expectation that any given child of a male's partner is one's progeny, but also more partners' children to care for. or to put it a different way, familial communism. so it either shakes out as less investment on kids being "theirs" or less investment in their kids over all. i'd imagine that they'd still shun deadbeats.  
    it would be clear who the Mother of a child is, so we could wind up with a matriarchal family unit.  


    Put like that, it's not that difficult to see *why* people from such a culture might find monogamists creepy. it's possessive.
