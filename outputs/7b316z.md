  So, I'm wondering if the goblin was actually aiming at the fae, or if it was just a lucky hit. Or a "lucky" hit, with the shot being nudged along by Fate when the fae decided to just start raining arrows on Cat from beyond her ability to retaliate when she had yet to start her main fight for the battle.

    It could be a shot by Robber. I am still pretty certain he has a Name.
    ```

    - u/Clipsterman:
      ```
      If he already have one, we'd know about it. He might get one, but I personally find it unlikely, since I think he's going to die relatively soon.

        Why? He wasn't in the presence of Masego for quite a while.
        ```

        - u/JdubCT:
          ```
          Nor would a goblin name be obvious. They live in a culture of secrets and treachery. Cultures shape names.
          ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I'm leaning towards it being a nameless character. It fits the theme of the many vs. the Named being the drivers of history, and how Cat is trying to change the dynamic towards the many.

  Not much to say except this chapter was *awesome.*

    Can never have enough Robber!

    Hmm, we haven't heard anything about his preparations for this fight have we? Deal with Queen Plan B?
