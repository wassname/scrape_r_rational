## I nominate a Bluer Shade of White for this week's contest. [META]

### Post:

Exactly what it says in the title.  [This](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White) should be a part of this week's contest.

  Hmm.  There's probably a range of opinions on this, so good idea on making a meta thread.

  The way I'd deal with it is to allow nominations of your or someone else's prior work as suggested reading, a separate category to original work written for the contest.

    Also under separate reading, see /u/eliezeryudkowsky's ["The Last Disney Princess"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3ahdiw/effective_cinderella_or_the_last_disney_princess/)

      Thanks. I hadn't seen that one.

  Well according to the rules

  >you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past

  And since the author of A Bluer Shade of White is the guy running the competitions and set the theme, I'm sure he's aware of the possibility of submitting it. Perhaps he will.

  I had no idea /u/alexanderwales wrote that! I hope it's at least recognized, it's pretty fantastic.

    Sadly, the flair field is not big enough to include all of his fantastic works. /alexanderwales  [Metropolitan man, A bluer shade of white, Shadowsofthelimelight, The last christmas] is too much for reddits puny engine.
