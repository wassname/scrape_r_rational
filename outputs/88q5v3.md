  The limited tolerance to Pressure reminds me of the psychological risk of prolonged / repeated exposure to the Simurgh in Worm.

    I find myself sort of mentally saying "End bringers" (or sometimes, Storm Bringers) when thinking about the Storm birds. I think the serve a similar semiotic role in both stories.

      Yeah, making one of their names Stormbringers in the story was my way of putting in a bit of a nod to Worm :)

  Welcome back everyone! I want you all to know that I care about you a lot, and the way you know that's more than just words is that I chose *not* to update today with a temporary (and *very* short) April Fool's chapter that would have reeeaally capitalized on last chapter's cliff-hanger.

  Instead, enjoy a normal, boring chapter. All feedback welcome, as always, and thanks for reading!

    "Your characters once again feel a distinct unease, as if what they're doing is a *really bad ide*-"

    "Whatever, we follow the Absol into the Onix nest."

    "...Are you SURE?"

    "Yeah?"

    The DM buries his face in his hands. After a moment: "Your careless footsteps wake the female Onix up. It spots the threats to its eggs and it burrows upwards, then descends from the ceiling in a flash. It rocky body falls on you, everyone dies.

    How many bloody hints do I have to give you idiots?"

    Thanks for the feedback! I edited the conversations a bit to hopefully correct for it. Here's the taboo one:

    >"It's a way to keep from getting caught up in semantics. We're not allowed to use that word in the discussion anymore, we clearly mean different things when we say it, and are just getting more aggravated every time that happens." She lets out a breath. "Or I am, anyway, so let's just focus on what we're actually trying to say instead of tripping over that word again and again."

    >"Oh, that's like a game! What would you say instead of luck, then?"

    >Aiko stops to think, then continues slowly. "If this power or ability or whatever exists, it has to be something guided. It can't just be some diffuse, aimless effect that happens at random but also keeps benefiting the absol. Otherwise it could just as easily hinder itself with the things it causes. So it must be through some specific mechanism, something under conscious control, like clouding someone's mind or sending a tremor through the ground or whatever."

  ```
  Has no one ever captured an Absol before or something? This hypothesis seems like it would be pretty easily testable with a caught one. My first thought upon reading that was "great, catch one and you've got a safe way to train against Pressure!" And then I read the next part.

  If resilience to Pressure really does get "used up", that's an absolute nightmare of an already terrible situation - your strongest trainers getting weaker over time, less able to make use of their stronger and more experienced pokemon. If that was proven to be the case, would someone dedicated to fighting the Stormbringers be better off not attending their attacks for the first half of their career, so that their limited number of attendances would be "used up" with a stronger, more experienced team?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Sorry, I didn't make it clear, just edited: not all pokemon that *can* have the ability do, like in the games, and unlike the games, even if they do have it, it's not binary, and varies in strength like any other trait.

    As for the idea of waiting to use up Pressure exposures, yes, and also most kids don't want to be anywhere near the stormbringers anyway, so it's not usually an issue. Blue and Red have Something to Prove.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      I imagine it's effects are variable depending on the species and "Legendary" status as well.

      It seems the Stormbringers have an AoE measured in miles (or kilometers for your non-Muricans), whereas this Absol's is measured in yards/meters.

      If we're going through with some "scientific" approach, most forms of non-focused radiation do not fall off at a linear rate--ie something twice as far away is not taking half, but one-fourth or less the amount of exposure.

      Thus it's likely the Absol have a Pressure "output" several orders of magnitude less than the Stormbringers.  It's *probably* not too dangerous for an Absol Trainer to be exposed to it, in as much as they might be exposed to the chaos of its effects (the opposing 'mon might lunge at the Trainer instead of the Absol, for instance).  The "total amount" they would receive is likely negligible compared to the exposure of a Stormbringer.

      TL;DR:  Absol Pressure is likely similar to the dose of a microwave oven or a cellphone; Legendary Bird (or Mewtwo) Pressure is similar to that of the radiation from nuclear fallout.
      ```

  - u/OnePunchFan8:
    ```
    I think it's because absol are quite rare, so trainers that gave them are few, and interest in their abilities is also low. Or at least so that no one has done any conclusive study on it.
    ```

    - u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:
      ```
      Caught Absol also probably no longer use that ability because it harms their trainers or puts them in danger. So the trainers with an Absol having that ability might not even be aware of it.
      ```

  - u/noimnotgreedy:
    ```
    Oak faced the bringers 23 times, unless Oak's an exception.. (fairy?) I don't think you use it up.
    ```

    - u/AnthiumV:
      ```
      23 is a lot, but Blue was speculating Oak HAD used up his "resistance" at that point:
      >there are rumors that he was nearly crippled from the after effects, and was warned off ever attending another by his physician.

      He also implied 23 is more than normal:
      >How many fights do most trainer get with the birds before they start getting overpowered? Ten, maybe fifteen?

      Then again, the whole paragraph was speculative and more than a little panicked, so who knows? Maybe there IS no loss of resistance, or maybe it's something that our protagonists will find can be trained against.

    Oh yeah! I forgot that's what Red and Leaf were up too. It's a shame Blue won't be there with them to rub the sea captain's back and taunt Red so they can finally learn how to cut down a tree. (GEN 1 really had some contrived story beats didn't it...)
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      By far the worst was the whole snorlax sidequest.

      "Oh no, there's a giant sleeping pokemon blocking the road! If only we had some way to... make it smaller... or... move it from place to place... or... capture and tame it... Oh well, better go get the one specific flute that can wake it up so you can fight it!"

      Twice the hilarity ensues if you then put it back to sleep in-combat to help capture it. I really don't know what the game writers were thinking :P
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Of course, it will probably put *itself* back to sleep when you fight it...
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          Right, what would have been great is if the flute somehow stopped it from using Rest to heal itself. That way if you fight it without the flute it was a really hard battle, or if you got the flute it would be easier.

          Not that they'd actually let you do that of course, since it was just meant to be a contrived way to direct the player from one place to another.

              Yeeeap. It's not an *important* gripe, but it's still one that bothers me in terms of lazy game writing/world crafting. Since they refuse to make a real open world game, the now-multi-millions-making game company should be able to come up with better reasons to artificially block map exploration :P

            ```

            - u/Silver_Swift:
              ```
              For that to work master balls would have to be able to capture intelligent beings without killing them, in which case it has applications way beyond using it to capture Mewtwo (who as far as Giovanni knows is mostly content with being a lab rat for now).
              ```

- u/TheGreatTactician:
  ```
  Awesome chapter as usual! I love seeing Blue improve as a leader and avoid making costly mistakes that he easily could have made in the past ala Viridian Forest's events. I kind of hope Blue captures the Absol somehow and bonds with it in a unique way since he's Dark and it's a Dark-type. 

  Also, I do have one quick question about Pressure. Is the whole discussion about only being able to stand up to it a limited amount of times a definitive thing, or is that just something that Blue and the others were speculating? It was a bit hard to determine from the way it was written in this chapter.

  Thanks for not giving us a joke chapter, and if you celebrate it, happy Easter Sunday!
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Glad you enjoyed it :) And the Pressure effects are definitive: there's on hard limit, but the impact of it becomes more and more pronounced after each time.
    ```

    - u/TheGreatTactician:
      ```
      Interesting. So does that mean that Absol can't even really be used if caught since its ability is so dangerous? Or can it be turned off, so to speak?
      ```

      - u/Electric999999:
        ```
        Since people have caught absol and not noticed the pressure it might be that it can be turned off and is turned off by the instinct overriding part of pokeballs (the thing Red brings back)
        ```

  *camera pans over the defenders, the absol, and the rest of the scene, from various angles, in extreme slow motion/freeze frame for the duration of the [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I) *

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Ha! I like this mental image. There are many moments where I would like to add music to the reading experience, and this would be the second or third scene that not only would have lyrics, but also wouldn't be anime or video game music. I feel like that might be jarring (in the hypothetical world where there actually is mini clips of music playing at random points in the story) but think it would fit in this case :P
    ```

- u/noimnotgreedy:
  ```
  I'm glad you didn't make a joke chapter.

  A question: Are ghost types rare and difficult to catch? They would be a very useful resource in this situation: even if they can't phase through walls, they're probably silent. Gen VI removed Gengar's levitate (wtf?) but even Gastly by itself is pretty darn scary; quiet cloud of poison (secondary typing!) that moves by itself.

  Also, one thing that I just noticed: Surge's gym pretty much teaches people how to deal with those situations. Why not even the rangers ask for backup? Practical field experience, too.

  BTW, suggestions for an actual joke chapter anyone? "There's a Rotom in your dishwasher!"? Peak humans (Batman) in the Pokeverse? Blue finds
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    > A question: Are ghost types rare and difficult to catch?

    They are indeed, and the most difficult to train. Most trainers in fact don't bother, and leave Ghost pokemon to psychics who feel a need to walk on the dangerous side.

    >Surge's gym pretty much teaches people how to deal with those situations. Why not even the rangers ask for backup? 

    Do you mean in general, or this situation? They do in general, and in this situation they didn't realize it was as dire as it was until the report by Blue's group.
    ```

  - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
    ```
    Ghost types are weak to and against Dark.
    ```

    - u/noimnotgreedy:
      ```
      I'd say ghost types would be better suited to indirect solutions rather than direct ones. Fighting is out of the question esp. when weakened.

      My naive and simple strategy would be to have a few gastly use Curse. Paging /u/DaystarEld: how do moves like Curse, Spite, and (less likely) Pain Split work in Oos?? Are those psychological, rather than physical effects?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Yeah, most Ghost attacks cause "mental damage," especially non-direct damage attacks. And anything that lowers PP, like Spite, can be re-imagined as simply being something that tires out the enemy faster.

  ```

- u/empocariam:
  ```
  Interesting that of all non-legendary lines with Pressure (Aerodactyl, Weavile, Dusknoir, Absol, Vespiquen, Spiritomb, Wailord, Bisharp), 50% of them are dark type.

  Could Blue's darkness give him an advantage on resisting Pressure? Maybe that's why elder Oak was so resilient, something Dark about the Oak family tree.

  As an aside, I find it a little unusual to think that a Pokemon like Vespiquen, which seems to relatively common from the way they were talked about during the Pineco catching chapter, would not have the same reputation as Absol for bad luck. Maybe attributed to the chaos caused by dealing with large combee swarms?

  Absol really does seem to have some kind of heightened intelligence, of only for it's ability to be so dang creepy. That scene of a lone cat-monster standing in the center of a dimly lit hollowed out chamber while the rumbling of even larger snakes come burrowing toward you. Chills to the extreme.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    The game treats abilities as pretty binary (either you have the ability, and its effect is 100% there, or you don't, and you have none of it), whereas I'm treating abilities as much more fluid than that. So most vespiquen don't actually exert any Pressure noticeable by humans, nor do most absol for that matter :)
    ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  Holy shit, Blue. What the hell have you gotten yourself into?
  ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  Hm. Hey Daystar, how would you explain Absol's *other* ability, Super Luck? Perhaps a different application of Pressure?
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I kind of think of it as just an overall heightening of agility and combat prowess, to the point of being able to strike more cleanly and effectively. It looks to others like you just happened to step to the right place at the right time to avoid a strike and land a critical blow in return, but in truth it's more like the ability to read the enemy and move in tune with them.

    And again this is just one adaptation of the ability. In my world pokemon abilities are named the same thing because of their effects, not because of the underlying mechanism behind them :)

He was expecting to stay there until others arrived or talk to them over the phone, and totally forgot to update Bretta's group when he left.
