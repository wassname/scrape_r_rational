## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Eye Opener](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/74400/eye-opener) is something I’ve been reading lately, it’s not a real mystery but so far it’s mostly been about discovering what third eye really is. The synopsis does a better job of selling it so I’ll post it here.

  “Cameron Howard crowdfunded Third Eye on a whim. He didn’t really believe a dev team with no industry experience could deliver on an “immersive Augmented Reality, Altered Reality Game for mobile platforms.” If they managed somehow, he’d get a cool game out of it. When they failed, he’d be out the price of a couple hamburgers and have a story to tell.

  But Third Eye did deliver.

  Now Cam, his ex-girlfriend Lena, and their friends and rivals around the world are about to discover just what they’ve backed themselves into. Third Eye is graphically stunning. Technologically mindblowing. Irresistibly addictive.

  And that's before Cam starts to suspect the magical powers he can use in-game are working in real life...”

  Edit: on reflection I feel like I maybe wasn’t being completely fair when I called it not a real mystery. It does scratch a similar itch. I also wanted to say that the characters and dialogue is the real strength of this story.

    The glowfic [Project Lawful (or Planecrash)](https://www.projectlawful.com) has a large chunk of the story being the bad guys hiding how bad they are from the quite altruistic protagonist while trying to literally seduce him to evil with a harem. The main characters are the protagonist and his main gf, who is often the person in charge of tricking him.

    It's a pathfinder (the TTRPG) fanfiction, crossed over with one of the authors' OC world. Basic idea is a guy from a super lawful-good (and hyper rational, in Yudkowski's style) world isekaid to a standard if pretty grimdark fantasy/d&d world, but falls specifically to the hands of the country ruled by the forces of hell. A farce ensues, where the bad guys try to get his advanced knowledge of science in order to take over the world, and lie to him just enough that he stays with them willingly, without being found out (there are in-universe reasons why they don't just force him to cooperate). Contains a lot of lectures on math, logic, and decision theory. Also contains quite a lot of sex (not particularly arousing to most people, very much part of the story), torture, and combinations of the two.

      I remember reading it back when it was a single fifty-page thread. I probably should pick it back up, it was fun. With that said... I see that the latest thread in the main continuity is marked as "Ob Hiatus." Is the story *actually* on a hiatus or is it  the story-is-complete-but-epilogue-is-still-pending kind of deal?
      ```

      - u/-main:
        ```
        It felt pretty much finished to me. With how it finished, there *could* be more to come... but it felt like one of the two authors was putting it down and positioning it for a large stopping point.
        ```

      - u/GrizzlyTrees:
        ```
        Sort of both? You could read it as mosly over with a somewhat open ending. It's clearly missing an important part of the conclusion, but all the players have made their bets and what is left is just seeing where the chips would fall.

    How does demons lord lover compares to the black company?
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      It's very different. It's a webnovel, so not as well written. It also takes after that typical jrpg fantasy setting, where the hero and their team fight and defeat the demon lord. The premise is that the mentor of the current generation of heroes falls in love with the Demon Lord, and then hijinks ensue as they try to meet. Mostly comedy and adventure, with some surprisingly good worldbuilding and drama at times.
      ```

- u/GrizzlyTrees:
  ```
  I've recently read a story called Aftermath, at storiesonline.net (not sure if I can link it directly, its quite nsfw). The story follows a community trying to survive after a comet hit earth and destroyed most of civilization. The story is very pornographic, and deals quite a lot in sexism (and isn't very rational at all), but aside from that it scratched a certain itch for me. 

  It lead me to wonder if anyone has any other stories following similar premises; small groups of people trying to survive (and maybe rebuild civilization) after a major disaster destroyed most of the earth. 

  The worm fanfiction Moonshot startet out scratching the same itch, but then started going off the rails in ways I didn't enjoy (all the bio-threats).
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    You could try [To The Far Shore](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50836/to-the-far-shore), it fulfills some of your criteria. It's post-post-apocalyptic oregon trail. The protagonist's city is suddenly destroyed, and he realizes that war is gonna come to his corner of the continent. So he decides to make the trek to the other edge of the continent, with a caravan of a lot of people that is slowly reduced through natural and unnatural disasters. 

    It's not really small group vs nature, more like medium group vs nature. The caravan goes across other settlements for supplies, and in between there are moments of true survival where there are no people in the nearest 100 miles.
    ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Is the important part that it’s Earth, that it’s low-tech, or that it’s small group dynamics?

    [Set in Stone](https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-01/) was an interesting story about Stone Age technology combined with modern, rationalized institutions. The society lacks access to metals but has been otherwise able to develop (with a few important caveats). So you have water power and pastoralists sharing space with democracy and public education. I had a few issues with stylistic choices, but thought it was overall a good read.
    ```

    - u/GrizzlyTrees:
      ```
      Mostly the small group thing, though that's being earth was nice too. It wasn't particularly low tech, and moonshot was scifi as hell and that didn't bother me. Mostly the "small group vs. nature" conflict, and knowing that there isn't a wider civilization to pick up the slack if they fail.

      Your suggestion seems interesting at first glance, thanks!

    There’s Lucifer’s Hammer by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. It’s almost exactly the same premise and quite good from what I remember.

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    [The Day of the Triffids](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/530965.The_Day_of_the_Triffids) is a lot like you describe Aftermath as being, with the exception of pornographic. It's certainly more understandably a product of its time(1951 rather than 2000). I liked it well enough.

    Another one that I might suggest is [Remnants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remnants_\(novel_series\)). It's a tad YA, but still decent.

    I’m not sure I believe the consciousness-shift thing. C.f. Scott on the [bicameral mind](https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/01/book-review-origin-of-consciousness-in-the-breakdown-of-the-bicameral-mind/); a lot of the weirdness about that hypothesis should apply to theories about the Piraha and steppe nomads, too. 70s/80s psych research is prime “replication crisis” fodder.

    But that’s beside the point. I loved *Maybe I’m a Lion* so much, and I definitely see what you mean about character self-reflection. Most stories which even get close to the subject stay on the more comfortable ground of maturity-as-decision-making, where the tension is between (youthful) gut reactions and (mature) rationality.

    *With This Ring* veers into this territory. Since the protag’s Orange Lantern powers depend on wanting things, he has crises of self as he reckons with his desires. I think he grows by becoming more aware and deliberate with those feelings, and cultivates them to bring them in line with his long-term values. It didn’t land as well as *Lion*, in my opinion, due to generally weaker prose and more self-indulgence. But it’s playing with the ideas.

    *[At the End of All Things](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3451040/chapters/7569143)* is one of the best pieces of fanfiction I have ever read. The Oath of Fëanor isn’t what the elves would want, but it binds them nonetheless. I want to say it fits your criteria, because their different levels of self-awareness are character-defining.

    It’s also unfinished, as I believe lintamande has moved towards glowfic. Which, if you’ve got the taste for it, is also a great place to find metacognition. Unfortunately, I can’t help you navigate that realm. I’ll have to be content hoping lintamande finishes *At the End*.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      If you want weird metacognition fics by Lintamande theres a lot! I recommend "what promises signed in our blood do we break" https://glowfic.com/posts/3873 Its a Velgarth/Silmarillion crossover. The metacognition comes into play because Tolkien elves can give binding oaths, which does alter their mindstates.

      It also features a great love story, again with the metacognition aspect.
      ```

      - u/netstack_:
        ```
        Yes! That handling of oaths is *exactly* what I was thinking about. I remember the different sons of Feanor having different levels of coping with their oath, which I thought made for a fascinating setup.

        Do they still hang around reddit at all? I've thought about reaching out and asking if they have plans regarding the fic. Or at least leaving a glowing review. Gah, just something to convey how unfairly good that story feels to read.
        ```

  Has anyone read [Horizon of war](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/45331/horizon-of-war-an-isekai-with-historical-twist)? Would love to hear feedback before I start it and of course recommendations of things similar to this.
  ```

  - u/sephirothrr:
    ```
    Having given it a solid try, I'd give it a very easy **de-rec**.

    On a subjective level, I found the pacing glacially slow and uninteresting, was not compelled by the protagonists superpower of "can do basic arithmetic" no matter how historically accurate that may be, and also I was strongly repulsed by the MCs bizarre brand of prude horniness. 

    The prose, while grammatically passable, is incredibly uncompelling. The third person narrative frequently switches from omniscient to limited in a jarring way, in addition to bouncing back and forth from the narrative and giant blocks of exposition. Everything has this incredibly stilted quality that makes it a chore to read.

    I read it until >!a second surprise isekai hamfistedly showed up!< which was the last nail in the coffin for me. I wish I could get that time back.
    ```

  - u/serge_cell:
    ```
    Strong de-rec. Poor worldbuilding, not engaging plot. Was declared to be military fantasy but author don't know or don't care how feudal army was organized, moving or supplied. The same carelessness was applied to feudal society in general, from peasant household to lord retinue. If it was because of magic the influence of magic was not shown either.

  [REQUEST] need some recommendations for a specific genre 

  Im fine with any form of media by the way .

  I'm not sure wether it's called Genre of trope or whatever . But there is characters like Kellhus from the Novels by SCOTT BAKKER { Prince Of Nothing } 

  & Sherlock Holmes by CONAN ARTHUR DOYLE 

  & Hannibal Lecter from the novels by THOMAS HARRIS { Red Dragon / Silence Of The Lambs } 

  & Light Yagami / L Lawliet from the manga { Death Note } 

  & Akiyama Shinishi + Baku Madarame + Akagi from the manga { Liar Game } + { Usogui } + { Akagi } 

  & Kleinn Moretti + Fang Yuan from the Chinese webnovels { Lord Of The Mysteries } + { Reverend Insanity }



  The common factor between these guys is that they are all into the unrealistic Hyper-Genius or Hyper-Manipulator or Hyper-Scheming trope . Right ? 

  I want characters who are on the out-of-the-world level like these guys . I saw some others people asking for smart characters on this Sub . But they didn't ask for guys like these who are at the peak of human intelligence potential or even beyond human level . 

  Basically if you have read any of the recommendations i mentioned . Then you know the level scale im asking for so try go give me all the characters you know who are 1 - ( close to these guy's levels ) 2 - ( At their level ) 3 - ( even smarter ) 

  And if you haven't read any of these characters then just hit me with the smartest characters you have ever known from highest to lowest . 

  And sorry to trouble You Kind people with this long ass post and ranting 😅😅 . Thanks


  And as for more examples

    -

    All these characters are described to be smarter than human. The problem is that the person writing them is still just human.

    Consider switching your focus to non-fictional biographies of (e.g. [*Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\).*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You're_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!) Those will provide more realistic and nuanced portrayals, and the top-percentile regular humans described in them will also de facto be *more* intelligent than what a fictional, supposedly "super-intelligent", human often ends up looking like.

    Another option is to branch out into AI prots: [*Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect, The;*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMetamorphosisOfPrimeIntellect) [*Number, The;*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48012/the-number) [*Friendship is Optimal;*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FriendshipIsOptimal) [Demiurge’s Older Brother, The](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/21/repost-the-demiurges-older-brother/); etc.

    I feel like you might get a kick out of Columbo from the TV show of the same name. He's a super-smart (in the TV sense) detective who plays dumb in order to trick criminals into giving themselves away. Every episode starts with the 'perfect crime' shown on screen so you already know Who Did It, and the actual conflict in the plot is how Detective Columbo will manage to outwit this episode's criminal and prove that they committed the crime.

    [Kings of Paradise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35994830-kings-of-paradise) fits your request really well. There are 2 main characters, with one of them, Ruka, being a malformed genius outcast. It's pretty great. 

    Miles of the Vorkosigan Saga isn't quite at the super genius level, but neither are many of your examples tbh. Still, he's an upper echelon thinker who solves problem through his wit and charisma, much like Kellhus, and I think you would enjoy it, especially as it's got a lot of books to catch up on. Start at [Warrior's Apprentice](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61906).

    The MC of [Lion of Senet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/384352.Lion_of_Senet) is about on the same level of Miles Vorkosigan in terms of intellect and charisma. The only issue I have with the story is that the scope of the story is a bit narrow, the world feels a bit small.
