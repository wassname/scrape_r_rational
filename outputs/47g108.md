## [Biweekly Challenge] First Contact

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/455k69/biweekly_challenge_new_age/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "New Age". /u/OrzBrain is the winner with their story [Nuclear Rapture](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/455k69/biweekly_challenge_new_age/czzbszx). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/OrzBrain!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be "First Contact". My first thought when I hear that phrase is *alien* contact, but there's no reason that you couldn't do contact between pre-Industrial civilizations on the same planet, contact between parallel worlds, or contact between the past and future. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, March 9th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time the challenge will be "Mere Reality". In other words, fiction that takes place in the real world, or something very close to it. No magic, no fancy super tech, just people in the real world doing realistic things. We're looking for something that's exceptionally grounded. (My personal advice would be to look for real life examples and work from there, but YMMV.)

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 3/9.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread for recommendations and discussion is [available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47g8p1/challenge_companion_first_contact/).

      He wasn't going back *that* far. The species is fine.

        Very true. He was just wiping out the current generation, and the previous 2-3 generations. Ultimately small change (assuming you're not part of said generations XD)

    This is good. 

    I didn't like the following, however: " The Makers will refer to the people who sent us, a little corny and dramatic but easy to remember". That sounds out of character, like the author speaking through a character and being self deprecating.

    There is also a problem with the grim Vingeian Slow Zone-esque picture she paints -- [Spoiler](#s " Vinge had to prohibit AI in the Slow Zone to make it work. The existence of the probe, and what she was able to do to the girl (and noninvasively using electromagnetism, yet!) shows that at least human level (and very likely better) AI is possible, and the viability of brain uploading probable. The way out of the trap is to redirect all available resources to AI and brain uploading. Once those are solved, space travel mass constraints, the speed of light limit, resource limitations, terraforming, starvation, population growth, lifespan limitations, plague, etc., all cease to be real problems, and the galaxy is ours! Mahahaha!")

      Thank you.

      Yes, that is indeed the author's self-deprecation over being unable to think of anything better to call them. At first Amanda was saying "the people who sent us" over and over again, and it started to sound like an M. Night Shyamanlan script. I justify my choice with the idea that she wants to disarm the narrator just then, and saying something out of character is a way to do it.
      [Vinge](#s "I deliberately meant to exclude conventional brain uploading, implying a biological/AI boundary with talk of the advantage of using girl brains for their language learning advantages. See also the distinctions between second person plurals, and I vs. we.  Amanda speaks for the probe, but she isn't the probe. That said, versions of a Vinge singularity are very much what I imagine the Makers were cleaning up after.")
      [and...](#s "The original draft had a big gotcha 'it's all a lie!' twist at the end which I couldn't make work and abandoned. Then I tried a 'it's all a simulation!' twist where the bored AI isn't actually allowed to do anything but watch and wait... which was worse. I fundamentally disagree with the much of the picture that Amanda paints, but I thought it was an interesting, relatively subtle way to imagine a first contact and the Great Filter.")

  [Rats!](http://pastebin.com/LpfNVCih), 500 words. This is short, almost a sketch. I was going to expand it, but I had some trouble coming up with an ending that wasn't either "everyone dies," or, "aliens come back, notice the 95 percent human death rate, and make some ironic comments about manifest destiny before putting the remaining humans on reservations and colonizing the place."
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Seems weird that it slipped through the net of the biological testing mentione earlier. 

    Like the overall writng style and the concept, but te ending mabye needs expanded a bit

  Human aliens show up. But what if they got beaten to the punch by [extradimensional terrorists and a couple of teenage superheroes](https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/21091666/)?
