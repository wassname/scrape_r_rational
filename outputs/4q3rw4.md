## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Hello I just found this sub through a link to The Mother of Learning and am interested in stories which have a well defined and immutable set of governing principals.

  This is tied to a love for science which has lead me to obtain a Bs in physics and I am currently seeking to gain entry into grad school.

  In my free time I love concocting fantasy ideas based around first defining a set of laws of physics and establishing a base line and history for that world.

  I particularly enjoy redefining aspects of fantasy/myth/fiction into more scientific frame work my current brain child is a variation of fairies based on the ecology of ants and Termites and other social insects. the premise is a wasp derived social arthropod with a parisitoid ancestor. They have through evolution obtained the ability to steal and integrate DNA from other creatures into a malleable genome. This has produced strange specialized forms with well defined roles in the hive, notably The gene snatcher which is a genetic clone form the queen's DNA(a method employed by termites). They are responsible for collecting new DNA and injecting changeling larvae into developing young who will eventually be "called" back to serve the hive after learning from their society. The larvae which bypasses the immune system, injects itself into the developing notochord of vertebrate hosts where it sits dormant as the host develops while subtly spurring the host to be interested in new and different things. These creatures are also the only fey that are able to innovate and learn thus are very valuable to the hive but absolutely terrifying to other denizens of the world. 
  I think I should stop here as it is getting pretty long...

  I feel the social structure employed by social insects (as well as the very unusual mammals known as Naked Mole Rats  who actually employ a similar structure) while they may individually lack in intelligence on a whole an emergent social cohesion forms allowing for great tasks. Ironic that I got into this after we found a termite infestation and myself discovering how little I knew about them.

    Welcome! Always nice to see a new username around the forum.

    Taking DNA from other living beings is [Horizontal Gene Transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer). Pretty much universal in bacteria, but also not unheard of in multicellular beings. And parasites that modify the host's behaviour are unusual, but [they do exist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-altering_parasites_and_parasitoids) and they're an excellent device for science-fiction stories.

    Looking forward to seeing some of your stories!
    ```

    - u/Dragrath:

      Yep both traits are found in biology behavior modification is actually more common than you might think though and there is some evidence that it might be present in humans due to the higher incidence of risky behavior among people infected by Toxoplasmosis.

      There is also claims that certain viruses may make their hosts more social during the incubation period.

      As for stories I actually have little experience writing charecters and social interactions so I don't know how it will turn out. I will certainly need help that is for sure.

      Most of my ideas are built for a fiction that is a mix of high fantasy(thus separate  laws of physics) and perhaps a bit of science fiction. The issue is I can't stop with one world so I have actually a bunch of separate developing worlds that have actually fed of each other over the years with some branches dying and others splitting off.

      Off the top of my head I can think of

      -A dystopian society based around a viral based vampire "species" that "breeds" through infecting a suitable host

      -A high fantasy world under threat from a extraterrestrial foe. I have the world structure for this as well as general events pretty well laid out but the little details beyond that are near impossible for me to figure out how to do.
      (I have a Prologue made and an idea for how it will end)

      -A "modern" fantasy world suffering after a long environmentally cataclysmic war built of both nationalism colonialism and strong species oriented racial tensions. Complete with biological and chemical "super weapons", genocide and thermonuclear warfare. The main set point is the next generation after this war ended due to a bio-engineered virus mutating and becoming more virulent than expected, devastating all factions and forcing a truce.
      the surviving hominids are devastated such that elves have been forced to turn to cloning, dragons are solely able to reproduce parthenogenetically as the male line (or Z chromosome) is extinct.

      I come up with so many ideas I can't keep up... to be honest...

        I have a similar thing I do with fanfictions; like I'll read/watch something, have an amazing plot bunny that rampages through my brain for a while and then just sits there never to be utilized. Simply because I don't have the willpower/time/interest to do it.

        It's gotten better in past years but man, when I was a bit younger T_T

        In other news, I find it impressive how fleshed out your ideas are, even though you haven't done any sort of storyboarding or anything. I personally find it a bit difficult to worldbuild. I'm sure I'm capable (I've ingested more than enough fiction and knowledge) but I'm not very detail oriented and my attention span is very...selective. Hence my lack of patience with it.

  While we're here....

  Are people here familiar with White Wolf and the Storyteller System?

  I was originally attracted to the publisher by Mage: the Ascension, which promised a tale of competing ideologies/ontologies and their paths to a transhuman state.  And...well, you could do that.

  But the story that White Wolf has generally promoted was "Greater powers than humans have would make for a Crapsack World, subtly or grossly worse than our own."  This makes some sense when the powers belong to nonhuman entities with different interests than ours, but it was applied pretty universally.

  Anyone else have this frustration?  And/or run a "progressive" game that dragged the Worlds of Darkness out of...um, Darkness?
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    You have to understand that angst/horror was part of the target Demographic for white wolf, and that made it a recurring theme.  If you ever start a progressive game that'd be interesting.

    Just curious but have you ever come across: [Eclipse Phase](https://robboyle.wordpress.com/eclipse-phase-pdfs/) and if
     so what were your thoughts?
    ```

    - u/Mabus101:
      ```
      I'm aware of thst, of course.  I just felt that it wasted the potential of the setting.  Imagine writing Star Wars from the perspective of helpless Ewoks being orbitally-bombarded by the Empire.  There would be a certain verisimilitude to it, but I wouldn't enjoy watching.

      I have heard of it but not had a chance to investigate.  Thanks for the link.

      I've had very few chances to run games--there are few gamers where I live and my internet access is usually limited.  I am writing a Buffy/Exalted crossover but many of the characters,I've found, are too damaged to respond rationally to the power of an Exaltation while still being recognizable as themselves.  I do have some plans to write rational!Harmony as the story proceeds.  Why should people who are already smart have all the bootstrapping fun?
      ```

      - u/Mabus101:
        ```
        I've spent a little time looking at Eclipse Phase.  Makes my mouth water,and not just for the gaming experience.  It does remind me a lot of the SJG product Transhuman Space, but I suspect any copying is the other way round.  It does contain the usual obnoxious "monotheism is dying" trope.  Short form:  fundamentalist religions of the sort we love with in America, at least, are sometimes antiscience but almost always protechnology.  Body upgrades are no threat to someone who believes that "we shall all be changed".  Current sociomoral changes hold more danger.
        ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  I find myself more and more derisive of media since I got into rationality (and I'm not even that into it, really, considering I haven't really bothered to supplement myself with any sort of learning materials/nonfiction to promote my understanding)

  I'll scoff at things that are stupid. Or characters being stupid. Or just...anything being stupid in a work. But the thing is, I don't think stupid should equate to bad in the same way that [tropes are not bad.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools)

  Of course, there's stupidity and then there's *stupidity*. For example, there's moments that don't make sense or seem "stupid" that may just be to build dramatic tension, impart emotion, etc. For example, concepts like last words where someone says something and smiles even when cut in half or run through by tons of sword. Implausible IRL? Sure. But not necessarily stupid in the same way that Voldemort branding his followers with a distinctive tattoo in a visible part of the body is (Thief's Downfall, for those people who snark about concealment and such). And even in that sense, the Dark Mark, while stupid from a rational perspective, serves its use wonderfully in story as a device for JK Rowling. It's clearly evil, it acts as a cheap pager, and it's branding for Voldie's side. In both the literal sense and the marketing sense. 

  So....not sure where I was going with this; I guess I'm just annoyed by my newfound tendency to feel exasperated at stupid moments in fiction that may not be completely adherent to real world intelligence but do quite well as dramatic devices. Anyone else feel like this?

  How do you form an unbiased opinion on the Internet, if it's possible at all?

  I'm trying to read up on recent political events and determine whether I've been backing the wrong horse. But all the communities I'm already part of are ones that largely agree with me, and I don't know where to find well-researched counterarguments that come from a place of reasonable discussion. And of course, tempers are running high at the moment and it's probably too soon to have a reasonable and sensible discussion about the subject matter. (I am, of course, referring to the Orlando shooting.)

  I don't want an argument for arguments' sake, I just want to know which side is right.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    There usually isn't a "right side". Any given issue is a complex, multi-faceted thing. Anyone who tells you that it's for sure this one simple thing is someone you should probably look at with a critical eye. Anyone who divides topics into "sides" is probably someone you want to take a step back from.

    (Following the Orlando shooting, my Facebook feed was filled with people who were sure that it was one hundred percent about Islam, or LGBT discrimination, or mental health, or guns, or the national security apparatus, or ... whatever. It drove me nuts that everyone thought they had the one true solitary answer that could be boiled down to a soundbite. I think it must just feel good to think you've got the silver bullet.)
    ```

    - u/space_fountain:
      ```
      This kind of view frustrates me sometimes. Sure real life is complicated and there are many factors to consider, but there is still an optimal outcome for any particular value function if you want to call it that.

      Similarly dividing issues into sides can be counterproductive, but at the same time useful at times. Sure every issue has hundreds of possible policy stances around it, but that doesn't mean we can't classify them into multiple camps. Indeed humans can't deal with a sea of anecdotes so we need to classify stuff somewhat.
      ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      Well said. So I shouldn't be looking for "the right answer" to a political issue, but rather seeing how it fits into the wider world as I know it. Complicated issues have complicated causes and complicated effects, there is no single viewpoint that completely and definitively explains everything.
      ```

    - u/gabbalis:
      ```
      Actually, that's a great idea. Silver bullets would make shootings far more expensive. /s
      ```

  - u/Dwood15:
    ```
    The problem is that it's easy to summarize and tell the side of the story you want with these things. Anything from "The Shooter was mentally insane, there should be a mandatory visit to a psychiatrist before you buy a gun!"
    to "It was discrimination against LGBT groups" are going to get big from news article.

    I've found that if you really, really want to learn the details of a specific event, your best bet is to look for published court and/or police reports. While it's impossible to get a truly unbiased opinion, generally police and courts are good about getting information on the various deliberations.
    ```

    - u/elevul:
      ```
      Don't forget "If everyone was allowed to concealed carry within the club then the shooter wouldn't have been able to make so many victims".
      ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    Search for academic books that provide background on a subject.  Ideally pick two so it's easier to distinguish niche thesis from relatively discipline-wide agreement.  I'd start with books by historians, political scientists, anthropologists, and/or sociologists.  Use a university's [Primo](http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do?mode=Basic&vid=OXVU1&tab=all&) or Google Scholar to search.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Generalizing from this, primary sources.  In addition to academia and scholarly paper, /u/Dwood15 pointed out published court and/or police reports.  I would add skimming the "news" for the direct eyewitness quotes, finding the source of the quote, and considering the context of the quote.  Then keep in mind that reality is complicated.
      ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    Why would a side be right? The Orlando shootings were a complex series of events involving lots of participants. Your opinions should be based purely off facts, not narratives or sides that sides typically have. Source every statement and fact as well as you can and you should be fine.
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      Still, there's some possibly-relevant information that I'll never learn if I don't look outside the filter bubble. Checking the sources will only let me rule out incorrect facts, not learn new correct ones.
      ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        Could you clarify on what sort of info you expect to receive from other sources that isn't on yours?
        ```

  - u/Dragrath:
    ```
    Bias is likely an innate part of how humans catalogue data. (I.e. we attempt to classify all new information based on preexisting information) so in essence we all have bias. 
    However there are ways to mitigate bias where in essence you can look into how other viewpoints would see an issue.

    Effectively I try and do this from a devils advocate stance however even I find it very hard, if not impossible, to do for issues I have a very strong stance for or against.


    The key to remember is things like right and wrong, good, evil, moral and amoral are all subjective terms based on our societal cultural norms and upbringing.

    Without a set definition described entirely in qualitative and quantitative form based on real observable features/traits you can't really say whether one path is right or wrong.
    ```

  - u/chaosmosis:
    ```
    I wouldn't rely on the internet at all, to be honest. One thing I've found useful when thinking about complicated and controversial things is to basically list out as many (semi-reasonable) possibilities as I can think of ahead of time, even if they are somewhat stupid, and then consider various themes and assumptions common to the views I find most compelling. I mean "compelling" in an almost narrative sense here, which means sometimes views I do not agree with much still count as "compelling". Generally there are convergences that emerge from across many very different compelling viewpoints.

    In other words, I advise that you don't look at individual arguments as you happen to come across them online, instead you should think about networks of arguments that exist within the space of all possible arguments. You do need to draw limits on what you consider somewhere, but if you don't rely exclusively on any particular point of view then weird outlier ideas cannot do as much to hurt you so you can explore further away from your preconceptions than you might think.

  I have read claims that, during World War II, British intelligence used double agents to feed false reports to the nazis, so they would shift their v2 launches to less populated areas of London, but after thinking a while about it, it starts feeling just confusing enough to possibly be a urban legend. Does anyone have a verifiable source for this?

  TLDR: I spend way too long explaining what changed in my life over the past 6 months. My conclusion is "dramatic improvement is awesome, but is it sustainable?" I wonder if CFAR could have accomplished something similar, but I dunno.

  War on Akrasia, first half of 2016:

  * I started on Buproprion in November 2015. The 150mg doses didn't do much, but when I missed days those days were noticeably worse. I don't remember when, specifically, I switched to 300mg, but it did make a noticeable difference, mood-wise. It's harder to say what it did for productivity (see below).
  * I tried to make myself throw together a simple game for April first. I couldn't do anything but write a bunch of unused code-fragments.
  * On April sixth, someone decided to put up a 24 hour game competition. I managed to submit an entry, then kept expanding on it after the contest was over, pretty much for the next month or so.
  * None of the other standard intervention attempts (which more or less include diet and going outside, since I didn't have many other options) didn't show any reliable results, as usual.
  * On May 15, I arrived at the [Louisiana Center for the Blind](http://louisianacenter.org). I have been trying to put together something coherent to describe the first month there but it is not coming along very quickly. Suffice it to say, it's... different. My feelings are mostly positive so far but "mostly" is not "entirely".
  * LCB is a 6-9 month program. It only took a week for me to go from "too pathetic to leave the house" to "I guess I'll go to Wal-mart this afternoon." Sweet merciful cool breeze in July, does that make a difference! (Also I feel like it's weird that I like going to Wal-mart, of all places, but whatever.)
  * The most obvious changes from home? Being forced to interact with people on a daily basis for most of the day, lots of walking (the apartments are half a mile from the center, which probably isn't much compared to more realistic situations but it's a considerable difference from anything I've dealt with before), and the apartments do not have free internet and I don't feel like paying $50/month and so internet is less trivial than usual. Oh, and not so monotonous as home.
  * Sleep was still being uncooperative, in spite of a fixed schedule. So I tried Melatonin and it seems to have helped some. My body still seemed determined to only sleep for 5 hours, though, even though I got the timing fixed.
  * Productivity is not solved. There are still bad days. But I think it's safe to say it's improved dramatically. Over the course of one weekend, I wrote about as much as I had in the past 3 years put together, as an example. I'm trying to experiment with analyzing photos so I don't have to either hire someone or spend way too much time on calculations and debugging to do simple character animation. Etc. Not exactly 2001-2005, but the past month alone makes 2016 better than 2014 or 2015 in the productivity department.

  Which has the bigger impact: Buproprion, or LCB? Are they both necessary components? How do sleep and the internet fit into this?

  Food quality is not irrelevant, per se, but it's only a decisive factor if I'm drowning in sugar on a daily basis. Even then, I was in a hurry and just bought a couple candy bars at the dollar store for lunch yesterday, and the mental effects that I noticed were far less severe than I expected. (I need to shop at healthier places. I'll note, though, that I was at the dollar store because apparently my already impossibly skinny waistline has been shrinking dramatically since I got here and I neglected to bring a belt. I blame the walking for 3 hours a day in Louisiana summer.)

  I cannot conclude that anything sustainable is to come of this, and I worry that the improvements, though rather dramatic, are not quite so dramatic as I want them to be (\*mumbles something about gift horses\*). Still, mentioning LCB in front of someone who would not make it easy to chicken out of enrolling was probably the best decision I've made in a while.

  "No matter how smart you may be, no matter how much money you may have at you disposal, no matter strength of arms or argument, you simply cannot force people to do something. It costs too much. For all the bombs we have dropped, for all the lives that were lost, in the end this is why the Nazis could not prevail. There is not enough money in the world to truly command and control a populace. The best you can do, all you can hope to do, is create a situation where it is easier for people to do what you want than it is for them to do what you don't. Then no one will seek to oppose you or thwart you aim because it appears you are merely helping them to do what they really want to do. There is, in the end, no defense against cooperation." - Patrick E. McLean, How to Succeed in Evil

    > in the end this is why the Nazis could not prevail. 

    I would attribute that to fighting on two fronts, fighting Russia during the winter, fighting Russia with the US's lend lease backing, and the fact that the US had almost as much industrial capacity as the entire rest of the world at the time.  I think with only one of these things to deal with, the might have held ground and built a longer lasting regime (at least on the order of the USSR in longevity).

    I think maybe the USSR might be a better example for "you simply cannot force people to do something. It costs too much. "

      In context, it's a speech given by a former British intelligence agent to his son, who grew up to be a consultant for comic book supervillains. The book is kind of a rationalist comedy, with a Quirrelmort-like protagonist marveling at the stupidity of everyone around him and trying to manipulate them to his own ends, only to fail because he can't comprehend just how irrational people are. I haven't finished it yet, but so far I like it even if it's rather mean-spirited and cynical.
