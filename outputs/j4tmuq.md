  Umm.  Why is Rain pushing for a democracy, again?  He wants to be in charge as a lord.  The society expects lords to be in charge.

  Even if he's committed to "democracy = good", at the very least he should wait a few weeks until the company is running smoothly.  8-person parties and helping each other kill blues is already a major change for the society.  Let that settle down, then start stepping away from being a lord and towards sharing power in a democracy.

    Cultural brainwashing from birth, also called "grooming". The concept of a liberal democracy is a useful structure for obscuring the horrors of power structures, both for the ruling class and the public. Rain, having a hold of some power, doesn't wish to feel like he's a "bad person".

    These days, Worth the Candle looks like it's exploring the problem of consent of those with no power.
    ```

  - u/zombieking26:
    ```
    Well, what if something happens to him? It's important to set up these rules now, so that when he's no longer in power, the whole thing doesn't fall apart.


    It's basically what actually democracy does well: a smooth transition of power (most of the time, anyway)
    ```

    - u/grahamyvr:
      ```
      He's not setting up an environment for good public discorse, though.  He yells at people in the meeting, his soul-damage is terrifying the unawakened, and he glares at people until they vote the way he wants them to.  That looks like "democracy in name only" to me.

      I'm not certain if the author is going the "flawed protagonist" angle (and is deliberately showing that Rain is starting to go down the "tyrant" route), or if this is just a facet of writing that could be improved with some editing.
      ```

      - u/zombieking26:
        ```
        I don't think he has to become a tyrant for the protagonist to not see himself as that scary. I mean, he obviously sees himself as a lovable dude, and people thought of him like a puppy before he found his armor. I just think the dude needs a reality check that he's way more intimidating then he realizes.
        ```

      - u/baniel105:

        I think it's less rain going down the tyrant route and more rain not being fit to lead atm. I think that's something that'll change eventually.

  Rain is clearly going to infect the entire company with the strange plague of Numbers. At least if things turn out how he wants, anyway. They're also clearly not ready for it, except maybe for Staavo. But at this rate they're going to have to learn just to figure out their compensation and benefits. I wonder if he's going to have to invent the abacus or if there's a local version he can promote, just so people can do the math.

  Are there any fiat currencies in this setting so far? I don't recall for sure whether there's money that isn't formed out of an equivalent value of a precious metal. And it sounds like he's going even beyond that and making the company "credits" abstract entries in a ledger, without any physical currency! I guess that'll be fine as long as all the transactions go through the company. They'd have to "cash out" in the form of some company assets to trade with anyone else.

  EDIT: Ah, I missed this the first time through:

  >Credits, on the other hand, can be exchanged just by moving some numbers around in the quartermaster’s ledger. It’s like how the Bank’s coins aren’t worth the same as the metal they’re made from, just taken one step further by doing away with the metal altogether.”

  So the Banking guild already had fiat currency.

    Given the sheer amount of overmana they are getting from him blasting out Winter non-stop he might well get them to the point where they can do all the numbers in their heads before too long. Well, except Carten.

    I fully anticipate some resistance from people giving up Tels, without a grounding in number theory it is quite easy to perceive what rain is doing as an elaborate excuse to horde all the Tels.

  - u/kurtofconspiracy:
    ```
    That's rather ingenious. Motivate people to learn math by making the math be about their money.

    This sort of education could be revolutionary. It is a shame the story progresses time so slowly we are unlikely to see the ramifications. That's one downside of the current trend of character-driven stories: there aren't many that encompass large swathes of time. Even a Dickens-style entire lifetime narrative can do things that just aren't possible in stories about just a couple of weeks or years.

- u/Allian42:
  ```
  Damn, he is bad at this. Sorry, not trying to poke at it, but the first thing he should have "structured" was not the proceedings of the vote itself, but the proceedings of a meeting. The way it went, Rain explained three times what was needed, everyone else got one third of what they needed to vote, concerns were not addressed, almost no one got to clarify anything and the vote was held anyway. Thankfully, he had some good things passed there, even if a little forced. The rules as they are now will probably contribute to calling things back into question and smoothing things out later.

  Now, the system he proposed is almost point per point the system used by pirates back then with a bit of extra complexity, so it should work well enough. I suspect giving people the chance to take non fighting classes and still being a viable "career" within the group will pay dividends later, the same way Tallheart does. Also math is a extremely good idea. Having people being able to do the math and check the books will dissuade anyone from pointing fingers blindly. Not sure if it's worth teaching a whole new set of numbers and measures just because he prefers it, but that's his free time to use.

  I just wonder how he will set credit values for tasks. "Shares" worked well for pirates, since there was not that much of a power gap between crewmates, there was one task giving dividends (plundering) that everyone joined for and the reward was one massive treasure to be shared. Everyone did the same work, the only ones getting more were the ones doing extra work (captain, quartermaster, surgeon, carpenter, etc) and it was a simple ratio. 

  Here on the other hand, there are several tasks "worth of credits" that not everyone will participate. This means people with specific talents like fighting, healing or even different power levels will claim their contributions should be worth more credits. Not everyone is gonna be as selfless as Ameliah is, and since there is strategy and luck in bidding for a blue, the power gap will not smooth out easily. More than that, it will take one monster dropping a rare item worth a load of credits on one guy's lap to throw the whole credit system on it's head.

    I think he's sort of assuming that existing adventuring parties are usually pirate share style affairs. So that he can build off of that.
    ```

    - u/Allian42:
      ```
      That would help the transition a lot, but I remain very skeptical.
      ```

  Sometimes I wish Rain was just a little more selfish, or a little more competent at his plan of enlightening the masses.

  So, this is the chapter that made me drop my Patreon subscription, if I'm keeping my timelines straight. Reading about Rain trying - badly - to implement democracy while appealing to (but not actually explaining) some sort of half remembered Robert's Rules of Order was not interesting. 

  In fact, it made me feel rather bilked by the Patreon model. Not for the first time, and it's not the author's fault, per se, but I remember thinking: *Am I really paying a subscription for this guy to slowly worldbuild his way to something approaching a story?*

  That puts me now in the unfortunate spot where I have to wait a month or two (had paid for September's advanced stuff too) before I can access new content in a story that already suffers for its serial format. Maybe I'll just pick it back up in half a year. Like other posters have said, I think Delve really does do better when you can consume it in bigger chunks.

    > That puts me now in the unfortunate spot where I have to wait a month or two (had paid for September's advanced stuff too) before I can access new content in a story 

    This is why I think the "pay for advance chapters" concept is flawed. After the first blast of chapters you are no longer paying for a benefit (as chapters still come out at the same frequency) but are now merely doling out money to avoid suffering a detriment (have to wait a month without chapters).
    ```

    - u/Gr_Cheese:
      ```
      That's more of an issue on the author's part than the Patreon model.

      The Wandering Inn? 1 advanced chapter for $5. You don't have to 'drop' the story for a month when you drop Patreon.

      Delve? 8 advanced chapters for $2.50. If you drop the Patreon, you're out of the story for 2 months.

      Both stories are doing *very* well. But they have very different implementations of the same Patreon model. And frankly, with Delve's pacing, I would rarely pay for 1 advanced chapter, so the author has probably made a good decision here.
      ```

    - u/ivory12:
      ```
      Yeah. I mean, I'm happy to pay the comparably tiny fee as a form of support for the author, but you're right that you're not really buying the product at that point.
      ```

    - u/Pirellan:
      ```
      PLus, unless there is a thriving community in Patreon for discussion, you cant really discuss what you've read unless you're willing to drip feed the discussion very slowly.
      ```

  - u/CorneliusPhi:
    ```
    This is why I've started backing for one month then cancelling until there is a new public chapter I haven't seen yet.  Basically forces me to read it in Worth The Candle style batches of 8-10 chapters

  Finally caught up with this. At literally any point I would have liked Rain to try and abuse Overmana. In this chapter we get a few throwaway lines about Winter “helping” the classes that night. A few weeks gave a horse semi-intelligence. These people do not understand the concept of 0 yet he is trying to install some sort of representative (?) democracy. They should have just camped close to the city and gotten used to the “fake” cold of winter, taking his classes and shit, before they moved on.


  I would have MUCH preferred if he said “hey guys, we’re gonna travel into the ranked zone for a bit, if we find some lower level region we’ll drop roots there. If not we build a camp somewhere and work on finding lairs for our unawakened to farm. After we get everyone awakened, we move south for more ascension.” 


  This semi-guild shit is so... odd for me. It’s like, 10 chapters ago he was just trying to lower the barrier. Then he just... gives up control for nothing to the watch? Why not use Fel Sandis to fund ascension if that’s his goal? Why not USE the city in an impenetrable barrier??????


  I really got sucked into this a few days ago, pretty GREAT system exploration and the lair stuff, shit I would say this was 10/10 scratched some CRAZY itches I didn’t even know I HAD with regards to LitRPG up until the bubble shows up.  Basically forcing myself to read the last 30 or so chapters.


  ALSO: at this point I’ve forgotten why it has taken him so long to upgrade mana manipulation. How the fuck is a normal person to get that to 10/10??????? And no matter HOW it happens, with a group of unawakened and Ameliah, his next blue is always gonna feel gifted/weak/Mary sue’d. There were opportunities (lavarro, bring me a lvl 27 blue and I will add your name to the list, or leveraging the Citizen.) to raise his cap in satisfying ways but at this point... just bleh. 



  One thing that WOULD be cool is if he got Ameliah to try out theorycrafted builds. It’s gonna take ALOT of trust from her because he’ll know everything about her at that point, but if he can make her “builds” more specialized that’d be great to see. 

  Or perhaps he creates “Ascension” builds. Like the secret builds of the Watch. The first is Passivist. 


  Ah at this point I’m just kinda ranting sorry lol. I still liked this, 7/10 for me. Just a disappointing end

    Pirates weren't math scholars either. The governing isn't related to mathematics.

    He couldn't wait for weeks or go delving because he's on a rescue and evac mission. He was never going to do what you wanted there.

    He couldn't have fought the watch. They're stronger than him. Besides if he did somehow incapacitate them, he could never leave the barrier limits to go delving or he'd be attacked.

    The consensus in readers is that normal people max mana manipulation over many many years if ever.

    Bringing a silver blue to a rank 11 zone, the blue would've probably died before it arrived. Implication of velika taking him elsewhere for a blue if they ever escaped the barrier were there but then she was attacked and had a mental breakdown.

    Not sure I understand your next blue gifted thing. His entire end goal is to gift blues to everyone in the world. And his working theory is monsters in general need to be fought with a party of 8. He's just following his theory.

    Ameliah already told him she can swap skills. Looking forward to her trying the builds. Passivist is going to be cool. And secrecy of builds is smart at least until they're a very powerful organisation.

    Re: Mana Manipulation

    Easy. Normal items have like 50% efficency as we see when Rain recharges the hotplates. I have little doubt that actual training items have something like 100% efficiency (many of them probably even allow you to just siphon most of the mana off so you can use it in a charging loop) and thus the fact that they only have like 1% of the mana regen doesn't actually make them level up in the skill slower then Rain.

    The fact that Rain hasn't spent a hour picking up a normal charging item at the store and then the next day just training his skill up to 10 is honestly pretty appaling.
    ```

- u/hwc:
  ```
  It seems to me that second-in-command should be a different position from quartermaster. Rain needs someone designated to take over when he is incapacitated in battle, probably not Vanna.
  ```
