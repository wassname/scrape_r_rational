  People who've been following. I stopped maybe 10 chapters back. Is it worth picking back up.

    Yes. I did a re-read a month ago up to ch 101, because I read up to ch 85ish in my first read 6 months ago. The more recent chapters have a large battle at the northern front against zombies and other interesting developments. 

    I do wish the earlier chapters could get an edit. The Hero's war is so close to being really good, if it had an editor.
