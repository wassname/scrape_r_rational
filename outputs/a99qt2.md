## Which weekly threads?

### Post:

When a system has grown up by accretion, it's often a good idea to take a step back and look it over and see if it seems to be working.  And try some changes, which, if they don't work, can be reverted.  End-of-year seems like a good time to review our weekly thread system.

I'll open with these proposals:

* Delete the Monday general rationality thread, because it seems low-volume.
* Change the Friday "Off-topic" thread to an "Open" thread.  The general rationality can go there.
* Weekly recommendations threads, instead of monthly, since monthly doesn't seem often enough to let me recommend nice things I've recently read.  We could have a monthly roundup post of the previous month's strong recommendations if anyone wanted to do one.  Monday seems like a good day.
* Weekly request threads, since we seem to have multiple posts per week from somebody who wants to ask for particular fiction recommendations.  Sunday would put this thread just ahead of the weekly recommendations thread, which seems synergetic.

This would make the new weekly system:

* Sunday:  Requests thread.
* Monday:  Recommendations thread.
* Tuesday:  Empty thread.
* Wednesday:  Worldbuilding thread.
* Thursday:  Does not exist.  There are no Thursdays.  There have never been any Thursdays.  You are imagining the Thursdays.  There are only six days in the week.  Why are you seeing Thursdays everywhere.
* Friday:  Open thread.
* Saturday:  Munchkinry thread.

  I'm on board with that. It would also probably come with a new rule that people stop posting requests outside of request threads, especially since a lot of them come from the same set of people making the same frequent requests. I'll talk to the other mods (here or via PM) and make the changes to Automod sometime that's not Christmas.

    I think that is no good idea. Recommendations are often asked by new users and having them redirected to a general post, where they most likely vanish in the masses, will turn them away.

        Two stickies shouldn't be considered a limiting factor here. You just make a sticky thread that then links to the other threads. Let automod edit the thread each week to keep it current and the problem is solved with less (or equal) maintenance overhead than the default.

        Besides, one of our current sticky threads is a three week old "biweekly" challenge that has had 3 participants between the last 3 challenges. Even offering gold to the winner isn't bringing people in to write for those.

          The challenge is likely going the way of the dodo, in part because of a lack of participation, and in part because I just don't have the time/effort needed for it, especially in winter.

          r/anime does indeed have such a bot and it works fairly well. Not only, but someone made a [massive flowchart](https://imgur.com/gallery/yPVPj9Q) with questions that lead to your ideal 'starting' anime base on what you're looking for.

      Ideally we'd have some actual data to back that up, like, say, going back through the last three months and profiling the users who are making those requests (e.g. account age, comment/post history on this subreddit, involvement subsequent to request post, etc.). I will point out that those users are quite often pointed to either the search function or the general threads anyway, just not very often by the mods.

    Why wouldn't you just add a limit for those people? Maybe only one request post post per person a month? Though I guess it's probably better to wait for the new changes to settle before making any decisions.

    Why Empty?

    Otherwise, works for me as long as the Friday thread stays in place.

      > Why Empty?

      I'm interpreting "Empty" as there is no thread for that day. As opposed to on Thursdays, where there is no day for that thread. If you think there's a thread worth having on Tuesday, go ahead and propose it but, in general, I don't think we need to have a thread on all six days of the week just for the sake of it.

  Overall look good to me. Weekly request thread is the only one that seems like it may not work out, since most people will probably not want to wait up to a week to get recommendations when they're looking. It may consolidate recs for those who may be looking for new things to read though, which seems useful, if people use it.
  ```

    ```
    This subreddit isn't *that* active. As long as people know to use the request thread even when it is a few days old it could work I think.
    ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    If you can't wait a few more days to avoid cluttering up the subreddit with a new separate thread... then, uh, tough luck you have to wait anyways?

  Requests/Recommendations should be in the same thread, IMO. (Most) people aren't going to be making new requests each week-- they'll have a general idea of what they want, post once, and get their itches scratched (hopefully). Plus, having dedicated weekly threads will mean that people will be more likely to see other requests, and if those requests match what they'd request, then they won't make their own requests, driving down the overall volume of requests.

  Meanwhile, the request threads, as collections of recommendations tailored to specifications, will already be serving as a de-facto recommendation thread anyways, especially since people recommend stuff that is merely tangentially related. So it serves both purposes to have a single thread.

  The other thing I'd suggest is to make the Wednesday thread a tuesday thread instead, but also make it a general "OC writing/worldbuilding critique/discussion" thread (snappier title pending). Currently, I typically use friday off-topic if I want a specific bit of writing critiqued, and have gotten some excellent feedback. But with the monday thread content moved to the friday thread, it doesn't need that additional function of writing review to keep it active. Meanwhile, giving it three full days of time where it's the main thread increases the chance that people will pop in and interact with people spitballing stories. To make sure that thread isn't just spamming chapters and begging for review, though, I'd propose a requirement that the OP of any subthread must also provide review for at least one other poster on the thread. Moderator enforcement wouldn't be necessary; if someone made a habit of leeching, the community at large could simply refuse to interact with the leech.

  I do essentially agree with your points, though.

    Requests and recommendations do feel like different functions to me.  Does anyone else want to chime in on this with an opinion?

    Writing/Worldbuilding Wednesdays make sense to me.  Though I wouldn't go putting any measures to prevent people spamming chapters and begging for reviews unless we actually see that happening.  Wait for something to break before fixing it (on those occasions when a patch later is just as good as a patch in advance).

      Requests and recommendations usually go together. /r/anime has one weekly thread for both, and most subreddits that do one do both.

      Hmm. Now that it's brought up, requests and recommendations really do seem to be two sides of the same coin. One is requesting a specialized, personalized recommendation while the other is broadcasting an unrequested general rec.

      (most posts in both threads are parts of key/value pairs: a subset of recommendation criteria and fics that fulfill that criteria. General recommendations are simply responding to the request of "what things do you think /r/rational would like". )

    FWIW, we did have a weekly "Writing Skills" thread ([see here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=writing+skills&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)), but it was posted independently by /u/xamueljones and then never canonized/automated in the same way that the monthly recommendation thread was.

    I don't object to bringing it back. The big risk is that there are a bunch of automated threads that don't get much discussion ... ideally we'd have automation for the automation that would generate an overview of discussion activity and flag things for review.

      Well, for certain definitions of "automation"...

      I can start updating [my (newly updated) spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NWuBAATJVbEQEUWcUy7Jt5D5URJfXkiMj3e3Hzq69do/edit?usp=sharing) weekly. What values do you want to watch for, aside from the obvious ones I'm already tracking?

  ```
  I was born on the last Thursday. It was Christmas. Christmas day, December 25th, 1969, (Capricorn) to be exact. A lot of smart, well-informed people insist that the last Thursday was the zero time, January 1st 1970. But zero time was technically always off. Programmers hate complicated maths problems. And well, we hate complicated physics problems even more. Only last year did the TAI finally stopped dragging their feet and finally ammend zero time to be Wednesday, December 31st, 1969 23:59 and 58 seconds, due to previous leap second errors. January 1st 1970 was a Friday, we just didn't know it back then. A lot of unpleasantness was addressed about that during the previous TAI conference and I don't intend to dig any further and pick open old wounds. 

  Anyway, I'm looking forward to the next Thursday! The TAI made up for their previous error and so the next zero time is February 7th, 2036 and it's going to be great! Already though, I can tell a lot of busy bodies will be trying to explain that no, zero time is somehow two years later, in 2038. Clearly, they've been in a cacoon for the last five decades, and have missed this little thing. You might have heard of it. It's called the Internet. Ya, Hello? Call me, maybe, when you've hatched. It's a big deal, Capital I and everything, just like mother. And At 6:28 and 14 seconds on February 7th, 2036 we can all feast our many eyes and experience the transition from Friday, back to a proper Thursday. I'm really looking forward, even though it's not my birthday, not exactly. Although, I hear Harlan Stenn is a big fan and plans on making future Thursdays possible as well.

  Sounds good to me. The only alteration I might do is move the Sunday thread to a weekday, as it seems to me that weekend weekly threads are slower (tho this is a hunch supported by no data).

  Why not move it to monthly, and see if that's enough volume?

    You would have to sticky it. Otherwise, there is no way it will stay in the front page for the whole month. And if you keep doing it month after month, that permanently takes up one of the two sticky threads slots.

- u/aldonius:
  ```
  I hear /u/Agasthenes on requests being mostly made by new users, and I hear other people on combining requests and recommendations. 

  So I'm suggesting that we have combined threads, twice a week?
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Looks good to me but I also think recommendations and requests should be combined. We're not such a large subreddit that would in any way lead to difficulty in navigation, it'd still be easy to read through the whole thread, so I don't see any downside to increasing the density of comments on one thread.
  ```

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    It might be helpful if they weren't tangled up together.

    One way to do this in the same post:

    R&R Post (which says "only comment on the first two comments.")

    \-Comment: Requests here.

    \-Comment: Recommendations here.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I really don't think so. There just aren't enough comments in this sub for that to be a concern. There'll probably be no more than 10 top level comments on any given thread, easy to scroll through and skim everything.
      ```
