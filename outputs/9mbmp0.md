  "I bet my hand on the new age."
  - ~~Shanks~~ Hakram

  I feel like Hakram will have a lot of things to talk about with Cat once she gets back. I do wonder how exactly any of their decisions might have changed if they listened to Vivi. Wasn't she an advocate of the bonfine plan?

  This also ties in a nice parallel to Grey Pilgrim's words : "Your people are being warped by your presence", but it's actually more along the lines of "becoming better people".
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    They're becoming better utilitarians. Grey Pilgrim is a deontologist. Things are good or bad to the degree that they are mediated by Above or Below, and no greater purpose in any action exists. Things like context and subtlety are not lost on him, but they don't matter. He wields Good as a blunt instrument, bashing the world into shape, and damn the consequences or those crushed by his club.

    Cat is the exact opposite. She will make pact with demons and angels alike if it serves her purposes, and her purposes serve her vision of a stable world. Good and Evil are meaningless to her, but she wields both like a scalpel, trying to minimize the damage done in the process. Those who follow her see what she is doing and seek to emulate it, even when their natures rebel at the task. 

    As always, Catherine Foundling is the Breaker of Stories, and the stories she breaks the most are always those of thd people closest to her.

  Also, Adjutant is a new Name.  No one has had it before.   It's also unaligned.  I think that's a core thing about the Woe vs. the Calamities.  

  The Calamities: 

  1. The Black Knight (Evil) 
  2. Warlock (Evil) 
  3. Ranger (Neutral) 
  4. Assassin (Evil)
  5. Captain (Neutral)  (I'm guessing this isn't an exclusively Praesi Name but I could be wrong)

  The Woe 

  1. Catherine (formerly Squire thus evil... now just something else, but Winter related so still evil.) 
  2. The Apprentice (Evil) --> Heirophant (Neutral) 
  3. Archer (Neutral) 
  4. Adjutant (Neutral) 
  5. Thief (Good/Neutral)   

  The Woe have been moving away from Evil Names throughout the series.     The Calamities subverted their evil names but didn't change them.

    Squire was actually a neutral transitional name, since it could become White Knight or Black Knight (which is interesting, because Good characters tend to treat Cat like she sold her soul, regardless). I think Apprentice might have also been a neutral transitional name, but I don't recall well enough to state that as fact.
    ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      > which is interesting, because Good characters tend to treat Cat like she sold her soul, regardless

      My impression was that the name itself is neutral, but any given Squire falls squarely into a hero or villain role. One that is more open to redemption or fall stories, perhaps, but still neatly defined.
      ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Agreed, though I don't know if 'neutral' names really exist, the name is a blessing from above or below, nothing in between, with the only exception maybe being Cat whose name/mantle isn't from creation and thus may not be bound so strictly to its rules.

    The question on whether winter is evil is something I have been thinking about, and I don't think it is, it's just... Primal, winter is the need to dominate and satiate, it is the need for food and warmth, or the absence of those things.
    ```

    - u/XeL09:
      ```
      +1 for neutral names not existing.  i think the "neutral" names can go either way depending on circumstances while others are always good/evil aligned, e.g. Black Night/Warlock is always Evil or Wizard  of the West/Champion names are always Good.
      ```

    - u/Schuano:
      ```
      As someone said above, the "Squire" Name can go Black Knight or White Knight and Ranger is explicitly neutral.
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        It has nothing to do with the position of the name, but the entities who bestow the power, Ranger is almost certainly empowered by the gods Below, because she is an element of utter chaos in the story, even if she does occasionally help out or train a good guy, she herself is still Chaotic neutral at best.

        Neutrality does not exist within names, they are either good or evil, neutrality would completely negate the point of names in the first place, as they only exist  to further the bet between the gods above and below.
        ```

        - u/Schuano:
          ```
          I suppose... but then why did Hunter (A good name) go and train with Ranger... an evil one.    

          Or take the Heirarch... Is that a Good Name or an Evil Name since theoretically anyone in the seven cities can get it?
          ```

          - u/signspace13:
            ```
            Ranger doesn't care who she trains, she just requests a certain level of competence or interest, note that she refused to train William. It's possible that some names can be empowered by either depending on the situation, like the Wandering bard, Hunter was a hero, but he may have turned villain given the right motivation.
            ```

            - u/Frommerman:
              ```
              I don't think the Bard is a hero at all. She seems to work against Evil most of the time, but it's implied that her motivations are entirely her own. Neshamah referring to her as Intercessor also implies that her Role is to foster...communication? Between the sides. In any case, her Name works entirely differently from anyone else's in that it makes her absolutely, conceptually immortal even if she doesn't want to be. Always being wherever the Story is regardless of whether she wants to be also implies that she is supposed to be a kind of observer. She is the recorder, and the record, of the Bet of Creation.
              ```

              - u/turtleswamp:
                ```
                I think the Wandering Bard is the Game Master figure.

                Her name is that of a narrator, she pops in and out rarely having a direct impact on events, and she has generally acted to escalate the conflict between good and evil. Could be she's acting as a moderator/judge for the contest the gods are having and her role is mainly to nudge things towards the eventual resolution by preventing long periods of coexistence between good and evil.
                ```

      - u/Agnoman:
        ```
        >the "Squire" Name can go Black Knight or White Knight

        I don't think that this is the same thing as the Squire name being a Neutral name being "neutral", as in something that's *neither* Good/Evil or from Above/Below. Rather, Squire is something that can *either* be Good or Evil (but is going to be leaning in one direction / given by one side).

        For instance, when Cat gets the Name, it's made pretty clear that it's a Villainous Role given by the God's Below. See Cat constantly talking abut how she was given it by the Gods Below, how the Name pushed back against a redemption story, how every character talks about Cat's position, or these WOGs:

        >“The Squire Role isn’t always Evil, no. It largely depends on who they’ll be squiring for, though anyone squiring for Black is going to be Evil. Catherine taking the shortcut he offered made that a done deal: since he effectively used his own Name to kickstart hers, there’s going to be bleed over in several ways. As for the possibility of a “good” Squire, for that kind of a Name to appear there’d need to be an equivalent to the Black Knight out and about. ~~ *Erratic Errata 1.9*

        and

        >the Name tricks displayed so far are something pretty much every Named can do with a little training, save for the necromancy – which is for Evil Names only, and not all of them. ~~ *Erratic Errata 2.4*

        ---
        >Ranger is explicitly neutral

        Not quite?

        The only real evidence I can find for this is that Black said:

        >“Calling Ranger a villain is something of a stretch,” my own teacher finally said. “She’s not particularly concerned with matters of Good and Evil. Mostly, she does what she feels like doing. We can discuss it more later, Catherine – it’s a somewhat complicated issue.”

        back in 2.11. Which isn't saying that she's not a villain, it's saying that it's complicated. But the Name was presumably given by one side, unless there's a whole other set of gods we've never heard of (Gods To-The-Side?).

        Whether that name came from Above or Below, well, there's only one set of Gods that's okay with people just doing what they feel like doing:

        >“The influence of the gods is usually on the subtle side. You’re right that Evil Roles usually let people do whatever they feel like doing – that’s because they’re, in that sense, championing the philosophy of their gods. Every victory for Evil is a proof that that philosophy is the right path for Creation to take.

        >...

        >Good Roles have strict moral guidelines because those Names are, in fact, being guided: those rules are instructions from above on how to behave to make a better world. Any victory for Good that follows from that is then a proof of concept for the Heavens being correct in their side of the argument”  ~~ *Erratic Errata 1.12*


        That said, Names certainly seem to be able to shift away from the alignment they're given. There's all the redemption stories thrown at Cat, or Thief's transition to Villain-hood.
        ```

    - u/OmniscientQ:
      ```
      It was my understanding that Roles and Names were never directly or explicitly created by the Gods, Above or Below. Paraphrasing, since my recall is imperfect, the first chapter said something like, "Eventually, the pattern repeated often enough that grooves were worn into the fabric of Creation, so that the stories happened more easily with each cycle."

      Named are referred to as Blessed or Cursed, as Gifted or Damned, but that's the religion of the mortals showing. It's not a confirmation that the Gods are deciding who gets which Name. I'm pretty sure that the whole Role and Name mechanics are what we'd call emergent behavior. The Gods didn't plan for it when they set up creation, but it's kinda cool, so why patch it out?
      ```

      - u/CoronaPollentia:
        ```
        I don't think so - that goes against the premise. I think it's more like Creation was explicitly set up as a substrate to run narratives on, with individuals gaining culturally-established Roles, and then the Gods Above and Below investing those Roles with extra power. So you've got three layers - mundane creation, the place where things happen - setting. The narrative layer, the place where Roles get worn in - plot, and to some extent character. The Name layer, where the Gods have their say - this supercharges the character aspects of the Narrative layer by granting distinct Aspects. Arcadia is basically a high-energy prototype of Creation, where instead of having the Gods invest through the Name layer, there's just a ton of power tied up in Roles, aligned to fluid dualities rather than Good and Evil. Kind of a proof-of-concept. The devs screwed up and didn't sandbox it right, which is why you can get arbitrary courtier execution in Arcadia from Creation. There's no way that will be a problem, though, it would take a one-in-a-million chance to set up circumstances so that a potent Arcadian mantle... would... become invested in a. Creation native. Shit shit shit rollback rollback ROLLBACK-

      Does Hye's chaotic stabby count?
      ```

- u/MutantMannequin:
  ```
  I'm interested to see what she proposes, because, up until this point, I really do think her status as an obstacle has been entirely her own fault. She's objected to plenty of plans, but I can't think of a time she's provided a workable alternative prior to her suggestion in Zwischenzug. Hakram is hearing her out, but by the end of this chapter, all she delivered was some useless moralizing. Ball's in your court, Viv. Prove me wrong.
  ```

  - u/tavitavarus:
    ```
    You raise a fair point. When you're an underdog nation surrounded by enemies, being nice is a luxury and she has never offered a viable alternative to Catherine's more ruthless actions. Also I think her complaints about not being an equal voice in decision making is a bit odd since she was the character Cat listened to most during the first arc of Book 4.

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  Summary:

  * Here, have some more worldbuilding
  * Thief finds it reassuring that Hakram randomly cut his own hand off in the middle of a conversation without providing any explanation
  * Thief is important because she values Cat's vision of a better world and isn't as willing as the rest of the Woe to set it aside in the name of expediency
  * She's also important because she's the head of the intelligence service
  * She doesn't value herself and apparently no one else does either because they've mostly been ignoring her
  * The author doesn't value her much either, since the update shows her complaining and then cuts away as she starts saying things that are important and relevant to her character

  Good Lord, could we *please* get back to the actual plot?!
