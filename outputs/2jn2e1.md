## [BST][Q][D] Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rationality

### Post:

I'm currently starting on a rational version of Code Geass, but I'm having a bit of difficulty. In-series, they don't give much info on the geography of Tokyo (i.e where things are in terms of the Tokyo wards). I was wondering if anyone would be willing to offer advice or help, especially on the geography side of things.

Additionally, is this series something people want to see? Do people think it's a good idea, or would a rational!Code Geass fail?

  The answer to virtually ever "would it work if/is it a good idea to/etc" question about writing is, "Yes, if done well."

    Worst case: it becomes a funny crackfic as it goes totally off the rails. If well written, that's still fun to read.

  Lelouch's geass is too powerful. The obvious problem is that he can (metaphorically) wish for more wishes, which any reasonably rational person would do instantly. Particularly since (iirc) his power works on entire crowds at once, possibly through recordings or streaming video. The thing is, even if it _doesn't_ it's still way too powerful.

    Geass obviously doesn't work via video, otherwise it would be able to affect Viletta in 2nd(?) episode while she were inside Knightmare. Also, Geass has maximum range of about 200 m, as Lelouch figured out a bit later.

    About limitations - maybe people under constant Geass (unlike short one) could suffer mental breakdown. This could force Lelouch to be more accurate with his power.

    Also, this wasn't explored, but Geass was extensively studied by it's Cult, which had ties with Britania. Thus, there could be safety protocols against potential Geass user (of course, their true meaning isn't known to people outside of Royal Family, and even then only to few).

    Also, Lelouch's life could be made MUCH more difficult if Kornelia/Schneizel knew about existance of Geass.

      Well, Knightmares don't use video, anyways. But you are corrrect in that it doesn't work via video.

      I'm not entirely sure what limitations I'm putting in yet, but that sounds like a good idea. I'm also thinking about making it more specific, as in, Lelouch has to be more specific with his commands. Think programming.

      There definitely is stuff to do with Britannians having anti-Geass stuff. For instance, Jeremiah had a thing that could cancel Geass powers. It makes no sense that he was the only person who had this.

      I'm intending to make Cornelia and Schneizel the true antagonists of the series, rather than Charles. I'm intending to treat Charles as sort of a crazy puppet ruler that is allowed to follow his own ideas, just as long as they don't mess with everything else. Schneizel actually runs everything.

        Charles can alter your memories and cripple you at will.

        If you want him to be a puppet ruler then Schneizel needs code/some other way of resisting geass (which is probably a good idea anyway, or Lelouch insta-wins).

  I'm not sure whether you've already seen this, but the wiki has some information on Tokyo, like here: http://codegeass.wikia.com/wiki/Tokyo_Settlement. It uses Tokyo railroad lines to explain the basic geography so it shouldn't be too hard to compare it to a map of real-life Tokyo and it's railroad maps. Beyond that, I doubt that there's very much information on it. The show was not very specific about these things, especially since the alternate history doesn't really make sense. Even the location of Pendragon in Brittania is not certain, though the wiki says it's somewhere in Arizona. I think it would be okay to just look at real-life maps of Tokyo and make stuff up as long as you're consistent. I would be very interested in a rational Code Geass story as long as Lelouch's personality doesn't change much. The show had its flaws, but the characters aside from Suzaku were the main appeal for me.

  That is my favourite series. Looking forward to your fic!

  What I'd like to see is justification for the mechs. Or, alternately, they could be replaced with tanks utilizing all the same tech.

  I've lived a year in Tokyo. I can't promise I can answer everything (Tokyo is huge), but if you have any questions, I'll see what I can do.
