  From the page:

  > The year is 1921, and a little over a century has passed since a great mind unraveled the underpinnings of life itself.  Every week, it seems, the papers announce great advances, solving the riddle of immortality, successfully reviving the dead, the cloning of living beings, or blending of two animals into one.  For those on the ground, every week brings new mutterings of work taken by ‘stitched’ men of patchwork flesh that do not need to sleep, or more fearful glances as they have to step off the sidewalks to make room for great laboratory-grown beasts.  Often felt but rarely voiced is the notion that events are already spiraling out of the control of the academies that teach these things.

  > It is only this generation, they say, that the youth and children are able to take the mad changes in stride, accepting it all as a part of day to day life.  Of those children, a small group of strange youths from the Lambsbridge Orphanage stand out, taking a more direct hand in events.

  There's six chapters up in the very first arc, and I'd say Wildbow's at the top of his game again. If you stopped reading his work in *Pact*, now's a great time to start again. Twig has some massive differences from both *Worm* and *Pact*, since it begins with a complete party of main characters from scene one, and the protagonist absolutely sucks at fighting. 

  If you read the primer chapters Wildbow wrote after *Worm*, you'll recognize the setting as the one from *Boil*, however the characters and story have nothing in common. It has a little in common with *The Mysterious Benedict Society* so far, but with more evil. Much more.

    Well, I guess that's my cue to give it a shot.

    (Though I would be more optimistic if you were /u/ProfessionalOpinions.)

    Oh my goodness, get fucking hype. As a Wildbow fan who dropped off during *Pact*, thank you so much for reminding me this is a thing that exists. A perfect size for the *MoR*-shaped hole in my heart.

    I stand behind that statement fully. I stopped reading somewhere along the way during Pact, but Twig, so far, seems to be just great. It's not *amazing* yet, but it's off to a really great start.

    Do people generally think Pact was less good than Worm?  Has Wildbow said anything to that effect?

    I'd agree, but I'd be curious to see if people discussed it anywhere.

      Pretty much everyone did, [including the author](https://wildbow.wordpress.com/2015/03/07/pact-sealed/).
      ```

      - u/OffColorCommentary:
        ```
        I missed the author's commentary on that, thanks!

        I was hoping for more musings on Pact's structural problems, but I can still appreciate that having the wrong work pattern can have such a visible impact.

  Is it fun? Lighthearted? Whimsical?
  ```

  - u/noggin-scratcher:
    ```
    >Fun? 

    It has its moments of humour.

    >Lighthearted? Whimsical? 

    Not really, no. I don't think those are words that wildbow is particularly familiar with.
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      Wildbow's idea of whimsical and lighthearted is a superhero telling highschool kids about the awesome fun of meth.
      ```

      - u/chthonicSceptre:
        ```
        Every part of that sentence is only partially correct.
        ```

        - u/Iconochasm:
          ```
          Admittedly it's hyperbolic, but I'd be interested to see you diagram that.
          ```

          - u/chthonicSceptre:
            ```
            I... I meant it was incorrect as a factual description, not grammatically...
            ```

            - u/Iconochasm:
              ```
              That's what I meant too.  I had thought what I had written was more "technically correct but so divorced from context as to be deceiving".
              ```

        - u/holomanga:
          ```
          The bigger question is would I get forsworn for saying that?
          ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    Wildbow's writing it, so the answer is "sort of". The world is rather dark, but the characters don't angst or dwell on it too much, and there's been quite a bit pf character driven humor so far.

    What do *you* think?
    ```

- u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
  ```
  I've really enjoyed how much of an unlikeable cynic the protagonist is. In 1.3 he thinks some things to himself that make the setting seem like Crapsack World, but I felt this sense of optimism, that he was wrong about how shitty everything is.

  The plotting and manipulation has been very fun to read, too.
  ```

- u/somnicule:
  ```
  God damn, I wanted Boil because of the setting, but wasn't that fond of where the plot seemed to be going. I'm really enjoying it so far.
  ```

  - u/notentirelyrandom:
    ```
    Do we know that this *isn't* the same setting as Boil? I'm rereading the samples now, and it seems like it could be a different focus in the same world. What with the rampant biomedical engineering based on "Shelley's codex," and the artificial life being called "voltaic." I'm pretty sure Twig used the same term, and the voltaic horses were "sewn together like patchwork." There's also a colloquial reference to "stitch" servants.

    Boil could be later, or on a different continent, but I'm strongly suspecting it's at least kind of the same setting.
    ```

    - u/somnicule:
      ```
      That was a positive "god damn".

      I feel like the difference between Boil and Twig will be similar to the difference between early incarnations of Worm and what it ended up being. Worldbuilding, ideas and themes, maybe characters, but not an actual shared canon.
      ```

  ```
  wait, so is pact finished?

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    Yep.

  My thoughts as I read 1.1:

  > How does it go?  The first lesson, something even the uninitiated know.  For life to flourish on the most basic level, it requires four elements.  Carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen.

  And phosphorus. I cannot think of even a single life form that doesn't use phosphorus. ATP. Phospholipid bilayer membranes. Phosphate groups in DNA/RNA backbones. The stuff is in fucking everything.

  But okay. Go on.

  > Kitties,” Lillian whispered, horror overtaking fear in her expression.

  *giggle* Yeah okay, I know it isn't supposed to be funny, but it just reminded me about Tom Riddle and his jar of kitten hearts.

  > As if to follow the thought, Lillian’s foot skidded on the bottom of the trough, and she tipped forward, straight into Helen’s arms.  The creature stopped its slow consumption of the cat’s litter.

  Lillian is going to be the Panacea of this story, isn't she?

  > “You go second,” Lillian whispered to me.  “I know you well enough to know that If you go before me you’ll look up my skirt.”

  What? How does *that* work? He'd have to go *after* her to do that.

  > She accepted Gordon’s support in getting down to the downspout, and began her slow descent.

  Oh, they're going *down*, okay that makes sense.

  > It all had an odor.  There were smells that became second nature, and there were smells that were ingrained in the psyche as bad smells.  Ones that spoke of death, of long sickness, and of violence.  Rendered fat, decay, and blood.  Each were heavy on the air.

  Bonesaw's lab?

  > It wasn’t the first time I had told myself any of those things.  I’d heard it from Gordon.  It didn’t make it any less annoying.

  Getting a pre-Bonesaw!Brian vibe from Gordon.

  > I let go, and enjoyed both the moment of utter terror and Lillian’s gasp of horror, before my fingers caught hold of the window frame below.

  And an [abridged!Kirito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0) vibe from Sy.

  > I was nodding before the word came out of his mouth.  “You.”

  > “You’re clever,” I praised him.

  > “Why?”

  > I made the universal gesture for money, rubbing thumb against two fingers.

  Abridged!Kirito is a sociopath, in case you were wondering.

  > “If you don’t follow through, you won’t get a deal like this again,” I said.  “Think hard before you try cheating me.  A big part of what we do is find people.

  Heh. Sy recruits for the mafia.

  > Helen spoke for the first time in a while.  Her voice was cute.  “The Academy sends its regards, Mr. Snake Charmer.”

  And it's over. Ending with a bunch of victorian preteens killing a guy in cold blood. BEST FIRST CHAPTER EVER.
  ```

- u/Tringard:
  ```
  Just finished the first chapter and this looks very promising. If I didn't have a presentation in the morning I'd eagerly binge the rest. Like others, thanks for the alert that he has moved on from Pact, that just wasn't holding my interest as Worm did.
  ```
