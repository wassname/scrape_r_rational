  After almost two years, there's finally an update!

  This is an amazingly well-written story of a self-insert and there are plenty of moments of cleverness, hilarity, and rationality as the SI reasons through the underlying laws of slap-stick comedy/tropes dictating the worlds he falls into.

  The first part of the story begins [here](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality). Reading the first chapter should be enough to determine if you like the story or not.

  Catching up on volume one of this and loving it. Minor spoiler follows of an action the protagonist made that had slipped my mental list of actions to take were I to get into a similar situation, but is absolutely a great idea:

  When the protagonist [(spoiler)](#s "pops back to his home universe and spends a good chunk of time on SpaceBattles croudsourcing his decision-making, he pretty much made the best possible choice. Makes me want to write an SI where I include a post on /r/rational ...")
