## One week time limit: Download The Two Year Emperor for free

### Post:

Hi folks,

Short version:  if you would like to read The Two Year Emperor you have one week to download it from:

[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/two_year_emperor.tgz](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/two_year_emperor.tgz)

This includes absolutely everything -- all the author's notes, all the reviews, the timeline, various snippets that didn't get used, everything.  It goes away May 26 my time and I'm on the other side of the Date Line from most of you, so don't wait.


Long version:

As I've mentioned before, I am trying to monetize 2YE.  This is a story that I wrote and put online for free for two years (which is rather apropos considering the name).  A couple days ago I posted the first 8 chapters to Amazon under the "you can borrow this book for free and I get paid more money" option, which seemed like a win for everyone. 

Now, Amazon has an exclusivity requirement, so I had to remove those 8 chapters from fanfiction.net.  The simple thing would have been to remove the whole story, but I chose to instead replace those chapters with a pointer saying "you can still read this for free on Amazon, and the other chapters are still here."  I thought I was doing the right thing and choosing the best option for everyone.

I've since been informed that this seems like an exploitative bait'n'switch -- that having the story up is bait, and then people come in to read it and whoops! they have to go to Amazon and have a Kindle Unlimited account.  (Granted, I also gave a pointer to the free trial version of KU, but the person in question said that free trials are also bait'n'switch, because people will forget to cancel the trial before being charged.)

I don't agree with this assessment, but I see how some people might.  I'd rather not have a reputation for being exploitative, so I'm going to give the complete story away for another week and then remove it.  After this week it will be a purely commercial venture, although you can of course still get it for free through KU if you have an account.

  For what it's worth, I think you're doing the best you could with what you've got. It all seems fair to me, in any case, and this is definitely a good gesture :)

  Could you monetize 2YE without going through amazon, and therefore avoid the exclusivity silliness?
  ```

    EDIT: I had a response with specific numbers and such, but it was complicated.  Let me boil it down.

    Monetizing this in any way other than the one I'm using would cost me money.  Either due to publishing on sites with smaller audiences, publishing under options that have much smaller royalties, or paying the fees for print on demand.  The way I've done it gives me the most money and gives you the option to read it for free while I still get paid.  You just need to create a KU account using the free trial link that I've provided, read 2YE, and then remember to cancel the KU account within a month, which is pretty easy if you schedule a reminder on your Google Calendar.

      Do you plan on stopping writing at some point in the future? Have you considered more indirect methods of monetizing your work, inclduing for example building up a patreon following or something like that?
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        I actually [created a Patreon several weeks ago](http://patreon.com/davidstorrs).  I've been faffing around letting the perfect be the enemy of the good but in response to your comment I just launched it.

        And no, I do not currently plan to stop writing, although the future is uncertain and savings is a limited thing.

          Cool. Now I can support you directly. You know I really enjoyed Y2E.

            Wow.  That's really awesome.  Thank you so much.
            ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Wait I'm confused. Why would you be only making money from sales with the KU account? Shouldn't you be earning something if people buy it directly with the $2.99 price?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It's not that you don't get money from sales. You do. It's a revenue optimization problem. If you get $`X` every time someone borrows the book and $`Y` every time buys the book, and Amazon exclusivity costs you `Z` new readers who would convert to sales/patrons/fans at rate `A`, the optimal path to maximizing revenue is `B`.

  I downloaded it, I really enjoyed the story overall, it was a true, fun rational event. And I think it scales really well, as things get more and more serious.

  >bait'n'switch 

  !?!? just have an authors note saying so on p1. not bait and switch if they know beforehand right? 

  Good luck with monetizing!!

    I'm probably one of the only people who cares, so let me see if I can explain:

    Originally, 2YE was put up on ff.net. We (generally) liked it, shared it, commented on it, reviewed it, and offered suggestions for it, many of which made their way into work itself. 2YE owes much of its success to the fact that it was free online for anyone to read. 2YE owes some fractional amount of its ideas to the readers who would comment on each chapter as it was posted. There wasn't any indication that the story would be taken down and locked into Amazon's service.

    There were threads like ["Crowdsourcing plot points for Book II"](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2mdy5l/spoilers_bst_crowdsourcing_plot_points_for_the/) or ["If you were Jake, what would you do?"](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2a2vrk/q_if_you_were_jake_in_the_two_year_emperor_what/) or ["What would you ask Loki?"](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2bj6ag/q_mk_what_would_you_ask_loki_two_year_emperor/) It was in many ways a community thing. People contributed because it was open to everyone. And now, in a week's time it's going to be locked into Amazon's service, probably indefinitely. I already have the story downloaded using Calibre, which I did a long time ago. It's not a matter of me personally not being able to read it, it's that I see/saw 2YE as being this friendly community thing, and see this move as disregarding the community in order to make a buck.

    I wouldn't have had a problem with it if 2YE had been pay-to-play from the get-go, or if the stated intention was always to shut down the story on ff.net and sell it, but if that had been the case I don't think it would be as successful a story as it is today, for a number of reasons.

    And that's why I think it's a bait and switch.

  Aw man, thanks for this, but un-styled html is about the worst reading format that exists. I guess it's probably easy enough to convert it to epub though.

  And I don't think you'd get a bad reputation even if you hadn't given it away, to be honest. Plenty of authors take down their stories for no reason at all, and the majority of readers don't get mad at the authors. But again, thank you.
  ```

- u/Nepene:
  ```
  Thanks for the awesome story, I appreciate all your work, and I wish you commercial success in all you do.

  To anyone else who is being a douchebag towards the author the majority of books are not online for easy access, someone isn't an asshole for wanting a small amount of money for it or giving you only a large free sample. If you want it all then it's never going to be that hard to pirate it, or any other ebook, movie, or tv show, for those who want to support their favorite authors this gives them a good way to do it.

  Wait, how is this monetizeable?

  Did you systematically go through and purge the D&D references? Does that even make *sense* from a story perspective? Wouldn't referencing a set of fictional rules not immediately established essentially make the story unpredictable from depicted events, which is a blatant violation of the Prime Rationalfic Directive?

  (The solution to this, of course, is to pull a Pathfinder and release the entire d20 ruleset nearly unaltered and with minor presentation differences. For $9.95 MSRP. :) )
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    > Did you systematically go through and purge the D&D references?

    Yes. The Amazon audience doesn't care about rational!fic. The original versions are still in Git so I could get them back if I wanted.
    ```

      >> Did you systematically go through and purge the D&D references?

      > Yes.

      Huh. I just bought the book (or at least, part one) on Amazon, because I was really curious how that would be accomplished. *Two Year Emperor* was so steeped in D&D rules-as-written that to take that out seemed like it would have some far-reaching repercussions. I've read through the first third, and can mostly see what changes you've had to make, but it's a little difficult because I remember how the original went, and of course I'm well-versed in D&D rules.

      Let me know how it turns out - I'm very curious what someone reading it with fresh eyes would think of it, and I imagine that you'll get some of those reviews in soon. Oh, and good luck.

      (Fun fact: when I first started writing *Metropolitan Man*, it didn't have Superman in it)

        Yeah, it absolutely will.  I'm figuring that people who DO play D&D will recognize what's going on and be able to appreciate the Munchkinism.  For people who DON'T play I'll provide enough explanation as I go that hopefully it won't feel like a series of asspulls.  If it does, they'll either keep reading because they find it amusing anyway, or they'll put it down, in which case they can get a refund (assuming it's within 7 days of purchase) and won't buy any further installments.  All in all, it should be doable without anyone having to suffer.

  Thank you for writing 2YE and making it freely available; I downloaded it.

  An anecdote: When HPMOR ended, I had such a writing fever for it that I couldn't do planned writing about anything else if I tried. This was a problem, since I had multiple assigned essays to write! Then I read 2YE in a single night, and loved it, and it competed with HPMOR for my idea-generation and hilarious-thought-generation well enough that I could finally write the essays I needed to get done. :)
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Thank you so much for sharing this.  I am amazed that you read the entire thing in one night -- was this after it was finished, at 350k words?  Day-um, I wish I could read as fast as you!

    Also, I'm glad I was able to help you get work done. :>

  Hey man, I love your writing.

  If this is what it takes for you to write more(and more and more and more?), then it's what I, random-internet-stranger, would love for you to do.

  I'll be following your work.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Thank you very much.  I *really* appreciate hearing things like this.
    ```

- u/blazinghand:
  ```
  This seems like a reasonable and generous solution to the problem. You've made the right call, and the extra courtesy of making it available for download for free for some time should address any complaints people have. I enjoy your writing.
  ```

- u/TheAtomicOption:
  ```
  I expect it's difficult to deal with trying to monetize something you were previously giving away for free. You have to overcome the fan sense of entitlement, overcome their perception of ill will and greed, and then you still have to make a successful sales pitch. (and as a fan I admittedly have had to partially overcome these reactions just to write you this hopefully nice sounding message.)

  Writing is a career that's difficult to succeed in under the best circumstances, and I expect this transition will compound that--especially with all the KU free trial business that I personally wouldn't find worthwhile for any book. If I were in your shoes I'd be trying to make it as a writer with a *new* IP (or at least a sequel rather than the original) using the original as my resume, rather than trying to remove the original from the internet and then sell it back.

  But I did enjoy reading 2YE over the last while, and I appreciate you at least giving people who are paying attention some warning and a chance to grab the story before the transition, so I wish you the best of luck.
