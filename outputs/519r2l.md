  [Finally finished Worm this month, and man, is it good.](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)  I think it'd be fair to call it the best novel I've ever read; it's better than HPMOR for sure, and IMO, HP canon as well.  It's gotten a lot of acclaim around these parts, but frankly, it deserves wider acclaim as well.  I'd love to see it be a household name like the MCU, and lord knows Wildbow would benefit from the attention.  I'm going to finish up a writing project I'm working on, and then I'm going to read Pact, the second novel Wildbow wrote.  I'd like to live in a world where Worm fandom is as large and as mainstream as HP fandom.

  I hope this doesn't fall afoul of the no self promotion rule, but I'm learning to draw, and I did [some doodles of the main characters](http://imgur.com/a4F1Zbr).  If you enjoy Worm, I hope they amuse you, and I hope to do some more soon, maybe of the Slaughterhouse Nine.  :)

    If you find yourself not enjoying Pact, skip ahead to Twig. Pact has some issues that may or may not lower your enjoyment of it, but Twig is significantly better about those things.

    That said, if you enjoyed Worm *that* much, you probably won't mind it. I'm not explaining the issues because when you point them out, they pop out that much more :)

    I love Worm! Wildbow should do some light editing and sell it as an ebook on Amazon. I would buy it in a heartbeat.

      That is the current plan. Apparently he was also in (very preliminary) talks about making it into a TV show. And his agent was also looking into more traditional publishing methods.

      But currently he's editing the story with the intention of self-publishing, in case none of those other possibilities will pan out.

      I honestly have no idea how he manages to do that and keep up with his writing schedule for Twig. It would be hell for me.

        As much as I'd *love* this, don't get your hopes up, there are a million obstacles on its way. And a LOT of ideas that go much farther than preliminary talks still never make it to screen.
        ```

        - u/Fresh_C:

          Yup, I know. It's an oversaturated market. Tons of ideas out there, and a lot less people willing to pay to make them happen.

    Links for anyone else who's *finished* Worm - seriously, if you haven't this will spoil the story for you *so badly* - /r/Parahumans for general discussion (including Pact and Twig occasionally, but mostly Worm) and /r/WormFanfic for finding fanfiction, since a lot of it is on SB/SV/QQ only and not on AO3 or fanfiction.net. There's a huge index of stories on the subreddit wiki.

        Yup. Doesn't get worse in terms of sheer, visceral awfulness. From there, the awfulness is definitely on far mode.

  The D&D podcast [The Adventure Zone](http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/adventure-zone) is what I've been recommending to my friends for the last several months. If you're a fan of RPGs or the McElroys (who have six~ish podcasts among various members of the family), give it a listen. 

  I think they start playing a pre-written 5e campaign but depart from it for the DM's own plotline. It's full of wonderful characters, the story is compelling, and the players have a fantastic chemistry, very entertaining overall. I would start on [Ep. 3](http://www.maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/ep-3-here-there-be-gerblins-chapter-three#comments) where everyone starts being comfortable in their characters and the DM starts using his own material.

  Extra:

    I've greatly enjoyed [Campaign](http://oneshotpodcast.com/category/campaign/) by the One Shot creators, a Star Wars roleplay podcast using the Edge of the Empire system. A clone veteran, an irresponsible smuggler, a bounty hunter, and a five-year-old sith. Great fun.
    ```

  - u/BlueSigil:
    ```
    The Adventure Zone is my favorite D&D podcast. Every Arc is completely unlike the one before, yet they all fit together seamlessly into an over-arching plot, and you can tell the players are having a lot of fun. I have my pod-catcher set to auto-download every episode as it comes in.

    If people want more D&D stuff, I also recommend:
    [Total Party Kill] (https://www.theincomparable.com/tpk/) for the great character interactions and decent plot. 
    [Critical Role (Youtube)] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDXQ_XXbAws7gyakXAPAC8XmqzW38Ivbk) The DM is the best I've even seen, and all the players are voice actors.
    ```

- u/Gaboncio:
  ```
  [The Expanse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/) is a SyFy series about a detective in space and an interplanetary conspiracy. In addition to being excellently written, with consistently great dialogue and a fleshed out cast of complex characters, the worldbuilding and background science are (almost always) spot-on. A great example was pointed out in [the review](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/) that got me to watch it. Because a lot of the action happens on a spun-up Ceres (since the local gravity is too low for humans to survive in), people living there need to take the Coriolis force when pouring out drinks. It's that well-researched. 

  The space battles, especially, are one of the best thought-out elements of the show, and I think the people on this sub who were discussing the realism vs excitement dichotomy should really watch it and study it. 

  About to finish the only season out (only two episodes left!) and I can honestly say it's one of my favorite scifi series of all time.
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Liked it mostly. However, part of the plot hinges on humanity having mined out Ceres (asteroid) of water, which immediately blow my suspension of disbelief out the window. 

    Ceres has a diameter of 1000km, and an estimated 200 million cubic kilometers of water... No way in hell or heaven that could be mined out in that setting.
    ```

    - u/Gaboncio:
      ```
      They don't need to have mined it out completely of water, just enough for it to be difficult to the point of it being practically impossible to get any more.

  I'm quite enjoying the music rhythm game [Osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/)

  It's a very challenging game with simple rules but seemingly limitless difficulty.

  The gameplay is similar to titles like Elite Beat Agents where you click circles to the beat. There are also 3 other modes (Osu!Mania which is similar to Beatmania, Taiko, and Catch the Beat).

  The best part is that it's completely free, community driven, and customizable. All you need to play is a mouse. (Though I recommend aiming with your mouse and clicking with your keyboard. z and x are the default click keys. Really helped me up my game).

    Seconding GC (anyone who gets put off by early chapter art: persevere, it gets way better) and Nedroid (wish it updated more often).

    In similar veins, [Cucumber Quest](http://cucumber.gigidigi.com/) is a cutesy-with-plot comic I've been enjoying a lot, and [Owlturd](http://owlturd.com/) does the humour almost as good as nedroid, but much more regularly.

    ETA: eh, Great wasn't great. Decent, maybe, but the plot gets stale very quickly and the jokes are repetitive.

  I recently started listening to the audiobook version of *[Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell](http://www.audible.com/pd/Fiction/Jonathan-Strange-Mr-Norrell-Audiobook/B0036NAYIQ)*.  I've read the book before (and it is actually one of my favorite books), but I think I might like listening to the prose out loud even more.  Audible has a free trial offer where you get two free books before having to pay anything, so it's real easy to get of a copy of it if you've never used the service before.

  Found a FFN community called [Video Game Plot](https://www.fanfiction.net/community/The-Video-Game-Plot/105176/) which features a lot of The Gamer style stories. One that I enjoyed quite a bit was [Harry Potter & The Game](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/Harry-Potter-the-Game).

  *[Amalgum: Lockhart's Folly](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447)* (121k words, ongoing) features a Harry who accidentally merged with Gilderoy when he attempted to travel back in time to his younger body. It's a nice treat for anyone who enjoyed *[Partially Kissed Hero](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771)*. (Indeed, the two stories seem *[suspiciously](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4zp1g2/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d6xuwrj)* similar in style...)

  *[DID You Hear the Rabbit Cry?](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8923291)* (140k words, ongoing) is an interesting story, featuring a Harry who developed multiple personalities (some of them female!) as a result of the Dursleys' abuse.

  *[Champion](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11790377)* (110k words, ongoing) features Hermione going back in time to turn Tom, who apparently was meant to be a champion on the side of good in the great meta-conflict, but somehow was seduced to evil, making Albus' burden significantly heavier than it should have been. (I think the background is cool, at least.)

  *[Wharf Rat](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097887/1/Wharf-Rat)* (131k words, ongoing) features a Danny who can control rodents, rather than a Taylor who can control arthropods. He also seems to be more of a coordinator than an administrator.

  *[Soul Mirror](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9065052)* (383k words, ongoing) purports to be a deconstruction of stories in which the Kyuubi gives mind-control powers to Naruto so that he'll create a harem.

    Is there any reason why the title of Amalgum is a misspelled word? It's not immediately obvious, and that kind of puts me off it.

    DID you hear the rabbit cry seems quite fun so far, though.

    Two days later, I'm done reading Wharf Rat.

    I literally have to say - that's the best Worm fanfiction I've ever read. Not even joking. More content per chapter than most others, no ridiculous plotlines, no exceptionally obvious twisting of powers from their canon variants into different and brutally more powerful variants... It's great.

  [The gods are bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/), a web serial that I'm currently marathoning.

  Summary: adventures of a group of students at an exclusive 'adventuring' university (think apprentices to an epic-level D&D wizard) in a high-fantasy setting where humanity is currently experiencing the industrial revolution using magic as the power source. Brilliant characters, funny quips ("You each have a valuable role to play, as anyone can attest who’s tried to play a game of chess without pawns"), interesting settings... One of the best things I've recently read.

  I already recommended the webcomic The Dragon Doctors in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/50750j/rt_the_dragon_doctors/), but I don't think many people noticed it so I'll share it here. If you can get past the crappy artwork, you'll be in for one of those rare stories that's truly special and deserves more attention. See link for details.

  As for books, I'm almost done reading The Night Angel Trilogy and have loved every word. It is the single darkest fantasy series I've ever read, there are some points where it makes Jessica Jones seem downright lighthearted by comparison, but like JJ it's disturbing and disgusting for all the right reasons. The plot is intricate, the characters complex, the writing tight, and the whole thing is surprisingly rational with even some munchkinism.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    I'm going to offer a counter to this, because while I enjoyed the trilogy I don't think I'd recommend it to a rationalist audience without disclaimers.

    In my view, the Night Angel Trilogy is similar to Mistborn in a certain way: it starts out very strong, and gets weaker with each book. I really enjoyed the first one, moderately enjoyed the second, and can barely remember the third one outside of its major set pieces. 

    Also, while you're right to say it has amazingly well done characters, its magic system is almost completely unexplained and irrational, especially the convoluted and mysterious rules of the Ka'kari.

    The main thing I would recommend Night Angel for is the characters, which again are mostly fantastic, with one or two exceptions.  The worldbuilding is okay and has some neat ideas, but the rest is pretty standard fantasy fare, if a bit on the more darker side than most. It's definitely an entertaining read, but not in my top picks, personally.

    >the single darkest fantasy series 

    Out of curiosity, have you read A Song of Ice and Fire? I saw a lot of Game of Thrones influences in the first Night Angel, and in my view GoT is at least as dark, if not more so.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I have not read or seen Game of Thrones, but I'm a huge fan of Mistborn. I actually picked up Night Angel because Brandon Sanderson is my favorite author and recommended this series. I admit neither series is totally rational, but I think they're both a step up from the standard fantasy fare I've grown tired of.

      They have all the standard tropes, but each puts their own spin on them and rationalize aspects of the story. Night Angel has intelligent characters, including a rationalist later on, while Mistborn has its clever setting and magic system. If you don't like them, that's fine, but I count them among my favorites.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Oh man, you should reeeaaally read Game of Thrones. I'm glad you enjoyed Mistborn and Night Angel, the more things someone enjoys the better! But if you like dark and non-traditional fantasy stories, you're in for a treat with the Song of Ice and Fire series.

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:

  I've also been having a lot of time-wasting fun lately with a Steam game called [Point Perfect](http://store.steampowered.com/app/303840/).  It's a randomized arcade game in the vein of Binding Of Isaac (albeit somewhat lighter on content; it doesn't have the literally hundreds of items that BOI does by now).  It's much faster-paced, though, and only gives you one hit point (but three or four lives per game, and three games per session).  It makes excellent use of mouse controls and has a nice aesthetic, though, IMO, an offputtingly rude sense of humor.  (Not in the grossout sense of Binding Of Isaac, but in the sense that it routinely insults you for your failure.)
  ```

- u/Golden_Magician:
  ```
  Since I usually get a lot from the recommendation threads without contributing much, I'll put forward a few suggestions of my own of things I've enjoyed in the past.

  Video Games / Visual Novels:

  -Phoenix Wright trilogy: You are a poor defense attorney trying to save your clients. Memorable plot and character, compelling gameplay that makes a court of law seem like the most fun thing ever. Definitely not rational, so if that might bother you please be careful. If on the other hand you aren't afraid of a couple Idiot Balls and silly twists, there are countless moments of heartwarming and awesome to be enjoyed. Nice brain teaser as well overall.

  -Danganronpa 1&2: A bunch of talented kids are trapped in a high school and forced to kill each other for the amusement of a sick heartless mechanical teddy bear. Find the culprit or die! Similar to Phoenix Wright (same disclaimer applies), more stylish and anime-esque. The concept is really interesting and well-executed for the most part. Outrageously over-the top and ridiculously immersive and enjoyable, if you ignore the sheer irrationality of it all. Also some interesting logic puzzles.

  -999 & Virtue's Last Reward (Zero Escape trilogy): This completes the good visual novel series. People are trapped in (insert game location) and have to escape. A bit different from the others, in that it's based on branching paths and multiple story endings. The games are convoluted and well-executed and with no courtroom-style segments. I found VLR to be especially cool and dealing with interesting issues for this subreddit, heavily recommended!
  ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    In terms of VNs, I haven't played that much. I did enjoy Fate / Stay Night, Tsukihime, and the Muv-Luv trilogy. Fate/Stay Night is a story about a bunch of magic users summoning heroes out of the past to fight over a wish. Tsukihime is a complicated story about a guy with the power to kill anything fighting vampires, more or less.  Both those two stories by Nasu had cringe-inducing flaws - I think that at this point Nasu has proven he should not be allowed near sex scenes of any type, as they have been absurdly terrible every single time. Also, the pacing is extremely slow and there's a lot of slice-of-life stuff that breaks up the action.

    Muv-Luv is a complicated story where trying to describe it spoils badly, but it initially *looks* like garbage comedy harem anime BS until it really suddenly and abruptly isn't. The story takes forever to get off the ground, as basically all of Extra is garbage, and even a lot of Unlimited is fairly risible, but Alternative is amazing and good enough to justify the time spent in Extra and Unlimited. Unfortunately, you can't just skip to Alternative as that would deprive the story of all it's force - the setup proves to be necessary for the whole thing to work.

    I also quite liked social-justice-ish stories Digital: A Love Story and Analogue: A Hate Story a lot, but Hate Plus was a disappointment and I don't recommend it at all. These are neat games told through interacting with fake computer interfaces - Digital is in close to the present day and is about AIs on the net, while Analogue is in a far future setting exploring a failed generation ship.
    ```

    - u/AugSphere:
      ```
      > I think that at this point Nasu has proven he should not be allowed near sex scenes of any type, as they have been absurdly terrible every single time.

      A couple of them manage to get out of comically bad territory, I think. The one where Akiha watches Kohaku have her way with Shiki comes to mind, although I may have underestimated how bad it was due to how well it hit some of the fetishes I had at the time.

      > Unfortunately, you can't just skip to Alternative as that would deprive the story of all it's force - the setup proves to be necessary for the whole thing to work.

      I think skipping Extra may work well enough. I've went through Extra diligently, but I haven't built up any kind of empathy with the characters due to the whole thing being a horrible boring mess. Sure you get to contrast the "happy" carefree days in this world with what happens in the later games, but I don't think it's worth the time investment in the end. Unlimited does way more work at getting the reader invested in characters, and even then in retrospect the only one I really cared about was Marimo-chan, and that's mostly due to the *impactful* way her storyline ends, which was great.

      > I also quite liked social-justice-ish stories Digital: A Love Story and Analogue: A Hate Story a lot, but Hate Plus was a disappointment and I don't recommend it at all.

      I can second this recommendation. Not the most amazing of games, but work well enough. The cake thing in Hate Plus was pretty ridiculous, but aside from that I thought it wasn't that bad either.

  I've been reading a lot of RWBY fanfic recently. Unfortunately I haven't found any well-written longform Weiss/Ruby or Jaune/Pyrrha fics yet, but there are some good choices. Here are my recommendations:

  [Spectrum](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11352744/1/Spectrum) is probably my favorite. The summary is this: Jaune's seven sisters are possessed by the swords passed down the Arc family lineage and it is now up to him to save them. It has some great action scenes, fleshes out Jaune's sisters, the omakes are hilarious, and has an unusual Jaune/Yang pairing.

  [Silver Moon, Golden Sun](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/silver-moon-golden-sun-rwby-pokemon.380918/) is a promising Pokemon crossover on Spacebattles.

  [Satellite](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/satellite-penny-ciel-rwby-fanfiction.411014/) is a good slice-of-life fic focusing on Ciel Soleil and her friendship with Penny. It's quite funny and it's interesting seeing such a minor character getting development.

  [From Beyond](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11518796/1/From-Beyond) is a competent romantic comedy. Jaune dies during initiation and ends up as a ghost haunting Blake, who is the only one who can see him.

  [Breaking through the Bottom of the Bottle](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12027237/1/Breaking-Through-the-Bottom-of-the-Bottle) is my favorite as far as pure romance fic goes. It's a Jaune/Yang story, with the two of them meeting again years after the events of the main plot.

  [Just a Few Pointers](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11765215/1/Just-A-Few-Pointers) is one of the only good Jaune/Weiss romance fics I've found, though [Letters to Winter](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12111333/1/Letters-to-Winter) also looks promising so far. 

  [Dust to Dust](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dust-to-dust-percy-jackson-rwby-crossover.419948/) is a Percy Jackson crossover with Percy ending up in Remnant. It's a bit too early to evaluate it, but it looks good so far.

  [Broken Wings](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10534001/1/Broken-Wings) is quite good if you're okay with sad stories where self-harm is a major theme. Weiss was born a faunus and is forced by her family to cut off her wings each time they regrow and attempt to pass as a normal human at Beacon.
