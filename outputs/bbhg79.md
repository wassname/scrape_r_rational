## [RT][HSF] Recommendation: Deeper Darker

### Post:

A new work by mooderino, the author of The Good Student. It's  dungeon delving adventures in a sci-fi setting. The hook is that an extinct alien civilization called the Antecessors left remnant sites full of advanced technology to loot, as well as very dangerous security systems to avoid. It's a rational fic because the characters try to make intelligent choices based on what they know & conflicts get resolved by talking as often as by fighting. Also, the plot moves fast, the characters are distinct and interesting, and the action it well-written. IMHO, it's the best thing mooderino has written. To get a taste of what this novel is about, you can read [Chapters 35 & 36](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23290/deeper-darker/chapter/349904/35-suited-and-booted), which describe a dungeon crawl and don't require much prior knowledge.

    There is hard sciense fiction(with FTL though) about dungeon diving(tower climbing actually). Diamond Dogs by Alastar Reinolds. Its quite good IMO

    Premise of moving garbage between stars to drop into garbage dump on specific planet is wrong on so many levels it looks like a parody. Capital spaceship powered by solar energy is no less absurd. It's not even soft, it's something from 193* science fiction.

        Rational fiction shouldn't require you to throw throw your brain out for immersion. If you're going to dodge worldbuilding by ostensibly setting your story in the future light cone of the real world, it should be consistent with its rules, just like any other piece of rational fiction is expected to present the reader with consistent world rules.

      Pretty sure the Garbage Worlds are per star system only.  It seems that when humanity colonizes systems, they try to get on every possible planet that isn't stupidly lethal.  I could be wrong about this, though.

      I'd personally be OK with the colony ship being solar powered if, and only if, it wasn't explicitly stated to have 64 gravity engines and massive singularity cannons.  If it had some light ion engines and generally just drifted or had a set path, using carefully researched orbits to change course, I'd be fine with it.  But... it doesn't.

    Don't worry you aren't alone, I have almost exactly the same experience, if said science fiction doesn't have any aspect of magic, I can read fantasy stories that get into space travel and multiple planets, and I can read Sci-fi if the main character is an esper it psychic of some kind, but remove that magic element and I just can't immerse myself, I guess a part of me just doesn't find the idea of a fictional world with no magic entertaining.

      I mean, for all intents and purposes, the organics discovered from the alien sites are your aspect of magic. They/re sufficiently advanced relative to what humanity has as to essentially turn users into a super-powered gods amongst mortals. 

      We've seen some limited uses of them, one of which was apparently from the most powerful human being (if that term even counts anymore) around. 

      For what it's worth this has my recommendation. I'm enjoying it way more than The Good Student and frankly wish chapters were longer. Now that the different character viewpoints have sort of converged it's become way more interesting.

        Sounds interesting, I haven't actually tried deeper darker yet, I am waiting for it to get some backlog. Though honestly my hopes aren't exceptionally high, the author isn't my favourite, I tried The good student and enjoyed it initially, but honestly the convulted mess of "Aha! I have discovered the truth! Let me be a badass and solve the situation! Wait what? That was exactly what the villain planned for!?" That that story became has kind of turned me off getting into his stories.

          You're not entirely wrong. When I said that the novel had become a meme in the recent thread it certainly wasn't a compliment.

  > It's dungeon delving adventures in a sci-fi setting

  I find this fairly misleading when you have to get to **Chapter 35** before any 'dungeon delving' actually occurs.  And, in so much as its a dungeon, it's a ridiculously lethal one due to its traps (automated defense system), with life expectancy in minutes or seconds.  

  This is a sci-fi series with three protagonists that happens to focus highly on cybernetic modifications and happens to have dungeon delving as a key part of the background as to how some of these modifications came to be.

  > It's a rational fic because the characters try to make intelligent choices 

    Good key word there.  It's rational because they **try** to make intelligent choices--given the limited knowledge and experience that they have, and when they mess up they try to learn from the experience.

  So far I rather like this series, but the slow buildup might not be for everyone.

  Good points that should be mentioned:
  1)  The different worlds have different cultures, and each protagonist comes from a vastly different background with a specific set of skills.  When the skills overlap, they are from different perspectives and sometimes even opposite ends of the spectrum.  It seems as if the writer is trying to give them all roughly equal 'screen time' so we stay invested.
  2)  None of the protagonists are assholes for the sake of being assholes.  I don't know why this becomes a trope where some main or semi-main character is just an utter ass to everyone for no particular reason or because he had some harsh upbringing.  None of these people are harsh to anyone else unless its part of a planned strategy to get what they want, and always a short-term solution.
  3)  The 'cut away' moments to other characters **never** happen in the middle of the action or as a cliffhangar.  I can't express how much I appreciate this, as I find the whole "Let's cut away from this person at a critical moment to pick up with another character in a calm situation instead to keep you reading (or watching)" to be *monumentally stupid*.  I will keep reading if I like a series, do not attempt cheap tricks such as this or I will leave.  Fortunately, **Mooderino** understands this well and doesn't treat his readers like attention-starved children, and because of that has earned a lot of patience and goodwill as I wait for the story to continue.

  I've been enjoying this series a lot! But I hope the author never comes reading into this subreddit, the people here are very elitist.

    >  society still looks almost identical

    I... disagree with this completely.

    Semi-spoiler time.

    OK, so one character is on an eternal Generation Ship where everyone has to follow the laws established and enforced by an AI with supreme authority.  Violence is not tolerated and use of it will get you executed or exiled.  It has a very specific method of handling human relationships and reproduction, the welfare and healthcare is top notch, and the people are quite insular and think of themselves as better than everyone else.  Different families jockey for power and position, but must use non-violent means and have developed a code of conduct for 'unofficially' solving problems.  Whenever said people go out into the universe, they are considered ruthless and pragmatic to the extreme by everyone else.

    Another character lives alone under a giant trash dump used by passing spaceships.  His past includes being abandoned as a child and becoming an urchin in a street gang.  He's had to learn social skills to survive as a loner in a society that otherwise would accidentally, and with no hard feelings, crush him.  That planet is mostly run by various companies and has a society stratified between the dirt-breathing ground dwellers who range from slave to well-off businessman all the way to the super-rich who live in a veritable paradise orbital ring and have no qualms about annihilating anyone who threatens them or doesn't move up the right way.

    The third character comes from a noble family that is the de facto rulers of their world, and who helped other families out by advancing them, only to have them turn traitor.  His mom and dad are from two seperate families, and both are 'organics' (read: Biotic) users of great and specific powers, and his mother used to be a planet-bombarding mercenary Space Amazon who is backed up by a biotic Space Amazons organization that has a thing against misogyny.  And by 'thing', I mean, 'willingness to exterminate families of those who abuse women'.  The people are mostly properous, but like in the first example, the families jockey for power and finally the main character's parents get tired of it when someone tries to kill the mother.


    Each is an example of a wildly different society, each developed around different origins, rules, and values.  Given that human biology has remained the same for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years, and the only biological alterations in this setting come from *alien tech*, it's no surprise that humans are mostly baseline but vary wildly in culture.  It's almost like how humans develop in the real world.

    How would you describe a society in which psychology / Sociology is extremely advanced? I can only imagine that this would be very difficult to read.

  I actually gave it a try just last night. I love how the main characters interacts but the setting leave a lot to be desired. I believe this fiction has been recommended here when it just starting out and it did not receive the best reception. Well, because it's new, and hasn't scratch this community itch yet. And after all this time, I can say the novel did not scratch our itch. 

  Anyway, even if it doesn't fit this subreddit theme, I will still follow the fic because I just love witty verbal jabs. At least until the plot develop into either tedium or utter ridiculousness, which I hope will never happen.

    Witty verbal jabs are my favorite part of all of mooderino's writing.

  I made it to Chapter 7 and am stalling out.

  One of my pet peeves is when SciFi authors get blatantly heavy handed with their Current Year commentary. And the Trash Dump guy was just spamming that button.

  Oh no - - we hear four or five times - - our society has gotten wasteful and just dumps trash instead of repairing things! We've despoiled a planet!

  Except, this idea is just dumb. I can believe that recycling, in deep space, somehow costs more resources than just building new things. But the societies aren't just dumping stuff. They're accelerating it, inside a ship, crossing an interstellar distance, then decelerating it, entering atmosphere, and dropping it at a dump. They're willing to put that much work in, but don't bother consolidating the trash pile to a mere quarter of the planet. No, while thing is covered.

  And I'm probably nitpicking, but ugh, this is like talking to someone who thinks California's drought was caused by people lingering too long in the shower. And the book is signaling that this is one of the major setpieces, that's probably been carefully thought out by the author
