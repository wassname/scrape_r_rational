## [D] The Genie Loophole Game

### Post:

This game will get harder as it progresses, as I incorporate suggestions and/or patch loopholes.

The rules this specific genie has, which (I think) cover the biggest and more obvious loopholes:

1: No metawishing (No wishing for more wishes, genies, etc. You only get three wishes, no more)

2: Each wish must be phrased beginning with "I wish", but there is no limit on the length of the wishes.

3: No paradox wishes. (Time travel can only be observation of the past, no "I wish this wish will not be fulfilled", etc.)

4: No persistent supernatural effects or abilities that last longer than a week **Changed, thank you /u/Prezombie**

**5: No changing the rules. Thank you /u/Psychobeans**

I don't think I'll last very long against this subreddit, but I'd like to see how you could get around the restrictions. 

**EDIT: I was right, this didn't last long at all. I can't come up with anything else, I'm giving up. Someone else can be the genie, this sub is too smart for me.**

    That's an odd way to wish for immortality, but I guess it works.

  **The programming loophole.**

  "Let the following term - skribbitz - describe the following situation:..."

  (books and books describing everything you could every possibly want)

  "...end definition for skribbitz. I wish for skribbitz."

  **The not-quite-meta loophole.**  
  "I wish to be brought into existence a non-genie device, golem, or being of sufficient power and nature to quickly realize any and all desires I present to it, to the power level of approximately half a genie."

  (Basically, genies are able to instantly and trivially grant any wish a human could think of, so a device or being of only half that power would probably still be able to bring about the wishes of anything a human could think of. If a genie could move stars around, for instance, to create a more pleasing constellation, or could put the sun out and rekindle it the next day, or could spin the moon to show the other side, a half-genie-power creation probably wouldn't have a lot of trouble doing anything short of bench-pressing the planet. And it wouldn't have the limited-to-3-wishes restriction either.)

  **The super-charisma loophole**  
  Even without persistent supernatural abilities, there's nothing stopping you for wishing to have charisma equal to the maximum natural human ability. Every politician, celebrity, conman, and religious figure in history would have nothing on you - you could ask anyone for anything and they'd be almost orgasmically happy to do it for you. You'd pretty much have total power anywhere there were other people, which is most of the interesting parts of the planet. Tell everyone that war and corruption were to stop and everyone was to get along nicely and help each other, for instance, and the globe would probably be a much more pleasant place to live.

  You'd never want for creature comforts; everyone would be more than happy to give you anything you wanted. You wouldn't even *need* wealth or its trappings.

  Heck, even 'merely' wishing for charisma equal to that of the most charismatic person on the planet right now would get you insanely large benefits, and it wouldn't even be asking for something that no-one else had, or something beyond human ability.

  **The super-knowledge loophole**  
  Wishing to know everything that any human knows, along with the improved mental capacity to be able to retain, recall, and use that knowledge without deleterious side effects, wouldn't give you knowledge beyond current human capability, but it would give you access to every secret, every idea which couldn't be realized because of lack of resources or opportunity, insider knowledge of everything ever, all languages, all mental skill and experience at all professions, all knowledge of things which the knower couldn't or wouldn't necessarily make use of themselves themselves, all knowledge of how to build and maintain anything humans have made, etc. You'd instantly become the most powerful person on the planet.

  Would this count as 'persistent supernatural ability'? I don't know... rebuilding your brain so it could hold and use all this information *naturally* shouldn't count as supernatural any more than wish-granting you a body equivalent to having great genes and having worked out for twenty years. It's not supernatural; it's just a natural possibility you didn't previously take (or have the option of taking).

    ```
    Super-Charisma: You will be very convincing, but you wouldn't be able to convince people of anything you want, as no human is capable of that. You would likely get into high-power positions though. 

    Super-Knowledge: Assuming a natural brain could hold all the data, that would be valid. I think. But, you would also need your other bodily processes modified to meet the heavily increased demand from your brain for oxygen and nutrients.

  ```
  Wish one: I wish for everything I want in the manner that I want it.

  Wishes two and three can be saved for fixing the inevitible unintended consequences.
  ```

- u/Psychobeans:
  ```
  You missed the loophole of wishing to modify the rules.

    Shit, I had that there in my earlier draft...

  I doubt you'll have much trouble with this, but I'd like to see what you guys come up with. Spoiler for a certain anime: [Spoiler](/s "I want to erase all witches before they are even born. I will erase every single witch in every universe, past and future with my own hands. All those magical girls who held onto their hopes and fought against witches, I don't want to see them cry. I want them to stay smiling until the end. If any rule or law stands in my way, I will destroy it. I will rewrite it. That is my prayer. That is my wish. Now grant it, Incubator!")

  I think I'm just going to cheat.

  [I wish, on behalf of all of humanity, what we would wish if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted.](http://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf)

    Your wish was non-naturalistic and the genie only obeys precise phrasings.  Nothing at all happens.
    ```

- u/Prezombie:
  ```
  I wish I was omnipotent with the exceptions that I can't alter past events and can't force John Smith to like ice cream.
  ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    The genie changes your desires to perfectly match the laws of physics, with the possible exception of wanting John Smith to like a different kind of ice cream. Now everything you want becomes so, so you are omnipotent.
    ```

- u/Empiricist_or_not:
  ```
  I wish to extended my influence to the extent of the observable or  conceivable universe and all domains that have influence over it, now; and to have absolute control over all events their-in, such that I am able to understand all events, and their implications, and free and able to choose their outcome, without violating the base structure of the reality that results from my wish, while retaining my current values for making said choices; and without having any burden for evaluating when to act to change an events outcome.

  TL: DR  (please criticize the long form)  Make me capital "G" god now.  Make the outcome of physics be what I choose it to be with perfect knowledge of the outcome.
  ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  First wish: I wish for you to copy me, tell the copy it's the copy, simulate the copy for a subjective 50 years / objective 1 second and tell me what messages it told you to relay to me.
  Second wish is derived from what I thought of in 50 years.

    You've got 50% chance of being really bored for 50 years, then.

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  Wish #1 - I wish I knew the best possible wish (for satisfying my desires) to make.

  This should be valid because meta-wishing seems to be about getting more wishes or changing something about the wish-granting function. I'm just asking for knowledge of wishes.

  Wish #2 - I wish (whatever wish I learned about from Wish #1).

  Wish #3 - Emergency wish to become the Genie if the previous two wishes go wrong somehow. I'm not wishing for an Undo Wish. I don't like maintaining a "status quo" like you always see in stories involving wishes gone wrong.
  ```

- u/frozenLake123:
  ```
  I wish for a good lawyer to help with the wording of my next wishes.

  I wish for that considering supernatural effects, the duration of which have their reference points inside of a black hole's singularity.

  I wish for probability manipulation on the scale of being able to create virtual particles in a way that fits my personal desires.
  ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  I wish that I and everyone else will subjectively experience time passing at an exponentially increasing rate, so that this week will subjectively last an eternity, and also that I be omnipotent for this week.
  ```
