  boy that's a lot of sigfigs for something with a 100M error margin

    The subtle art of making unnamed characters realistically incompetent without going over the top.

      Nobody should care about sig figs IMO. Better to just keep in mind the limits of your data than to destroy part of it (even an apparently uninformative part). It's like intentionally seeking out equivalents to floating point errors.

  Jeez, that's a lot of US cities + Bases. Though the fact that there are many US military bases listed is probably because it's compiled by the US military - there might be other military bases in China that are destroyed, but that the US doesn't know about. 

  I'm guessing so much of China/India's industrial capacity is untargetted because either a) Visser needs at least some manufacturing capacity intact or b) the Visser has already infiltrated the local governments there? There was some mention of an "Indian Battalion" in the preceding Jake chapter. 

  Also, I wonder how many controllers died in these blasts, and what the Yeerks must think about that.

    That was the intended interpretation, yeah.  Tried to signal that with the (INCOMPLETE) at the top, plus the "estimated unlisted".

  ```
  Easter egg: This interlude confirms that Tyagi did not die in either the Visser's attack on the day he took out the Animorphs, nor in the subsequent carpet-bombing.

  RCP: P(X):N.T.

  Recipient: President (ex) Najida Tyagi
  ```

  - u/daytodave:
    ```
    Does the fact that they're reporting to Tyagi also mean what's left of the military has figured out that the new president is compromised?
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Not necessarily.  Tyagi could have (for instance) forked a small black force prior to "dying" and falling off the grid, and may not be in explicit contact with the larger (remaining) military.
      ```

  ```
  Kadena should also be AFB, should it not?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Online references say "Kadena Air Base," not "Kadena Air Force Base."
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:

        Huh.  Guess it was just a common slip of the tongue, then; I always heard it as 'Kadena Air Force Base', but then again I didn't frequent it, just passed through while my dad was stationed there (we lived on Camp Foster, a Marine Corps base).   


        I assume with the size of Kadena and the existence of like five other bases, Okinawa itself is just really a smoking crater at this point, tho it's not like the mainland is doing much better.
        ```
