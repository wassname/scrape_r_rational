## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I'm going to recommend 'The Green Knight' (which I just saw.) Trippy, artistic fantasy tale. Be aware of the ridiculous difference between the critics and audience consensus-- this is very much not your traditional fantasy quest. I would also suggest reading or at least getting a basic overview of the original 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight' tale, because the story self-consciously plays with the concept of chivalry and deliberately contrasts against the source material.

    I absolutely loved it. Best description I could give is "revisionist chivalric romance," in the way that a western or a noir flick can be revisionist. Thoughtful and critical of what underlies the genre and its form. 

    Of course, here the "genre" is largely a few centuries dead, but that just makes it all the more special IMO.

    I get the feeling a large part of the critical/audience reception disparity is that going in, even having seen the trailers, it would be very easy to simply expect a straightforward adaptation, an arthurian adventure tale on modern technology and budget, which this absolutely was not.

  I recommend this Warhammer Fantasy quest as not just a quest but a good story: [Divided Loyalties](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/warhammer-fantasy-divided-loyalties-an-advisors-quest.44838/). There's some good themes about the advancement of knowledge and unity between sapients.

  I love it, even with limited knowledge of the setting it introduced the world in an understandable way. The story is well-written and hands-down my favorite quest with rolls. The QM has a real knack for rolls, breaking down an action into the exact ways it could fail and laying out the probabilities in a reasonable way. Worse QM's will frequently inject some random bullshit to explain a poor roll, but the author here adapts to the scene and the characters. Frequently a failure will lead to recovery rolls to show the character changing their approach or receiving aid from other characters.

  On the opposite side of the quest spectrum, I recommend [Attempting to fulfill the plan](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/attempting-to-fulfill-the-plan-vsnkh-edition.73217/) as a management sim/alt-history deal. 

  The rolls and structure of the choices play heavily into the characterization of the Soviet Union under Stalin. Contrasting the choice's results with the sorrowful diary entries and letters of the laborers doing the labor is probably the main emotional draw of the story.

  Beyond characterization the quest mechanics are actually really satisfying as an economic development sim, so much so that it's been copied by another author for the newer GDI edition, which I enjoyed less.

    Gah, I don't know why I never learn. Every time someone recommends a quest I get interested and follow the link, and every time it's in second person. Based on the amount of people that read these things and love them I'm in the minority with my inability to read more than a paragraph in second person. It's genuinely as distracting to me as if the author had decided to forgo all punctuation.
    ```

    - u/Missing_Minus:
      ```
      I've seen a few quests in third-person, but not many. I think it can work fine in other persons, so I'm not entirely sure why second person is so common. I guess to make you feel like the character in it.  
      I run into the issue that it just all turns into an internal monologue of a character since I don't consider it 'me', unless I'm playing a text rpg game where I'm actually making choices then it works a lot better.

  [Unwitting Champion](https://manmagnificent.wordpress.com/unwitting-champion-main/) is a high fantasy political serial by ManMagnificent, probably best known for his numerous Parahumans fanfics. It starts out with a fairly typical premise to webfiction - the main character is the 'summoned hero,' brought to this world to fight against some evil. ManMag, however, deals with this premise in perhaps the most convincing way I've seen so far, and present a protagonist who, despite being utterly terrified and at the mercy of people vastly more powerful than him, tries his best to wheel and deal and grow in importance.

  The magic system is well thought out - I wouldn't necessarily call it entirely original or unique, but ManMag has taken some fairly simple base principles and managed to build a coherent, interesting, and developed system which affects not merely the various magicians but the politics and fabric of the world. Characters are unique, strongly-developed (as much as they can be in just 16 chapters so far) and, even when confrontational, enjoyable to read. 

  I personally would call the story rational, though the focus so far has been on political rationality, trying to make deals and agreements, improve social standing and bluff one's way into power. That being said, the protagonist makes believable mistakes, is overcome by his emotions, and has to deal with the consequences of such.

  It's also just very well-written, at least for my tastes - a good balance of interior planning, description, interesting fight scenes, and well-developed character interactions.

  Overall I would highly recommend!

    I'll second this recommdation heartily. UC does an amazing job in deconstructing the imperialist subtext found in so much of the isekai genre, and the build up in how scared and alienated the protagonist starts makes the payoff when they accomplish things all the sweeter.

  - u/Audere_of_the_Grey:
    ```
    Just tried to start it and found myself frustrated by how extremely frustrated by how counterproductively the main character was behaving. How long until he starts acting sensibly?
    ```

    - u/VilhalmFeidhlim:
      ```
      I'm guessing by 'sensibly' you mean 'committing to actually carrying out his plans,' rather than just dithering and worrying and being scared; in which case, I'd say Chapter Nine is roughly the point you're thinking about. However, I think you're missing the point - it's far more 'sensible', at least from an outside perspective, that a character have fears and worries and issues that are not immediately solved by simply committing to a course of action. That's how real people work - rationalising can only take you so far. Whilst I suppose I can empathise with your frustration, I don't particularly understand it; to me, the 'counterproductivity' is a necessary aspect of the character's arc to make his ultimate success (or maybe failure, who knows where MM is taking it) all the more impactful.
      ```

      - u/Audere_of_the_Grey:
        ```
        Him dithering around a bit i'm not too too bothered by, but him taking out his moral anger and frustration on the people around him, lowering their opinions of him, which should basically be his #1 priority at first, i'm more bothered by.
        ```

        - u/VilhalmFeidhlim:
          ```
          Thats fair enough I suppose, only defense I can offer is overwhelming culture shock making him forgot how important that is in intense moments? Its hard to say how a normal person would respond in that situation in all honesty.

    How close is it to completion?
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      Chapters release every Monday. So far it's been consistent.
      ```

- u/jtolmar:
  ```
  Caught up on [Seed](https://www.webtoons.com/en/sf/seed/list?title_no=1480) (ongoing, small update weekly), which has been recommended a couple times here recently. The overall plot is about people interacting with an uncontained superintelligence in its early stages, which is on brand for around here.

  The art is very nice, the characterization is pretty good, the plot is engaging. The world building contains quite a few neat extrapolations from recent tech and AI news. 

  However, the central plot revolves around a mystery about just what that AI's constraints and motivations are. Whether the story as a whole is rational depends on just what the conclusion to that is.

  Also the computer science so far is not terribly accurate to real-world computers. Treated as a magic system, it's about as self-consistent and solid as one of the better ones, like, say, Mother Of Learning's. But it does explain some concepts wrong, and does the usual cyberpunk thing where computer networks are far more spatially constrained than they actually are.

  Overall, would recommend, but temper your expectations if you're expecting a very hard science or rationalist work.

      I thought the pacing of the story itself was pretty solid, having just read through the whole thing.

      However, that update rate is glacial, which could easily make the pacing feel slower.

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:

        Yes, I meant pace is glacial for update rate.

  I saw the film *Stowaway* recently. And the story has problems, to say the least. Just lots of plot holes and moments where you go "hey wait, that doesn't make sense." The acting and cinematography are quite good, but I would *not* recommend spending the two hours it takes watch the movie.

  On the other had, the film did remind me of a short story I read years ago: *Breaking Strain* by Arthur C. Clarke. It's an interesting take on the "adrift in space and running out of time" story, where two men have to come to terms that one of them has to die for the other to have enough oxygen to wait out a rescue operation. It is told almost exclusively from the Captain's (Grant) POV, and goes into how his mentality (and morality) slowly changes as the oxygen runs out. 

  You can read it here (not the best version, but readable):

  ```

  - u/surt2:
    ```
    One of the science advisors for *Stowaway* was Scott Manley, who makes genuinely great space-focused youtube videos. Honestly, I think I enjoyed hearing his thoughts on the movie more than I enjoyed the movie itself:

    https://youtu.be/hic0mz3_U4c
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      Thanks, that was pretty interesting.

      As an aside, I read *The Cold Equations* that Manley mentions, and I'm seeing a lot of similarities between the story and the movie. Not just the story, which very likely served as inspiration, but how the ship is so badly and illogically designed (zero margin of error on a spaceship?!) that it forces an outcome that should have been easily avoided. "*Designed to Fail*" would have been a better title.
      ```

      - u/PresN:
        ```
        *The Cold Equations* is very intentionally like that - the editor (Joseph Campbell) *really* wanted the girl to die in the end, and the author kept coming up with ways to save her, so then it would get sent back and he had to make it more implausibly inflexible. And never mind the premise of the story itself, which has a similarly implausible lack of margin of error.

        It's been criticized pretty much since it came out, though I liked Cory Doctorow's casting it as [one big moral hazard](https://locusmag.com/2014/03/cory-doctorow-cold-equations-and-moral-hazard/).
        ```

- u/LazarusRises:
  ```
  I'm about to finish listening to *The Bone Clocks* by David Mitchell (the *Cloud Atlas* guy). This will be the third of his novels I've read, and I gotta say, he's fucking good.

  More than any other novelist I know, Mitchell makes you feel like you're getting a tiny glimpse into a vast, complex, interconnected universe--but instead of being frustrated that you can only peek into one corner of it, you end up feeling grateful that you've been given any insight at all. Probably the best example of this is *Slade House*, where you get the equivalent of peering through a keyhole at an alien civilization; *The Bone Clocks* opens the door for you a bit (onto a different subset of the same civilization, interestingly) but still gives the sense of vast unseen vistas. 

  *Cloud Atlas* is good if a bit scattered; it's really more noteworthy for its narrative gimmick than its content. TBC and SH are both much more satisfying for their exploration of a novel (and very cool) cosmology. Characters are beautifully written and developed in all cases.

    My favorite dimension travel fanfic is a crossover between *[Labyrinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(1986_film\))* (cult classic 80s movie) and the *[Chronicles of Amber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Amber)* fantasy novel series:

    **[Labyrinth of Chaos](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11120619/chapters/24821469)**

    The story starts with the heroine from *Labyrinth* being guided by a planar traveler on an interdimensional road trip. Along the way, the author explores the unique and fascinating cosmology of the *Chronicles of Amber* multiverse.

    The story wasn't explicitly written to be 'rational', but it fulfills most of the requirements listed in the sidebar. I think it would be an enjoyable read even for people who aren't familiar with the two source works, because the author does an excellent job of introducing the setting and characters through the course of the story.

  I saw Dark mentioned in a previous comment here.

  I'm trying to avoid any spoilers as I know when I watch shows all I want is a positive recommendation (and perhaps some adjectives).

  I can just comment on two seasons but so far it's excellent. It's well shot and directed, the acting is superb, the casting is excellent, but most relevantly to this subreddit the writing is really really good.

  I'm sure most of you will be well familiar with some of the ground it treads but I've yet to see such a competent and thought out attempt to portray its subject matter.

  When I watch TV I'm always brimming with questions and most of the time I'm left disappointed, while not every question is answered some things I was complaining about the stupidity of which, in most other TV shows would just be bad writing, were clarified to my immense pleasure.

  Unlike most TV shows the writers knew they had 3 seasons from the start and that's how many were planned for. Obviously Season 3 might be terrible but this is no doubt one of the reasons everything makes sense in Season 1 and 2.

  I will say that it's often very hard to keep track, I was watching it with someone and it was very helpful to ask them questions as we each understood different things and remembered different details. It's a show you have to engage with, you cannot browse reddit on your phone while watching and be able to 1) understand it and 2) enjoy it to the extent it deserves.

  While the song choice is excellent some of the, I don't know, audio effects, backing noise?, especially in the first season are way over done and super irritating. The kind of noises that are used to build tension. That's my biggest flaw with the show. Also the intro song is too quiet IMO. The SFX got better later but it's really prominent at the start. Another flaw would probably be the name as it makes it rather hard to find out who it was who mentioned it here to give them credit.

  EDIT: I retract my recommendation due to Season 3, in particular the finale, I think it's the classic spectacle over thought and it undermines the first two seasons. I would recommend watch only Seasons 1 and 2 and Episode 7 of Season 3 and imagine that's the show over. Obviously others enjoyed Season 3.
  ```

  - u/smallcool:
    ```
    Agree with everything here.

    Just one thing to add is that this show is gorgeous in 4K resolution. It's one of the only shows/movies where I think a 4K TV/monitor (even a cheap one) actually makes a big difference in viewing experience.
