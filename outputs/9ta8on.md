  Soo... what did Neji decide in the end? Will he train Hinata honestly or will he sabotage her to make her quit ninja career?

  >"But how much chakra could a sleep-improving ninjutsu possibly cost?"

  Poor, naive kid.

    I love how here Naruto is a genius of technique construction and a trained kid-soldier, but in these things he's still a naive twelve year old.

    There's this trend in works where the protagonists are supposed to be intelligent, especially young and brilliant, of writing them basically as adults. I'm happy LUTD manages to avoid this pitfall.
    ```

      Huh? If anything, it's extremely unrealistic for a 12 year old to be this unaware of sex. And I mean any 12 year old, not even a smart one. In the real world, this would be indicative of a developmental issue. This is a classical trap of adults writing children while forgetting what children are actually like at certain ages.
      ```

      - u/xartab:
        ```
        You mean that the child who was shunned by his whole community -with a high ranking figure explicitly out to alienate him-, who only talked with the Hokage -who could give him approximately as much time as the POTUS can his children-, with an unspecified parental figure -who is implied to have been dead for some years-, and later with only one of his teachers -mostly during class ours-, could have ended up with developmental issues/severe gaps in his knowledge?!

        Nah, I can't see how that would be possible.

        Ok, sorry, sarcasm out, but I don't get how that would be surprising. Remember that, at the same age, LUTD!Hinata has a fairly good grasp of sexuality.

          Naruto also had the sexy no jutsu in canon.

          Ninjas are supposed to seduce people too.
          ```

          - u/xartab:
            ```
            Sure, but, first, this is not canon, it's AU, and it's not like canon ever claimed to be the pinnacle of rationality and self-consistency. Second, the sexy jutsu is a naive technique that shows a naive understanding of sexuality. Third, ninjas are supposed to seduce people too, but not kids (in this fanfiction). You will remember during Kakashi's trial that everyone in the court was scandalised such a young child had used seduction against the enemy, the Hokage had to remind everyone about the Hidden Stone "scandal", and pointed out that is was a diffused practise during the warring clans period (implying that it's not done anymore).

  OH MY GOD IT'S BACK

    Oh yeah, Ch. 27 came out on October 11th, this is the next chapter out.  REGULARISH UPDATES HOORAY!
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Well, it's not as if Velorien stopped writing cold turkey, so it makes sense that once he returned to this he'd spend at least a little while on regular updates. (Or he could just have some left in his stockpile)
      ```

      - u/Velorien:
        ```
        I'm aiming for fortnightly right now (I couldn't handle weekly with my other writing commitments), but that's also heavily dependent on the schedules of my beta readers, as well as generally being organised, which is not one of my strong points.
        ```

- u/Velorien:
  ```
  Thanks for posting this link. I meant to do this myself but shamefully forgot in the flurry of uploading to three different sites which all have different formatting requirements (AO3 does strange things with paragraph breaks, SV turns all my backgrounds + text black unless I remember to use workarounds, and FFN just plain eats some things and there's nothing I can do about it).
  ```

  ```
  Great job on the rewrite! Just binged the whole thing. 

  I really really want a Shikamaru fic now. 

  "Ramen chef extraordinaire Naruto? Oh yeah, he was my classmate once." 

   - President Shikamaru

    [Chiaroscuro](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11267384/1/Chiaroscuro), also fairly rational.
