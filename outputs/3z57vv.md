  eeeeeeee

  So Rachel somehow tricked Erek into leaving the field without her, and then he couldn't get back in to stop her from attacking Esplin? I'm not sure what happened with the hologram he was hiding her with. Was he able to leave it up, even though he was compelled to try to stop her?

  Is Esplin's modified fighter the thirteenth from chapter 12?

  Actually, that's a question I forgot to ask: if there are "presumably four" on the surface, and an unknown thirteenth that Ax can't detect - it sounds to me like there are five that Ax can't detect, he assumes four are on the surface, and one could be anywhere. That seems like a strange assumption. Am I reading it right?

    [Author responses; seek clarification at your own risk.] (#s "You're reading it right.  I may never get around to explaining in-story that Yeerks typically divide their squadrons of 13 into three flights of 4, with one ship left over.  That ship variously serves as a scout, a bomber, a reserve, a command, a black-box recorder, etc., depending on the needs of the conflict.  As for the holograms, Chee can project asymmetrically and at fairly good distances, but they always remain somewhere inside the sphere of the projection, and can't reliably project through walls or force fields (so yeah, the cloak went down as Erek passed through the barrier).  The thirteenth fighter is Esplin's/the Blade ship (so it's smaller/less overtly cool than it was in canon, though hopefully MORE cool overall given that it was cobbled together by Esplin himself, a la Galen's Blackbird Viper from BSG).")

  I am reminded of an idea brought up in another rational fanfic  (I think it was /u/datapacrat's MLP fic) The Fundamental Theorem of Poker.  Basically, Esplin is overestimating animorphs numbers and capabilities badly enough that he is making interesting mistakes.  I wonder if the animorphs can capitalize on this tendency.  Unfortunately, he seems to be updating extremely quickly on his threat estimates...  I am kind of worried if the author can actually let the animorphs win without serious Ellimist intervention (it was in canon, so it wouldn't quite be a deus ex machina, but it would be kind of story breaking).  Given canon, I think one major intervention at a decisive point might be reasonable, so long as it merely gives the animorphs a fighting chance (as in canon) as opposed to giving them a win.

  What's up with "Leeran hypersight"? It sounds like the ability differs from (and is significantly more powerful than) the telepathy they possess in canon, which makes me wonder why the adjustment.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Two reasons: first, I couldn't see my way clear to "eavesdropping telepathy" in any way that made sense cross-species (how the heck does a Leeran just KNOW how to interpret the meaning of a bunch of neurons firing?), and second, I needed a way for the ability to be truly flawed/a dangerous tradeoff, such that it didn't become the answer to everything a la the Eagles in LOTR.
    ```

      I may be missing something, but the flaw/danger doesn't seem clear from context. I read the end of the chapter as [spoiler](#s "everything would have been fine for Esplin if Rachel hadn't lopped his head off, and in fact is pretty much still fine since he was puppeting bodies")
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        [What's missing—since we only saw things from Esplin's POV—and will be obvious in later chapters, is that ] (#s "the effect of a Leeran's presence is symmetrical and egalitarian.  Esplin got a shattered, chaotic glimpse into the minds of Rachel and Erek, and gained some measure of private, tactical information.  So, too, though, did Rachel and Erek get a shattered, chaotic glimpse into the minds of Esplin and Alloran.  Nobody else got anything more than a dream, since everyone else in range was unconscious (Yeerks in an unconscious host are somnolent, just like Yeerks in a dying host die).")
        ```

  Huh.  I was figuring this entry would provoke MORE discussion than the previous chapter, not less.  Need to update my models, I suppose.
  ```

- u/royishere:
  ```
  At first, I took the talk of stuff hidden in "artificial skin" and an "extra set of eyes" to imply that Esplin had managed some REALLY freaky stuff with the morphing power.

  Cloning is still pretty freaky, though. That's another strike against the Animorphs winning... but of COURSE the yeerks would have press-ganged the Arn into service.

  Not sure what to make of the Leeran ability. Does it do that to everyone who passes within its range? If Rachel had been out of range, would Esplin have gotten nothing at all? And who got the bigger benefit from the hypersight, Esplin or Rachel? Given how incredibly unprepared she was this chapter, I'd say Rachel... especially since with Ax on the team, the Animorphs are going to be radically changing their game plan anyway. Esplin won't be able to predict that, since Rachel doesn't know about Ax yet.

  Do Yeerks die when you kill the body they are Controlling?

    Not in canon, though they're hooked into everything so it's extremely debilitating if they don't pull out at the right time.

      She could have picked up his head and interrogated him!
