## Winners of the Secret Krampus Contest!

### Post:

Congratulations to /u/vi-fi for the amazingly imaginative prompt, "Far out in space, humanity encounters God's chosen people."

/[u/CeruleanTresses](https://www.reddit.com/u/CeruleanTresses/) also deserves recognition for winning the ~~Thunderdome~~ story contest with their story, [The Key to Every Door](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/cxzttw/secret_krampus_story_voting/eyopkh1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). It's an incredible read and I'm afraid to say anything more about it in case I spoil anything.

It seems like this contest was well liked by this subreddit. However if it was to be run again there's a few things I would do differently.

First off, I wouldn't have anyone submit their prompts to me, but just their request to enter the contest. Then I would forward each participant's name to whoever they would receive their prompts from. This way, some anonymity would be preserved with people only knowing who they are receiving their prompts from or giving to. It was more trouble than it needed to be with me getting the prompts to check for any issues. Everyone was wonderfully creative with their prompts and no one actually submitted anything problematic, so my role in reviewing the prompts was unnecessary.

Secondly, I think the time for the contest should be adjusted from a month to three weeks. A month felt longer than it needed to be, but two weeks like the biweekly challenge is a bit too short.

Let me know anything else that people thinks should be adjusted and if they want the contest to be run again.

For anyone who is curious about the statistics, there was 26 people who entered, but only 14 people submitted a story. That's almost a 50% fatality rating!

  For anyone who wants to know why I'm posting this so much later than the stated voting deadline of Sept 14th, it's because I had a lot of overtime at my job and kept falling asleep when I got home. I haven't been online the last two weeks or so. I made a lot of money because of it which is great, but kinda forgot about this contest until this morning.

  If anyone is wondering, I can confirm that vi-fi and CeruleanTresses were the winners when the contest ended, I was just late with the prizes (a month of Reddit Prenium).

  Thank you for hosting the contest and for your kind words (and the prize)! I think it was a great idea, and I had a lot of fun reading all the entries. I especially loved The *Grakian* Choice, which I'll be recommending to my friends in the hope that I can add "grak" to my vocabulary and be understood. 

  I think it would be great for the contest to be run again, although I thought a month was actually a good amount of time before the submission deadline. I was definitely still fiddling with my entry right up until the last couple of days. But it would be interesting to see if changing the contest time affects how many people follow through on submitting a story. Like, would a shorter time give a greater sense of urgency and reduce the chance of people forgetting to work on their entry? Or would it cause more people to flake because they don't have something they're satisfied with in time? I could see it going either way!

  Did no one write a story based on /u/vi_fi 's prompt?

    Ted Chiang's Omphalos (part of his recent Exhalation collection) is pretty good and nails the prompt.
