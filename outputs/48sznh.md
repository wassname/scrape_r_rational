## [RT][FF] Oh God, am I the Mannis now? - a GoT/SI by Sir Rabby - New Chapter

### Post:

After a week or two without an update, this gem of a story is back online. So far I'd like to think the MC is behaving rational enough to merit posting this here! >:)

  It's a fun read! My only worry is that the story hasn't established a direction or central conflict. It's largely running on toppling existing conflicts from canon without setting up any new characters or *meaningful* obstacles of its own. Problems arise (which is good), but they're solved relatively quickly and without knock-on effects. Even *Tywin* falls into line, and Robert has basically no agency at all.

  That said, the politics angle once the action moves from Storm's End to King's Landing is really interestingly explored, especially given that it's something not many fics pay any attention to whatsoever. It presents a lot of opportunities for opponents to build their own factions and for things to fall apart without any notice at all, if Stannis misses just a few crucial items at the wrong time. 

  It's a fic I'll be keeping up with, at the least.

  Oh god, I just now understood Mannis nickname... Yeez, he really wasn't beloved at all.

    I don't get the nickname. Care to share?

        I always figured that it was just because he was manly as hell and no-nonsense... right up until just before the end  where he wasn't much of a man at all.

  I don't understand why everyone in comments want for Mannis to kill Baelish. He is a useful man if you can bind him to your cause.

    Probably because it's almost guaranteed that he'll eventually betray you on his way up, and he's smart enough to do it in a way you won't expect. I liken him to a landmine that spits out gold, but only if you keep it in your pocket all day long. Hey, maybe when it finally goes off you'll notice, hurl it away from you and hide behind a wall in time. Maybe you'll even *defuse* it!

    Also he'll happily burn the kingdom so long as he can rule over some of the ashes.

    I'd rather go with someone less competent and more trustworthy.

  This is also posted on the Space Battles forums, with a chapter after this one. I'd link to it, but I read the forums on my phone, and I am incredibly lazy.
