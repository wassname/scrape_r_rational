  I just started reading, and I find myself quite entertained. The sumptuary laws and basically every part of the future legal bureaucracy, in all of its beauty and all of its horror, make me laugh every time we encounter them.

  For everyone who is curious, there was a little discussion behind the world-building in this story from the Wednesday World-Building thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4ixzrw/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d32651s).

  I like the swearing by trees. Inspired by *[MLP Time Loops](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/98568/)*? :)

    Oak, I'm basically stealing it outright from there - I just wish I'd thought of more places to apply the idea in-story. :)

    I enjoyed his comics for a number of years, generally able to ignore the times when his conservative Christian beliefs overrode good narrative, and willing to go with the flow when he banned me from his comics' forum. (IIRC, it was because I stated that I was helping to share the Wikileaks torrent.) Then he made the villain of one of his comics a straw-man scientist who claimed to want to prove biogenesis was possible by using a probability-manipulating device to repeat the phenomenon, without worrying about the collateral damage involved; and after spending a few moments thinking on it, I decided that his comics were no longer giving me the pleasure they once had, so deleted my RSS feeds. At the moment, I'm only subscribed to a few of his My Little Pony stories, and when those finish, that'll probably be it.

    It's a bit of a shame - nobody who can get their comics on Atomic Rockets can be all bad, and he has some very interesting thoughts on death-killing in some of his MLP work - and things might change in the future, but for now, there's way too much good stuff to read, and figuring out how to filter it all is a never-ending project.

      My opinion exactly. I'll add that he's a very good writer with absolutely no ability to manage his Internet fandom/hatedom, much like [another well-known MLP fanwriter with a transhumanist streak](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/Chatoyance). I still occasionally check in on the QQ comics, but if his politics don't dull my interest soon then the lack of updates will.

      Hadn't finished the story at the time I wrote the above comment. Valerie's art was the one that reminded me of RHJ, the lighting and layout especially. I'll stop talking about him now.

      Damn good story. You really front-loaded the weirdness; the blue rat body and the rule against bodymodding set my expectations high, but after a while Dan started to strike me as more weird than the people around him. By the end, the world stopped being Weirdtopia and started being a new normal. Just another story set in the Liberal-Democrat Techno Furry Quasi-Utopia (flaw: privacyless). Well okay, maybe there aren't any other stories in that exact setting, but most subsets of those five traits have been on this reddit.

      Point is, you got across really well Dan's initial disorientation and his eventual adaptation to the new world.

      Incidentally, if you haven't read *Accelerando* by Charles Stross, you'll love it.

        And you've just nailed down pretty much the exact reason why I stopped writing where I did. Coming up with a proper weirdtopia is /hard/, and I seemed to be having troubles adding more weirdness than had been in the literal dream that inspired the whole thing.

        At the moment, I'm seeing if I can get some properly decent levels of weirdness, with a cross of ideas between a Dyson swarm of bubbles, accidentally-sapient squirrels, informational immunology, anglerfish mating practices and Voltron. Not sure I've got the chops to turn it into a proper story, but it's fun trying. :)

        > Accelerando

        Read it, absorbed it, building new ideas on it. :)

          Interesting, but don't forget the small-scale weirdness too. "Privacy/cryo nut in a robot body" is one thing, "privacy/cryo nut in a robot body *which is a blue rat skeleton*" is another. You got a lot of weirdness mileage out of Dan dealing with his small size and the various opportunities/limitations it presents.

          Informational immunology. Have you read Stross's **Glass House**?
          ```

- u/Towerowl:
  ```
  Very very enjoyable read.
  Kind of sad you might not update it, but also glad you don't just keep updating with bad chapter when you run out of steam like some webwritter do.
  Now looking for your other stuff ...
