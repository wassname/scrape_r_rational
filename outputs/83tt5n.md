  Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

  Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

  * Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
  * Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
  * The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.

  I'm going to guess here that Hector was initially being monitored because the government actually has some currently secret way of detecting supers that they don't want to go public with yet, so they knew he was unregistered but weren't willing to arrest him (since he didn't appear to be doing anything).

  Though going by the lengths he goes to in order to make his computer use undetected, I'm very interested in how they linked Hector to Delphic. My current guess is: they have an actual technology super, capable of bypassing any and all cyber security they have access to. 

  They used this to figure out the Hector is connected to Delphic, but don't think he is Delphic because, as far as there tech super can tell, he isn't using his computer to get passwords and stuff, he just appears to magically know them. Since they don't know about View, they probably just think Hector is a guy Delphic has help him with the physical side of things, or a close friend he allows 'in on the action' because it's good company.

  I feel like I'm even more worried about Hector's mental health than his mom. Telling her he doesn't want to bring "Hector" to Doc Stevens' attention? Reminds me of an episode of Batman Beyond when Bruce Wayne knows it's not his own voice he's hearing in his head because the voice was calling him "Bruce".

  And, yeah... maybe the CIA shouldn't have kidnapped a little girl in order to poke at the omniscient super hero just to see how far he could stretch.
