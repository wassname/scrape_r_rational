  SIH Will be going on a short hiatus while I rebuild my buffer. I moved and my mum ended up flying across the country to visit shortly afterwards, and I've managed to burn through all of my backlog. I'll need a bit of time to replenish it.

  This story feels so underrated to me, I'm really liking it and I hope it gets the deserved attention

  Thanks for letting us know. I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here waiting for the next update.

  Okay so this is something of a setup chapter, and I'm not sure how it meshes with the pacing from the previous excitement-packed spectacle. There are a bunch of story threads happening and I'm not sure if it works to open a new one especially with this much setup while another is ongoing. Though I'd probably have to read it in one go to be more confident. Also maybe the bit with the radiation hazard can be made slightly clearer.

  Is this meant as serial fiction or a book that's just happening to be released chapter-by-chapter?

    I'm really sure how I'd describe it. Probably along the lines of Ra or Unsong, where there is an underlying plot, but concessions are made to make each individual chapter more interesting, given that they're released one at a time.

    Funny thing, one of the most common critiques I see of rationalist serial fiction is that the author introduces too many story threads. I'm wondering if it's a fluke (my sample size is small) or if it's really a common mistake for the sort of people who write these stories. Or maybe the audience is highly enriched with people who find multiple threads annoying?
