  A bit ago I was [asking for help coming up with a name](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/41jwrv/bstrthf_name_for_the_new_novel/) for my new project.  Well, the blue ribbon goes to /u/JackStargazer for his suggestion, "The Tinker's Daughter".  

  I waffled between "Daughter" and "Children", and I'm still not 100% sure; it might change when it goes for publication.  For now, however, I hope you enjoy the story!

  It's happening!

  It's interesting that Rob is intelligent enough to understand bayesian probability and deductive analysis, but barely intelligent enough to speak and not able to speak while thinking hard. Orthogonal intelligence is hard to understand though, and golems are pretty orthogonal to humans in that regard.

  It appears worldlines are something like all the potential future timelines, and one can gain mana by cutting those lines (by killing her). They also appear to be directly related to human life. Not sure if Rob counts or not. It could also be that humans just have much more impact on the world than average rocks or whatever.

  > that a myriad of worldlines shivered

  Personal preference: "that myriad worldlines shivered," but that's just me.

  Currency is "marks." The mark was the German currency before the Euro. Conclusion: society based on Germany? Location is in a desert, so not Germany in that way.

  Magic can engineer animals. Is this genetic (ie. biopunk magic) or plain magic (ie. the magic changes something and continually enforces the change)

    [Spoilers about Rob's intelligence.](#s "Rob is actually quite bright, and is able to speak with full 'educated-person' grammar and syntax; this was shown once when he was talking to Pat and once again at the end of the chapter.  Producing recognizable human speech takes a lot of processing, though, so when he's multitasking or stressed he tends to simplify.  This is a source of great frustration for him:  he *likes* sounding like the intelligent person that he is, and it aggravates him that he has to sound like an idiot so much of the time.")

  Hmm. The source of mana is intriguing, but leaves open large questions and huge ramifications.

  For example, the main character's entire future has been cut down. Who, mechanically, would reap that? Or, would it go unclaimed? Or do you do a different kind of ritual that sacrifices the possible futures? Seems like there's a clear set of operations that do cut off world-lines (mixing things together, death), but another set that narratively cover that but would not do so physically - making enemies out of friends, for instance.

  It also seems a way to probe the future. Gambling with picked numbers, for example - if I win, I have a great many more world-lines. Does that mean that I can determine which numbers to pick by seeing which world-lines have the most mana to give up?

  There's also an interesting thing that happens when a mage is paid marks, as it would seem like it also pays them mana. Harvesting mana itself would seem to open new world-lines, although that can be explained easily by the mechanics of mana, magic, and the harvesting process.
