    I wouldn't say that renegade is evil, more like dickish. Renegade!Paul still has the same goals as Normal!Paul, but doesn't care about people's opinions, and so chooses to take the non-socially acceptable options.

    I see the stories as similar to two Mass Effect play throughs - the same overall story is happening, but Renegade!Paul has different advantages and disadvantages because of the way he acts. I think that the renegade story-line is one continuous storyline, but you have to fill in the blanks from the main storyline sometimes.

    So essentially an omake? I had thought that at first, but then some of them referenced previous omakes, so I was unsure.
    ```

    - u/VorpalAuroch:
      ```
      It's an alternate storyline, where he's considerably more ruthless. All the red is a single continuity, I'm pretty sure.

  I submitted this as a link, so I should mention here that I am not the author of this series. I have been reading it for awhile, and have not seen it posted yet, and wanted to share.

    Well worth it so far. . . but there went my schedule for today.

      Hard to read because of the site's format, but I'll deal since people are suggesting it is worth it. Almost makes me want to whip up my own wget scraper and parser to dump it to a single simple page to make it easier to read.
      ```

        You can put it all in a single page though :P

        I like to use [Page Zipper](http://www.printwhatyoulike.com/pagezipper). It’s a bookmarklet, inserts a javascript into the page on clicking.

        Also, not just for reading. It’s great for archiving interesting forum threads in one fell swoop too. You have to scroll/PgDown all the way down so all the pages get to load (Not Ctrl End.. learned that the hard way) 

        Then save the page and convert to Pdf. I think I saw a few other thread saving methods around if this doesn’t work for you.

  Just read through this in the space of a day. Pretty fun. I can't speak for how rational it is, and perhaps my taste isn't the best, but I certainly intend to read more. 

  [Edit] So, any fics of similar quality around? 'cause I really wanna read more, and clockwork daily updates just aren't enough anymore apparently.
  ```

- u/Empiricist_or_not:

  I like it so far.  

  Rationalism is an avarice, where avarice is *very loosely* defined as 'I want it,' based ideology.   Spacebattles is crashing on me at Pg 2, but so far we have a fairly standard lesswronger given superpowers, and  only the starting of the munchkindom that is to be expected.  Our hero is a bit of a twit, but that's standard.

  So, this isn't bad. Finished what's been written so far, as it is a WIP. Strong writing, at its best when going off-canon. Just wish it would do so more often. It is currently following the TV show plot closely, so I'm looking forward to the S2 time jump to see what happens after Paul's deal is over.

  That's the story I really want to read -- someone who knows details about the Big Picture dealing with intergalactic threats with a SmartRing approach. Hopefully this has all been planned as an introduction to the setting and characters, and it'll go in original directions soon.

  Let's see, what else. I think the "Renegade" path stuff isn't as good, but there is some reason for it, I'm guessing. One that goes beyond feeding the forum dwellers. Especially given how much DC loves multiple universes and crossovers from them. There is *zero* chance that RenegadePaul doesn't meet ParagonPaul at some point.

  ```
  really cool so far, but is there a guide to what the various font styles mean? I have picked up that the orange usually means something to do with his avarice/ring use but I can't figure out what the other colors mean.

  Also, is the font size just supposed to represent how loudly something is spoken?
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    I think so on the font size.  As to the font color I'm pretty sure it's [this](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Emotional_Electromagnetic_Spectrum)
    ```

  - u/clawclawbite:
    ```
    The colors are the colors of the different DC lanterns:

    Red - Rage

    Yellow - Fear

    Orange - Green

    Green - Willpower

    Blue - Hope

    Indigo - Compassion

    Violette - Love 

    (and white is life/black is death but I have not seen them)
    ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    It goes big and strange-font when he's mentally altered in some way, I think. Up to where I've read, it's only shown up in the temple of Gaea and after the lipstick incident.
    EDIT: Got to the totally-not-Korea segment. Nevermind, all yelling is large.

    Small caps are definitely whisper or whisper-like thoughts, when they've come up.
    ```

- u/rationalidurr:
  ```
  Great point besides the obvious munchkinry, after every mission the protag reviews and updates his modes of operation.

  On the other hand, if you want to hide your glowing body and posses telekinesis, use chunks of rock or metal or cloth to cover yourself up, especially if you have x-ray vision, enemy is a bit weak so far. 

  Overall great thing to read. Go read now.
  ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    The telekinesis makes the chunks of rock glow as well.
    ```

    - u/Eryemil:
      ```
      Not if he creates root-shaped tentacles of energy to pierce the rock with and hold it in place, but it seems like a lot of effort for something that his other teammates, such as Ms. Martian could do so much better. Also, OL is very effective at super long ranges. 

      Might be useful in dire circumstances though.
      ```

- u/Zephyr1011:
  ```
  This is actually surprisingly good. A lot better than I expected at the beginning. I've spent the better part of 2 days reading

  [Page 13 Spoilers](#s "The Ophidian really seems to be being portrayed as a bad influence on Paul after they merge. Is it bad that I think the Ophidian is awesome, right about most things and a vast improvement over old Paul?")
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    Well the Ophdian is a super-intelegent optimizer, but it seems like it's core utility function is possessiveness.  As a group we are prone to like things that can *just make it right*, but we don't look those gift horse in the mouth enough for the flaws.  I've been/am guilty of the same a fan of CelestAI, even if she is [Optimalverse spoiler](#s "an omnicidal maniac to "non-human" aliens.")

    Edit: grammer
    ```

- u/Eryemil:
  ```
  I've been doing nothing but reading it on my free time since yesterday when I saw the link here; just finished today's chapter. Very fun to read. 

  This story also has some very sexy undertones for me for some reason. I actually had some pretty steamy dreams about Superboy last night, not joking.
  ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  Huh. Did anyone else notice right after [Spoiler](#s "The Ophidian was removed") that Paul [Spoiler](#s "Receives a short visit from DESIRE OF THE ENDLESS.")

  Because I thought that was pretty important. 

  It means that in this universe [Spoiler](#s "the Endless exist.") Which also means that [Spoiler](#s "Lucifer exists.") Which necessarily leads to [Spoiler](#s "Yahweh being the creator of the cosmos, Hell and Heaven being real places, and all the rest or the implications inherent in the Sandman and Lucifer comics.")

  That seems to me to be rather important. Maybe he just hasn't read those?
