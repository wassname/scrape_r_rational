## [RT] Perfect State by Brandon Sanderson

### Post:

Just finished reading this and I had an absolute blast. Sanderson writes a lot of rationalish fiction in general, but this is probably the best fit for the genre of anything he's written so far. The blurb doesn't do it justice at all - it's much less about a date, and much more [about ](#s "living in a word you are aware is a simulation. Also, the relative value of the lives of simulated NPC characters.") At least, that was my read on it.

I considered giving this [another tag ](#s "for transhumanism, but that felt like a little too much of a spoiler, even though the reality of the situation is established pretty early on.")

I can't recommend this enough, especially for people who already like Sanderson's work.

  God-Emperor?  Really?  Ugh, he's only 300.  That's like, 14 in shared-world standard-equivalent-life-experience years.

  Perfect State was amazing and it's so accessible! I'm probably going to use this (along with Warbreaker) as the intro-to-Sanderson from now on, instead of Emperor's Soul.

  Ok, reading the author's Excerpt.  I will almost definitely purchase this, and read the whole story.  It is engagingly written.

  And then I'm going to snark like all hell at it.

  Like, seriously, Kai is the *only real person* in a whole sim?  And honestly, man, a high fantasy desktop theme from the bloody ancient Baseline Ages?  And you were *born* into it rather than...

  Which psychocidal jackass sanctioned this?  Who the hell is the Wode, and why is their management so clearly and flagrantly evil!?

  >Even thinking about the Wode turned me into a child again; Besk was right on that count. I’d commanded armies of thousands and I’d single-handedly forged an empire that spanned continents. But this . . . this made a spoiled brat out of me. I stopped inside the stairwell.

  No, you dumb bastard.  Commanding armies of thousands of simpering roleplaying sim half-AIs and single-handedly (actually, see previous statement on "single") forging an "empire" that spanned entire *sim*-continents made as a *game* made a spoiled brat out of you.

  I DEMAND TO SEE THE MANAGEMENT.  If sensible and decent answers are not forthcoming, I will confer with, let us call them, my comrades, and we will return with a sufficient military force to level your planet.

  Just read it on this recommendation and man, it was way to short, and I mean that in the best possible way. Highly recommended!
