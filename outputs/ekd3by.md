Pyrebound is a story of brutal power politics in a world coping with an unstoppable cycle of magic disasters.  It's almost a year old now, and it's got a reasonable-sized following.  The story begins [right here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Please consider voting on TWF if you like the story, to help spread the word.  Thank you!

  I love how you show of the interaction between the mystical and the political. If the people of this world are slaves to the gods, they really make the gods work for it.

    The funny thing is, I'm pretty sure this is much more straightforward and orderly than real-world theocracies.
