  This really puts a different spin on the line, "If a time traveller hasn't gone back in time to stop you, how bad of an idea could it really be?"

  whelp, that was an unexpectedly heartwarming story about timetravelers saving the world.

  Well that was a pretty unique take on superman's story. Really enjoyed it too. The whole "time travel has consequences on the future but the evidence / memories dissapear" thing doesn't really make much sense, but considering the kind of wacky shit that is par for the course in DC stories, I'll take it.
