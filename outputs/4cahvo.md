## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Aaaaaand the numerical measurement code I was using is buggy.  Of course.  But for a short, blissful period, it almost kinda looked like my hypothesis was correct: the trained model had a higher number.  Now it has a lower number.  God knows what I'm fucking doing anymore without a test dataset.

  Edit: hahaha fuck me, I'm mixing discrete and continuous variables and treating both as continuous.  That might be a problem, you know?

    I hope it works out for you!

    About half of my project has been realising *why* my topic seems like an obvious hole in the literature.  On good days I still think it's that crossing disciplines is rare, on bad days I dream of all the people who tried and just couldn't make it work.  Less than two months to go, now.

    One piece of advice I've run across is the [Three Clue Rule](http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule).

      Came here to post this. No rpg puzzle is actually going to be solved without strategically blugeoning the players with information.

        Depends on the group I'd argue. 5 copies of me? No riddle is ever going to get done. 5 copies of my groups designated puzzle-person? Buckle up, its going to be a fast ride.

    I've heard that when it comes to roleplaying and mysteries, first come up with a number of clues that makes the mystery super obvious and solvable. Then triple that number.  Basically, from an inside perspective it always seems much, much easier to solve than when it will be for your players to solve it. This makes sense, the author already knows the answer, so all the clues are interpreted in light of the answer.  When it's an actual mystery, it's way harder.  [Here's](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/solvable-mysteries) Elizer writing about this issue in HPMOR.

    In all the time I've been playing roleplaying games, I have never once seen a group of players actually solve a puzzle. With that in mind, I strongly recommend that you make only light preparations, and be ready to change the story to that whatever zany scheme the players come up with ends up actually working. The alternative is sitting around the table while the players twiddle their thumbs looking bored.
