## Rational comedies?

### Post:

Reading ratfics, I notice they are often a bit on the dark side of storytelling, if not outright grimdark. Sometimes (read: almost always), however, I want to read stories that follow rational tropes, but are lighthearted in nature and generally aim to get a smile out of you (and no, occasional funny moment, like in MoL, doesn't qualify).

Can you make some suggestions? Thanks!

  Hm.

  u/eaglejarl's [*What if SG-1 weren't stupid?*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11361802/1/What-if-SG-1-weren-t-stupid), [*Supernaturally Rational*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11530632/1/Supernaturally-Rational), and [*Episodic Parody: The Flash*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11583263/1/Episodic-Parody-The-Flash) would probably count.

  [*A Modern Myth*](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/) is fairly light-hearted, but I'm not sure if it's light-hearted enough.

  [*Harry Potter and the Natural 20*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20), *Harry the Hufflpuff ([{1}](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6466185/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff), [{2}](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7330591/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-2), [{3}](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10843543/1/Harry-the-Hufflepuff-3-Harry-s-Year-off))* and [*Seventh Horcrux*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux) are fun, but their rationality is dubious.

  That's... all, off the top of my head.

    Out of these, I have read HPN20 (it's so irrational it goes around and approaches rationality from the other end, it's a masterpiece XD) and Seventh Horcrux (amusing book, I rather liked it, but it wasn't awesome).

    I'll be sure to check all the other, thanks!

  It is not a rarfic, but if you have not yet done so, check out Catch-22 for a comedy about how non-rational the world and people actually are.

    Black comedy coupled with venomous satire also doesn't count.

    Edit: I mean, the book is good, and I have read it a few years ago. It's just not the kind of comedy I'm looking for here.

  The Dark Wizard of Donkerk was originally going to be Terry Pratchett style comedy.

  Edit: spelling

    But did it end up that way in it's finished state?

    - u/hankyusa:
      ```
      No. Just a fun fact.

  A Black Comedy, by the same author as Seventh Horcrux. If you liked the latter, you'll like the former. Basically a buddy-cop story between Harry and Sirius, except they aren't cops, and they don't respect the law at all, and in fact make a mockery of self-respecting institutions such as the Wizengamot,

  Don't let the title fool you, it's really got very little super serious stuff. There is a bit of seriousness, but it's pretty dedicated to being humorous throughout. Not quite a crack fic, but as close as you can get without being one. It's kinda like the silly portions of HPMOR except a whole story of them.

  (also, it's the origin of the name David Monroe. or at least it's where Eliezer got the name from. Warning: if you haven't read HPMOR, reading this fic and learning about the character David Monroe could spoil the big reveal in HPMOR.)

    It's not, totally different authors.  Also: not exactly what I'd call rational.  Their decision making process often borders on "what do I feel like doing right now?"
