  > Sasori began to speak, but Orochimaru cut him off, looking around the barely illuminated cave appraisingly, “Don’t get me wrong, I too prefer my workspace to be,” he paused, “... *moist* , but surely one needs something more than this?”

  Oh my god, is there really not a ton of Orochimaru and Sasori in Akatsuki fic out there?

    I haven't encountered any, but if anyone knows of some standouts I'd love to give them a read as well.
