## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Earlier this year [I asked the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/eq1ibu/d_friday_open_thread/fepaq0t/) for their favorite irrational science-fiction tropes for a game I was making, and the responses were so good that I [shared the beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/etbk3o/d_friday_open_thread/fffzvl4/) here. You were all a great help! It now has a release date (in two weeks) and store pages, so for the people who asked to be able to pay for it:

  Next up is a replacement for dexterity boardgame Catacombs that I can play during quarantine. So here's a [cryptic prototype](http://noisyowl.com/shuffleboardsaga/) of that.

  I had my dad rant about how death note sucked and hat the police would easily find kira out even though I told him it took place in 2000

    So how would they do it? It always seemed to me that it was kind of unrealistic how quickly L has narrowed things down, even given the stupid mistakes Light has made and some coincidences that happened because plot required them.

    It's been a long time since I've watched it, but I think he really got in trouble after he somehow used information he stole from the police through his dad, which allowed L to narrow things down from like half a country to people connected to the police department?

      Yes.  For everyone who hasn't seen a good explanation of giving away information, here's the ever-popular gwern take on it:

        I disagree with some points. He kind of assumes it as a thought experiment and not as an actual case. Light could have just done irrational things or an odd job. Light could have been leading him by the nose and he would never know. Personally, I hate when anime(or any medium) uses 'instinct' as a reason logically. It just doesnt work like that
        ```

        Right off the bat this article seems to miss that >!Light *wanted* to be known (if not identified). He wanted to be a god.!<
        ```

    - u/venky05:
      ```
      Yeah, same. If L made a single mistake, Kira could have been on like the opposite side of the world.

  So looking at the chapters for [Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation), it looks like it's been marked as complete.

  I wanna cry a bit at seeing such an amazing story being finished.........

  Does anyone have any idea what the fudge bit in the title was supposed to mean?

  EDIT: Before anyone asks, it wasn't marked as complete when the last chapter went up back on April 17th. Here's the link to the [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g33qfy/rtffwip_chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_chapter/) about the last chapter if it helps.
  ```

    It's not done.
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      Just so you know, I am _right chuffed_ to hear this.

  - u/callmesalticidae:

    Your memory *may* be playing tricks on you, but in either case you shouldn't assume that the story is actually over. 

    Chili was marked as 'complete' on [25 February](https://web.archive.org/web/20200225042916/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/12/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation), when the kids were rescuing Wonka from the VIPs. 

    My original theory was that gaze never removed the 'complete' status after his initial fakeout, but the chapter where we are introduced to the VIPs is [*not* marked as complete](https://web.archive.org/web/20200222081117/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/11/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation). Nor is [the chapter before that](https://web.archive.org/web/20200213184606/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/10/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation), but then, on 24 Jan, the [contract-signing chapter](https://web.archive.org/web/20200124133044/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/9/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation) *is* marked as complete, and so is [chapter 7](https://web.archive.org/web/20200110111754/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/7/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation), which followed the fakeout, and [Chapter 6](https://web.archive.org/web/20200104232215/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/6/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation), the fakeout in question. 

    Unfortunately, whoever was logging these chapters stopped doing so after Wonka was rescued from the VIPs, so we don't have further data to analyze. 

    Two possible scenarios: 

    1. Gaze is fucking with us and a complete archive would show that the 'complete' tag had come and gone multiple times.

    2. Gaze meant to tag it as 'complete' the whole time but accidentally untagged it as such and only fixed this a couple chapters later (not unreasonable, given how user-unfriendly FFnet is), and we're misremembering. Certainly, *I* don't remember the story being marked as 'complete' during the VIP debacle.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      It's 100% scenario #1.

      In the face of all acceptable Bayesian thinking, I assign infinite probability to the fact that Gazemaize is screwing with us.
      ```

      - u/callmesalticidae:
        ```
        At the very least, I hope that gives you some measure of comfort and mild assurance that there will probably be more chapters.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          No it doesn't, because ending the fanfic right now at chapter 18 would be a perfectly valid move for Gazemaize to take in the name of giving his readers a good mindscrew.
          ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    It was marked Complete when I caught up, and has updated once or twice since then and still been marked Complete.  Or rather, whenever I *checked* while I was catching up and reading new chapters, it was marked complete, as I cannot vouch for what it is like when I'm not looking.  Either way, I don't put much stock in the label.

  Anyone else like listening to lectures by The Teaching Company/Great Courses? They have been my constant companion for 14 years now. Sometimes I try out a new lecture series on a whim and end up falling in love with a subject I never thought I would. Last one was about the Arthurian legends. There's a surprisingly rich history there.

  I've started watching the Voltron remake, with my only prior exposure being a bunch of people saying it was really disappointing. So far I've watched season 1 through 4.

  Season 1 and 2 are okay. Lots of robots blowing up, story-wise it mostly feels like the writer is going through all the "kids with superpowers fighting aliens" cartoon tropes.

  Season 3+4 is both the most interesting and the most disappointing so far. The part where the team has to adjust to the absence of a dead member only for that member to come back almost immediately is a little jarring, but whatever, it's not like I expected him to stay dead. Also, the red guy gets to join a black ops commando for good, and that part is just awesome.

  What really disappointed me so far was the new villain. I feel like after two seasons of Darth Vader, I was promised Grand Admiral Thrawn and ended up with Kylo Ren. Seriously, his intro episode is amazing, and it does a ridiculously good job of hyping him as a main antagonist... and then he does almost nothing interesting for the entire season. Same thing for his bodyguards: they were incredibly interesting and got dropped almost immediately.

  Going into season 5 now. I'm a little anxious.

    Stay home and ride it out.  Hope you have a job during or be able to get one after it ends.  Only thing we can do.  Worrying about an incompetent government does you no good, if anything it worsens your health.

    > Anyone else feel a bit on-edge with how badly the pandemic is being handled by the government? 

    Its been horrible, the failure of leadership (not that I expected any better, but still).

    Some counties have just a handful or two of new cases per day.  And the USA is seeing thousands die per day, never mind the new case count.

    In case you missed it, Charlie Stross recently wrote how real life has caught up to some of his SF ideas, and nixed an idea he had for another Halting State universe novel:
