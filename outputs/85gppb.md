  Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

  Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

  * Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
  * Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
  * The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.

  Something I've been wondering about: what sort of penalty would an average person see for tampering with control units to the extent Hector has?  Is it worse in the Delphic-verse?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    This isn't my area of law, but typically that sort of activity is prosecuted as vandalism and/or criminal trespass here (and pretty much the same in the Delphic-verse).  He'd probably be looking at 3 to 5 years in jail plus tens of thousands in fines.
