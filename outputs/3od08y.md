  Pretty good development. I'm still waiting for the ball to drop with whatever [](#s "Kyuubi") is planning. Hopefully we'll get some of that next chapter :)

    Since when has Naruto cared about his teammates using his chakra?

  What seems to be a group

  Guess it was too much to hope Orochimaru didn't know about Shino's spying attempts :D
  Surprised Kurama hasn't started feeding him chakra from the moment he sensed the drain, but I suppose they're not really /friends/ as of this time. Still would have expected it for continued-life reasons, but could be if Naruto dies Kurama goes free from his prison rather than dying alongside his jailor.

    They will never be friends.

    >if Naruto dies Kurama goes free from his prison rather than dying

    I doubt that is the case.

    If the Kyuubi gave Naruto chakra whenever he needed it, there would be very little incentive for Naruto to meditate and expose himself to the Kyuubi's manipulations. Naruto is not in any immediate danger of dying, or the Kyuubi *would* save his life with his chakra, which means there is room for the Kyuubi to use this opportunity to build more rapport with Naruto.

      No, but there is opportunity for Naruto to risk his own life and force Kyuubi to help him, or threaten to do so.
