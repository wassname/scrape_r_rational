## [Q] Is HPMOR readable if you haven't read Harry Potter?

### Post:

I enjoy rational fiction and I often see references to Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality but I haven't read most of Harry Potter and I'm not a big fan of Harry Potter. Is HPMOR worth a read even though I haven't read the Harry Potter series?

  Reading the first HP book or watching the first movie is strongly advised, but if you can't then you can't.

    This is a correct advise and put very succinctly. Dang me when I read the username. Hello there!

  Readable? Yes. The most enjoyable way? No.

  I would highly recommend reading the first book or watching some of the movies so you get the gist of the setting and characters. Without the background the story and mechanics is still solid, but you don't get the neat moments of understanding how EY has changed characters. Dumbledore specifically springs to mind, I don't think he would be nearly as hilarious without knowing the canon character.

    HPMOR is, at least to some extent, fanfiction of Harry Potter fanfiction, rather than fanfiction of Harry Potter. There are a few places where you can see that the writing was influenced more by other works of Harry Potter fanfic than the actual Harry Potter itself, and some of the commentary that any fanfic necessarily gives on the original is, here, commentary on other works of fanfic.

      Yep. Wards, nobles houses, competent!Amelia, Tsukuyomi!Legilimency... those are all [fanfic influences](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/1ny8ha/fanfic_influences_in_hpmor/).

      Which fanfics?

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Not any particular fanfics, though there are references to a lot of them. It's fanfic of the *entire genre* of Harry Potter fanfic, or at least as much as the author had read (which I'm given to believe is a lot of them).

        That is to say, any genre has its tropes, and any fanfic community will have its tropes, its fanon, its recurring characters, etc. (Blaise Zabini is one of the better-known examples.)

        Notable one is [A Black Comedy,](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy) which EY took the name David Monroe from

        I'm going to assume you've read some fanfiction and can extrapolate what a given corpus of fanfiction is like from reading a Tvtropes page.  You don't need to read any of the HP fanfiction, watch one of the movies, maybe five or six if you really want to get deep.  HPMOR pointed me at a lot of fanfiction for things I hadn't watched or read, and eventually did watch or read. (E.G. I hadn't really watched Naruto more than any other non-shonen fan but I NOW do like it's rationalist fan-fiction; I think this is what got me to start Madoka, and I have a Pinkie-Pie and a Kyubei on top of my security monitor)

  as others have said, its beneficial, not mandatory. The more familiar you are with cannon, the more references you'll get and the more you'll be able to appreciate the changes that were made. Having said that a lot of people are recommending you read/watch the first book/movie, I think there's value in going beyond that. For example, demontors, patronuses and azkaban are pretty important to HPMOR but aren't introduced into harry potter until book 3.

  The movies are a decent substitute for the books, so i'd recommend watching the first one for sure and if you find that you enjoyed it, maybe watch some of the others, otherwise, if you find it boring, just go straight to HPMOR.

    >the more references you'll get

    It references a lot of things putside HP as well. Many subtle (and a couple *incredibly* overt) nods to a wide selection of sci-fi and fantasy works, even anime: the incantation for the Breaking Drill Hex is, apparently, *Lagann*.
    ```

    - u/htmlcoderexe:
      ```
      Also the blood fort thing is from some other anime, and I'm quite sure "Fal Tor Pan" is a star Trek reference
      ```

    Don’t get too familiar though, there’s a point where knowledge of canon gets good enough you just start to see all the flaws it does, which makes it looks even worse and more annoying. It’s part of my problem, I know HP canon sufficiently well a lot of changes that some people wouldn’t care about leap out at me which makes the whole thing appear worse, particularly as it progresses they basically just start rewriting all the rules to better push their specific views of rationality as the true way. Even early bad tropes rear their heads, but ones that are completely missable with low or medium knowledge of the series.
    ```

- u/PathologicalFire:
  ```
  Considering it was written by someone who hadn't read the whole series, I'd say yeah. Won't lie, there's some stuff you aren't gonna get- the author doesn't waste time with exposition about stuff someone who's read the books would know. That said, the parts people tend to really love don't require much background knowledge at all, so I'd say go for it.

    You could also just read the first book of HP. It's a short read.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Do this. You'll miss out on a lot of the HPMoR experience without having read the first book. Or heck, just watch the first movie!
      ```

- u/TheAzureMage:
  ```
  It's readable, but like most fanfiction, you'll get more out of it if you understand the basic device. You'll miss certain jokes, but it's a functional tale for it's own sake. 


  The further into the series you get, the less the fanfic matches up/references it, so you get the most mileage out of the first book or two.
  ```

- u/eroticas:
  ```
  Having read Harry Potter, I would think the whole thing would be a lot less humorous (especially in the beginning, which is a lot of in jokes), and you miss out on the satisfaction of seeing the characters do what they ought to have done in canon, but it is otherwise fairly intact.

    Labeled or self-labeled?

    Worm was written before HPMoR was finished.

        >Some (maybe even many) writers were probably introduced to the idea via **Worm** or Luminosity **or another fic which was inspired by HPMOR**, and maybe they never read HPMOR before starting their own work, and perhaps still haven't.

        Seriously reassess your assumptions; I'm fairly certain that Wildbow had never heard of HPMOR before Yudkowsky recommended Worm.  He's neutral-to-negative on fanfiction as a concept and primarily thinks of Yudkowsky as "that guy who gave my reader base a big boost by recommending my work to his readers".

    I think you may be overgeneralizing from your own experiences, when you recommend deliberately capping one's reading speed. For my part, I find dwelling on any given sentence of a work of fiction for longer than necessary *actively unpleasant*, and have a much lower-than-baseline rate of finishing those books whose prose necessitates doing so (e.g. by having a high density of unusual words or by using particularly hard-to-follow sentence structures). It's not a hard-and-fast rule—sometimes a story is good enough to remain worth reading despite those considerations, or uses them in a deliberate artistic fashion that I enjoy (as with, for example, stream-of-consciousness narration)—but it's a pretty strong trend nonetheless.

    None of this precludes enjoying good prose; I share your experience of enjoying HPMOR a lot more than canon HP on the micro-level enjoyment-of-sentences axis, and there are various other stories which I similarly enjoy on that level. I just appreciate the prose *as it flies by* rather than pausing to dwell on it. I suspect that many people inclined towards speed-reading share my psychology in this regard.

    (Also, on a more pedantic note: there's plenty of rational fiction which was started by someone with no prior exposure to the rationalist community or its works, many instances of which were even written before HPMOR was started; I agree that rational, and especially rationalist, fiction would be much *rarer* if not for HPMOR, but I think you're overstating your case when you say that *none* of the other ratfics would exist.)

        I think possibly I may have introduced confusion by my use of 'speed-reading' in my post. To clarify: I'm not particularly interested in a binary distinction between speed-reading and slow careful reading; I'm interested in the gradient of faster versus slower reading and the curve of readers' utility as they move along that graph. So, to give a personal example: my default reading speed is about 320-400wpm, and if I'm reading anywhere in that space I'll probably be pretty happy with the speed. When a book's prose is sufficiently difficult that I need to go down to 300wpm to retain my usual level of absorption-of-the-material, it feels off to me. I can only think of a few works of prose fiction that I've needed to go down to 250wpm for, and my distinct recollection of those works is that I found the slow pace to be a slog actively detrimental to my reading experience.

        So, sure, maybe reading at a slower speed improves comprehension. I have no quarrel with that point, and agree that the research is pretty definitive on the subject. But that point is also utterly tangential to the issue at hand, which is which reading speed will maximize a hypothetical reader's enjoyment of the work. If I were to deliberately slow my reading down to 250wpm, I'll grant that I'd probably pick up more detail on a per-sentence level, for the ten minutes I'd keep it up before giving up on the book in frustration at how slowly it's moving; but that's not a very strong argument in favor of going out of my way to read in that fashion when my goal is *enjoyment* rather than ability to recite the book's contents in detail when quizzed.

        In your original post, you made a comment to the effect that speed-reading is for work while slower reading is better for fun reading where your priority is to enjoy the work. But my experience is precisely the opposite: when I'm reading something due to an external obligation such as schoolwork, I'll read as slowly as it takes to absorb everything, in order to ensure that I retain whatever portion I need to fulfill the aforementioned obligation; but, when reading for fun, I can afford to deprioritize comprehension and prioritize *enjoyment* instead, which means reading faster, maybe missing more details, and not taking six hours to get through a ninety-thousand-word book when I can do it in four.

        More broadly, my point is that most people's hedonic sweet spots in terms of reading speed aren't necessarily going to line up with your own. You enjoy reading slowly and chewing on the individual words, and that's fine; I enjoy reading quickly and getting the higher per-second stimulation that results, at the cost of some degree of comprehension, and that's also fine; and I don't think you've presented much reason to think that I'm a bizarre psychological outlier in this regard. More likely there's a wide range of preferred reading speeds, with the two of us just sitting at different points on a larger bell curve; and my strong suspicion is that most people intuitively teach themselves to read at a speed reasonably close to the speed they enjoy most, such that if they deliberately intervene to slow their reading down it's going to move them *away* from their optimal speed rather than towards it.

  You could read it, but you'd maybe get 70% of the experience.

  A lot of the humor in the fic, especially early on, comes from looking askew at just how ridiculous some parts can be of a fantasy universe created for children to be the most important actors (e.g. quidditch, the general uselessness of adults, etc.)  Also the increasingly out of character ways some characters act after having been shaped by HPMOR Harry's actions.  It's a parody, and reading a parody without know what's being parodied and where the author is actually being affectionate with their teasing of the setting instead of malicious and skewering is a bit like trying to join in the in-jokes of a group you're not a member of.

  Harry also makes some mistakes -- BIG ones -- that aren't apparent unless you have the "meta" knowledge of who some people are and their actual motives that Harry himself does not possess.  There's sort of a creeping sense of dread that comes at times from reading his interactions with certain characters you might not get if (like him) you don't know the consequences of what he's saying to them.

  That said, all such things are revealed in time, and the story has more than enough notes of humor and dramatic tension that stand on their own to make the experience enjoyable.

  Watch the first movie at least, all of them if you can. The context helps a lot. Movies aren't a big commitment and they're pretty good anyway.

- u/Locoleos:
  ```
  It's a deconstructive work, so having some knowledge of the thing it deconstructs is going to enhance the experience a lot. Now it is of course relevant to say that EY didn't read the entire series, so you don't have to go overboard either. Also, HPMoR arguably deconstructs HP fanfiction moreso than HP itself, so eh.

  If you're just there for the more preachy bits, what you might call the rationalist as opposed to rational aspects, you'll enjoy that fine regardless.

  But honestly, just read the first book. It's short.

  I was finally convinced to start reading it by the comments in this thread, and at chapter 11, I have to this is one of the funniest books I have read in a long time, if anyone had told me that most of the rational thinking in the first part of this book at least was purely comedy, I would have picked it up ages ago, cause it freaking hilarious.
