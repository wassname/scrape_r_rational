  Reminded me a bit of the later parts of [Fine Structure](http://qntm.org/structure) for spoilery reasons, and Vernor Vinge's Zones of Thought universe (where technological progress is more or less limited depending on where you are in the galaxy). I liked it, though it was one of those things that I might have liked better at novella length (although there are always risks that an unlikable protagonist can't carry a longer work).

    I don't think it could have worked at novella length. The [ending ](#s '"entire plot was retroactively orchestrated by the main characters via time travel for the sole purpose of closing a causal loop"') ending is one that irritates me for how often it's used. The longer the story, the larger the plot, and the more difficulty I'd have swallowing that as an ending.
