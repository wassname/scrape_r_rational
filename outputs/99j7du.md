  Would you look at that:  

  * Simple yet competent analysis of a fight, and fighting in general.
  * Rational social advice that's both applicable to life, as well as insightful in general.

  It may be just me getting used to rational naruto stories, but it's a first time in a (relatively) long time I've seen actual lessons in my rational fics.

    I've always prefered rational fics with lessons or lesson-like things.  I think most of the point of rational fiction is to share useful facts/perspectives/techniques/whatever in a format that's more entertaining to read than a collection of essays.

  I'm only on chapter 1 but the demon fox doesn't just let Mizuki kill Naruto (which would be one of the conditions of being freed) and Naruto doesn't *notice*, despite the fact that Kyu just *told* him that "if you're assassinated in cold blood it will free me". And also Naruto doesn't seem nearly suspicious enough regarding the entity that as far as he knows almost destroyed his village. Oversight, or plot?
  ```

    A couple of notes:

    1. Naruto would be an absolute idiot to trust the demon fox's word on how the seal works.

    2. Naruto at the start of the story is kind of an idiot.  One of the things I wanted to do was show someone slowly acquiring rational skills over time, rather than starting out with them.

    3. The events in the first chapter (specifically the demon fox preventing Naruto from being killed by Mizuki) weren't meant to be evidence that the demon fox is lying about how the seal works.  If asked, the demon fox would say that Mizuki had already betrayed the leaf, and from his perspective Naruto was an enemy combatant.

    Having read all of it so far, definitely plot. Layers upon layers upon layers.

  This is really good. I read it all at once pretty much, and it drew me in. I really like the relationship between hinata, sasuke, and naruto. Inner Hinata is hilarious, and the overall focus of the story is great. I like that you're taking it slow with the timeline, because even as slow as it's going, it still feels too fast sometimes.

  One question I do have: What prompted you to skip the actual altercation with mizuki?

  I hope that you continue working on this (and maybe increase the pace of chapter releases a little, since it seems like this has been going two years with only 13 chapters?) and I'll be sure to keep reading.

    Thanks!

    I'd like to write more chapters, but it's slow going because the story's style is a style I don't really write in naturally any more, so it takes a long time to produce a chapter in that voice.

    ​

    Re Mizuki:

    ​

    This was one of the first things I ever wrote (the first draft of the first chapters was written \*way\* more than 2 years ago, I just decided to actually publish it two years ago).  I literally didn't know how to write when I started, so I just read through the manga and transcribed exactly what was happening panel for panel into words, then went back and edited it to have something slightly different happen.  This was a useful crutch, since I didn't understand how story structure worked, but produced predictably awful writing.

    ​

    The writing got a lot better in the later chapters once I'd had some practice (or at least I like to think it did).  Two years ago I decided to publish it, but the first chapters were godawful, so I just threw them away and rewrote them.  This was kind of boring, so I basically tried to move the story as fast as possible to the point where I felt the writing was publishable, which meant skipping everything possible.  The fight with Mizuki didn't have any important exposition or character-building in it, so I just never rewrote it.

  Just reread it, and I want more!

  I read Kyuubi’s voice as the voice of the cat in Ghost Stories.

  ```
  Holy shizzle. I love it, this is incredible. I appreciate this and look forward to the next update.

  I don't know Naturo lore particularly well as I never enjoyed the manga much. Is that going to be a problem for future chapters?
