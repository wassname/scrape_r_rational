  The following is meant as constructive criticism.

  You could greatly benefit from a beta reader of some kind. Your whitespacing is terrible, you don't use line-breaks nearly enough to differentiate between speech and actions, and some of your word choices are awkward. 

  In terms of content, I'm not sure I know much more about Orm-as-a-person in this chapter than I did in the previous one. 

  Aside from the fact that he is some kind of non-Psion telepath, and that he wasn't willing to risk execution for learning illegal mental domination powers, we don't really have much information here about how he thinks. Who he is is not necessarily the same thing as what he can do.

  I also feel like your characterization of Jake is a bit off, but it's always difficult to get into the position of someone else's character.

  Hmm, interesting thought - this is more directed at /u/eaglejarl - knowing that they are planning to betray even 100% loyal and good people, how have the Landguard not fallen yet? 

  In this case at least, we have Thomas, an already established hypocrite with anger management issues, who *knowing that he was betraying someone* by fucking with their brains in a  conspiracy and then planning to murder them before they leave, still gets angry to the point of torture when that person betrays him in turn.

  And then that person *stands up to a God to protect him from eternal torment.* Even after all of that. 

  And he's still planning to betray that person. For what amounts to not even close to a greater good, since they can just Mindscrape him to find out if he is truly planning anything or holding anything back.

  I cannot see how that is not an evil act that would cause him to fall. Especially with all the other options available to them with D&D tier magic.

  Hell, with the power they have now, no invasion that wasn't a Death Star or other Class X extinction event has any chance of damaging them. They certainly are not at risk.

  I'm going to second /u/JackStargazer in saying that you should find a beta -- the story itself is interesting, but the physical writing is rough...runon sentences, paragraphs that are too long, improper separation of dialogue, etc.

  I will partially agree with him about Jake; your characterization of him feels just slightly different, but that's fine.  The whole point of fanfiction is to explore different alternatives.

  Your characterization of Orm as a mental recording and therefore flat is okay, but the logical extension of that is that he shouldn't be flexible -- specifically, him rotating through different settings in order to make Jake more comfortable shows a problem-solving ability that I would not have expected.  I think you need to decide whether he is a recording or a true personality; in the former case he should *behave* like a recording and in the latter he should be less emotionally flat.

  In addition, you're burning more time on the conversation than necessary.  Despite being told "hey, the Landguard is going to kill you soon", Jake seems to be futzing around a lot asking for burgers and such.  Despite repeated assassination attempts, I would still expect this to get his attention.
