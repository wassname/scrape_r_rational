Lets you fly trough space as a free point of view.

Contains the entire Hipparcos catalog of stars, as well as all known extrasolar planets, over ten thousand galaxies, and all of the most prominent objects in our Solar system are included. This adds up to over 130 000 objects. 
As for procedural objects, there are more galaxies and star systems in SE than exist in reality in all of the observable universe.

Has lots of cool options, like being able to manually search for celestial bodies, accelerate and reverse time, orbit and track a planet, add custom music files (ogg filetype only i think), visit moderately detailed planet surfaces and even get exact details on anything.

Game is free.

  Love this concept, but there's no linux version. :(

  One of the best uses that seems suggested (especially by the name) but sadly nobody seems to have done yet, is to have this as the background/basis/seed chooser for what is pretty much any unrelated game taking place on a single planet in real time, redoing entirely the modeling and rendering of that one planet but using the generated heightmap and geology and such as the starting point, and using it for a spectacular skybox and controlling light conditions and calendar and such.

    At least, Linux is "planned" according to the FAQ.

    edit: and it seems to work well in Wine
