  tl;dr: "[1632](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1632_%28novel%29) with Uruks".

  Biggest criticism for me is that Saruman's voice sounds ... off. He sounds like he's reading off Wikipedia sometimes. Could have spent some more time polishing his manner of speech, but it's all good for the crossover awesomeness.

  I love this thing, but it's boring sometimes. The author knows a lot about weapons and war though.

    If you like often highly specific and technical reading I definitely recommend the alternatehistory.com boards where the author posts this story. You can find lengthy stories on what seem like tiny changes and outside of ASB (alien space bats) forum they all are attempting to accurately represent people and their desires (huge part of history), no evil irrational antagonist. You also get lots of discussion about how a 17th century weaponry operates etc. I've recommended the site before here.

      Any particularly good stories?

    I also love it, and yes, on occasion he goes a bit too deep into technical details, but that doesn't discourage me from continuing to read. Pity it updates so very rarely.

      I started reading *MoR* three years ago. I think I can wait.

  So after reading the first two chapters I have one thing that irks me most. The Uruk's anachronism. It makes sense that the ancient and wise Saruman mentally connected to the stunted FAI 'Central' thinks in a rather modern fashion, but what made the Uruk into disciplined and educated men discussing Gandalf's bigotry? And what happened to the LOTR canon degeneration. Did Saruman manage to cure his race completely of everything but their ugly face despite millennia of corruption through Morgoth?

    >the LOTR canon degeneration

    Which is, of course, merely a racist stereotype perpetuated by the enemies of scientific advancement â€“ one that, it seems, you've bought hook, line, and sinker. Feel free to educate yourself on your antiquated bigotry with the Salon essay [*Enemy of Progress*](http://www.salon.com/2002/12/17/tolkien_brin/) and the excellent fanfic [*The Last Ringbearer*](http://ymarkov.livejournal.com/280578.html).

      So generations of purposeful inbreeding don't have any actual effect? Because it seems like the book treats all the rest of the book as canon, including fiery balrogs, magical palantir and Sauron with all his evil magic and manifold minions. In any case, even if the Uruk minds are as sharp or sharper than those of humans they still wouldn't suddenly become a wise-cracking, post-medieval culture casually talking about Gandalf's bigotry. Not to mention how they are suddenly completely at home with any new innovation, supremely understanding and disciplined and generally more perfect than life all the while, if I understood the Uruk creation process right, having had less than 5 years of education since their birth. Because if Uruk have a normal life cycle then when did Saruman manage to breed several regiments plus support staff in the little time since he came into contact with Sauron? And who the hell gave them all of that anachronistic culture? Allfather Saruman?

        If dogs are any indication you can (in)bred for discipline and kindness just as well as you can (in)bred for agression, size, hair color etc.

    I am curious how it will develop given that God literally has a plan for this world that He's acting to defend and I'm pretty sure that plan does not include outerdimensional AIs. I wonder if this world is even still in the same cosmology. I mean, the power of the Maiar is technically outerdimensional itself, no? So how does that work with the cosmology?

    It seems to me like this story takes Uruk as a distinct species from the Orcs and does something very common in a lot of the rational fiction I've read which is not accepting arbitrary corruption or evil.
    ```

  Excellent, but hasn't updated for over 6 months.
