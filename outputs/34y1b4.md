  Accept-by-default policy for social events.

  Also exercising immediately after getting home, when I'm still winded from the walk/stairs.

    > Accept-by-default policy for social events.

    Interesting. I think that my quality of life improved significantly when I switched to reject-by-default. But I'm an introvert, and social events take a lot of energy.

      ```
      I am introverted by default too.  Rejecting social events is easier, but worse for long term mental health.  At least for me.

        It might be more on-point to say that isolation is bad for mental health.

        In my observation, one pattern that seems to work for introverts to stave off isolation, is arranging many regular meetings with a few well-known people. Not being an introvert myself, I can't comment on whether this is actually less draining than 'accept social events by default' , but it sounds like it should be. In any case, since I see this actually happening, I guess it must seem to work out positively to the introvert in question.

  Sleep 9 full hours a night.

  Seriously. Sleep is severely underrated from a health and productivity stand point. 

  Go to bed early, get up early. Get your Benny Franklin on. 

  I have trouble sleeping. I used to stay up really late and occasionally sleep really late. I'm at least 3 times as productive now that I go to bed before midnight and wake up before 930.
  ```

  - u/Khaos1125:
    ```
    I have some of the worst habits of anyone I know when it comes to sleep, so hearing that it made you 3 times as productive is eye-opening.  

    So some questions, if your willing to answer them.  

    * Are there any other factors that might account for the change in productivity, or is it very clearly sleep that's the culprit?  

    * What field do you work in?  Would you say it's a field with obvious floors and ceilings to productivity, or is it a field where it's realistically possible to be 10x, or even 50x as productive as the average worker?  
    * How important is creativity in the work you do (asking because things that you wouldn't expect to impact creativity often do, eg caffeine, alcohol)?

    * Are you measuring productivity, and if so, how?

    Thanks

      >Are there any other factors that might account for the change in productivity, or is it very clearly sleep that's the culprit? 

      It could simply be being up early, and not the actual sleep. I certainly did sleep in before, though my sleep was very inconsistent. So it might be the consistent wake time, the wake time being early, or just consistently getting a similar amount of sleep rather than the raw amount of sleep itself.

      >What field do you work in? Would you say it's a field with obvious floors and ceilings to productivity, or is it a field where it's realistically possible to be 10x, or even 50x as productive as the average worker? 

      I'm an actuarial student. Still looking for my first entry level job. But I notice a HUGE increase in my ability to retain information as a study for my next exam (actuaries take a lot of exams) as well as a significant increase in my practice test scores. I'd say that an estimate of three times as many brain-fart type mistakes while on less than a full nights sleep would be reasonable and probably conservative. I can go from getting 10 questions (out of 35) wrong purely out of stupid mistakes to making only a few mistakes. It is *very* noticeable. Honestly, I think back on all the tests I got very little sleep for in high school and college, and all the stupid mistakes (on said tests) I couldn't believe I made... ugh. Not fun to think about.

      >How important is creativity in the work you do (asking because things that you wouldn't expect to impact creativity often do, eg caffeine, alcohol)?

      At the moment not very. I just study, apply for jobs, and tutor on the side. Its really the information retention that I see such a difference in, as well as the elimination of "brain farts." Brain farts being mistakes that I clearly shouldn't be making given my comprehension of the material.

      >Are you measuring productivity, and if so, how?

      The three times thing is based on my ability to do practice problems combined with the lack of dumb mistakes. Its just an estimate.

    This really depends on your chronotype, though. Perhaps you're an early riser who benefits from that, but someone else might benefit equally by going to bed later and getting up later. And someone *else* might benefit from going to bed earlier and getting up later.

  Give up drinking any sugary drinks = low-hanging fruit to eat more healthy. Ironically I'm often underweight due to my quick metabolism, but that's been slowing down since I entered college. So I also have friends to go to the gym with. Quick way to go cold turkey is to drink nothing but water for a few days. Soda will taste overly sweet afterwards.

  ...

  Double-major = Not the best choice for everyone, but it's been pretty good for me to know that I will have a lot of flexibility in my future career when I graduate with a BA in Cognitive Science and Computer Science. Just the increased confidence in my future has been pretty helpful. Therefore I recommend having a solid plan for the next few years to get a sense of security.

  ...

  Finding a good role model in my older cousin = He introduced me to HPMOR and I respected him so much that I wanted to be like him. Since we were pretty similar in personalities and how we lived our lives, I had a sneak-peek into how my future might look like and could anticipate certain choices I would be making. If you can find someone who acts like you and can from similar circumstances or lifestyle but is living a good life, then ask them how they got to that point and copy them. Multiple role models would be good in this case.

  ...

  Join a social group = I joined a group with a common interest in computers and as a result I'm invited to a lot more social events and my introversion doesn't 'trick' me into staying in my room all the time. Find a club or social activity you can go to weekly or more often.

  ...

  Learn a second language = I'm learning ASL now and it's so invigorating to be able to 'talk' in multiple languages and to understand another culture. The problem most people (in the US anyway) have with learning another language is that they try to learn in a school setting and when they fail assume it's because they are inherently bad at it. But if there is one subject that the public school system is bad at teaching above all others is foreign languages. Taking the time to join a club which meets weekly to have conversations in the foreign language will teach you more in days than months of classroom learning. I recommend buying or renting a textbook to learn a few phrases and the culture behind the language for a start. Then find a class/club to join. The public school system is bad because of the focus on grades, but a class/club available for anyone of any age to join tends to be more focused on actual proficiency and is more of a casual environment to learn in. A quick way to tell if a class/club is very good is if the teachers require you to only speak in the foreign language while in the classroom (it's okay if they allow speaking in English for the first half or something similar).

    Holy crap.  You are *phenomenally* well put-together for an undergrad.  I really wish I could have been like you.

    Any time you have a question about comp sci stuff, what grad school is like, or what industry is like: ask away!

    If you don't mind the offensive question: what's your near-term (five to ten years) goal?  The thing listed in your flair ;-)?

      Thanks for the compliment! I'm curious, what stood out to you as being a particularly good choice on my part?

      > Ask away!

      I'm planning on taking a look at potential graduate schools over the summer (I'm a sophomore going onto junior) and the biggest concern I have is deciding whether or not I can handle the stress of the course work and thesis/projects. Can you give me a good idea of how difficult it was for you to go through grad school as compared to college? Bonus points if you were part of a research group as an undergrad and can compare it with research as a grad.

      > What's your near-term (five to ten years) goal?

      Mostly just spending time learning and enjoying my life as a college student. After all, these *are* likely to be some of the best years of my life. ;)

      However after I graduate, I know that I would love to go into research in cognitive science or work in the field of AI research. I seem to be leaning towards cognitive science because it's just so much easier for me to do better than the majority of the students in my classes and I'm working on a research project in building a language corpus from the words children (six months to four years old) are exposed to as well as another research project I've been accepted into for junior year. My dream goal would be to get famous and rich off of developing some sort of intelligence enhancement drug/therapy. I promise to give the people here a discount. ;>

        Most people don't have the self-direction necessary to front-load their learning in life.  While you're young and in school, you can spend waaaay more time on study, and subsequently research, than when you get to be a "real adult" and have to keep money coming in all the time.  This applies whether you choose a "career in" industry (where you have to write and ship productive code for your boss all day) or academia (where, as a full professor, you would have to keep grant funding coming in for your grad-students).

        Most people [half-ass their youth with everything they've got](http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/), or just *entirely* half-ass it.  I did the former, and now wish I hadn't.

        You can do much more interesting stuff as an adult if you've front-loaded your learning, and you can also do much more interesting stuff as an adult if you *keep* learning, rather than if you do like some of my friends and let yourself forget everything you learned in school once you've got a job.

        >Can you give me a good idea of how difficult it was for you to go through grad school as compared to college? Bonus points if you were part of a research group as an undergrad and can compare it with research as a grad.

        Undergrad research is designed for undergrads.  You can have a good time being someone's "trained monkey".  (I have heard undergrad researchers *actually referred to this way*, being a grad-student.)  However, once you're in grad-school, you need a *much* more solid mathematical background in your subject than you needed to get through undergrad.

        I did not know real analysis, optimization, abstract algebra, category theory, or statistics when I entered grad-school.  At the very least, I managed to leave knowing some bits-and-pieces of optimization, and a solid grasp on statistics and machine learning, and a fair grasp on the Coq proof assistant and type theory.  My actual thesis was in empirical software engineering, partly because that was what my advisor did, and partly because without a lot more background, I couldn't do anything more mathematical.

        (Which is why I'm studying a bunch of maths in my spare time right now!  Think we should do a textbook recommendation thread?)

        Also, grad-level research is more stressful, because it is your career riding on doing rigorous research *and getting positive results to publish even though rigorous research sometimes doesn't yield those.*

        >I'm planning on taking a look at potential graduate schools over the summer (I'm a sophomore going onto junior) and the biggest concern I have is deciding whether or not I can handle the stress of the course work and thesis/projects.

        That depends how you define "can handle".  If you are well-organized and can take care of yourself well, you can complete a PhD without acquiring any new mental illnesses.  But it will be stressful, no matter what.

        But then again, industry work is usually *also* stressful, but often far less in-depth and interesting.

        >Mostly just spending time learning and enjoying my life as a college student. After all, these are likely to be some of the best years of my life. ;)

        Undergrad can be.  But it seems to me most people who say that are like the people who said similar about high school: they're spending more time not-working than working, and so will be screwed when the next thing happens and society didn't allocate them a Designated Job to step right into.

        >However after I graduate, I know that I would love to go into research in cognitive science or work in the field of AI research. I seem to be leaning towards cognitive science because it's just so much easier for me to do better than the majority of the students in my classes and I'm working on a research project in building a language corpus from the words children (six months to four years old) are exposed to as well as another research project I've been accepted into for junior year. 

        I also recommend cog-sci, on grounds that it's actually a rigorous science.  Far be it from me to claim human cognition is the only possible kind, but imagine trying to design an aeroplane if you can't explain how and why a bird flies!  No, what you need is not a theory of flappy-flap, but you *do* need one of *aerodynamics*, and both cognitive science and theoretical neuroscience are much more closely investigating the information dynamics of cognition than AI, which [seems to focus on taking a bunch of philosophical theories and thinking very hard about their philosophical implications](http://lesswrong.com/lw/m5c/debunking_fallacies_in_the_theory_of_ai_motivation/cc0v), rather than on figuring out how an actual embodied mind has to work to do its job.

        >My dream goal would be to get famous and rich off of developing some sort of intelligence enhancement drug/therapy. I promise to give the people here a discount. ;>

        Well, that *does* sound ~~paranoid~~ ambitious enough.  And thank you for the discount; I in turn solemnly swear not to destroy the world under any circumstances.

    Oh man, I can totally second the thing about sugary drinks.

    And, if I may say so, there are times when it kind of sucks. Because I had gotten into a habit of having soda with pizza or with certain kinds of pretzels, or with cheez-its, and now it feels weird to not have soda with those things, but the soda is absolutely disgusting. 

    But I've been months without soda now. Almost a year, if you don't count my two or three abortive attempts to have soda with one of the aforementioned foods, only to dump my glass down the sink. 

    (Also white bread and non-Greek yogurt: I can't stand those either)

  This is kinda weird, and almost the opposite of the thread's implicit purpose, but...when someone gives me advice, I attach a high probability to it just not working. People love to give advice, and it's frequently well-intentioned advice, but a great deal of the time it's just cliched nonsense or patterns inferred from insufficient data. Giving useful advice that generalizes across differences in individual circumstances is *hard*, and to a first approximation, no one can do it.

  I've found it much more useful to sit down, analyze the situation explicitly, write down my assumptions if I'm uncertain and imagine each one being false (this is like the #1 most awesome thinking/debugging tool I've found), and then build my own solution. Use advice and the experience of other people as *information* you can use to build your own solution, not a solution in and of itself.

  There's a lot of literature written by highly successful people, saying things like "I used these 3 principles, and went from rags to riches". People often jump on these like maniacs, ignoring the fact that random factors are always a major component. A few principles do seem to work, but they're hard to find and rarely guarantee success. It's easy to fall into the trap of using the ones that feel good or profound or something like that.

  My position on advice developed once I read a Quora thread on intellectual giftedness that was full of fairly obvious things about being gifted. The one post that got my attention was that advice that works for normal folks will fail for gifted people, because giftedness has some correlation to cognitive unconventionality. So attempting to force yourself into standard patterns is likely to fail.

  Following *that* principle has paid off well, and I don't think it's limited to gifted people at all. Individual variation is way too great to let yourself be fully defined by your culture, or religion, or society, or what have you. Much better to become a "nation of one" and use the intellectual flexibility that comes with that.

  And...er, bear in mind that this post may not generalize well to other people either. ;)

  Getting into social dancing (swing, blues, and contra are all good choices). This can to some extent also be read as a recommendation for social physical activities in general (e.g. casual sports, rock climbing, canoeing).

  For the long term, though, it might be some more blue-sky activity like "reading some math textbooks."

  * In college, after 6 years of being a writer, becoming a computer programmer instead, because it made me happier. 
  * A few months ago, after 20 years of programming, becoming a writer instead of a computer programmer, because it made me happier. 
  * Getting married. 
  * Getting divorced. 
  * Founding 3 different startups and making different mistakes each time. 
  * Getting out of startups to a job where (YMMV) the majority of people are not sociopaths. 
  * Quitting that job because the clients clearly wanted to get rid of us. 

  Life is where you find it, and the choices you make right now that will have the biggest impact -- for better as well as worse -- will not be right later on. Make a habit of re-evaluating periodically and seeing if you've outgrown any of your prior choices. That's the real lesson I can offer. 

  Also, a useful but less important lesson: choose your career path, don't let it choose you. If you're a programmer, learn a new technology every month and a new language every six; if you're something else, do the equivalent. No matter what you are, always be thinking what you want your next job to be and actively set yourself up for it through study and networking.

  Well, the best change in my life was my Free State Project move, back in 2009.

  I suppose extrapolating that into general life advice would be "Surround yourself with people who have similar goals and ideals as the person you want to become". 

  This can be done without even the extreme effort of moving cross-country. 

  Want to stop smoking? Surround yourself with non-smokers

  Want to lose weight? Surround yourself with healthy people.

  And, of course, the reverse is true as well. 

  Want to be productive? Stop hanging out with lazy people.

  Want to be rich? Stop hanging out with people who spend money carelessly (be they rich or poor)

  You will unconsciously emulate the habits of the people you spend the most time with. Or at least I do, and I don't believe I'm that much of a mutant.
