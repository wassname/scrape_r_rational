  I love this on a level that cannot be described in English. Maybe Furling has a word for it.
  ```

  This is totally canon in my head. The sad thing is, the stargate is actually incredibly safe by Ancient standards. It has an intuitive interface, failsafe mechanisms and it outputs its warnings on stderr.

  Most of the problems the SGC has with its target are due to the fact that they are using a housemade cobbled interface that physically manipulates the gate instead of the normal "press the buttons to activate" DHD. Plus, Goa'ulds always sending super-powerful energy beams at it to blow up earth.

    Even a number of times the systems they use come up an error...and then they just find a way to circumvent it and dial to the place, causing some kind of problem
    ```

- u/EasyMrB:
  ```
  That was *amazingly* wonderful.  Thanks for posting it!
  ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  wasn't this already posted on here a while back?
  ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    Yes, but we encourage reposting (within reason).
    ```

    - u/chaos-engine:
      ```
      And thank god for that! I wouldn't have seen this otherwise
      ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    Yeah, it was written by /u/DRMacIver, and he posted it here. It was recently on the front page of hackernews, so that's probably why it's here.
    ```

- u/thedarkone47:
  ```
  How many of the scenarios at the end where in the show?
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    At least most, based on what I can recall, but I'm pretty sure all.
    ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    1, 3, 4, 5(ish), 6 all appear in the show. I don't *think* 8 does but similar things do. The others are made up.
    ```

- u/Corticotropin:
  ```
  I haven't read or seen the Stargate series, but... could someone fill me in on the particular humor ? :v
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    A lot of the situations and quirks described happen in the series, and are assumed to be due to fundamental properties of the wormholes the gate use.
    ```

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  Where can I hire a Furling? They sound awesome.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    I'm surprised the Ancients didn't use them more often. After all, how much would *you* charge to engage in your favorite hobby?
    ```
