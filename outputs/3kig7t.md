  It's interesting to me that most people assume that aliens which come to Earth would have no interest in actual Earthlings for the purposes of slavery. I suppose the thought is "if you have interstellar travel, you already have all the AI and robotics that you need, so why use humans". I'm not entirely sure that's correct though. After all, humans would technically have the capacity for interstellar travel via generation ship, if we really put our capital towards it, and we don't have unlimited robotics or artificial intelligence.

  So imagine a species that is maybe twenty years ahead of our own in terms of technology. Either they don't care one whit about human life, or they're in truly dire straits, but either way they've decided that the need both the production and intellectual capacity of an alien species. That gives them plenty of reason to conquer Earth, especially if they're naturally disinclined towards cooperation. This is especially the case if they don't have a home to go back to for one reason or another, or if "home" is so far away that it's hardly worth thinking about.

  The real question, to my mind, is why they would try to conquer instead of just engage in trade. But if you go down that path, I suppose you have *A Deepness in the Sky*.

    Sufficiently advanced trade is indistinguishable from conquest. Apple Inc. has more actual power over people's day to day lives than the Chinese military. (More money, too.) That was effectively the original plan in *A Deepness in the Sky*: sell the aliens space travel, portable electronics, perhaps a few cryptography algorithms, and you'll own a significant fraction of the planet's economy. Then freeze yourself for a few decades while the industry catches up with the new technology, and when you wake you can buy your very own city-sized starship.

    Not significantly different, in my mind, from conquering the planet and building your own starship factories, except that less people die.

    Conquest makes sense if they don't trust humans to implement their productivity improvements, and those improvements weigh up to the cost of conquest. Humans may not volunteer to be hooked up with a dopamine pump linked to the aliens' utility function, but such a device would probably improve productivity significantly for typical work-to-get-paid types.

    Also, I don't see how trade would work without the threat of force from the aliens: the hosts could offer an extremely crooked deal if the aliens' are dependent on them for basic necessities.

    If we really put our capital towards it, we have most of the robotics we need too. At least for anything you could use slavery for.

    I gave a similar answer in the original thread but didn't want to post it in this one for fear of contamination. General AI may just be very very hard, or it may be lesss economical than the fairly trivial task of coercing a bunch of already existing intelligent natives to do the work. This is unlikely to be repetitive manual labour, but more like complex construction, engineering and design work thats hard to automate.  


    > The real question, to my mind, is why they would try to conquer instead of just engage in trade.

    Several reasons. Perhaps our current political and economic system isn't suited to their needs and they think they can run it more effectively. Why have any humans wasting precious hours on creating non-essential products when they can all be working for you? Also trade would over time increase our power relative to them, which might be bad, why give us the chance to reverse engineer technology or in other ways become a threat?

  The quartz-based alien lifeforms have been in communication with our trees for millions of years. Recently the trees asked them to come to the planet and help them reduce the number of a pest population that was causing global deforestation, and the trees offered a significant portion of Earth's silicon reserves as payment. The quartz-based life forms don't operate on our timescales, and neither us nor they can perceive the other as living.

  As two commenters observed, reason 1 is to prevent humans from spawning a competing superintelligence and reason 2 is to consume the negentropy of the material making up Earth.

  More material to use for computronium? A sci-fi story where earth was quickly devoured by nanobots and then used to emulate more alien minds seems anticlimactic, but realistic.

  Because rapidly self-improving intelligence (humans, technology) is dangerous?

  Surprised that wasn't the first response, considering how many unfriendly AI discussions we have on this subreddit :P

  A quasiFriendly singleton consuming the Earth and uploading its inhabitants by force. Alternately, not uploading its inhabitants.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    You know, I think I might have to argue with the notion that quasi-Friendly singletons are realistic.  Just because *Prime Intellect* and its spiritual successor are available to us, doesn't mean things really work that way.

    In fact, I imagine, since these things are more like directions than locations, that if you switched on a UFAI, you would just get obviously Unfriendly behavior *really quickly*, because it would never condition on new information about the human operators' intentions.  The degree to which this is true determines the degree to which we need to either Solve Everything Forever This One Time, or can use more gradual or learning-based approaches to solving the actual problem.

  I see a lot of arguments that resources aren't a good reason to invade the earth, that there's easier places to get resources elsewhere.

  But if you're an alien ASI and the first/only known singleton, you might want *all* the resources. Sure Mars is empty, and it'd dismantle Mars too, but eventually it'd want all those atoms the earth is made from. 

  Another potential explanation might be that this singleton sees us heading towards developing our own strong AI, and tries to wipe us out to protect its status as the singleton.

  Harvesting unique dna sequences?

  You never know how useful a single celled organism may be for farming a chemical resource that their evolutionary tree skipped.

  In my mind, the three most likely reasons for aliens to want to conquer Earth are:

  * First, Xenophobia.  Incompatible species/ they don't trust us/ we smell bad/ we eat things that look like them/ Really bad experiences with other aliens before us/ etc.

  * Second, Colonization.  They are more advanced than us.  We are taking up valuable space and resources.  We steal valuable components and resources from them.  We are a possible disease vector.

  * Third, Religion or something analogous to it.

  When I say conquer Earth, I mean eradicate humans.  All they would have to do is look at our history (or perhaps their own if they were like us) and see that if they don't get rid of all of us, they might as well not attack us at all.  Otherwise we're just going to use asymmetrical warfare against them in any scenario short of mind control technology or their-science-is-magic levels of technical disparity.

  Game Theory.

  If you shiv your partner before the cops catch the two of you, he can't choose defect in the iterated prisoner's dilemma. It's even better than choosing cooperate.

  I assume it is really about "conquering" not "fighting humanity". If they just feel threatened by humans, then sending a big asteroid is the easiest attack, but that is not "conquering".

  Habitable space. The same reason why we want to colonize Mars. We run out of space here and more planets means more diversification aka insurance against existential risks for our species.
  ```

  - u/Eryemil:
    ```
    That's the least realistic reason. Or one of them. Any species that can make that trip don't need our planet for anything. 

    A more realistic cause would be ideological, as that is not required to make sense. Specially if it's some drive of belief that is actually alien to our values.
    ```

    - u/Farmerbob1:
      ```
      We do not yet know how common liquid water worlds are.  Even if they are reasonably common, it's still probably cheaper to establish a colony on an existing planet than build the equivalent surface area of habitable volume in space.

      Room for population expansion is one of the most likely reasons for an advanced race to colonize and/or war with other races.

  Why do humans conquer things?
  Religion, Revenge (political showboatmanship), Resources, Glory

  To me it feels like Colombus, Glory, Gold and God. Speculating on alien religion seems pointless as there is no information to think about. It is unlikely humanity has managed to offend another species that is hitherto unknown unless it is for moral objections (disregard for plantlife, and climate change etc.).
  In terms of resources, we don't have many that uninhabited planets lack. Our minerals, are not rare. Our organic compounds are the only thing likely to get us looked at if the aliens haven't seen them before.

  My take on this is that we end up with Aliens like Cortes who see some of Earth's organic compounds and want to see all of them so that they can artificially generate more. It turns out to be cheaper to make humans do it than build machines, and so aliens try to conquer the planet because humans don't want to have the planet teraformed to support genetically modified organisms that just generate organic molecules for aliens.
