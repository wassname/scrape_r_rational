  Realistic. Most past humans were farmers or hunters. Most modern knowledge isn't useful for either.

  The common knowledge we do have that is useful to them, like crop rotation or boiling bandages, isn't easy to prove worthwhile in a hurry.

  "Trust me, three years from now your crops will be better!" Not much of a sales pitch, is it?

  If you get sent back in time, you want to get to a city or a royal court, where things like math, astronomy and world maps will have value. (Medieval Iceland, of course, had neither cities nor royalty.)

    Plus in a city, you can become a playwright, musician, author, and at least make money.  Most ancient music, at least the ones that survived, were really nondiverse and bland by modern standards.

  I love all of the classic authors' middle fingers to peggy sue fantasies. From Poul Anderson to Mark Twain, it's all delicious.

    There's a Lord of the Rings fanfiction that has a modern girl be transported to Middle Earth, right in the middle of the story. She spends all the time confined in Rivendell, struggling to learn to speak the language and with issues such as "how the fuck do I keep clean during my cycle without pads or tampons?!?". 

    It's called [Don't Panic](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1690622/1/Don-t-Panic).

    Twain was pretty optimistic, connecticut yankee has a whole industrial revolution before he goes down to Merlin. That's really what this author is sending up.

  Isekai of engineer into medieval world would be not much different from dropping him into  territory controlled by Boko Haram. Let him try to convince Boko Haram to use combat drones assembled from Ali Express parts  instead of suicide bombers and invest into establishing semiconductor fabs instead of drug trade.

    I don't think it's that terrible, but lots of the knowledge wouldn't be very useful. Some metallurgy though might be applied right away; the engineer could become an ironmaker or a smith (well, if he's a man. As a woman... tough luck, probably), after suitable apprenticeship.

    Nobody knew about steam engines until the late 17th century. Super simple concept to explain & execute, good way to at least get comfortable.
    ```

      Steam engines aren't useful without cheap coal.

      The first steam engine shows up around 100 BC - the aeolipile of Heron of Alexandria in Roman Egypt. It's a toy, basically. Nobody can afford to throw enough fuel into those things to do work.

      What changes around 1700? The British are mining coal, lots of it, and their mines are flooding with water. So you can burn coal in the mines, to heat the water in the mines, to drive a steam engine to clear water from the mines.

      TBF, if you could bring back a modern machine shop, you could build a steam engine that was efficient even without a whole coal mine's worth of coal to work with. You'd still need coal, not wood, to make it worthwhile; but there are places with surface coal deposits.

        Womp. Guess I wouldn't do much better than poor Gerard after all. If I were knocked back to the same geographic location 1000 years ago, the best I could hope for would be joining up with a friendly band of Lenape & hoping I don't carry any smallpox.

        You just put wood in the oven to make stacks of charcoal and use that.
        ```

        - u/DXStarr:
          ```
          Chopping wood is expensive (in labor). You'd lose far more manpower in harvesting the lumber than you could make up with any plausible application of the steam engine.

          There's nothing wrong with charcoal, but any situation where you have to chop down trees for fuel is one where you're better off with muscle power than steam.
          ```

          - u/wren42:
            ```
            that's why you need an early iron golem farm off the villiagers, Iron ax speeds up wood collection, and once you have that first charcoal stack for torches and iron pickaxe you can go diamond and redstone hunting and start moving toward fully automated society.
            ```

          You already do that. But you need the coal to make steel. Here's [an exhaustive explanation of the process in medieval time](https://acoup.blog/2020/09/25/collections-iron-how-did-they-make-it-part-ii-trees-for-blooms/).

  If you want a detox from that, I recomend:  


  **Cross-Time Engineer by Leo Frankowski**  


  A high-testosterone, old school isekai of a 1990s engineer being time-stranded in 1200s Europe, and realising that in 12 years the Mongols will come and slaughter his new friends.  


  He then goes on a berserk industrial-upgrade rampage to prepare Medieval Poland and Hungary to fend off the Mongols.
