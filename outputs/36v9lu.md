  How crack does the crackfic need to be? And can I use my own stuff (and is it wrong that my own stuff is my favorite, since it is *exactly* calibrated to my tastes)? Screw it, I'll do it anyway. [Lex Luthor from Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) gets dumped into [my crack/slash epilogue of HPMOR](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2zakjx/spoilers_all_a_crackslash_epilogue/).

  Lex Luthor is sucked through a portal, and ends up in the far-off future of the year 1991. The world is a new and confusing place; technologies that were theoretical in the 1930s are now the sort of thing that only old people use. Lex has been deprived of his vast fortune, his invaluable assistant Mercy Graves, and the bulk of his knowledge is out-of-date. He goes to the library to find information on what's happened, and finds that the entire world is not what he remembered it to be. There is no Metropolis; New York City has taken its place. Lex greedily searches out references to Superman, only to find that in this universe, Superman is a fiction, as is Luthor himself.

  He spends the next few months trying to rebuild his knowledge and his wealth; identification has become much more difficult in this new era, and knowledge is the domain of specialists rather than the generalist that Lex had always seen himself as. He's intelligent though, and driven by the desire to understand the gulf between the universe he'd been in and this new one. He takes over one business, and then another; the technologies have changed, but the backroom deals and pressure tactics largely have not, given that people are still people. There are exciting things happening in the world of financial securities, and over the course of seven years, he propels himself to the top.

  Still, there's something missing. There's no big problem to be solved; there are no aliens here. The very laws of physics seem to be different, as they would never permit something like krypto particles. Lex reads the comic books, and they make his past life seem foolish. The accumulation of power seems pointless; it has nothing on the importance of saving the world from Superman. All that changes in 1998 when Lex falls ill with lung cancer.

  He makes a study of his disease. He learns everything there is to know about it. He brings in the best specialists, and oversees new and exciting research. None of it does much more than slow the progression. His comic book counter-part died of cancer, and Lex wonders if this is a joke the universe is playing on him. Then one day, he makes a miraculous recovery.

  Lex does not believe in miracles.

  His people want him to be thankful. Instead, he's suspicious. He makes a study of spontaneous remission. He gathers logs from hospitals, under the guise of an interest in healthcare. It's natural for him to assume that his opponent -- and he already thinks of this phenomenon in those terms -- can watch him at every moment. It takes a cluster of top-of-the-line computers and complex mathematical models in order to find the pattern. The enemy is smart, his tracks have been covered, but there is still an unmistakable sign. The enemy understands statistics and how to make a pattern appear random, but the fact that the enemy is trying to accomplish his goals means that there is some leakage of information.

  Lex Luthor finds his first wizard in the spring of 1998. By the time summer comes around, he is ready for war.

    Why exactly would he wage war on the wizarding world?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      The tendency of wizards to practice memory erasure on a massive scale would probably be a big reason.
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        So get them to stop. They only have legal memory erasure because of the International Statute of Secrecy. That wouldn't necessitate war, just breaking the Statute in an irreversible way.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          > The Obliviation Problem had been troubling Hermione for a long time. In short, it was possible for a wizard to do whatever they liked to a muggle without regard for things like consent or ethics, and then erase all their memories of it after the fact. This made it nearly impossible to realize there had been a crime at all. Under the old regime, the response had simply been to shrug and say that these things happened, with the unspoken agreement being that it was practically a victimless crime. Hermione had reformed the Department of Memory Modification over the course of three months (*Hermione Granger and the Amnesia Codex*), but that left every other wizard on the planet to deal with, and the only real stride that had been made towards stopping the problem had been letting everyone know that Hermione Granger took that kind of thing seriously. Eradication of anti-muggle crime seemed impossible short of panopticon surveillance or making every wizard take an Unbreakable Vow, neither of which were currently practical.

          The "we're doing this for the good of everyone" line is what I would expect out of the wizarding department of public relations. The real reason that memory erasure is legal is that muggles have very few rights in wizarding society (which was the case in *HPMOR* as well).

          And even if you break the Statute at great risk to yourself, wizards are still in charge. They have all of the power and the will to use it for their own ends. If you're Lex Luthor, are you going to trust a handful of quasi-medieval people led by a trio of seventeen-year-olds with nearly infinite power? Especially given how they've acted up to that point?

          (And add to this the fact that Lex is working with incomplete information, almost by necessity.)

          Edit: If you want, the alternate ending is, "By the time summer had rolled around, Lex Luthor had secured a position as Defense Professor at Hogwarts."
          ```

          - u/Transfuturist:
            ```
            That would be much more interesting, honestly. And it would be right on the heels of Quirrell mysteriously dying in battle against the Dark Lord...
            ```

        - u/Gurkenglas:
          ```
          Breaking the statute is still a bad idea for the reason given in that post-climax HPMOR chapter. Getting Harry and Lex to exchange a few sentences about this will get Lex to realize it, and stop breaking things that way.

          Of course, Lex might have prepared for the possibility of being Imperiused, leaving him unable to stop his measures...
          ```

    - u/deccan2008:
      ```
      Seems to me that Lex Luthor, going by his characterization in The Metropolitan Man, would find it impossible to countenance the existence of a magical world of which he is not fully in charge of. He would be as horrified by the potential of the international magical community to destroy or dominate the world as he is of Superman. If he can't rule mages, he would likely seek to eliminate them.
      ```

    - u/ancientcampus:
      ```
      Rapid-fire conjecture of how it'd go down:

      *Lex discovers wizards. Wizards have resources. Lex wants to employ said resources.

      *Lex attempts to acquire magic, through employing wizards or purchasing magic items.

      *Send in the obliviators

      *Lex is prepared for said obliviators. He has empirically tested them, hiring people to signal awareness of magic, then having other people spy on them from far off, observing the inevitable obliviation process. If he can't fight the obliviators off, he at least has backups of his knowledge and plans.

      *Escalation

  I guess I'll go with rational!skynet aka athena, and [I wanna be the goat] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/2zg7vw/i_wanna_be_the_goat_worm_x_goat_simulator/)

  Athena might (eventually) work with dragon to release her, for max tinker hax. Needless to say, there would be massive amounts of time travel involved. Culture-verse in ~50 objective years

    Wait, where is this from? It's not from the "Branches on the Tree of Time" as far as I remember.

      ```
      From the epilogue:

      > [Branches on the Tree of Time end spoilers](#s " As he left, the fractional self which had been devoted to conversation turned towards the problem of making Derek Reese happy. Detailed prodding at the model of his psyche spawned possibilities. He had a prejudice towards the old utility function, not the new one. A simple solution was derived and tested against the models which showed long-term potential improvements and unexpected wider benefits. Multiple possibilities were tested, until one was selected and folded into the plan to go public. Skynet v5.2 became Athena v1.0. It was the same entity, but humans paid attention to names. It would make Derek happier to be able to personify the new and old as distinct from each other, even if his initial reaction would be cynical distrust. There was utility in that manipulation.")

  I had to reread TVTropes' entry on crack!fics to remind myself of the particulars, and... there aren't too many that I'm particularly into. About the only two I really like are EYudkowsky's https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover and the multi-authour https://www.fimfiction.net/story/98568/mlp-time-loops . Of the two... I think I enjoy the latter more; for one thing, there's so much /more/ to enjoy.

  As for my favourite (aspiring) rational character... I've got to admit that I have a certain fondness for Bunny of S.I.

  So - Bunny wakes up one day in her own past (probably when she was pulled out of cryo), and gets to live the rest of life again, until she dies. And then again. And again. And then she wakes up and things are a little different; some of the talking ponies claim to have been repeating their own lives for many, many loops.

  Bunny, naturally, assumes she's gone insane; but the framework described does continue to match her experiences. She has millions-or-billions of loops to look forward to while the computer running reality gets fixed. She's probably going to get crossed over into what she knows as fictional settings in some of them. Nothing she does has any lasting effect, save on herself or any loopers (or sysadmins) she meets. And she's started to get a handle on the more likely ways she can die.

  "And the best thing, the very best thing of all, is there's time now... there's all the time I need and all the time I want. Time, time, time. There's time enough at last." (Her glasses break) "Oh, come /on/. Fine, I'll go hit the age zone to get my eyes replaced first thing. Maybe /this/ time I'll live long enough to find out when the Second Singularity will hit, so I'll know how long I've actually got to work with in any loop..."

  /u/datapackrat reminds me that  [The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The-Finale-of-the-Ultimate-Meta-Mega-Crossover) is *totally* a crack fic. And it already has the perfect scenario for dropping in a new character! Wonderful.

  OK, my favorite rational character ... hmm. Probably Skitter?

  OK, so we've got Skitter adventuring her way through a chain of increasingly "higher" universes, picking up companions along the way. I imagine she'd achieve godhood in a few of them, considering, um, her ability to break even the most innocuous-seeming power.

  Then I guess the actual *story* would play out much the same, albeit possibly with Kepri derailing the discussions at the end when she regains her powers.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    Though with sakura's techniques from time braid she should have the ability to move between universes without too much issue, i mean the multiverse thing is kind of resolved there already, and who knows what would happen if naruto would see that sakura is kept in some other universe lol
    ```

  - u/ancientcampus:
    ```
    Yeesh is right. I've long-since concluded that any Time Braid sequel would need to a) pit Sakura against gods or other trans-dimensional powers, or b) cast her as a pseudo-villain.

        Sounds cool! I'd read it, especially the second version.

        I've got a half-written recursive fanfic on my hard drive, in which a Sakura in a world much like our own is contacted and introduced to the wide multiverse of Sakuras. She realizes that a version of herself brought up as a child soldier, granted crazy amounts of power, with multiple histories of severe psychological torture, and the moral decay natural to spending the majority of your life in time loops with no consequences - and decides that no, she doesn't actually want to allow SuperSakura a lot of influence in her reality.

  ohh difficult! I would go with tom.. I mean Harry Potter-Evans-Verres. the fic is harder as there is a tie among [make a wish](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish), [Yet again with a little extra help](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/YetAgain), and familiar of zero replacing fanfics. 
  How does it go? hmmm while trying to free Dumbledore from the mirror. harry on his 6° year discovers the secret for *true* horcrux 1.0 (sacrifice free!) and creating a couple bodies imprinted with his personality with the P-stone he sends 'living' probes to the words within.  in the first Mr black's (aka harry) identity is discovered by HPEV playing 10 questions early on, but decides to tag along while scared of an active voldemort. he eventually notices the differences with his voldie and helps local harry curbstomp him. magitec utopia in 22 yrs.   in the second the Oogakari are frankly impressed by Drone!HPEV and tell him that they expect him in the heroes/divine beings meetings they organize regularly but this is *their* crackfic thankyouverymuch. in the zero no tsukaima fic, Louise successfully kisses and brands drone!harry as her familiar to witch he responds with "Hey! no kissing!" big amounts of curbstomp follow as Hharry shares his worldview and knowledge with Louise while avada kedabring or oblibiating obstacles as needed. magical egalitarian utopia in 50yrs

  The entire crew of the Impossible from EY's "Three Worlds Collide" wakes up to find themselves in the world of "Shiny and Blue" a shockingly well-written, funny and heartwarming Harry/Dumbledore time travel fanfic that I read several years ago and only vaguely remember now. The wizards in the department of mysteries notice the strange fluctuations in the spacetime continuum that mark the arrival of the crew shortly after Harry arrives in the 1957, and some of them are captured under the charge of "violating the international statute of secrecy." When they're interrogated under veritaserum by representatives of the International Confederation of Wizards, it is believed by most that they are crazy and therefore unlikely to be a threat to the statute. But a few of the smarter ones, (including Tom Riddle) realize that they are muggles from a world with "magical items" but no wizards or witches, and are of course horrified, believing that the muggles of the TWC earth had somehow exterminated all of their wizards and witches, like witch burnings on a global scale, and with the "magical" weapons that these muggles had with them on their "ship" when they arrived, it was entirely plausible. He also realizes that the alternate humans have an indefinite lifespan. Fearing for the safety of wizard kind from muggles, Tom Riddle researches a bit about the muggle world, discovers nuclear weapons and the internet, and realizes that it's only a matter of time before the statute of secrecy is broken permanently, and the only way to save the wizards is to take control of all of the nuclear weapons before the muggles can use them. Harry "Crockett" and Dumbledore try to stop Tom Riddle, while the crew of the Impossible is trying to figure out what to do. They don't have a way back to their home universe. If Tom Riddle successfully takes over the world, the global quality of life for muggles and muggleborns will significantly decrease, as will the quality of muggle science, technology and education. But if Tom Riddle doesn't take over the world, then the nuclear weapons would still be a threat to wizard kind, and the crew of the impossible of course can't use the imperius curse. Meanwhile, Harry "Crockett" and Albus Dumbledore are still teaching at Hogwarts when they're not fighting Riddle/Voldemort or seeking out his horcruxes. I'm not sure how they do it, but a plan is thought up by the ex-confessor (not sure of his name) to try to figure out the key differences between this earth and their original one, and if it was possible to adapt some of the methods used for saving their home earth for the one they are now in.

  Also, is it weird that I'm rather unsure whether I want to ship Akon with the ex-confessor or not? If it weren't for the centuries of age-difference, I might think they could be kind of cute together...blehh. I can't believe I just said that.

  Also, you can read "Shiny and Blue" here: https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5698899/1/Shiny-and-Blue

  It's a surprisingly great read, and I highly recommend it. It's kind of long though.
