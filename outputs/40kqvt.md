  Hey, this is quite well written.

  Don't trust the sidebar or the vote count too much :) What gets the most upvotes are are things that are good stories in a certain sort of "hard sf/f" genre, often by authors familiar to and/or with this online community. It does help if your protagonist ignores story conventions, or is a munchkin, or models thinking skills for the audience, but these are hardly mandatory.

  So in some sense, this is obviously not a "/r/rational fic," because it isn't the right genre. I bet most people on here haven't even read a single Jane Austen novel.

  The thing it really has going for it is the whole "characters ignoring genre conventions" part - starting a story with characters being honest with each other is, ceteris paribus, rationalist catnip. Sometimes you also do a good job showing us characters using sensible thinking processes, which is my main internal criterion for actually thinking of something as "rational fic." I don't think you quite make it all the way to that bar in the couple of chapters I've read, but neither do most stories on here, so whatever.

  Hmm. I skimmed the first chapter, I think it's a bit of a stretch for /r/rational. 

  I did find it interesting that people are fucking and proposing on the very first chapter, especially considering the 400k words that follow. I don't read the genre at all, but my impression is that the smart play in romance is to tease things out over a suitable period of time, with the inevitable and much anticipated crotch-rendezvous providing something of a catharsis for the reader. Is that not the case?

    Haven't read the fic, but good stories can be told about people who are already married or otherwise in a relationship.

    Ooh, interesting. Why do you think this is a stretch for a rational fic? According to the characteristics of rational fiction listed to the right, my story emphatically qualifies. (Note: it's not a *rationalist* fic, as there is the inclusion of a supernatural element. Although the supernatural element rarely, if ever, has a material effect on the plot; it's not a deus ex machina device. It's just another input in the characterization.) I know my fic is primarily family drama / romance / historical, but I would think the qualities that make a story rational could apply to any genre.

    Just a note: no one is fucking in the very first chapter. They're just kissing.

    Yes, the average, obvious play in the romance genre is to waste oodles of time on a will-they-or-won't-they scenario, with a final proposal or marriage at the end. So overdone. In my own experience of dating and marriage, dating is the shallowest part of the relationship. The real interesting stuff happens when you're in a committed relationship for the long haul and you have to deal with life, with each other (warts and all), with things like illness and raising a family and navigating the in-laws, etc.

    Since this is a *Downton Abbey* fic that covers 1914-1971 (the first three novels are complete, and the fourth and final novel will be starting up soon), the story is about a fascinating and turbulent period of history, as refracted through the marriage of two particular characters, one of whom is a pragmatist and the other of whom is a moral idealist (which is true to their canon portrayals). Their philosophical conflicts drive much of their interactions. I take a much more rational approach to the plotting, characterization, and historical accuracy of the story than the equivalent portion of the TV show does.

    There are multiple crotch-rendezvous happening, given that they're married for decades, but all of the sex scenes have a purpose that goes beyond mere sex. I don't waste anybody's time just writing hot sex scenes for no reason.

    I also don't waste time separating them with contrived and unbelievable plot devices, and there are no human villains in this story. The antagonistic forces all arise from the characters' personalities and from the medical, political, and economic forces of the historical period.

      Supernatural elements hardly preclude rationality, see: HPMOR, Metropolitan Man, Team Anko, To the Stars, Ra, see: almost every rationalist fic ever.

      I don't follow Downton Abbey or even know what it is in story or genre in the slightest. Is it necessary for the fic?

        True, you can be rational in a universe with supernatural elements, but I don't consider my story a rationalist fic because I don't try to demystify those elements in my fic using rationalist or scientific methods, and it's not an exemplar of rationalist techniques. Those elements are just assumed to be there, and they function in a way that illuminates the characters' psychology. There is a certain degree of puzzle-solving, in the sense that if you're familiar with the show and you think for a bit about my AU premise, you'll probably see where the fic is headed. Of course, the question then becomes: is the trip still worth it? I don't generally write with the intention of dropping bombshells on my readers, but rather with the intention of provoking clear thought about the psychology and dynamics of the situations that the characters find themselves in. And, if I get it right, with emotional resonance as well.

        You don't need to have seen *Downton Abbey*, or be familiar with the characters, situation, or genre of historical romance to be able to follow this fic (although of course knowledge of all those things adds a dimension to the experience). It probably helps to have a rough familiarity with that period of Western history (i.e., when WWI and WWII happened). One of my beta readers, who has been with me since the beginning, has never seen the TV show and doesn't intend to, as far as I know. She's helped me make sure this story can stand on its own two legs.
