  I want to see this crossed with Ozy's Toni Stark series. (The one that starts with "move fast and break things")

  I want to believe that that means that Stargate is real in your version of the Marvel universe. (Symbiote Venom is a Goa’uld confirmed.) But fiction from fiction appearing in fan-fiction of other fiction is fun too.

    I’m not the author.  I assumed the same thing also... the author wanted to hint at a multi-crossover.  Would be funny for the crew of the Prometheus to try out their new Asgard sensors and detect a force field over a small African nation.

      That would be fantastic!

      Things would be a bit confusing between SG Thor and MCU Thor before the two groups of Asgardians were sorted out. "Oh your hammer is a filter-transporter thing? Mine was an actual hammer. I could swing it around and fly and smite stuff with it. It was a good hammer--not that yours is bad or anything--I just miss mine." 

      Bast/Bastet turns out to have been a much more interesting System Lord than first thought, and Vibranium turns out to be yet another form of Naquadah.

        Or Vibranium might be Trinium?
        ```

        - u/CopperZirconium:
          ```
          Adamantine is more likely to be Trinium, because both are strong and relatively lightweight. Vibranium has glowing isotopes like Naquadah, and both are used for a wide variety of weapons, so I think it is more likely that Vibranium = Naquadah than Vibranium = Trinium.

  > and keep them out of trouble. It was an important job. The Americans might hear about their oil reserves

  That line is so petty, it made me laugh :D

    ```
    The Donald Duck cosplay was also great.  And the Jesus action figure Shuri left out for Steve.
    ```

  ```
  (Resubmitted because I linked mobile and auto moderator removed.). I’ve been on a MCU fanfic binge lately after watching Infinity War and this fanfic stuck out to me as suited for this subreddit.  T’Challa directs the scientific resources of Wakanda towards curing Bucky.  Interesting world building and also a bit of character exploration.
