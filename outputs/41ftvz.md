  This felt...extraordinarily abrupt.

  Like, I get how everything happened. It makes sense how it played out.

  But still didn't sit quite right.
  ```

    You're not wrong.  I poked at it, but couldn't find a way that I liked better.  Anko was going to get the team out of there so fast their shadows had to catch up, and it's only about a three-hour run to Konoha, so there wasn't a lot of room for other events on the way.  I could have put in the scene of them arriving and being brought to the Hokage, but that just felt like filler.
    ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  People have been asking for the events of this chapter for quite a while now.  I finally got enough pieces in play that I could realistically make it work.
  ```

  ```
  Damnit, Kurama actually appears to be making sense in his arguments and that makes me paranoid of them.

  Was there something about him not being able to lie to Naruto?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    > Was there something about him not being able to lie to Naruto?

    He told Naruto that bijuu are physically not able to deliberately break their promises, and that doing so accidentally hurts.
    ```

    - u/JackStargazer:
      ```
      Which we know to be true, as Kurama told us it.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Exactly.  I'm glad we agree.  You're the only reasonable one in the entire friggin' audience -- everyone else is all "Oh, Kurama is such a liar!"  "Oh, Kurama is a giant Primordial town-destroying monster, he must be lying!" or "Oh god oh god  oh god  oh god  oh god please stop eating me Kurama!"  Never any sympathy, any tolerance.

        What is the world coming to??
        ```

        - u/JackStargazer:
          ```
          It really is sad to see the state of our youth today, when Primordial beings from beyond time and space such as ~~mysel~~... *Kurama*, can not be trusted to be true to their words.

          It's discrimination quite frankly, and it disgusts me.

          Really, what are they teaching in our schools? Honestly.
          ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  Man, lotta people still distrusting poor Kurama. 

  Naruto, your distrust ruined everything. So sad.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I know, right?  Poor Kurama.
    ```

    - u/JackStargazer:
      ```
      It is truly sad.
      ```

- u/liamash3:
  ```
  Anko must feel so awkward. I'll be curious on Kurama's reaction once he wakes and realizes what happens.
  ```

  - u/duffmancd:
    ```
    I too am *very* interested to the reaction. Particularly as they've just finished the "I can't beat Orochimaru" conversation to find they have to escape in order to protect Naruto's precious people - presumably having to bypass Orochimaru in the way.
    ```

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  >A normal Aburame hosted a few tens- or, for the most senior clan members, hundreds of thousands of kikai. The force that Shino set on the Sound ninja was *fifteen million.*

  The restatement itself was already more than enough, the italics are definitely too much.

  Anko wishes she wasn't living in interesting times.
  ```

  - u/liamash3:
    ```
    > The restatement itself was already more than enough, the italics are definitely too much.

    Worked fine for me.
    ```
