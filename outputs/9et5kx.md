  Not the only reason chapters having been progressing slowly lately, but this is one thing taken care of.  I also have started working on a variety of side stories so that when I can't write on one story I can switch to another.  Works well as long as I keep finishing things.

  Nicely handled. And kudos for putting in that kind of effort to maintain consistency.
