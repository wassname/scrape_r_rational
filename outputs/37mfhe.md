## [HSF] Seveneves by Neal Stephenson

### Post:

"The moon blew up without warning and for no apparent reason."

I just finished this book, and thought that it would be right up /r/rational's alley. From that opening line, pretty much everything else follows, and Stephenson deals with all of the consequences with a large amount of thought and detail. I really enjoyed it, primarily because of the real cognitive effort that it shows, and think that you might too.

  I am roughly halfway through it (getting to the part Escapement mentions about politics/politicians, though it was foreseeable a lot earlier), and I am mostly enjoying it, but it doesn't really feel like vintage Stephenson to me (I'd include Diamond Age, the Baroque Cycle, and Anathem in that category). Compared to Anathem, it feels intentionally dumbed-down (directed to a broader audience?); compared to the Baroque Cycle it feels criminally under-researched. There is presumably a TVTrope for suspension of disbelief being much harder for stories that claim to be set in the present day, and it was in full force for me.

  Two examples:

  1) Stephenson seems to want the story to be set in the present day (with Skype and Facebook and Twitter and Python), but it's obviously set 10-20 years in the future (with asteroid mining actually a thing and a much-expanded ISS and better-developed swarm AI). Given the latter, I found the repeated references to present-day stuff **by name** *extremely* annoying and immersion-breaking. You can't treat 20 years from now like the present, and I expect better from Stephenson.

  2) Similarly, given how much research Stephenson put into the Baroque Cycle, it astonishes me how little effort he seems to have put into researching some parts of the real world. I am a physics grad student, so the inaccuracies in how he depicts the culture of astrophysicists (especially the Neil deGrasse Tyson expy) were always going to bother me. But even beyond those minutiae, which probably won't bother anyone else, there's just a bunch of sloppiness and mixed opportunites. One example: for reasons which I won't spoil, a passage in the book takes place in Bhutan. I was really excited, because I was sure he was going to talk about [Gross National Happiness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness), which would have meshed brilliantly with what was going on at that point in the book--but then he just treated Bhutan as a generic Buddhist country for no reason.

  3) (This is the point where I think the book strays furthest from rationalist.) In this book, for whatever reason, Stephenson seems totally wedded to the Great Man theory of history, in the sense that only his protagonists get to come up with ideas. There's a point very early on in the book where one of his characters realizes, a week after the moon blows up, that it will have particularly bad effects for the viability of life on earth in the near future. Set aside that it takes him a week to do this; the unbelievable part is that *literally no one else in the world* seems to figure this out until a similar period of time has passed. This is something that would be e.g. posted on Reddit within *minutes* of the moon blowing up.

    >The phrase "Gross National Happiness" (GNH); [Wylie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration): *gyal-yong ga'a-kyid pal-'dzoms*) was coined in 1972 by [Bhutan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhutan)'s fourth [Dragon King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Bhutan), [Jigme Singye Wangchuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigme_Singye_Wangchuck). The phrase was coined as a signal of commitment to building an economy that would serve Bhutan's culture based on [Buddhist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist) spiritual values instead of the western material development that was represented by gross national product (GNP).

    ~70% of the way through; concur with your assessment.

    > the inaccuracies in how he depicts the culture of astrophysicists 

    Would love to hear a bit more. I found the book vague on this front.

    Otherwise: like The Martian, it gets pretty deep into the intricacies of various engineering challenges. The situation in The Martian wasn't as inherently interesting, but the basics of maintaining food, air, power were still well conveyed. In Seveneves, I found some of topics engaging (bolide fragmentation) and sometimes too familiar (orbital mechanics, covered better in Anathem and elsewhere), and sometimes inefficiently realized in prose (tedious descriptions of spacecraft).

    Also, I am finding supposedly smart characters making very dumb decisions too much of the time, to an infuriating degree. The bad ideas are quite disproportionately assigned to the female characters.

    I just wish to note that reading LWian stuff and *The Diamond Age* around the same time was kinda painful, what with Stephenson saying in TDA that AI can't ever work, and the Platonism of *Anathem* was also quite discouraging.

    Oh, and God knows his material on language and the mind in *Snow Crash* was a bunch of fucking bullshit that contradicts his whole "AI can't work" thing in *The Diamond Age* to boot.

    You know, normally I like Stephenson, though I don't like his politics.  But I guess at some point these kvetches about the science have to come out.

      I took the platonism in *Anathem* as the speculative conceit (and also potentially as an homage to Godel's own platonism), rather than indicative of Stephenson's actual beliefs. I think you can make the same excuse for *Diamond Age*--he wanted to write a particular kind of story and AI (except the Primer) didn't really fit in it. But I agree that his science is not always the best. That's what Greg Egan is for!

  Currently listening to it. 
  Niggles in the order they hit me: 

  1: The plan is to build a closed ecosystem and industrial infrastructure in a place secure against the hard rain. Digging into bedrock would be *far* easier, in particular because a much greater part of the work force would have applicable skills towards the problem of "Dig the mines of moria" This is even mentioned early on, then so far mostly utterly ignored. WTF?

  2: "you can't use iron for rocket fuel".. Wrong. You totally can. They have an iron-nickel asteroid on hand, and can obviously find as much rock as they care to due to moon fragmentation. So the obvious answer to all propulsion problems is "Mass drivers".

- u/Escapement:

  I finished it last night; I think it's a really good story, and probably takes my 'favorite Stephenson work' from The Diamond Age. I liked it a lot. However, Seveneves doesn't really depart from Stephenson's tendency towards disappointing endings. 

  I honestly felt that Stephenson's attitude towards politics/politicians strongly approached the 'evil' (as contrasted with virtuous technology-proficient nerds) in the good and evil of this sidebar. Certain characters fell flat.

  That said, the story is extremely well researched and described and thought out; I really liked it overall, and you can tell a lot of effort was spent on technical details.

    I agree with this. It wasn't a huge problem for me given that the bulk of the conflict was Man vs. Nature instead of Man vs. Man; if the primary focus had been the political aspects instead of the engineering aspects, it would have been a major weakness instead of a minor one.
