## Pokemon update question and Patreon feedback thread.

### Post:

Hey everyone, January's almost done and the next Pokemon chapter is getting there too, but first I had some questions for you all.

First, I want some feedback about a decision I'm making about the next chapter. You here in the rational community get to be my  Beta feedback group before I publish with the decision locked into place on Fanfiction. That said, I don't want to spoil it for anyone  who wants to avoid that, so those of you who would rather just wait and see what happens, feel free to skip to the second part about my patreon.

The title I have in mind currently is [Chapter 28 -](#s "2.351.") Nonsensical, I know. The thing is, the first quarter of the chapter is written with very disjointed and random imagery and wording. So also mostly nonsensical... but it builds up to a reveal, and if I've done my job right, a fairly cool one.

For example, the first of the many sections of the chapter reads thusly:

...confused...

...

...hopeful…

...awed...

...triumphant!

...

...awedwaryconfusedEXCITED!

...hopeful…

...

...afraid…

...confused...

...afraid…

afraidafraidafraid

…

…

...


Seems random, right? It goes on like that for a bit, developing more of a detailed prose and narrative and adding more context, until the (hopefully awesome) realization dawns on the reader. What realization? Well, I can spoil all that buildup, but also remove the confusion, by naming the chapter more directly: 

[Chapter 28 -](#s "Mew 2.351").  Exciting, I know. Makes it much more clear where we are and what's happening, far quicker.

So what should I choose, the suspense/reveal, or the clarity? Let me know in the comments, and remember to use spoiler tags! Or just say "first option" or "second option."

Okay, second topic, [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/daystareld) is finally up and running, and I want some feedback in general on the page itself, and in specific on the rewards I listed.  A lot of people made some great suggestions, but one of my major limitations is that I didn't want to offer anything specifically related to the Pokemon story, since that might tempt the eye of Nintendo's legal department. 

A compromise I made is to just offer rewards of my work in general, on anything I'm working on, which of course includes Pokemon.  So if you pay at least X dollars (currently 3), you can have access to an epub or PDF copy of any of my projects.

Any and all feedback welcome, and thanks in advance to anyone that decides to donate. I write the stories I write for me, but the hours of editing and research and fact checking to make sure I write the best quality I can, that's for all of you awesome guys and gals. Your patronage means a lot.

See you in February!

  I'd go with the clarity option.  Research has shown that readers actual enjoy stories MORE when given spoilers, and so given that the extra clarity your considering is somewhat spoiler-esque, I think it's the better route overall.

  [Spoiler Study](http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/archive/newsrel/soc/2011_08spoilers.asp)

  There is probably a valid concern that your audience is far from a normal, regular audience here.  That said, it seems the base rate for spoiled > not-spoiled is quite high.  In the study, 8 out of 12 stories benefited in a statistically significant way, 3 benefitted but weren't statistically significant, and one was hindered but also not statistically significant.

  It seems like given the audience, you'd have to have pretty compelling evidence that we're more anti-spoiler then average to bet on obfuscation as a strategy.

  EDIT: Reading this again, I think I probably overstated how widely the research is actually applicable.  They certainly found the result in some contexts, but while the question your asking is similar, there are certainly differences as well.  So yea, I'm acknowledging that.

    It's an interesting study that I've looked askance at in the past, probably because my own personal experience is that spoilers *heavily* reduce my enjoyment of stories... or more accurately, having as little information as possible and going into a book or movie blind have incredibly enhanced the experience.

    That said, I think this is case where the ambiguity and mystery might be legitimately frustrating to read without understanding what's going on, which may make a big difference in determining how useful the spoil is to the enjoyment.

      If you were to write a whole story in this format that only becomes clear towards the end, it would be a problem.  For a single chapter, it should be fine.

  First option.  No need to go easy on us.  

  I have no useful input for the patreon.

  I say go for the spoiler-free version, assuming that it all gets explained within the chapter
