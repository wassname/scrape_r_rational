  >It didn’t matter so much that he beat Summer so long as an outcome without precedent lay at the end of the road.

  I'd like to point out that the very idea of an unprecedented outcome comes from the scheming of Black, so Arcadia is really just mirroring Creation, as usual.
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    Of course. Black is trying to break his own perpetual cycle, how did I not see that right away.
    ```

- u/JdubCT:
  ```
  Catherine is getting smarter with her enemies. A scary proposition for them all.
  ```

- u/um_m:
  ```
  Wait, didn't Winter also [say](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/04/12/chapter-7-elaboration/) they had to attack the creation because Summer was doing that? So Winter was lying?
  >“If Summer is at war, so must be Winter,” he said. “The boundaries have been thinned, the host will be assembled.”
  ```

  - u/JdubCT:
    ```
    Winter didn't admit anything there. They just stated that there has to be a balance. He's supporting the Princess's claims at this point.
    ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  Jesus christ man... this story... It might be the only one that has ever given me *shivers* irl. Amazing writing.
  ```

- u/M3mentoMori:
  ```
  I'm very glad that this was posted on Monday rather than Wednesday. I don't know if I could handle the wait.
  ```

  - u/FeluriansCloak:
    ```
    It's new chapters every mon and every wed.
    ```

    - u/M3mentoMori:
      ```
      I know. I'm glad that this chapter was a Monday release rather than a Wednesday release. I only have to wait a day or two to see the aftermath of Cat going to Malicia for politics training rather than three or four.
      ```

      - u/JdubCT:
        ```
        Then, from the depths of your greatest fears, comes... INTERLUDES *dun dun dun*

        Ps: If I see Akua before she's plot relevant again starring in a side chapter I'ma smash a plate on my forehead.
        ```

        - u/M3mentoMori:
          ```
          Interludes are a gamble. I'm not particularly interested in the First Prince or the Tyrant of Helike, so interludes focusing on them suck.

          Stuff like the Calamities interludes we got, though, are great. Same with that glimpse into Thief's past. 

          I agree; if we get an Akua flashback rather than something more current, I shall be very sad.
          ```

      - u/FeluriansCloak:
        ```
        Gotcha!
        ```

- u/Mgmtheo:
  ```
  > Dread Empress Malicia, First of Her Name, Tyrant of Dominions High and Low, Holder of the Nine Gates and Sovereign of All She Beheld, watched me for a long moment.

  > Then she smiled.  



  This is good, this is quite good. Also is this the first mention of all of Malicia's titles?
  ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    > Also is this the first mention of all of Malicia's titles?

    Not at all; see Chapter 20: Rise
    ```

- u/ForgottenToupee:
  ```
  So the thing that sticks out to me the most is that Sulia won’t tell Cat why the Prince of Nightfall must not get those crowns. Unless it’s a magically significant thing that Maesgo will explain, I kinda think it’s something Cat also has the power use since she is Winter and Named. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be a problem with telling Cat, right?
  ```
