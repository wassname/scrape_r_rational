## [MK][BST][HSF] Munchkining tricks for choosing your age?

### Post:

After an apocalypse, the mysterious AIs left behind some piles of nanotech here and there, some of which aren't even lethal. One has been discovered to be a bit controllable - and can rebuild your body at whatever age you tell it to. How many ways to munchkin this can you think of?

(It works on any animal that's been tried. It seems to successfully stuff adult minds into baby-sized skulls. There is a minimum age, for humans, of about minus one month. There appears to be some sort of limit based on how much spare biomass has been absorbed by the nanotech. There's something approaching a 1% error rate, in that the requested age isn't the one that's applied. The nanotech appears to be fixed to a site. Other transformation nanotech tends to be much less accommodating and pleasant.)

    > Hard to go on the run or make a breakout when you're a 5 year old.

    Why pick 5? It's even harder to escape when you're minus four weeks old, and dependent on an umbilical cord for survival.

    > In times of famine I de-age members of the community

    Is there any particular reason to wait for a famine to start? Why not apply some of the ideas you've mentioned for livestock, and determine at what age humans put on the most weight per year, and generally have people stay at their age of fastest growth?

    > What happens to a pregnant animal when it is aged?

    Complications. The nanotech doesn't induce births (or youthen a pregnant animal beyond what can carry its young). As long as the 1% error odds don't pop up, then a fetus is only aged to roughly minus one day, plus or minus some, depending on how long a fetus can safely remain unborn. There will have been a few cases where immediate caesarian sections were necessary to protect [the health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postterm_pregnancy) of both the mother and post-third-trimester offspring, but so far, no cases of mothers pregnant with toddlers-or-older.

    > A foetus?

    While it's younger than the equivalent of an eight-months human pregnancy, the nanotech seems perfectly willing to age or youthen it, to the point of returning to single-egg stage (and possibly even putting it back in the ovaries). If a fetus is ever aged past that point, the nanotech won't youthen it beyond that point again.

      Glad to be of help.

      1. Five mainly so they could feed themselves and take care of themselves without requiring excessive manpower. Three would probably work just as well. I'm not really.. sure how foetus incarceration would work, but wouldn't it be really awkward for the mother? Especially if she starts feeling protective.

      2. Humans are inefficient at adding biomass compared to animals. If you've got spare food, better to feed it to animals if biomass is the goal. Plus teenaged humans are rebellious at least partly because of hormones. 

      So you could inseminate a cow for example, age both to term, then do the birth, then age the calf and de-age the mother for extremely rapid husbandry? Allowing you to change species extremely quickly?

      Well that's even better. Run hornets through a few thousand generations until they instinctually defend humans and attack anything else in a particular area around the hive, and give them massive stingers. Then use them as a defensive/warning measure against rampaging abominations (I'm assuming you have those). If the particulars of Hornet farming make that impractical, do it with type of bug. Like a wasp, or a scorpion.

        Say that after the occasional oddball 1% accident, and some further experimentation, it's learned that the nanotech is able to manage cross-species gestation, as long as the sizes are reasonable. So if you wanted to put your prisoners inside goats, that could probably be made to work.

        > Plus teenaged humans are rebellious at least partly because of hormones. 

        Mua ha ha. :)

        > So you could inseminate a cow for example, age both to term, then do the birth, then age the calf and de-age the mother for extremely rapid husbandry?

        Almost, yes; the nanotech doesn't really add new information into an aged-up brain, so the rapidly-aged calf might barely know how to breathe, let alone stand, let alone breed. But if you're going for rapid species modification, that's probably a tolerable state for the intervening generations, as long as you aren't too worried about the lack of any selection pressure on the species' mental abilities.

        > rampaging abominations (I'm assuming you have those)

        There are monsters aplenty, yes.

        The rapid breeding is simple enough; how do you figure breeding for that sort of trait could be done?

          >The rapid breeding is simple enough; how do you figure breeding for that sort of trait could be done?

          It would take a while, and probably be quite painful. You'd need to have different species in an area they could access, then only breed from that ones that prioritise attacking other species than humans. Then you'd need to iterate until they no longer attack humans at all. It would take bloody ages and involve a lot of people getting stung.

          Other potential methods involve covering humans in don't-attack pheremones, then slowly reducing the level of pheremones and breeding from the ones that continue not attacking humans until the levels are so miniscule that you can spray someone once and have it work for weeks.

          I'll be honest, the whole hornets thing is slightly dubious. It may or may not actually be possible. Someone with more knowledge of bugs would have to step in.

          Doesn't that have a rather large risk of miscarriage killing your prisoners? Also, for a 10 year sentence they'd need to run that 1% chance 120 times, which is rather poor odds. To say nothing of sensory deprivation sending the inmates mad. There's a reason solitary is used as punishment. Solitary with no lights or possibly even a sense of touch would be hell.

          If food is *that* much of a concern you may as well just call it a death sentence, and de-age em for the meat.

            At least narratively, it's the sort of project that somebody might submit an application to use some time with the nanotech for, even if they don't end up with anything useful.

            > a rather large risk of miscarriage

            (Technical pedantry: As we're dealing with fetuses in the late-30's-weeks instead of pre-20, the preferred term seems to be 'stillbirth' rather than 'miscarriage'.)

            Fair enough - those are all good reasons not to set your prisoner's ages to the minuses. Do you have any thoughts on sending them through the nanotech to end up somewhere between 0 and 1 year of age, with or without an option to age them back up after a certain length of time?

              You'd need to wetnurse them and change their nappies, and babies require feeding every few hours. Plus they're really fragile and freeze to death or overheat comparatively easily if you're not careful. And they have special dietary requirements. Can't feed em on just grain or meat. You know how new parents look about 6 months in? All haggard and like they haven't slept since the dawn of time? All the jail guards/nurses would be like that. Plus, the screaming of babies is basically programmed to be really annoying and un-ignorable. Your guards/nurses would not be happy bunnies, and you'd need a lot more of them to keep all the inmates fed/changed/healthy/warm. Plus the inmates would suffer mental deterioration from being unable to turn pages to read or use their voices to talk. It would not be an effective way to rehabilitate people.

              On the flipside you'd save on space. Maybe food as well depending on if more guards/nurses eat more than the difference between how much babies and 5 year olds eat.  I wouldn't use it for people you want to still be useful members of society afterwards though. Maybe as some kind of particularly horrible punishment for people who society has decided deserve a fate worse than death. Basically solitary confinement except also with a complete loss of dignity. Personally, I think fates worse than death are immoral and inefficient but who knows that a post-apocalyptic society would decide.

              If I were to be an inmate in such a system, being turned into a baby would make me resentful in a way that just being a kid wouldn't.

              TL:DR I don't think the benefits outweigh the downsides.

      Does it ... does it still fit an adult brain in there?

        As interesting a thought as that might be, I'm trying to describe a line being drawn at the 8/9ths of a pregnancy mark, a line which can be crossed by making younger fetuses older, but can't be crossed the other way. So you don't have to worry about trying to fit an adult's mind into a blastocyst-or-smaller.

  How does the neural hardware work, in terms of recapturing childhood plasticity for languages and such? I can imagine teams of university-trained students being re-aged to childhood in order to learn certain aspects of their craft more naturally, or even keeping people in extended childhoods in order to produce polyglots.

    In theory, there's some potential there, but in practice... <scratches head> Is there actually any known way to build, say, a half-adder circuit out of organic parts that are part of a living animal, let alone anything as complicated as a Commodore 64's CPU? Or are there any oddball organisms, such as some sort of starfish, whose nervous systems can be tricked into doing computations?

  Well, the mind goes through different stages and different levels of maturity. Does the machine alter brain structure as well?

  If yes, then you could get young, back to when your brain was more plastic. There is a specific period in your youth when you pick up language very quickly. You'd find core aspects of your personality more malleable. Build habits as a young person, then age back up again.
