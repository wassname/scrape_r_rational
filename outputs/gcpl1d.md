## [HF] Pyrebound 14.2

### Post:

This is another two-part installment.  EDIT: I finished 14.3 early--I was on a roll and it's between semesters--so I've tacked it up early, to compensate somewhat for the big delay before 14.1 hit.

Pyrebound is a hard fantasy about power politics in a vaguely Mesopotamian-themed world where human civilization has adapted to an endless cycle of magical disasters.  It's been running about a year and a half now.  [This](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/) is the first installment.  Thanks, all!
