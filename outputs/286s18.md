    That she is. I don't care how the text describes her, she instantly gained a PINK carapace in my mind's eye moments after introduction.

  As an aside; is FictionPress basically FanFiction.net for original stories?

    I know what you're thinking, and I'd recommend against it. Notice how you can't copy text on fanfiction.net or fictionpress? It's a crude attempt at DRM.

    My understanding is that the staff is a little bit insane as far as copyright is concerned. Especially considering it's *fanfiction* for fucks sake.


    Archiveofourown is a less evil ff.net, specifically created to adress fanfiction.net's problems.

    I'm already providing wordpress hosting for one rationalfic writer. It's not a bad platform for publishing fiction. I'd recommend using wordpress.com unless you plan on using specific plugins for monetization. I could set you up with a free wordpress install if you wanted to use wordpress with plugins. You'd need to supply a domain name.

      Extremely crude. It took me less than five minutes of googling and installing a firefox addon to reenable fanfiction.net's copy/select text (because I like to highlight text when reading). I had honestly forgotten that they did that.

      That said, as a reader I really like archive of our own or fanfiction.net or fictionpress over wordpress, simply because it is so much simpler to convert those sites into readable .epub files for my phone compared to wordpress (where no simple, already automated solution exists that doesn't involve modifying python scripts, afaik).

      I don't have any objection to posting a story in multiple places - after all, HPMoR itself is at both hpmor.com and at FanFiction.net.

      (I already have a copy of Wordpress running blog.datapacrat.com. It should be possible to adapt it to run another sub-domain for fiction, if I wanted.)

    Yes.

    ```
    You've got it the wrong way around. FictionPress is actually the parent site, and they made ff.net a bit later so FP wouldn't become dominated by fanfic.

  I'm up to chapter 8, and it's really enjoyable. Slow-burning, but far better than average. Thanks a lot for the link.

  [Edit] Also, encouraged by this story, I went ahead and tried to search the website for other good ones.

  Ye gods. Do not make the same mistake as I did.

    Yeah, it was a bit of a slow start, especially compared to most time-loop stories.

    Definitely forgivable though, considering the sheer originality of how the hammer finally drops.

    I was just about to start doing that as well... unproductive? Disappointing, the concept of a site for non-fanfic stories was pretty exciting for me. Oh well, /r/rational will have to be enough.

    Speaking of, thank you OP for introducing this, it's fantastic.

  Slow start, detailed world and plenty of rational tidbits thrown in from all side not just the protag's perspective. Best part is recognizing the posibility of gvzr geniry abg orvat vaqrsvavgr. Feel free to add RT tag in title. Also protag is a bit slow sometimes. rot13.com is your friend

  From the author's user page:

  >Mother of Learning Next Chapter Target Date: 22nd of June, 2014

  >- break -

  >Q: Curious, how far would you say the story is?

  >Not even close to the end. The story basically has 3 arcs, and we're only getting close to the end of the first one. I'm really going to have to speed up the pace if I want to finish the story in anything resembling a reasonable time-frame.


  My, it looks like this one is in to be nice and wonderfully long, if slowly updating.

  It wasn't very nice of you to spoil the first few chapters with that title.
