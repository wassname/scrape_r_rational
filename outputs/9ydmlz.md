  Cat casually leading an army of a dozen Named, a hundred slightly-less-Named and forty thousand conscripts. Basically Malanza's crusader host, but with Drow instead of humans.

  If Cat could have nice things, I would say that it's the first move of Dread Empress Victorious, bringing the Drow in the fold of the Dread Empire of Eastern Calernia. Cat can't have nice things though. And I have no idea where anything is going anymore.

  Wow so how is fate gonna brutally fuck Cat over this time?

    I'm going with Sve Noc somehow executing all Catherine's Drow at the end of the battle and taking their power. Ubua and Catherine somehow manage to extend their 'peerage' to the recently dead and create a pile of drow zombies, and let Cat use her powers without going completely mad at a level that lets her fight Sve Noc. Temporarily, anyway, because Cat Can't Have Nice Things Ever Fuck You.
    ```

- u/IgnatiusFlamel:
  ```
  I think Sve Noc will somehow use Night to make all the oath-bound Drow betray Cat, the Winter Oaths will kill those drow, and the massive amount of unused night will be eaten by Sve Noc for a sudden powerup of her remaining drow forces and/or herself.

  I'm calling it now, Akua takes the army of Drow for herself, somehow.  These guys are too competent and too effective to let Cat use them
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    Either that or all but like Ivah get decimated in a pyrric victory against Sve Noc.
    ```

  - u/BaggyOz:

    Nah, something will probably happen to either nerf them or change the use they're needed for to something that isn't suited but there's no way this ends with everything Cat did since the Battle of the Camps having no effect of the strategic situation. She left Callow to find an army, she's not going to end up without something to solve the problem of too many dead Callowans.

    EDIT: I think I can see what will happen. I'm betting that the Drow will all lose their Night or have it drastically weakened after Sve Noc is defeated. That gives Cat her army without it being a big fuck you to Good that gets the hammer brought down on it.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      I think that's a fair bet. Either the Drow all lose their Night during the battle with Sve Noc, or we stop caring about Procer and immediately escalate to the battle with the Dead King.
      ```

    - u/tavitavarus:
      ```
      That's my bet too. The Peerage are just too powerful otherwise.

      Alternatively they could just take heavy losses in their first major engagement. Either the heroes turn out to be a fantastic counter to the Mighty or the Dead King has some method to deal with them very effectively, which is possible given how terrified Ivah was of the Hidden Horror.
      ```

      - u/BlackKnightG93M:
        ```
        This all depends on how Cat deals with Sve Noc. 

        "The essence of sorcery is usurpation." 

        Night has already been stated to have an affinity for Winter and Winter has been described as being unendingly ravenous. She also has the aid of a sorcerer that managed to create a thermodynamic engine that approaches 85% (at a conservative estimate) efficiency in real world terms. 

        It would not be out of left field for Cat to absorb the Night of Sve Noc into her domain, thus becoming the source of strength of the Drow in truth.

        With Masego's aid, she could then in principle shove off her principle alienation onto ALL of the Drow which would mean she can finally bring Queen and King of fae level powers to bear. Something I expect she would seriously need in her fight against the Dead King.
        ```

        - u/tavitavarus:
          ```
          That's theoretically possible but I just can't imagine Cat gaining assets as powerful as the Peerage and hundreds of Mighty without costs or weaknesses. It would create a huge imbalance of power within the narrative of the Crusade, so unless Good also gains a lot more power I think the drow are going to be nerfed before they join the wider story of Calernia.
          ```

          - u/BlackKnightG93M:
            ```
            All likely possibilities, though Cat is definitely opposed to the Dead King. She already petitioned for signatory status in the grand alliance. So she has the potential to manipulate that Story. 

            Methinks that whole power imbalance will only come into play once she actively declares war on the forces of Good. Remember there was no perpetual spike of power on the side of Good while the Dead King was gathering Named and consolidating his rule of Serenity and Keter all these eons. 

            From what we've witnessed is that Above and Below only ever react. When Black became too powerful, they crafted the White Knight specifically to be his executioner. When the Ashurans summoned their patron deity, Below answered by giving Warlock godhood for a minute or so. All of these conflicts were active in nature, whilst the Dead King is passive.

            So I think so long as Cat does not get caught up in the Narrative of wanting to invade the Principate then there should be no reason why her army would get nerfed. If she afterwards follows Akua's advice and plants roots in Callow, undergoing apotheosis in truth, then she would gain the same benefits that the Dead King enjoyed Story wise. Namely that she's a god and so she's suppose to have a super strong army according to the Story. 

            Then she can pull an Anaxares and simply refuse to play the games of the Gods.

          > It would not be out of left field for Cat to absorb the Night of Sve Noc into her domain, thus becoming the source of strength of the Drow in truth.

          It's worth noting that her title is the Sovereign of *Moonless Nights*.  It's entirely thematically appropriate.  

          (Except of course Catherine having nice things.)
          ```

          - u/BlackKnightG93M:
            ```
            This is true but having Cat's army nerfed to an extent where she can't beat her enemies would render this entire arc meaningless. Remember, Cat is the true protagonist of a Practical Guide to Evil and so far EE hasn't displayed the tendencies of grim dark writers that get their kicks from making the protagonist's efforts meaningless. 

            So I don't think EE will nerf her army; I'd think he'd just make the forces the Dead King can bring to bare more powerful. Not through Above inspired fisting, but merely revealing the Dead King was not left handed after all. That he managed to accumulate Revenants that are catered to dealing with large armies. And you know why this wouldn't be an asspull? Because he's a lower case god and the Final Evil so he SHOULD have those resources at his disposal.

            TL;DR: It will not be an internal case of "can't have nice things" (cat's army gets nerfed)  rather it will be an external case (the enemy is more powerful even with your army of Named and the Crusade also get a power up)
            ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    I'd say she'll usurp Sve Noc's place. Or in an inversion, she'll usurp Cat and cat will end up with the night instead.

    It's too damn hard to predict anything. But when it happens, it usually makes sense.
    ```
