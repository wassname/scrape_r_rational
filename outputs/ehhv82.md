  For those new to the quest, now's a great time to join! We've got quite the opportunity on our hands: If we provide better things for Leaf than anyone else does, then we could get our mitts on the Dog summoning scroll.

    Thanks for the invite, but I keep giving up on the quest after I follow it for a bit. Don't get me wrong, it's well written and driven by a lot of clever people. It's just that a realistic deconstruction of the Elemental Nations sounds like an awful place to live.

      That's very true. If you deem it unhealthy or unenjoyable, good that you're able to recognize that! 

      We *are* working to make the elemental nations better, though, so there's that going for it!

        I know you are, and best of luck with that noble quest.

  To elaborate:

  This is a rational quest set in an AU Naruto universe. The setting is close to 12th century Japan in tech level and has far less schizo-tech than the original manga/anime.

  We control a single young character directly and a few family members/friends/allies by proxy due to having become their leader.

  We can vote for all kinds of actions, as long as they are not too out of character and doesn't contain any knowledge the main character can't possibly have. We can push him to make certain natural observations or pseudo-scientific inquiries though (the scientific method isn't a thing yet.

  Currently we are outsiders that got adopted into the Village Hidden by Leafs and, after a series of catastrophic events, find ourselves as the young teenage heads of one of the voting clans under the freshly crowned Hokage Sarutobi Asuma (a canon character).

  Said Hokage, due to the dire position that Leaf is in, has announced a grand competition of who can provide the most lasting benefits through invention/innovation/exploration/diplomacy/whatever, with a set of stupidly attractive prizes going to the top 5 contributors.

  That's where you come in.

    To piggy back: the goal here is to munchkin the ever living heck and break the setting. We've already done it once by creating Skywalkers which are basically unlimited flight if you have prep time.
