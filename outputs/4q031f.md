  Only four years left... Time to start abusing those black rooms...
  ```

  - u/Cheese_Ninja:

    Yeah, my thought as well, but it's not very encouraging that their bodies were apparently in no condition to return after talking to the Guardian for less than an hour.  If they want to use a black room there, they'll have to come up with a much better cover story than their current disguise they use to get in.  I assume that any attempt to develop a black room on their own require too much in terms of time or resources to be practical, but I could be wrong.

    It's good that the soul marker can help them find the pieces of the Key, but the four years thing still seems like it'll make things difficult, I don't think they'll be able to figure out who RR is while still inside the loop.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Can they figure RR at all? 

      If we assume RR is the passenger (Zach being the passenger is rather unlikely) then after RR exits the loop, his template is reset to the non-modified state. The person that became Red Robe is still in the loop, with his looping memory erased. He is not even missing, he is just a regular citizen. There is no physical evidence left in the simulation. 

      The only clue can be hidden inside Zach's mind. Huh, funny that Zach asked not to mess with his mind right in this chapter. I wonder if this is a coincide... BAH! I CALL FORESHADOWING!
      ```

      - u/Johnisazombie:
        ```
        It would be funny if they could overwrite the escaped RR with the template RR by placing a marker on him and extracting with him. But there are so many hurdles in the way of that, I don't see it happening.
        ```

        - u/SpeculativeFiction:
          ```
          There is no template RR anymore. He left the loop. Just like the spiders RR killed can't be brought back, RR is out of the loop permanently.
          ```

          - u/Xtraordinaire:
            ```
            Him leaving the loop means swapping souls with the original. That original now continues to loop as a regular non-looper. The RR with his looping memory is in the real world, frozen in time while the loop runs the last iterations through.
            ```

          - u/Johnisazombie:
            ```
            Assuming RR is not the original Controller, why shouldn't there be a new copy of him? He hardly could have marked himself to not exist in the loop after he left, and there is no reason for the gate to do so considering what is happening now is out of the norm.
            ```

        - u/gabbalis:
          ```
          If it's cheap enough for the system they could just overwrite literally everyone with the template. That way they don't even need to figure out who it is. Can't miss if you target everything!
          ```

- u/vallar57:
  ```
  Xvim is awesome, as usual. That little scene made all the suffering he caused to Zorian *worth it*. Start over, Zach.

  I absolutely didn't expect one month length of the loop to be for moral reasons. Usually being capable of doing feats like the Gate are depicted above morality. it's also a possible clue that the system wasn't designed by gods, since gods were, according to Zorian "total dicks".

  So, now it's Dragon Ball. Search for parts of the Key scattered through the world, increasing your power level in the process, ~~and have your wish granted when you gather them all~~. Daimen probably has at least one of them. Time limit of 4 years seems challenging, but doable.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Divine Command Theory, look it up. Whatever Zorian deems moral a god may deem not.

    I think it is heavily implied that the Gate is a divine creation. Let's break it up:

    * Insane complexity. For example the Guardian is a pretty nice AI.
    * Insane power levels. Recreate a world 1000 times over, with potential to sustain those worlds for prolonged time (remember, the 1-month limit was said to be set up only for moral reasons)
    * Intricate knowledge of souls. I mean, does anyone besides gods have the capacity to create a copy of soul? I doubt that, because necromancers would be fundamentally different with such ability. Create a soulwell, populate it with copies of 1 soul -> profit. But no one does that (obv: they can't)
    * The Maker is implied to be an immortal. The guardian suggested that the Maker could have marked Zach, but the Gate's activations are once in 400 years. If the Maker is anything less than immortal, he is guaranteed to be dead. The Maker and his 'agents' sounds suspiciously like a god and his subordinate angels.
    * Excessive wastefulness. Creating 1000 simulations for *just one person but not for yourself*, that's insane if you think about it. But it's exactly the kind of move that Zorian would describe as "Gods being dicks. Again." 
    * Zach is a picturesque champion. He is just the kind of person that screams 'I am the Chosen One' and lo and behold, he is chosen.

    The first two alone strongly imply divine origin.
    ```

    - u/elevul:
      ```
      Damn, now that I think about it: the time loop consumes energy only when it resets, so if they manage to increase its lifespan from 1 month to 1 year or indefinitely they can effectively prolong their time within it greatly!
      ```

      - u/Johnisazombie:
        ```
        They could trigger one of the "multitudes of contingencies that will cause the iteration to terminate prematurely" by doing that.
        ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        This ignores the soft limit of the summoning of an elderich abomination, though.
        ```

        - u/elevul:
          ```
          At their current level of power and without RR working against them I'm sure Zorian&Zach can easily stop the summoning.
          ```

    - u/modrony:
      ```
      Zack being both a prince and the controller for an unrelated reason (chosen one) is less likely than him being the controller because he is a prince(connections, wealth, politics).

      Also, the spirit-serpent said the gate was unused for a long time. 
      I think it unlikely that a god would have a device for his chosen, that is usable every 400 years, and then forget to pick a chosen every 400 years.

      Why would a god with a chosen even have a gate? As long as you are spending attention on choosing him in the first place, just put him in a loop and give him a soul-switch to end the looping while you install the other ones.

      I think the controller at least gets chosen my mortals.

      The original maker of the loop may be a god, but that is far from certain.
      Powerful, certainly, but is that necessarily what makes one a god? For all we know "gets power from prayer" could be a criterion. "lives outside the simulation" could be a criterion. No matter how much power one gains in a MMORPG one is not more powerful than the guy who can unplug the server.
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        Oops, I'm being dumb here. The Gate is Noveda heirloom. Zach is Noveda heir. Zach is the controller. I think the causation is bloody obvious.
        ```

    - u/SurfaceExpression:
      ```
      Occam's razor suggests this conclusion strongly based on the evidence we are given. However, in the context of a story I'm always skeptical of this sort of reasoning. If the author of the story chooses to emphasize certain facts and to *repeat* them several times it is usually becauase he wants you to reach a certain conclusion. The author is a clever arguer. :)

      Let's pick this apart, are the first two points really indicative that the gate is something no human in the story could ever achive?

      The first - Zorian managed to build a pretty nice robot/golem with ... what? A few years of training? If you had someone train this skill for a ridiculous amount of time you could probably build something like the Guardian. Heck, in the real world you can build a chat bot with the same kind of interactivity. If anything, this would be easier in the world of MoL (mind magic, anyone?).

      The second? There is this thing about the gate only activating every 400 years, and ideally only during a specific time where it is easiest to do so. Maybe the time in between is required for recharging? Remember, the thing is located pretty deep in the Hole which provides more power than everyone in the city could possibly use. The gate may need more power than that, but it's also better located and can keep charging for 400 years.

      The other points are similar. In the world of MoL, if you had enough time (and we are talking about some agency which built something that looks like a time loop...) building something like the gate starts to look a lot more possible... as for obtaining enough time? Necromancers can apparently make themselves immortal, and if you can make a pocket universe you can have essentially arbitrary temporal distortion. Given these facts it's very difficult to rule out the possibility that the gods are really just human mages who successfully cheated the system.
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        The time may be needed for recharging to a certain degree, but mainly it's just using amplification effect for the dimensionalism magic. You can activate the gate at any time, but you would get significantly lower amount of restarts, if any at all. One month offset has cut down this number by an order of magnitude.

        But the Gate *was not* designed with the Hole in mind. It was functioning on another continent and was moved to the Hole *only* because Tesen 'donated' it to the crown. It just was moved to a pre-existing top secret governmental facility. It was there for no more than just 15 years. Before that it was residing in Noveda coffers for centuries.

        The problem with human cheaters theory is that there are no other signs of cheating. The gate is a breakthrough in dimensionalism, soul magic, mind magic and so on. Yet there are no signs of those breakthroughs bleeding into respective fields. Like I said, if the Gate was made by a necromancer, it would not waste millions of souls erasing them in each restart. It would collect them into a soul well and harvest mana for the necromancer to use. To put it another way, if the maker was not a god before the Gate's creation, he would certainly become one with such power.
        ```

    ```
    > Daimen probably has at least one of them.

    I'm a newcomer to this series -- archive binged after the last chapter came out -- so I must have missed a lot of discussion, but I have a strong feeling Daimen *is* Red Robe. Has this already been postulated/dismissed?
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      You have *no* idea.

      The problem with DtRR was... well... lack of proper in-universe evidence. Damien is undoubtedly the biggest gun on the wall and personally I'm inclined to believe he will appear in some fashion. 

      Before the inner workings and restrictions of the loop were revealed, it was possible to assume that Daimen activated the loop using some awesome magical ruins of Ikosian awesomeness and that activation also pulled Zach in. Now we have evidence that only one person can be the initial controller. As Daimen has no reason to bring Zach in the loop, he can't be the controller. If Zach is the controller, it is not possible for Daimen to be brought in the loop. I mean it's technically possible, but it would require Zach seeking out Daimen (and remember, he is in some jungle, pretty far away from civilization and Cyoria) in the first 5 years of looping and then telling him about the loop and then Daimen mindraping Zach.
      ```

      - u/Aretii:
        ```
        Thank you for the breakdown. Mostly I was expecting it based on the metanarrative appropriateness; after your post, I expect it somewhat less, but not so much less that I've dismissed it.
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          Well, this is /r/rational after all. The stories here can't run exclusively on narrativium.
          ```

  - u/isidinn:
    ```
    I think that Zorian is a little bit too biased to rely on as a source with regards to whether or not the gods acted morally. In addition, it's entirely possible that the gods may have been willing to act in such a way as to come off as dickish, but still have moral compunctions regarding killing several billion people multiple times.
    ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      Yeah, that's why I said "possible clue". We don't actually know a lot about the gods besides the fact they existed and made soul system, we don't even know their names.
      ```

      - u/Dragrath:
        ```
        I feel it should be mentioned that as we know nothing about the gods they could in fact be "mortals in a higher plane running a simulation" at the very least this logical conundrum seems to hint that they are not omniscient at least though this diverges into what it means to be a "god" in universe.

        Plus there is also the possibility of other non gods with high power that the author has not revealed though it is unlikely at this point in the story it can't be ruled out especially with an existing entity like the dragon below and her primordials.
        ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    > I absolutely didn't expect one month length of the loop to be for moral reasons.

    Seems kind of disingenuous, actually. Everyone who the Controller interacts with will diverge pretty radically pretty much immediately, and so will people they interact with.
    ```

    - u/vallar57:
      ```
      Diverge - may be, but becoming a different person - not likely.
      ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      Not the Maker's problem, cause they didn't do it. Zorian and Zach must have multiple planets worth of evil alignment score by now though.
      ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  So... An average restart lasted slightly longer than 11 days. Talk about wastefulness!

  On the other hand, Zach's concern that he is not the original controller seems not really likely. I find it hard to believe that RR!controller would tolerate Zach!passenger if he resets *hundreds* of restarts prematurely. RR tolerated Zach's recklessness with restarts because he had no other option. He had to mindwipe Zach's knowledge about the time loop.

  The temporary marker could be the mechanism how Red Robe got into the loop. He had 6 months to prepare how to screw Zach over and elevate his marker somehow.
  ```

- u/Noumero:
  ```
  A bit of trivia.

  In accordance to the Guardian's words, there's 967 past iterations and 52 future ones. For the sake of neatness, I will presume it didn't count the current one. That makes 1020 iterations in total, which equals to exactly 85 Earthly years.

  Now, Shutur-Tarana, possibly the first time traveler, supposedly spent eleven lifetimes looping.^ch.33 If we assume that 85 years is 'a lifetime', planar alignment amplifies dimensional magic by a factor of eleven, at minimum. No wonder Quatach-Ichl deemed it a great time to summon an eldritch abomination from beyond.

  I wonder, does anyone else have any plans for the occasion? It'll be a great shame if such an event would benefit only a bunch of terrorists.
  ```

  - u/modrony:
    ```
    Here's a plan:

    1. Be a lich.

    2. Make a pocket dimension.(Smaller than a world I would assume) 

    3. Evacuate everyone in the world into it. (put them in a well of souls for compact storage & not needing food)

    4. Detach the new pocket before the loop ends.

    5. Take your sweet time while you figure out how to connect to other dimensions.

    6. Spelljammer!

    Who says we need to leave by the front door to leave?

  Only 4 years to find the keys. That's a lot less time than I was expecting, but it does force some urgency into the story. It basically means there's not enough time for Zorian to go all epic archmage, unless he figures out a cheat.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    >not enough time for Zorian to go all epic archmage

    He is already probably the best human mindmage on the continent, how much more "epic archmage"-y can someone get?
    ```

    - u/bludvein:
      ```
      He is probably the best human mind mage, but he's far from top tier. A matriarch aranea could kick his ass in it.

      In other disciplines he's only fairly good rather than a master. The criteria for archmage is to be skilled in several branches of magic, much less his goal of being a mage to go down in history.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        >He is probably the best human mind mage, but he's far from top tier. A matriarch aranea could kick his ass in it.

        O, certainly. But comparing a species who communicate _only_ in mindmagic to humans is a tad unfair.
        ```

        - u/bludvein:
          ```
          They are the closest he has to peers, since he has kind of a ridiculously unfair advantage over human mind mages. He's the best among humans simply because other humans aren't open or don't know how to use their ability.
          ```

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            >he has kind of a ridiculously unfair advantage over human mind mages

            They just have to git gud.

            And he isn't the first such person among humans, I imagine, just probably one of the first to receive actual training.

            - u/Keshire:
              ```
              Also, keep in mind. Mind Mages are taboo. Probably in the same vein as how the Cat Shifters are viewed as.
              ```

              - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
                ```
                Worse. Cat Shifters are just untrustworthy thieves according to the public. Mind Mages can straight up Master you. An unshielded person can never know if a Mind Mage has screwed with their mind and changed their priorities. A shielded person has mere seconds to react to a mental attack, and if they fail then the Mind Mage can do whatever they want then make them believe that no-one attacked them to begin with, and that they are still well defended.

                The potential for abuse is massive. I can see why society decided to make it taboo.
                ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Archmage is being superior than regular experts in *multiple* fields.

      Yes, Zorian can write the book on Mind-Magic, but he's still a journeyman in golem-making, potioneering, wards and barely an expert in shaping. 

      I was also kinda hoping he would learn soul-magic and shifting, but we may get that after he kills the Grey Hunter.
      ```

      - u/altoroc:
        ```
        Well to be fair, when he gets out of the loop in four years time or so. (He has to get out or the story would be moot) He'd still be 15 years old biologically. Meaning he has a hell of a chance to make it in the history books.

        Granted I'd much rather him become Archmage level before the loops ends so we can actually experience it.

            Good point. It could go on afterwards. Actually that makes sense. Since they have to stop the real invasion for good.

          The Grey Hunter may very well be doable by Zach alone. He already killed the dragon Oganj [much earlier on in the story by himself,](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/16/Mother-of-Learning) after all.
          ```

          - u/Cheese_Ninja:
            ```
            Which definitely came back to bite Zach in this chapter, since he burnt through 20+ restarts to accomplish that.  At least a year and half of time.  He only really killed Oganj because it sounded like an awesome thing to do.  And as far as bragging rights go, it wasn't that great, because the accomplishment disappeared after that loop.  Sure, Zach can tell people that he soloed the Mage Dragon Oganj, but besides RR and Zorian, no one actually remembers that it ever happened.

            So while yes, I do think Zach could solo a grey hunter, it's probably not worth the risk of the grey hunter getting a lucky bite on him.

            We may never know what Silverlake wants a grey hunter egg for.

  Oh shoot, we only have 52 resets left before we potentially cease from existence or no longer have access to the abusing mechanics of the loop... better take a two loop break. Really? You have a one-in-a-kind non-renewable resource and you decide to basically waste some of it. (granted, they won't be doing *nothing* for those loops, but still) In fact, there are many things they could have done before the revelations of this loop.

  * Down potions that drastically increase physical and mental abilities at the cost of permanent harm to your body to the extent of death if done for longer than a month. (and since your body is always reset...)
  * Forbidden research on topics that you'll probably never be allowed to pursue in real life, breaking into the higher levels of the library and memorizing all the tomes. Even if he is sentenced to death / expelled from the school for reaching the highest level libraries, it would be worth it. (especially since Zorian can remember things permanently if he puts his mind to it) 
  * Rituals that give you permanent abilities at the cost of the death of those with said abilities. This one is a little morally iffy, following the same logic as the Maker, but if one decides to do it, one can basically collect all the special bloodlines of all the major houses. Zorian already has the advantage of having started with one, empathy, but imagine collecting many such abilities. (soul sight? instinctive use of fire? natural accelerated regeneration? natural resistance to magic? darksight? blindsight? innate understanding of vibrations in the earth? innate understanding of wind currents? more soul-brain space (since the mind seems to be stored in the soul)? the possibilities are basically endless)
  * Mind stealing knowledge. All of it. 
  * Black boxes and time accelerated training. Especially given how easy it was to find. Just hop in with as much food as possible close to the end of the loop and stay in there until the end / starvation-suicide.

  ...and these are just things that could have been done *before* this chapter. After the revalations of this chapter...

  * Mini-marker anyone you can convince to help you out and train train train.
  * Find the keys and figure out how to speedrun acquire them and use them to restart the looping mechanic on the *actual* alignment. 
  * Make use of Zach's brute force to mind-read everyone, since you are no longer worried about being found by RR.
  * Upgrade mind to Cyoria Matriarch level of OP-ness, master as much magic as you can and prepare for your endgame. (prepare for every teacher / mentor's favorites such that you can secure tutelage in the actual timeline)

    >"On the other hand, when you're literally messing with your body chemistry and using alteration on your flesh, you're usually doing something totally irreversible," Lukav continued. "Human body is a complex thing, and I don't think anyone really understands enough about it to meaningfully improve it. Most potions that aim to enhance the real body with some exotic concoction are basically stimulant drugs with addictive properties or cause hard-to-cure damage if used often.

    Stimulants aren't hugely helpful to them. Plus dying horribly is taxing to their mental sanity and the recovery would take time.

Even if he is sentenced to death / expelled from the school for reaching the highest level libraries, it would be worth it.

    Reading is a slow and a long way to get knowledge. Much easier to rely on mages like Xvim who have read said forbidden texts and know what works and what doesn't.

    Since both of them lack soul sight doing soul magic and soul research without that seems dangerous- it could permamently damage their souls or waste many loops in recovery. Plus for Zorian, he already has little magic, he can't afford to waste much more supporting an innate magical ability.

    >Mind stealing knowledge. All of it. 

    It does help, and Zorian is doing it.

    Hey, he needs rest too. He just commited a few genocides in a previous restart. Going at this rate, he'll just break in a few months. Not turning into a monster is kinda important.

    > restart the looping mechanic on the actual alignment. 

    I suspect that you can't do that. Originally I was thinking of the alignment as *powering* the loop, and being further away meant less power, which might have meant that you could retry with more power at the peak.

    But that's not actually what the Guardian said. It said that activating the loop early "made everything more costly, causing the time loop to degrade far more rapidly".

    So it sounds to me like the significance of the planar alignment is to make dimensional magic cheaper, thus allowing you to get far more iterations from the same amount of power. Presumably that power was collected during the intervening 400 years. However it is obtained, I'm pretty sure it's all being consumed in the current loop (unfortunately in a wasteful fashion due to the early start).

    > potions that drastically increase physical and mental abilities at the cost of permanent harm to your body to the extent of death if done for longer than a month

    I'm pretty sure RR has done this. From chapter 26, "Red Robe's strength was utterly superhuman and completely out of proportion with his size and build."

    That’s a cool idea for a MoL fanfic, but from the way the Guardian framed his answer it looked like activating a loop required accumulation of certain power beforehand, for a long period of time.

    On another hand, this timeloop seems to be unique in more ways than one: 1. multiple marked people inside, 2. still working after a Controller exited it, 3. activated earlier than supposed, 4. coincides with a summoning of a Primordial (which at least is coded into the loop as an early-reset trigger).

  The moral element of the iteration length makes me think that the Maker is some kind of human, or at least was at one point, rather than a god. When I imagine someone thinking that much about the moral implications of time loops, I can only think of a well-meaning philosophical type. How much do we know about the nature of the gods in this universe? Were they cruel or benevolent?

  There must be a reason that so much effort was expended to give a person an entire world as a playground. A quest, upon exiting the loop. To find out the quest, I think we should question what we know about Red Robe, the most informed person shown thus far. 

  RR probably found out about the loop and mindfucked Zach for all he knew. RR couldn't do the truly smart thing and turn Zach into a vegetable without risking the integrity of the loop, so he erased as much as he could, which is why Zach doesn't know anything he should about the time loop.

  If we reexamine what we know of Red Robe's actions, the fact that he is fully aware of the gate's mechanics means spending time helping the invasion must serve a purpose when he exits the loop. If that's true, then it makes narrative sense that this quest is somehow about the invasion, more specifically, the release of the primordial, as it too is tied to the planar convergence. Add to that the fact that while RR helping the invasion is the first interaction the reader has with him, its actually the last thing he does in the loop before he gtfo due to fear of additional time travellers. He was so scared of this despite the high likelihood that feeding the invaders information and gradually improving it is an obvious tell that he was a time traveller to any other sufficiently intelligent person and especially to Zach (which raises the question: how didn't Zach notice that even with his foreknowledge they were always one step ahead of him? Was he being continually mindfucked with?). 

  Assuming the quest is related to the primordial, to me there are three possibilities:

  1. The quest is either unknown or irrelevant to RR, and he is intending to help the invasion for his own reasons once he exits the gate. 

  2. The quest is to stop the primordial. It seems a bit too straightforward, but it would make sense given what we know so far. Less straightforward is that RR was aiding the invasion in order to infiltrate it completely, and he intends to quickly and completely dismantle it once he leaves the loop. It's a bit of a reach, but perhaps in order to supplant Zach as the loop's sole beneficiary then RR would also have take up its associated quest, or risk the wrath of the Maker. 

  3. The quest is, in fact, to ensure the release of the primordial, and RR is intending to do just that. This could make sense as a quest given to Zach's if we consider his backstory, which gives him ample reason to hate the establishment, but doesn't really fit Zach's temperament, which is why I think it strengthens the likelyhood of my [earlier theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4d88fl/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_51_out_of_control/d1omer4?context=3). 

  The last is the most out there, but also my favourite.

    No matter how much I am amused by the rebellious simulacrum idea I'd have to say that the easiest explanation is probably the best.

    The distinction between the Maker and the Controller suggests that the Maker doesn't need the Sovereign Gate for himself. Other than gods and godlike mythological figures I don't see anyone who would hand out tickets to SG.

    Which brings me to the reason why Zach is the controller. The gods simply may be thinking in narratives too much. Zach is the chosen one because it makes up a cool story for him to be the chosen one. I don't believe he was tasked with assisting the release of the primordial. This goes against his character. Stopping the primordial OTOH is the perfect thing for Zach to do: the noble good-spitited heir yadda yadda wronged by his caretaker, performs a great feat and restores order in the kingdom, huzzah (Yes, I think gods amuse themselves by writing shitty fanfiction and making it a reality). Stopping a primordial is also something gods would want since they imprisoned it in the first place.

    The next unexplained fact is that the Gate was activated under sub-optimal conditions. 1 month prior to the alignment cuts down its charge substantially. Perhaps the invasion simply forced the Maker's hand. Remember, divination works in the original world, therefore a primordial escape could have been predicted and SG activated as a countermeasure.

    How does RR get into the loop? Well, we probably have the answer: *"[Zach] really meant it when you said you went to just about everyone with the [time travel] story."* Zach told the wrong person, and with the amount of cranium rats and even cultist double agents lurking in the city this ended up badly. The specifics of the encounter could vary but if we keep it simple we get something like this: Year 5 or so of looping, Zach tells a cultist about the time loop and the impending invasion. The cultist pretends to believe him and maybe somehow manages to convince Zach to give him the temporary mark despite the boy's moral objections. For example he could lie and pretend to be terminally ill. "It doesn't matter if I die in the loop, I'll die in the real world in 2 months anyway. With this mark we can beat the invasion, though. Come on, pal, trust me." The cultist then has 6 months to prepare his betrayal. He drugs Zach and uses mind magic to pull the information from the boy's mind (we know he can do this), and then erases Zach's knowledge about the loop. He can't get rid of him entirely though because Zach's soul is the only real one in the loop, ejecting him would shut down SG entirely.

    Red Robe doesn't have the Zach's marker, he uses a modified guest marker and therefore was unable to use the tracking ritual. This explains how Zorian is still alive. Presumably RR attacked Zach to use his marker as an input for the search but he failed. RR being lower tier cultist would explain his mediocre magic, would explain the way the Lich treated him, would explain his dedication to the invaders.

    > how didn't Zach notice that even with his foreknowledge they were always one step ahead of him?

    He did not notice they were 1 step ahead of him because they were 10 steps ahead. Zach's strategy of choice was direct "1 on 1 me scrub" with the Lich. He would be unable to win this fight even against the original non-buffed version of the invasion.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I've thought about it overnight and I agree that a simulacrum is unlikely given the last 2 chapters, mostly because it would be anti-climatic. Zach exits the gate and assumes the body which his simulacrum had just recently possessed, end of story? Nah. 

      However, I think that Zach telling everyone about the loop would definitely have taken place after he was already found and mindwhiped by RR. Why? Because the alternative is that the maker/agent sent Zach in completely unprepared. Additionally, why would RR stop at selective amnesia? Why not instill some form of control on him as well, mindfuck him so that he's never a problem again? This guy is smart; he wouldn't leave the only remaining threat a viable one.

      So whatever imperative Zach was sent in with is no longer there, which completely changes his motivations. Speculating on that is moot, for now.
      ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        I'm approaching this excluding the obviously impossible options.

        RR can't be the initial controller because he just won't bring Zach in the loop. You can't expect him to tolerate Zach prematurely resetting hundreds of restarts. 

        They can't both be initial controllers because it is explicitly stated so. 

        That leaves the only option of RR being the passenger. 

        Yes, Zach was indeed sent unprepared because SG *is the preparation*. It's the perfect training ground. Plus he was probably instructed how to use the marker and all that briefly before entering the gate. So not completely unprepared.

        As for Zach's motivations, Zorian had interacted with Zach before the loop and his character is consistent. He always was extroverted, friendly and optimistic. Another thing is that Zach mentioned that he had this feeling that he had to stop the invasion. Whether this is a mindfuck placed by RR or a remnant of his initial convictions that RR failed to completely erase is a question, but I think it's the latter.
        ```

          There's a break in the causal link in that case. If Zach was aware that he was going into a time loop and was taught how to operate it, he wouldn't be going around telling everyone about the time loop. 

          It seems more likely that a mind mage close to Zach (besides Tesen, who seems unlikely; maybe a teacher) noticed something and extracted everything.

  Also, I still stand by my idea that Zorian will get a Gray Hunter familiar, possibly by giving that marker to an egg and soulbinding to it. Worst case scenario, he will do it during that final month, after they leave the timeloop.
  ```

  - u/vallar57:

  * Approximately 30 years in line**a**r time.
  * If I knew ~~I~~ all this

  * Frankly, if Zorian was in Xvim's place and a student came to him with a story about being a time traveler and then ~~**\br**~~ another student was also a time traveler, he'd react the same way too. Thus, the very next day after Zorian's talk with Xvim, he returned to the man's office with Zach in tow.

  Also, some thoughts:

  * they could start collecting a list of questions for an attempt to brute-force some additional information from the guardian. At the very least, they could start asking things like “Does the Controller have an ability to [...]?”
  * I think RR may not be a villain, even if his interests were seemingly in conflict with Zorian and Zach’s so far.
  * Now would be a good time for Zorian to re-activate his Silverlake quest, yes?
  * the explanation for the time loop’s length limit coincided nicely with [a recent discussion here on \/r\/rat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4pvgxp/d_taxonomy_of_teleportation_models_things_of/d4o6uga)

  I was contemplating the behavior of the Guardian, and how convenient it was, and I had a Fridge Brilliance realisation.

  The Guardian is currently operating outside its designed parameters, due to the presence of multiple recognisable Controller markers; yet rather than crashing, or wiping the protagonists, or randomly persisting a different Controller each time, it helpfully *added* Zorian to the awareness of the loop. And when RR left, instead of erasing everything as he expected, the Guardian recognised the remaining presence of Controllers and kept the loop running.

  At first, this seemed suspiciously convenient for the story. Why would the Guardian's broken behavior, like Zorian's broken marker, be conveniently broken in a helpful way? First rule of rational fiction in the sidebar, "Nothing happens solely because the plot requires it." But then I realised something. *Of course* the failure mode in this case was to loop both Controllers, because *it was designed to handle multiple markers all along*! One Controller and an arbitrary number of lesser markers.

  It's probably doing something like this:

  INSERT INTO gate
  VALUES (
    SELECT soul FROM copy_world WHERE marker IS NOT NULL
  );
  TRUNCATE copy_world;

  Ie grab everyone who has a valid marker, of either kind. Of course, only one Controller is supposed to exist, but this logic would continue to work for multiple Controllers.

  And then it would do the check that caused the loop to persist after RR left:

  if (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM gate WHERE marker == 'Controller') > 0:
    create_copy_world()

  There are still indications that the Guardian retains a direct reference to the original Controller soul, for the purpose of activating contingencies, because it treats Zach differently to Zorian. So the 'has the Controller left?' check *could* have been implemented differently. But doing it this way is quite reasonable too.

  Alternatively, if (as Kael once suggested) the difference is purely because Zorian's marker is broken - ie the loop ought to be resetting when Zorian dies - and if, as chapter 55 indicated, the Guardian doesn't seem to know anything about who is who beyond what marker they carry, then the abovementioned 'controller has left' check, which keeps the loop alive when one Controller has left and another remained, is perhaps the most logical implementation.
  ```

  Does it not bothers anyone that zorian might be a broken lesser marker that zach accidentally placed? Thats means that zorian might have a good chance of being wipe even if they managed to find all five keys and get out. Zorian marker is not complete. However theres one loophole in this time loop, which is memory transfer. Proven by the matriarch that memories and soul are link. if zach indeed left the time loop, maybe zorian could piggyback the same way the matriarch did. 

  "Some more variation of that question confirmed that the guardian had no idea when red robe left. *The Controller left, but didn't actually leave, and the guardian was hopelessly confused about the whole thing*" - Isn't this like a massive clue as to red robe identity?

  It is stated throughout the questioning that there could only be one controller and yet red robe exist and was able to exit from the the time loop. This might be the biggest clue yet for the Dark Zach (Red-Robe) Theory. Whats more was that the Time loop iteration have a major deficit, perhaps the soul damage caused by the lich took dam long time to heal and for zach and Dark Zach might had recovered earlier than zach and zorian to learn the abilities of the time loop.

  Meanwhile still itching for the world-building post. I super excited for it! God i love the world in the story!!

    We know what brought Zorian in: a soul meld by Quatach-Ichl, interrupted by the Guardian when it detected soul damage. Zorian's marker has the same privileges as Zach's, it just broke too much to detect that it was misplaced.

    If they get the Key, then they get admin privileges and can tell the Guardian to do whatever they want, so there's no risk of copies being erased.

    - u/FishyBinder:

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > they only get some additional privileges.

        After rereading, I think you're right. The Guardian said that the marker can be placed by the Key, or by the Maker, or its agents. So the Key doesn't simply designate its holder as the Maker. It just allows them to "gain sufficient authorization to reopen the gate."

        Perhaps the ability to un-bar the gate with the Key is a failsafe. We know that the Maker wisely included a lot of contingencies in the Guardian's design. Maybe the Key is meant for unforeseen contingencies, so that with enough effort, the Controller can still get out if something went wrong.

        Given that the whole point of barring the Gate was to prevent smuggling of copies, I wonder whether the Guardian puts extra scrutiny on a Controller who is un-barring it. Eg checking whether their exit requires replacement of an original...that could become another challenge.

  It is extremely out of character for Zorian to go on break for two restarts, in this situation. Everything we know about Zorian, would have him doubling down in his efforts. Yes, he's a far cry from the Zorian at the start of the story, but his work ethic is still his most defining characteristic. He doesn't waste time wallowing in despair, he puts his nose to grindstone in order to find the solution to his problems.

  I mean seriously, Zorian procrastinating before made sense; he'd been looping for multiple years and thought the loop ending would result in everything continuing as normal. But the AI just got done giving him the ultimatum: win in 4 years or you and everything you know dies. It isn't rational for him to do this and it isn't like him to do it.

  On a more personal note, I dislike seeing Kirielle this much. She primarily exists so that Zorian can mature as a person, and though he still has a ways to go, he's most of the way there. So what we're left with is an annoying brat who -- by the rules of the story -- cannot grow up.

    "The conclusion he settled on was that he needed some time to calm down and come to terms with what happened. Think up a new way forward. He would probably end up just wandering around the country for a restart or two. Or maybe a dozen restarts."

    This was just after the end of Arc One. It is a bit different this time because he knows exactly how many loops are left before the time loop self-destructs, but Zorian also knew at the end of Arc One that the time loop was degrading due to the Matriarchs message. Zorian seems to be only prone to "sticking his nose to the grindstone" only after he has developed a good plan forward.
