## Is there a summary of Mother of learning's plot up to the latest chapter?

### Post:

The last few chapters I have been feeling like I am missing a lot of small details related to the plot or world building. For example, I don't remember what discoveries they made about Red Robe, the time loop mechanism and how Zorian got into the time loop in the first place(was it a freak accident or there is more to it? What was the lich trying to do to their souls?)

I started reading MOL very early in its publication and never reread chapters so I guess it's natural to forget stuff over such a long period of time, but After being invested in this story so long I want to have my facts straight while reading the final chapters. 

Any relevant information would be appreciated!

Also, I am having the same problem (though to a lesser extent) with Worth the Candle, so same request about that story.

  >!This is what has happened, to the best of Zorian and Zach's ability to figure it out: Zach ended up in a time loop through some currently unknown means. He is the "controller" of the time loop. The Time Loop has special abilities, meant for the Controller to use. The Crown, for example, puts a temporary marker on someone's soul which lets them loop for 6 iterations. The dagger expels someone's soul from the template used to create the world each iteration, effectively erasing them from the loop. Red Robe somehow obtained a temporary marker and somehow subverted it, so that he was able to continue looping. He believes it is possible for others to do the same. He messed up Zach's memories, so Zach doesn't remember how he entered the loop, interacting with Red Robe, all his memories of a person named Veyers, and possibly other things. Red Robe worked for a long time to optimize the invasion, possibly because he made a deal with Panaxeth that Red Robe would make sure the summoning would succeed in exchange for Panaxeth's help exiting the loop.!<

  >!While RR was working on optimizing the invasion, Zorian enters the picture by a freak accident. QI attempted to merge Zorian and Zach's souls, which would render them insane, but the Time Loop safeguards triggered a restart when Zach's soul was messed with. This resulted in the merge succeeding only slightly, in a way that was very lucky and convenient for Zorian, because it gave Zorian a broken copy of Zach's Controller marker. Since it wasn't a Temporary Marker, Zorian didn't have any limit to his looping abilities. Zorian and Spear of Resolve hypothesize that someone like RR exists and they conspire to capture him. Their deception results in RR believing there is "an army of time travelers" who subverted the Temporary Marker the same way he did. RR "soul-kills" the aranea and exits the loop, barring the gate. Before Spear of Resolve died, she learned much about the time loop's operation from the Ghost Serpent. She left this information in a memory packet for Zorian. Zorian unfortunately got only an incomplete message packet. Therefore, he learns Aranean mind skills in order to read the other memory packet (the one that Spear of Resolve was using to loop), which also contains a copy of the message. From this and talking to Ghost Serpent, they learn many details of the Time Loop. They visit the Sovereign Gate and meet the Guardian. They learn that the gate is barred because someone (RR) already left and that to unbar the gate they need all 5 pieces of the key.!<

  >!They find the soulless body of Veyers. (The person that Zach has no memory of, despite having interacted with him before the Time Loop began.) They hypothesis that he might be RR, but there is some evidence against this: they think that when RR left the loop, his body would likely be reset like normal, not appear soulless. Ultimately this is inconclusive: they don't have a good idea whether veyers is RR or not, and they don't know what his significance is.!<

  >!They eventually find all 5 pieces of the key. They use the crown to bring in an army of temporary loopers. They use the key to unbar the gate. Activating the key also has the unexpected side-effect of triggering the guardian to do a full sanity-check of the time loop, where he identifies that Zorian has a corrupted copy of the Controller Marker. Thus, the Guardian plans to reset Zorian at the end of the iteration. Since the gate is unbarred, Panaxeth is able to help someone out of the gate, and he makes a deal with Silverlake. He brings Silverlake out of the time loop. The gate is barred again. They still have the key, so they unbar the gate. Zorian makes his escape through the dimensional portal. The gate is still unbarred, so presumably Zach will still be able to exit.!<

    \> >!The gate is still unbarred!<

    This isn't actually confirmed >!although narratively we can expect that Zach will escape somehow.!<

    We also know that >!angels made some kind of preparations for the loop, such as telling the Sulrothum to just hand over their Key piece. Quatach-Ichl expects the angels to do what they can to keep the primordial bound, and Zach's unusual mana reserves appear to be a divine blessing such as the angels can bestow. They're also the most likely candidates for marking the original Controller, since the Maker of the gate is probably one of the gods (which have vanished) and the Key was scattered across several continents at the time the loop started.!<

      >!It's actually slightly different, he expects his plan to free the Primordial to work, but he expects the angels to dramatically limit the damage that happens once it escapes. He humorously thinks that the separation of the material and spiritual planes means that he will have an easier time freeing the primordial, not that it is a symptom of a scheme to stop him. !<

      yes well everything I said is implicitly under the umbrella of "to the best of ZZ's ability to figure things out"  (although also I wouldn't say that in particular is very controversial? >!the latest chapter explicitly calls out that they unbarred the gate. I guess it's possible that zorian's escape re-barred it...!<)
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Indeed, it's hard to say >!what the Guardian would do about an anomaly escaping. The fact that Zach claimed his One True Controller privileges might help, since logically the Guardian should not allow any impostor to block him from exercising them.!<
        ```

        - u/tjhance:
          ```
          >!I don't really think it matters very much, since I suspect Zach can solo getting the key pretty easily. Maybe he needs to work a little harder to make up for not having Zorian but it's just details.!<
          ```

            I'm pretty sure they mentioned the gate was re-unbarred before the bridge was attempted, but with an avatar of Pax breaking in, and an anomaly breaking out, who knows what the Guardian's response would be.

            Biggest problem if Zach needs the key to prove for permissions again, is that he hasn't been able to solo the lich. They always cheesed the surprise dispel into the lich being rusty at mind magic. 

            So Zach has 12 (13?) loops to work out how to do that, with the additional challenge that I bet it was Zorian who memorized the gate address for the spiders, I'm betting on he just exits through the unbarred gate in the current or a subsequent loop.

              > I bet it was Zorian who memorized the gate address for the spiders

              >!I'd be really surprised if they didn't prepare for the situation where Zach has to loop back without Zorian, especially since it was the default thing that was going to happen if they didn't succeed at breaking out. I'm sure Zach found time in the 5 months in the orb to memorize the gate address. (Also, is there any reason he wouldn't just learn Zorian's fun memory spells?)!<
              ```

  ```
  A lot of the stuff in MoL is not necessarily plot relevant, in that it becomes obsolete if you reread, because it was a segue away into how Zorian starting learning a new skill, or discovering a new aspect of the loop. 

  I can answer the specifics if you want though for old plot points.

  I just fully reread Worth the Candle, and that helped me a lot.  I think I'm going to have to do the same thing with Mother of Learning.

    ```
    I reread both series and have to say I enjoyed the rereads even better than the first time around.  Great series are often like this.
    ```

- u/rtsynk:
  ```
  they don't know much about Red Robe except that he soul-killed the aranae and then left the loop, presumably to block them from leaving

  the time loop mechanism is the Sovereign Gate which can be fitted on a primordial (in this case Panaxeth), more info here: http://mother-of-learning.wikia.com/wiki/Sovereign_Gate

  Zorian got into the loop in the first place by being near Zach while he was fighting QI (the lich) and one of his attacks magically scrambled their souls perfectly so Zorian picked up a permanent temporary marker that allows him to persist
