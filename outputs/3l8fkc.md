## [Weekly Challenge] Blue and Orange Morality

### Post:

## Last Week

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3kb87f/weekly_challenge_defied_prophecy/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Defied Prophecy". /u/coadie is the winner with their story ["The eye of prophecy"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3kb87f/weekly_challenge_defied_prophecy/cv137ec), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/coadie!

##### This Week

This week we'll be dipping back into the TVTropes pool with "[Blue and Orange Morality](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlueAndOrangeMorality)". It's not good and evil, it's not law and chaos, it's some third axis that (tends to) lie perpendicular to normal human political axes. Cthulhoid monsters, paperclipping AI, benthic creatures, fey nobles, and starfish aliens are all a good starting point, though don't be afraid to use simple humans with their own strange ways of thinking. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, September 23rd.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Week

Next week's challenge is "Dangerously Genre Savvy", which it's hard to believe that we haven't done before. Here's the [TVTropes link](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerouslyGenreSavvy). In short, this is the person that defies genre conventions whenever those genre conventions would put them at a disadvantage. They know how things go in horror movies and don't want to end up as the next victim. They've seen too many heroes escape from elaborate death traps. And they're definitely not going to tell you their plans if there was the slightest possibility that you could change the outcome.

**Next week's thread will go up on 9/23.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). If you want to discuss the week's theme, feel free to [make a post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/submit?selftext=true).

    Lmao, so I took it to mean that some alien race had figured out the heat death problem and were using AFs to remedy it. Score 1 for overly complex predictions

    I cannot believe I did not get that twist until the end, despite the obvious hints peppered throughout. Great story

    From the very beginning they are described as having ships whose navigation is disabled through light but in the end Atlas is described as a bug himself. Also they have varied roles yet all seem to be night active. Are the characters the bugs or are they piloting the bugs and, if the second, is each one just piloting a single bug? With their ignorance of any type of vertebrae I was actually thinking that they may be some kind of micro-organism within said bugs.

    I... what...  They're bugs.  They're bugs flying into the candles or lamps we put out at night.

    Oh my fucking God you just made me feel bad for *bugs*.

        I actually didn't see much regarding value differences. All we saw about their values is that they want to survive and prosper and that they also value learning and problem-solving. Pretty much like us humans, no? All they differed in was sensory abilities and scale.

        Still a pretty cool story though.

            Well, we don't "value" ultraviolet light and other frequencies either. I don't know if value is the right word. Other than that, we don't value their lives because we didn't notice they are sentient. Just like they probably don't value the "lives" of proteins or whatever. All a matter of scale as opposed to *actual* unbridgeable value differences like Baby-Eating.

    Well *that* was quite brutal, though I can't help but think: *why the hell did you attempt to invade and annex a country full of people with whom One Does Not Cavort!?*
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:

      Well...that's embarrassing. [](#s "I assume you thought they tried to invade because of the word conquests, used earlier in the story. That was a typo, a holdover of an older idea. What really happened was that the knights were passing through, on their way to somewhere else, and left the road, which is agreed upon neutral territory by Fae and man alike, to go into the woods, for shelter against the rain. They didn't follow any of the proper customs for requesting sanctuary, as Rikkart's Fae clan made the deal with the king that was our King's great-great-grandfather. And, as we know, customs, especially *superstitious* ones, fade in time. So when they stormed in, the Fae perceived it as an attack. Especially when they lit fires. Simple camp fires, but part of the agreement is that human fire shall not be struck within the walls of the wood. So tresspass + illegal fires = a pissed off Fae clan. And then the King continued to dishonor them, because his guardsmen constantly turned all of their emissaries away, once they made it known that they were Fae seeking peaceful reconciliation. Which they were, at the time. But the constant denials added greater and greater shame to Rikkart's clan. They gave the King, in Fae terms, a *ridiculously* long leash before they finally snapped. And found him guilty, worthy of divine retribution. And, as the Fae believe you're simply reincarnated when you die, this is NOT death. Death is almost a kindness. Divine retribution is suffering, plain and simple, to be delivered by the wronged. And Fae aren't known for being especially forgiving to someone who broke oaths. To the Fae, an oath breaker is almost worst than a cannibalistic pedophile.")

      EDIT: I've updated the story to ensure this sort of misconstruing won't occur again.

        What i don't get is that rikkart also broke the oaths he made to the king. why don't those count?
