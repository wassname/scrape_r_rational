## [RT] [FF] [WIP] Annotated r!Animorphs: Chapter 1

### Post:

**Edit: Chapter 4 is up!**

**Edit: Chapter 3 is up!**

Use the link farther down to jump straight to the Google Doc, or go ahead and check /r/Ranimorphs for the full, dedicated Chapter 3 post.

As for *this* post, I hadn't really planned to keep updating it as chapters came out - but it's not like it costs me anything to edit, and who knows? Maybe people are still discovering it. Right now I figure maybe I'll keep updating it until it drops off the front page, but this sub doesn't move too fast, so that could be some time.

**Edit: Chapter 2 is up!**

Not quite as many notes for this one, given that it was less mysterious and introduced less than the first chapter.

I've decided to simply add chapters on to the same doc as I complete them, so the Google Docs link below should still work. Let me know if you guys would prefer a different system as readers.

Also, /u/TK17Studios expressed interest in having the ability to add author's notes alongside my annotations, so I've put him on as an editor. Hooray!

Lastly, make sure to check /r/Ranimorphs if you'd like to see when new chapters go up. Thanks!

**Original post:**

Hey all! I'm starting a project called Annotated r!Animorphs. The basic premise is that I'll be going through the fic chapter by chapter and adding footnotes to point out mysteries, give context for things, and generally act like a "guidebook" of sorts, aimed at readers who are already up to speed. The goal is that it will be part refresher course, part fun-read-and-trivia-facts-which-also-generate-discussion. The first page of the document explains it a bit better.

If you just want links, here they are:

[Google Doc version!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DKfflWPRLfGtTvrQdexlBD5jvfsaBqDxhRc5zWX1DaM/edit?usp=sharing) (Recommended! You may have to enable "Print Layout" on mobile to see the footnotes.)

[PDF version! V1.00](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12G3irn7x_rsR1q8Lx217hqmO3DuWB9rS/view?usp=sharing) (Bad, ugly, not recommended. Probably won't be continued after this chapter.)

In an effort to avoid clogging up this subreddit, I've created /r/Ranimorphs and I'll be posting updates there. (Major updates, like ends of arcs and things, may end up here as well, assuming a reasonable time buffer has passed since the last post.)

This is still only the first chapter and a bit of a trial run, so I welcome any feedback you might have. Thanks for reading!

  Two thoughts:

  1. I love this and will try to contribute during my own re-read. 

  2. While the project is ongoing, and thus in the present tense, shouldnâ€™t the subreddit be called r/Runimorphs? >:P

    1. Thank you, I'm glad you liked it!

    2. I considered /r/CurrentlySprintingimorphs but it was taken :/

  This is awesome, I am bad at picking up subtle things and I am really excited to see this
