## [D] Sunday Writing Skills Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow /r/rational fans...

* Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)?

* How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

* Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

* Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

* Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

    Thankyou for posting this! I love learning about things like this that you're "meant" to get by instinct but that work so much better when you can analyse them to within an inch of their life. I've never gone through my prose with such a fine-toothed comb and I'm excited to see how MRUs can make things more punchy.

      Happy to help. A lot of people instinctively organize their writing into an MRU-esque form, but knowing about it allows you to edit it and make it sharp.

  > This is a really hard problem to solve, by the way. I struggle with it more than any other, actually. The clash between the ideas you get in your head and what ends up being true when you actually try to write it...that's my bane. I don't have a solution, sorry.

  *yeah i quote myself*

  You ever do that thing where you have an awesome idea for a really rad scene, and then you try to write it, and it just...doesn't come out that way? Like you have this idea where...

  > Jane struggled to free her bound wrists. "What do you want, you son of a bitch?"

  > Dr. Evilus smiled coldly. "I want you to die."

  > In his hand was a gun. Oh no! He could use that to shoot Jane.

  It's going to be really tense and exciting. Great action, snappy one-liners, enough tension to snap a rubber band. And then you try to write it, and...Jane doesn't say that. Dr. Evilus doesn't do that. And now the scene isn't doing what you wanted it to do, and you're not sure why you were writing it, or how to make it do what you wanted, or what to replace it with....

  Does that happen to you? What causes it? How do you deal with it?

    I roleplay more than I write (and in fact a lot of my story comes from roleplayed skeletons), and I find it's very common. Me and my partner say that the cause of this is the characters and situations being *real*, having actual motivations and not being puppets on strings that perform what we want to see.

    The way we deal with it is we let it happen. Usually, the end result is better for it even if that's not clear at the time. 

    (For example, in my vampire/human romance, the characters end up breaking up. I pictured an argument over whether slavery is a good idea resulting in the human raising his hands in the air and declaring that the vampire was stupid and cold and the breakup happening immediately and relatively explosively. Roleplaying it out we realised the characters actually care for each other and are nice to each other, so the conversation ended with some animosity but no breakup, and then the human thought it over for a week before finally deciding to declare the breakup. This is better, even if you lose the dramatic "THAT IS IT, WE ARE DONE, I DON't WANT TO SEE YOU EVER AGAIN" scene, it actually makes more sense overall since Real Breakups Don't Work That Way).

    I wrote another scene where everything kind of went off on a tangent. I just deleted it and wrote it again, changing the initial conditions slightly. That was enough to make the conversation more closely resemble what I wanted.

    Hope that's helpful!
