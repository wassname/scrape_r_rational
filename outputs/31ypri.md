  I tried posting this before, but I think it got swallowed by the filter. I'll try again, a little differently this time.

  **TL;DR:** *In Fire Forged now has a regularly updating blog and prose is being actively written again at faster-than-snail pace without being deleted immediately thereafter as unworkable.*

  Hello there, everyone. It's been a long time. Some of you may have read or heard of the story I once started posting about on this subreddit, others may not have.

  It's called In Fire Forged, and it's a massively AU rational Naruto-fic which will later have some rationalist features as the characters mature and grow. Since I posted here last, a truly massive amount of world-building and plotting has gone into the story. I now feel much more confident about continuing to write, since the impending (and preceding) plot is no longer hanging by the thinnest of threads backed only by my intuition that "things were going to work out fine if I just plowed ahead."

  There are more details on why I stopped writing for a while at the blog, which will be the go to place for any further updates on the story's progress. The blog's setup is not yet complete, but I can't offhand think of anything that it absolutely needs that wouldn't take a huge amount of time to create (such as a glossary of terms and/or characters, which I am considering). Suggestions are welcome.

  I beg the mods' forgiveness for this first announcement not being strictly a piece of rational fiction. I will forgo mentioning my twice-monthly progress updates here in the future, but will post links to the lore and world-building posts as that seems safely on topic.

  I've already got one such post cooking, on the topic of how chakra works in general, and I think it will go up sometime this week or the next.

  Lastly, I hope you folks can forgive me for the delay as I slammed on the brakes and paused to pick up the pieces, but I think we're going to see a somewhat smoother ride from here on out.

    I'm not sure what happened, but [post approved].

    Rational Naruto is a very popular choice, it seems. Waves Arisen, Lighting up the Dark, Team Anko, this, and my own hobby reworking of canon.

    Delicious...

      I haven't read Waves Arisen. Is it good?

          You just single handedly raised the number of future character deaths in In Fire Forged

            Careful, now.

        It's excellent.

        I'm going to go against popular opinion and say that it wasn't that great. It had a lot of good ideas but there were a lot of flaws in the execution of those ideas. That being said it was engaging enough that I read the whole story.

        I loved it. I'd say it's worth reading

        It was all right, but more in the sense of cute worldbuilding on top of canon than a captivating story or convincing characters.

        Still, it's not very long so I'd say it's worth a read. Curious what you'll think about it.

    Don't feel bad at all for not updating, I know life happens. However, I am quite glad of this blog! I love reading details regarding the creation of works of fiction, whether it's of game development or a blog on what an author's been doing. Looking forward to it!

  I'll be honest. While *I* hadn't forgotten about In Fire Forged, I did think *you* might have. I'm glad you haven't, though I don't think you owe anyone an explanation. I really liked what you had written, I especially liked the characterization of Sakura.

  I just wanted to say that while I had heard of it for many years, I had no experience in the world of Naruto until I read IFF's 8 chapters back last year during Labor day weekend.  I was in the Keys with a bunch of women and spent the time outside by the pool with my Kindle reading.  I don't think I'll ever watch Naruto because it's a billion episodes but your story is definitely something I want to continue because just those 8 chapters built up a lot of possibility and were executed very well.  Your writing channels  Wildbow's Skitter with the 1st person female lead and also EY's Professor Quirrel with Kakashi, which are obviously two very interesting characters.  Keep it up and looking forward to the new stories!

    > I don't think I'll ever watch Naruto because it's a billion episodes

    I'd recommend trying the manga. You can read/skim it at your own pace. The anime has a lot of filler episodes that make even less sense than the canon events. At least the first few hundred chapters are quite fun. The last third (or half) is pretty disappointing, so stop when you notice that you're rolling your eyes too much.

    You can find it in some libraries and many book shops. Also on the Internet if you know where to look.

  Is there a reason for you to not post *In Fire Forged* chapters directly on the blog instead of just including links?

  Also I updated the summary of *In Fire Forged* on [RationalReads](http://rationalreads.com/#/works/24) to include a link to the blog.

    Thank you for updating the entry! I did consider posting the story on the blog, briefly, but on further thought I think that dedicated reading sites such as fanfiction.net and AO3 provide an overall better reading experience than I could on my blog.

    One of my biggest gripes with blog-based stories like Worm, Pact and now, Twig, is that the reader can't control the story's formatting properly and there are no legitimate non-guilt-inducing e-book files around. On ff.net, for example, I can change to a lovely dark background and half width, which is how I personally prefer to read.

    That being said, given the software and workflow I write with, it shouldn't be difficult to provide formats like .pdf, .epub and .mobi on the blog. I don't want to do this before I'm done with the impending revision of the story, though, as I wouldn't want to circulate a bad out-of-date version.

    There is one major change that I need to implement in what's been written so far, and that's simply an absolute necessity to remove a total idiot ball that's already made its way into the story. [spoilers IFF chapter 7](#s " The entire Jiraiya interlude is slated for a rewrite, as what's there now just doesn't work out.")
