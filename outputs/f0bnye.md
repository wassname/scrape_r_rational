## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  [Space Trains](http://noisyowl.com/spacetrains/spacetrains.html) is coming along. Thanks again to everyone here who's provided feedback! The game has two core mechanics that have been confusing in the past, and I think this version fixes confusion about what hops are in a stylish way. I think I can fix the last confusing element, how resource requirements work, with [alternate ways to display project boxes](https://imgur.com/a/7PpFhlf). I think the last treatment in the album is probably the winner, but I'll have to sacrifice some goats to make a real version of it, so I first want to check, do people feel like this makes more sense? (Especially if you haven't seen the game before, especially especially if you have but didn't understand how it worked.)

  I've also done some background work that'll let me add new kinds of mysterious planets, so a bunch of those should crop up over the next week.

  Also: new train graphics.

    I've already seen this advertisement here before.

    I tried game for 3 minutes, it felt good and nice, but I had no idea what's the point and what I am doing there by randomly connecting to new planets.

    I still have no idea how the game mechanics works.
    ```

    - u/chris-goodwin:
      ```
      When you click on a planet, it puts out resources.  In order to put out more resources, it needs to take in some resources.  Eventually you can get tech upgrades that give you more options on upgrading planets, even one terraformer, another grey goo that lets you reset planets.  You can build spaceships and wormholes and things of that nature.  There are a couple of different win conditions, but the game doesn't appear to track them and tell you "You won!" yet.

  The recent (as of ch. 1741) Forty Millenniums of Cultivation arc antagonist is basically evil!Eliezer Yudkowsky. There are other recent events that mirror, say, the Hanson-Yudkowsky AI-Foom debate (AGI vs ems). I was already suspicious that the author has read Yudkowsky's stuff, but this feels like icing on the cake. Curious whether others have this impression.

    Two points of personal experience:

    * I was a late reader.  My parents read to me every day, more than one book.  When we went to toy stores I could get one toy or two books.  But I wouldn't read on my own.Nothing seemed to take, and I was behind in Kindergarten.  My parents were distraught.  They tried experts, they did hooked on phonics, and tutoring.  In first grade, around 6.5 years old, I started to read.  I never knew this until he was dead, but my uber-masculine father broke down crying in the parent teacher conference.  Three months later I was reading on a third grade level.  Two years later I read more books than anyone in the small school, except my sister.  When we had reading competitions, I started to throw them because I didn't think reading should be a competition and other people seemed to care about winning.  I'm still an avid reader today, even if *Worm* has eaten up my reading time like nothing before.
    * I'm a teacher.  I see kids forced into stuff their brains literally aren't ready for all the damn time.  It's incredibly harmful, especially to those without a strong support system.  Many buckle under the pressure and give up.  A few become obnoxious in their ignorance; in High School that metastasizes into prideful ignorance.   At the same time, I see some kids that are ready for more advanced materials held back because of lack of institutional resources.  Out of 75 or so students, 5 should be finished with High School level material in Freshman year.  20 should spend an extra year or two going over different 5th grade material until they hit puberty and their brains can handle the extra abstraction.  10 should basically do 3rd grade level material until they can master it at around 14, and then go on to career track.

    Education is incredibly individual.  Stages of brain development are very, very, very real.  And the educational trauma that comes from heavily pushing kids too early is just as real as the educational trauma from kids getting bored.  Some people can and should be reading by the time they're one, others seven.  This is a problem that teacher AIs will ameliorate, but not solve.

    &#x200B;

    As for your loss of faith: did you assume your perceptions were wrong or experts were wrong?  In education "experts" are frequently non-scientific, but in this case, it's probably your perceptions that were wrong.  That should lead to curiousity, not a lack of faith.

    I learned to read when I was 3-4. I learned because my mother would read books and had explained to me that they had words in them, then I would sit next to her and ask "what's this letter?" "what's this letter?" and after enough asking I got the hang of it. Later my mother found me scribbling those same letters on paper and pointing at them, calling them by name, so I basically learned to write too that way - only block letters, TBF. Some of my first books were the printed volumes of "Once Upon A Time... Life", the educational series on human anatomy by Albert Barille' (which taught me at the same time the rudiments of biology) and "Pinocchio", which was my first novel, when I was 4, and so still holds a special place in my heart for that. Took me a while to work through it, also because its Italian was a bit antiquated, but I overcame it in the end.

    So, yes, I think it's entirely possible to learn earlier than six years old. I wouldn't say I find that consensus sickening - a couple years of headstart don't make that big of a difference IMO - but yes, in general, I believe we *severely* underestimate what a child's mind can do if properly stimulated and prompted. I have a brother 12 years younger than me and I always made it a point to never treat him like an idiot, no matter what he asked - if he asked me about quantum mechanics and was willing, I'd happily give him as much of an explanation as I could muster by moving from his existing knowledge onwards.

    According to my mum I first started reading around age 2, but it's unclear how credible that claim is (my early childhood was quite tumultuous, and I'm otherwise skeptical just on prior grounds). In this account, I was taught to read by one of my great grandmas, bouncing on her knee in the kitchen of our small apartment (where my "bedroom" often was, either the kitchen table or the bathtub). This was all in Russian, too -- supposedly when I first came to the US (age 4) I'd already taught myself English somehow, and a placement test (since I'd attended Russian, Georgian, and French daycares / kindergardens) put me in the 1st grade (so e.g. I finished 12th at age 16, though personally I wish they'd have let me skip a few more). I was also fluent in and reading Georgian and French, but who knows. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯



    I have no real memory of this time, just ones I've constructed from stories of my infanthood. Don't think I really have any real memories until age 5 or 6 or so.

    Is the expert consensus disheartening because it's a later age than you'd anticipated? Why would it seriously impede cultural transmission?

    My parents would read to me while pointing at the words they were reading and I'd follow along, and at some point when I was three or four I started being able to read. But someone told me I'd learn to read in first grade, and I believed them, so I didn't "know how to read" until the first day of first grade, then I knew and started reading whatever, mostly The Hobbit, which took all of first grade.

    When I was very young I spent a lot of time trying to remember what it was like when I was even younger, because some of my memories were very alien to me. So I remember remembering being fascinated by one of those boards where you put the matching shape through a hole, because I remember trying to figure out how that was so interesting, but I don't actually remember that far back. The earliest actual memory I have is trying to walk to my parents' room in the middle of the night, having to touch the wall with a fingertip to be confident in my walking, and being frustrated that I had to switch to crawling when I passed the fireplace.

    I was something of a late bloomer and didn't really put effort into reading until I was six. I may have been able to a little before then, but I didn't put much effort into it until I discovered Harry Potter books.

    However, I remember my childhood pretty clearly. I have vivid memories of my fifth birthday, the day my brother was born when I was four, and a few 'snapshots' of events which my parents never described to me, but must have happened when I was three. I have nothing earlier than those, but I'm told remembering anything from that young is unusual.

    And we don't really start to become people until we're 2-3 years old. Before then the brain is still too disorganized to support personalities or discrete memory recall. It's less that we forget our early childhood than that we were not capable of remembering at that time.

    Hrrm. I would have been reading by kindergarten (~5) for sure as I can recall writing simple books around then, and I recall reading encyclopedia entries for things somewhat after. I was reading Lord of the Rings well before I was 8. Without querying my parents I can't pinpoint much more beyond extrapolating backwards. As for methods, I vaguely recall my mom trying hooked on phonics for me briefly, but I honestly remember the damn pre-movie ads for them on my VHS tapes more than I do the program itself. 

    EDIT: my mom says I was reading simple chapter books by kindergarten, and she thinks I learned to read around 3 or 4.

    To answer your last question, I can't remember much beyond specific impactful events. There's a lot of things in my head bucketed in the "before I was 8" section because it was then that we moved out of my grandparent's house and my dad joined the Navy. It's all very much a blur. I have exactly two memories from before I was three, and everything from then to ~8 is all mixed together. 

    My son (3) can read very simple books a notch or so below Seuss and can write a very distorted version of all the letters in the alphabet. He could name all the letters on sight by the time he was around 2 or so. I credit the letter recognition to YouTube videos, and the reading/writing to a few different apps that we got for his tablet when he was also around 2.  The ability for him to control the endless repetition has been a huge help, I suspect; neither me nor his mother have the patience to have repeated the sounds of each letter or word the thousands of times he's heard them by spamming taps on the tablet.

    > How old were you when you learned how to read?

    Fuzzy on the details, but I remember having read Eragon in kindergarten or maybe early 1st grade (6 years old; it was around summertime), but didn't start to learn reading much earlier than kindergarten. I believe my reading education was fairly conventional; I'd had some exposure to letters beforehand (I have memories from when I was about 3 drawing cursive letters with chalk and asking my parents if they spelled anything) but other than that it was just the standard kindergarten exposure to language.

    As for how much of my early childhood I can legitimately remember, I start having concrete memories at about 3 years of age, and remember more and more of each year for every year thereafter. Most of my memories are information based-- I remember that I did something in some place at some time, and then any visuals I think up are probably synthetized after the fact. I don't remember sound, smell, taste, or touch virtually at all, with a few notable exceptions, but it's relatively easy for me to place specific events on a timeline because my family moved around a bit so the environments I was in are distinct.

    Personally, I think the general consensus on reading age is probably right. The responses you're getting to this post are all coming from /r/rational members who started earlier, but I have a feeling we were all a very particular kind of child. Since intelligence is highly heritable, any kid you have can probably stand to start early, but my gut feeling is that most kids are poorly suited to be taught reading any earlier than 6ish years old, either due to lack of comprehension or childish hyperactivity. They're technically capable of learning to read, but being forced to could poison them against reading in the future, in much the same way that you see a lot of kids hate reading books because of what they were forced to read in english classes.

    > How old were you when you learned how to read?

    Around 3 or 4 years old.

    > How did you acquire the ability to read?

    According to my parents, my older brother had just learned to read, and I was frustrated that he was able to do something that I could not, and taught myself to read.  Their first guess was that I had just memorized a book, rather than actually reading, but were satisfied after having me read the book in reverse order.

    > How much of your early childhood can you legitimately remember?

    Relatively little.  A few mental images have internal inconsistencies, or otherwise contradict the known sequence of events.  (For example, tricycling down a hallway to visit my cousins, when in actuality we had never lived in the same city, let alone the same apartment complex.)   I don't have any distinct memories of learning to read, though I do have a few consistent and confirmed memories that date to when I was about 3.

    > That sort of makes me feel sick in the pit of my soul. Like, any faith I may have had in the ability of cultural transmission to properly propagate the stuff that actually matters? Gone. Something major has to be going wrong somewhere for the world to look the way it looks.

    Can you explain this further?  Does the age that reading is taught seem too early, too late?  What about it causes the visceral revulsion?

    My first fragmentic memories are from around the age of one. From around the age of 2,5-3 memories got more substantial - prolonged series of events in contrast to few emotional scenes I remember from earlier age. I remember that period of life quite well, much better in fact than my 7-13 y.o. period.

    I was a late reader, I think I started to read only when I was 7-8 years old, in 1st-2nd grade (Russian school, it is on the "late" part of spectrum but nothing too unusual). And started to read casually for ones enjoyment only when I was around 10,5-11 y.o.

    This anecdote is coming in a bit late but I figure it can't hurt:

    I learned to read around kindergarten, which if memory serves was around four or five.  We had a little book section of the classroom that you could spend time in, and I have a distinct memory of something that happened about that.

    In my first year of kindergarten, I wasn't much interested in the books.  I could read them, so I probably picked up a lot of the knowledge around 4y/o, but I didn't care much.  Around the time I started my second year of kindergarten, I got a lot more interested in them (which is what I remember: me noticing the shift in behaviour).

    I don't have reading-based memories earlier than that (though I do have one around the same time about learning how to read silently), though, so I can't say when my parents started reading to me.  But it can't have been later than four, since I already knew the basics of reading in my first year of kindergarten.
    ```

    I was about three when I learned to read.  I might have understood some simple words and phrases at two, but three was when I started reading books.  Hooked On Phonics was involved, but I think our family's extensive collection of Seuss was also a critical factor - yes, my parents did want to teach me how to read at an early age, and yes, I did want to make them happy, but I was more concretely motivated by my appreciation of Dr. Seuss's work, which I could read at any time so long as I first *learned how to read*.  The appealing and unusual illustrations helped - yes, I could get some enjoyment out of them even without reading, but that just gave me some idea of *the real experience I was missing*.

    A couple of years later, at age five, I was reading children's chapter books; the thickest was the first Harry Potter book.  My kindergarten teacher took a bizarrely antagonistic stance towards my reading level (which might partially have been the result of her fringe-right religious beliefs not taking kindly to the aforementioned Harry Potter - she also explicitly taught antisemitism, and although my parents were disgusted by that, I'm not sure why it never blew up into a big scandal), repeatedly attempted to prove that I was lying about my ability to read, and essentially treated me like a freak until the end of the year, at which point my parents transferred me to a different school as I'd requested.

    The school I was transferred to for first grade specialized in gifted children, but it didn't set the bar especially high - I still had the highest reading level in the class, but that was seen as a good thing and I had serious competition for it.  I began looking down on other children for their poor academic performance - one girl in particular, I held in contempt because she was the last student in our class to learn how to read, and I saw this as symptomatic of some great deficit in her character.  In retrospect, I have extremely fond memories of her, and this failure to empathize with my age peers (realizing that things like their literacy would mostly be a consequence of factors outside their control) is one of my greatest shames from this period of my life.

    I have extensive memories of my early childhood; the memories get scarcer and blurrier earlier in the timeline, but only somewhat, and there are still definitely legitimate memories there, not just imagined scenes reconstructed from others' accounts.  For a long time I thought my first memory was my third birthday, but I gradually realized that some of my formative memories actually happened when I was two (particularly during a business trip in Europe).  My third birthday was just my first *solidly positive* memory; an incident during my father's business trip in Europe when I was two, which taught me that *it was possible to lose things*, was my first *solidly negative* memory.

  Real talk - I feel quite a bit stressed about this all and I need to vent, plus any experience/advice would be welcome.

  The recent Coronavirus situation has made me rethink a lot about my health situation. I'm not panicking about this virus specifically - it's just that it made me realise how in practice I'm likely to be quite vulnerable from a respiratory point of view, be it any new strange diseases or the good ol' flu. I've been living in the Oxford area for years now, and apparently this is quite the polluted zone. This has taken a toll as now I've got adult onset asthma, albeit a relatively light form, that has me on preventer inhalers all the time. My doctor says that it's unlikely to ever go away as long as I live here. This kind of thing can't be good - no one has ever mentioned the C- word yet, but I doubt frankly breathing in pollution all the time does wonders for my long term chances in that sense either. I've been considering moving away for a while now. The problem is, to move I would likely need to change jobs, and that's a bit of a toughie. 

  I'm a scientist and currently I work in a research council. Job wise this might be possibly the best position for me - it's not perfect, but I have no teaching burdens and get a lot of freedom in my projects and managing my time, which is something I cherish. If I were to leave here, it'd be unlikely I could find another job in a similar position while staying in the UK. So it'd be either the private sector, or trying for academia. Thing is, the first option worries me that I might find myself frustrated with a job where I'm much more constrained and have less opportunities to actually apply my knowledge in full; the second option seems far more attractive on the face of it, but it means throwing myself into the whirlwind of crazy competitiveness that universities have become as of late, and in the end working my ass off and suffering through a lot of stress I'm not sure I'd be able to take in order to end up becoming almost only an administrator, writing grant requests all the time, which seems to be what most professors do once they progress enough in their career.

  Does anyone here have personal experience of either environment? What is your take on their pros/cons? Mind you, both options would likely be better paid than my current job, so that's not the issue. It's more a matter of long term satisfaction and happiness. I may be underestimating for example the level of stress I can take because in these last times I felt very weak/lethargic. Maybe a job that interests me more could energise me. As I am now, I have a really hard time imagining that in 10 years I'd have the strength to cope with a very stressful job that I could barely handle now, but that might be a wrong impression.

    I realize this isn't addressing your question - others seem to have already done this - but I did want to chime in specifically about the infectious disease angle.

    Both SARS and MERS are coronaviruses, and the current outbreak looks likely to go the same way, if the same protections are kept in play.

    These, as well as influenza, spread in a very similar way - hand to hand. Use gloves when opening doors, and knuckles rather than fingertips to push elevator buttons. Frequently clean your hands with soap and water by vigorously scrubbing for around 30 seconds. Try to keep your hands away from eyes, nose, and mouth unless they've been recently cleaned.

    Clean hands will not entirely protect you, but they do greatly reduce exposure.

    If a vaccination becomes available, by all means get that done as well.

    Commercial business is great at making products a reality once they see the idea in academia, so those fields have great cost/benefit for the general population. The overwhelming majority of nutrition and health studies are either just correlations or have low sample size so they can't detect small effects or nuanced responses.

    Practice:
    Database of research in progress and studies that didn't succeed, just simple ongoing logs with a "failed due to X" at the end would be great. Very useful for academia as a whole.

    For the pharmaceutical researchers, I'd encourage the rapid development of safe and effective [nootropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic) drugs which can be shown to measurably improve results on IQ tests and/or to accelerate work performance at creative or intellectual tasks. There's no guarantee that such a thing could even exist, but if it is feasible, it would have the potential to greatly accelerate all other fields of research.

    For education researchers, I'd like to see focus going into establishing learning aids (like educational videos) to help reduce reliance on lectures in classrooms. Lectures will vary in quality; some good, some bad, but most can be improved with visual aids. We can try to identify the best lecture approaches/presentations and then include visual aids with that to produce educational videos which teach concepts as quickly and as effectively as possible. Variations on these educational videos can be presented to groups of students to see which ones yield the best results (in terms of both student enjoyment as well as ability to correctly answer questions across various timescales after viewing the video). With rapid development and improvement of these learning aids, we could possibly start accelerating school/college programs and then have spare time for more advanced topics. Improving education could also help to improve our ability to get capable researchers for promoting scientific advancements.

    As far as how science is practiced overall, for any kind of randomized control trial, I would want to ensure that all such studies are registered with whatever journal they'll publish with, and that they undergo pre-publication peer review to ensure that the basis of the study is sound. The pre-publication registration is important to ensure that we don't miss negative findings. It's easy for published research to create a bias towards doing/using things that are actually ineffective if all or most of the negative results don't get published. This has created significant problems in drug research and psychology, although many other fields are not without their problems in this regard as well.

    With those in place to accelerate our progress, there's still the big topics with potential for revolutionary socioeconomic impact: friendly GAI, nanotechnology, genetic research and engineering (including genetic screening, gene therapy, and GMO crops), viable nuclear fusion power plants, neural interfaces, and self-replicating robots (which could be sent to the asteroid belt or other planets).

    Go all in on nuclear fusion, I think. Right now a major breakthrough there is about the only way I see out of the impending resource catastrophies.

Also ocean water desalination, to ward off the next middle eastern war. Would also help with recycling of electronics and rare earths.

  Here's an unpleasant thought experiment I thought up this last week. Not sure how I'd respond to it, myself:


  Suppose in your care is a small, defenseless child. Maybe picture them a daughter, 8 years old, for whom you're the world's greatest parent. You love and care for them deeply, as they do you. You're a widow(er), but despite many struggles you've managed to eke out a small island of comfort and stability: flexible middle-class job, finger paintings on the fridge, long bedtime stories, the works.

  You're driving down a forested road one day when a Scientist turns on a Machine and causes the universe to shudder and split. The momentary distraction makes you swerve and crash, killing your daughter instantly but leaving you miraculously unharmed.

  One funeral and no small amount of mourning later, the Scientist comes to you and remarks that they've managed to contact and transfer matter between one of the alternate universes, identical in all respects up to the moment of shudder. In this universe, the shudder happened a split second later, bestowing upon the alternate *you'* that much more opportunity to sacrificially direct your' swerve so that *you'* died instantly, orphaning *your' daughter'* but leaving her at the mercy of a cruel and inefficient foster care system, with nothing but horror and inconvenience before her.

  The Scientist offers you an opportunity to connect you and *your' daughter'*, that she may live with you and be cared for and loved. Do you accept their offer?

  If you don't, the Scientist leaves, never to return. If you do, the Scientist leaves, >!but returns some weeks later, after you've settled into some semblance of normalcy, beginning to truly love *your' daughter'*, who you've now accepted as if she were your own (which, under many perspectives on personal identity, she is). The Scientist tells you that it's not just one alternate universe they've managed to contact, but trillions! And it would appear that across the distribution of alternate car crashes, an unharmed orphaned daughter was left a million times as often as a living, breathing "*you*". Each of those orphaned daughters finds herself on the cusp of a series of deeply unfortunate and tragic events, every one a unique blend of sorrow and tragedy. You may transfer as many or as few into your care as you'd like. How do you proceed?!<

    I transfer at least 100, probably 1000 to play it safe. Matter transference technology is the solution to most of our existential risk and roadblocks to post-scarcity, and so an extremely visible result that cannot realistically be played off as a hoax is the easiest way to get the world 100% committed to making this tech ubiquitous and saving the rest of my infinitely many daughters. Invite as many media networks as you can so TPTB can't squash the story for sinister purposes, get the highest quality livestreams you can out with the message, and let the gears start turning.

      You're like a daughter-saving paperclipper.

      Genius. At this point the most important issue is no longer "reuniting with your previously-dead daughter", but the amazing miraculous technology of transferring matter to & from trillions of other worlds.

      The story has been transformed from dealing with a personal tragedy in a slightly unhealthy way to bringing forth a multi-universe technological revolution.

    ```
    I think keeping only one is correct, unfortunately. If I'm in a small island of stability, taking two would make both their lives significantly worse, and there's diminishing returns where taking more eventually changes nothing about their overall lives.
    ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    If you're doing the naive-utilitarian thing and just trying to be better than the extra-tragic foster system for the largest number of daughters, then you can safely aim towards the dozen+.

    Of course that's not going to be a very fun rest of your life, or very rewarding (your daughters' childhoods will only be pleasant in a relative sense). And if you're a saint out to maximize utility you could just buy malaria nets.

    Seems like you should sit down and think about your food budget, ability to multi-task, available family/social support network, and your daughter's ability to care for herself (herselves). You could take care of anywhere from three to a dozen alternate-universe clones of her depending on the answers.
    ```

  - u/Threesan:
    ```
    Can you transfer, say, copies of legal docs to a million other worlds? It seems like you only need to solve the "procedure" aspect on one planet, then dry-run and fixup the "blind document delivery with no further interaction" approach several times before you can attempt to move into some form of mass-production. Perhaps you would have access to a sympathetic charity-case lawyer who could bootstrap funds access from your'-to-daughter' if funds are needed.

    Side note: Reaching a million worlds can be done in twenty doublings, so it's not like you need to fax a million copies from the first world.

    \*(edit) Also: I wonder how much real value that old "identical twins A/B testing" joke has. I would guess probably not enough to privately fund the 8-to-18 childhood of every participant. But perhaps some (sane) governments would be interested, as a public investment into the future of the nation and humanity. \*\*(edit2) Ah, with inter-universe communication, there might not be all that much need for doing such experiments same-universe (ie, universes can collaborate).
