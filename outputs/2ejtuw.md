  So...the message here is that immortality sucks and it's better to die than do the thing that will make it not suck?

    Seems that way, and frustratingly apparently it's rational to use anecdotal evidence to avoid examining the things that will make it not suck. Seems like an anti-rationalist anti-rational story if I ever saw one.

      So it's not just me. Good. Not sure why this showed up here.

    I think that's slightly mean-spirited towards the story: Twilight's is one perspective. Luna's was another, Cadence's a yet third. Celestia is left undecided as to how to proceed.

    Neither Luna nor Cadence found immortality to suck, but Twilight finds a simple end to her existence to be more tasteful than what the paths these two took -- or at least what said paths looks like from Twilight's external point of view.

    This was basically a story discussing transhumanist ideas, not really a "rationalist" story.
    ```

      Well, let's examine the options:

      * Twilight: decides that her life is boring and / or pointless. Prefers dying to trying anything that might change that fact. 
      * Cadence: decides that wireheading is the best possible use of an immortal's existence. 
      * Celestia: keeps doing the same thing (re-creating Equestria and its ponies over and over) instead of trying anything new. 
      * Luna: Transcends. Granted, this appears to be a positive outcome, or at least might be. We simply have no data -- the only thing we know is that all prior interests and attachments cease to matter. 

      Also, the protagonist's decision should legitimately receive a greater weighting than the other characters'.

    And they completely ignore that intelligence enhancements might enable them to think of a solution to their problems.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  The other stories are good as well. At least [two](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/212395/3/flashes-of-insight/paradigm-shift-487) of [them](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/212395/4/flashes-of-insight/no-free-lunch-490) are about economics.
