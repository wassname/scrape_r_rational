## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I'm currently out of completed webfiction to read. Before I get into even more serialized web fiction (The Good Student is going to be my next target), does anyone want to recommend **completed** works of web fiction or web serials (or other free digital text-based content)?

  Doesn't have to be rational fiction. I've read and am currently reading plenty of stuff that isn't.

  ---

  Full, *finished* web serials I've finished so far, roughly in descending order of length (if anyone's interested in any of these works, I can give little reviews of them):

  - Wildbow's works [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/), [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/), and [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) (all mostly rational)
  - [Void Domain](https://towercurator.wordpress.com/), "modern magic and demons" (Not especially rational)
  - [Entirely Presenting You](https://entirelypresentingyou.wordpress.com/), "what if only one person had superpowers, and they took Taylor's approach?" (Not especially rational)
  - [Twisted Cogs](https://twistedcogs.wordpress.com/), "what if everyone with powers was a Tinker in Renaissance Italy?" (Not especially rational)
  - [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://www.hpmor.com/), "what if Harry Potter actually made sense?" (extremely rational)
  - [Unsong](http://unsongbook.com/), "what if kabbalistic Judaism was right?" (Not at all rational but very much worth reading anyway, like Terry Prachett)
  - [Shadows of the Limelight](http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/), "what if your superpowers depended on fame?" (Rational)
  - [Ra](https://qntm.org/ra), a rational-ish approach to what magic might look like in the modern day if discovered (Mostly rational)
      - also, most of the rest of qntm's miscellany
  - [The Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man), Superman, but from a rational Lex Luthor's perspective (Rational)
  - [Post Human](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human/), an AI slowly becomes self-sufficient following the apocalypse that wiped out humanity (Rational)
  - [Interviewing Leather](https://banter-latte.com/portfolio/interviewing-leather/), a muggle reporter's perspective on supervillains (Rational)

  --- 

  Stuff I'm currently up-to-date with and actively reading as it comes out (for no other reason but than to provide recommendations if anyone wants them), in roughly descending order of update frequency:

  - [Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/), "what if the world literally ran on stories" (rational)
  - [Ward](https://www.parahumans.net/), the sequel to Worm (mostly rational)
  - [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com/), an Isekai except the protagonist decides to run an inn instead of be an adventurer (not very rational)
  - [The Gods are Bastards](https://tiraas.net/), a take on high fantasy as the industrial revolution begins and the age of adventures ends (somewhat rational)
  - [The Legion of Nothing](http://inmydaydreams.com/), a fairly standard superhero serial (not very rational)
  - [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126), an Isekai except the world is made from the protagonist's RPG ideas (rational)
  - [Pokemon: The Origin of Species](http://daystareld.com/pokemon/), a rational take on the story of Pokemon Red/Blue
  - [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning), wherein the protagonists munchkins the hell out of the Groundhog Day time loop he's stuck in (rational)

    [Tabloid, a worm fanfic](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tabloid-worm-artfic-%E2%80%94-complete.455278/) is very good. 

    Blurb: PRT photographer by day and cape paparazzi by night, Tabloid explores the effects of parahumans on society with the help of his quirky sense of humor. Each chapter contains original artwork. World-building, slice of life, drama, and dark humour comedy.

    since you seem to like superhero fic, I'd recommend Super Powereds by Drew hayes. Now, it used to be fully available on the author's website, except he took it down to sell it on amazon. However, you can still access the entire series through the way back machine here - https://web.archive.org/web/20170606031105/http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/spy1/p

    and you might need to leap forward a bit in time to catch the 'book' of it, which represents year 4. Because by the time the author was finishing the story he already put year 1 up on amazon I think....

    Basically super powereds is about a superhero training academy. not particularly rational at all, but likeable characters + interesting powersets + decent ending makes it a solid superhero story imo.
    ```

    - u/Penumbra_Penguin:
      ```
      This was a fun story. For anyone who's interested, it's trying to be Harry Potter, but with superheros instead of wizards. The bulk of the story takes place in superhero school - you see classes, interesting teachers, exams, and so on - and then every now and then the overarching plot impinges on school life.
      ```

    - u/tobias3:
      ```
      I tried reading that one and didn't like it. I can recommend "Forging Hephaestus" by the same author though (also a superhero story). Unfortunately there isn't any book two (yet). The protagonist does some interesting power munchkinry.

    [El-Ahraihrah](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/el-ahrairah-worm.372987/), a Worm fic where Taylor triggers as a Thinker with the same shard, is well-written and fairly rational. Unlike the original, which has so many enormous idiot balls that Taylor's real superpower is that she only carries one half the time. On a very long hiatus, but explicitly not abandoned.

    [Something Completely Different](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/something-completely-different-worm-tinker-si-original-city.25042/) is a lighthearted and nigh-rationalist Worm fic, about an author-SI Tinker with a specialty in corpses. Unfortunately abandoned due to audience backlash from how he handled the >!Slaughterhouse9Arc!<, but it has a good run which ends at the end of an arc. There are a couple updates he marked noncanon due to that same backlash; read them anyway, they're great.

  Are you interested in space, complex simulations and 5+ hour boardgames? Meet [High Frontier](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172737/high-frontier-third-edition). 

  Assemble a working rocket with [components based on real patents](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2580360/high-frontier-third-edition), paying mind to mass, thrust, fuel efficiency, thermal cooling, market availability, and future space manufacturing. Fly around the [solar system](https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2580365/high-frontier-third-edition)with its many available routes while tracking your delta V.

  Stake a claim with your robonaut; build a factory, and start upgrading your rocket via awesome space manufactured components. Then its time to get *real* science going: fly out to the gas giant moons or kuiper belt, get a proper Lab and promote your human colonists to their transhumanist counterparts. Maybe you want to shape the future by producing a mini black hole? Or you'd like to emancipe the robots? Or colonize other stars and send out a beehive ark? Send out a gas giant with a fusion candle? 

  So obviously this is very much rocket science and not for the faint of heart or time; BGG complexity weigth is 4.75/5. You learn it by playing in order:  introductory game ->base game->advanced game->full game. If you are the type to get hooked by it it will get you completely. 

  Once you have mastered space flight, the competitiveness comes from intense bidding on cards and even space combat. It is a physics/solar system simulation after all and the map isn't really balanced since it tracks what we know of the solar system. 

  There is a Tabletop Simulator module which works surprisingly well; and if you'd 
  like to I can teach it to you there. 

  In case you'd want to get a physical copy, there will be a kickstarter for 4th edition coming up on 24th of october, during Spiel 2019 in Essen - the biggest boardgame convention in the world (which I will attend). 

  So in conclusion: I really recommended this game, but you have to be a heavy boardgamer AND spacenerd to enjoy it.
  ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    > you have to be a heavy boardgamer/spacenerd to enjoy it

    I will testify that this is an *and*, not an *or*. I am a heavy boardgamer but not a big spacenerd and did not enjoy it.

    I would imagine a computer version of that game to be a cross between the rocket building of Kerbal Space Program and the complexity of Aurora 4x. Or possibly Distant Worlds. Would be a pain to make though.

      ... A friend of mine actually spent houndreds of hours programming the map+rules... So only need IP+art assets+couple hundred more hours to merge it all.

  I've read through and hugely enjoyed To The Stars. I really enjoyed reading about the development of institutions (like the foundation of the MSY and the military police in a spinoff series). I also enjoyed exploring the political implications of people with superpowers being placed in positions of power, and noble rulers reforming countries. 

  What are some good fics, rational or not, about the development of institutions and rulers/leaders with superpowers?

  I started a new series, [Palus Somni](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25475/palus-somni), that popped up on RR a few months ago, and it's really good. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who like horror/psychologial stories. It's more of a slow-burn psychological thriller than the usual fantasy/scifi that I'm into, but it's well written with solid characters. There's something very chilling about the world the author puts out for us. A group of nun are essentially stuck in a convent. They haven't had contact with the outside world in quite some time. Things are okay at the moment, but you've always got the impression that they're living on borrowed time, that whatever affected the outside world will one day find its way inside their walls. They're all normal people, no special abilities, and they're just trying to keep their world going one day at a time.


  Here's an excerpt (not a spoiler) from the beginning of the story that I really liked and shows off what kind of story it is.

  > [A handwritten note that hangs on the refectory door, yellowed with age. The delicate, neat lettering is still legible.]

  Need help narrowing down the list of recommended 'rationalist' fiction that is listed on the wiki. I'm primarily looking for books with a heavy emphasis on what I'll call "protagonist vs absurd environment/culture/society". I don't actually care if the book is truly rational, I just like the satisfaction/munchkinry that seems to come along with this style of book. Webnovels/unfinished works are fine to suggest as well.

  Examples I've read:

  * HPMOR

  * Two year emperor

  * Harry Potter and the Natural 20


  I also find I get some sense of this from isekai/reincarnation novels but it's usually pretty muted.


  Books I've read that don't fit the category:

  * Mother of Learning

  * Friendship is Optimal

  * A hero's war

  * Worth the candle

  * Sufficiently advanced magic
  ```

    hmm if youre willing to try asian fic, theres http://novelfull.com/warlock-of-the-magus-world.html

    its definitely protagonist vs the world. Except the protagonist can at best be described as chaotic neutral, or maybe outright evil. First 20 or so chapters are a chore before the translator/author finds their voice, and the more interesting worldbuilding elements are introduced.

- u/Yuridyssey:
  ```
  I recommend Moneyball (the movie) and Ookiku Furikabutte (the anime) as very munchkinny rationalist fiction although much of the effort of the characters of each goes into the narrow context of trying to win baseball games. I think they work less well the more you know about baseball, but if you're not a huge baseball fan then they should work well to scratch the ratfic/munchkin/optimisation itch. Both heavily feature trying to think their way through how to leverage lesser tools to compete with much more well-resourced competition, with Oofuri having much more time to go into a lot more depth on the actual thinking.

  If you know of other sports fiction that functions in a similar way I'd be very interested, they're probably a bit underrated by ratfic fans despite them often being a good fit. Because the goals and rules are often reliably clearly defined and consistent (win and whatever the rules of the sport are + mundane physics, respectively), there's a lot of room leftover to focus on reasoning and problem solving to get to those goals within those rules. Not all sportsfic are interested in that but it can be great, pure ratfic when it is.

    If you haven't heard of it, [One Outs](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5040/One_Outs) from the author of Liar Game sounds like something you might be interested in.
    ```

    - u/Yuridyssey:
      ```
      I think I remember not entirely hating it but it's definitely a bit sillier and less committed to realism. It's more Akagi but with baseball than it is Oofuri or Moneyball. Fun in a different, bombastic way rather than rather than particularly ratficcy. It might scratch similar itches though for sure, depending on what things people are actually trying to get out of ratfic. Thanks for offering the rec.

    To add a few suggestions to my own question...

    Blood Song by Anthony Ryan. It chronicles the training and early life of Vaelin Al Sorn, who is a member of a religious militant order. It's a prime example of what I call "interesting competent people doing interesting things competently". The best part of this story is just reading in growing up and making his mark on the world. There are two squeals which aren't nearly as good and turn the story into a bog standard fantasy epic. While perhaps not technically a magic school, the protagonist does have a magic power he learns to use.

    The Magicians by Lev Grossman. Pretty much Harry Potter as literally fiction, where the big bad isn't Voldemort but ennui. I rather liked the first book. The second and third were okay but I didn't enjoy them as much.

    Red Sister by Mark Lawrence. Take thee to a nunnery! This story is a weird mix of sci-fi and fantasy. The setting is a distant planet, currently undergoing an ice age. But some rare people also have magic powers. The main character is a girl who is sold to a convent, except this convent in addition to training actual nuns, trains church assassins, warriors and holy witches. More down to earth than my description seems. Has two squeals. Again the first is the best but the second is also pretty good. Third was rather bad honestly and read like the author just wanted the series over.
