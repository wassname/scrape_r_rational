  > I used to think I should try to convince people to like me without resorting to telepathy, but it's hopeless. 

  &#x200B;

  >Of course, that’s not the main reason I’m here. There are currently only a couple dozen human telepaths on the planet, and I intend to dedicate much of my life to increasing that number.

  A nice combination of relatable and ambitious.

  I bet she's right, and true understanding of the limits of telepathy will be a reassurance. I'm looking forward to seeing how that shakes out.

  As always, your thoughts are greatly appreciated. I ended up being quite busy this past month so it took a lot longer than expected.

  Big thanks to confettibin for editing!

    What genre would you say this story is?
    ```

- u/rationalidurr:

  I'm not a big fan of this story, character and premise wise.
  Mostly because every time they casually mention alien presence and telepathy existence, I get a little voice in my head yelling: You are are giving me a time turner to help my sleeping problem?

  Only in this case is: You are subjecting the world to mental influence of an alien whose nature you cannot fully understand or even block?

  And this time it's worse because apparently all the telepath has to do is make body contact for a short while with a person. Diseases take longer to spread, if there is even a sliver or malice or alien intent in the process or mental sharing then human nature is basically FUCKED AS SHIT.

  Never mind things like pathogens, which I understand you as author may have skipped since its boring/hurdle to bypass, or even personal body bacteria.

  We are seeing here an alien invader who is given free reign and is the only expert in telepathy and defense against it. This is crazy.
  Imma keep read tho.

  I enjoy reading this, but new installments dribble out too infrequently for me to stay as engaged as it would otherwise deserve.

  I like this chapter the most.
