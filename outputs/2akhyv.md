## [BST] Help with an identity concealment storyline?

### Post:

I am working on a rational fanfic at the moment and I go by the philosophy that crowdsourced intelligent/rational! characters will be more intelligent than if I try and model them all myself.
 As such, I am testing this out to see if this is a good place for asking and if it will work. Anyway, here goes.

Question:

If you had to hide a car so that it could not be found, then immediately transfer to another vehicle of some time in a way that would give no information about you, how would you do it? 

For example, you could leave it in a parking lot somewhere near a train station, but the police regularly check on cars in parking lots that have been abandoned for a certain amount of time.

You could sell it or trade it, but records are made. You could do it in cash or barter but then the person you did that with would recognize you. You don't want ANY information to be available later because RATIONAL! antagonist will track you and is thorough.

You could hitchhike but that isn't fast or predictable and you still have to abandon the car somewhere it ideally can't be found for at least a few weeks and then transfer immediately to the highway to hitchhike.

I need suggestions to use for my story. Preferably suggestions that can be explained in two sentences or less in the story. You can take more than two to explain here but it can't something I couldn't summarize. 

I look forward to seeing what you come up with.

  Sneak into a junk yard, put the car in the crusher and call it good.  You can bribe someone to do it for you, swap the car for the one that is supposed to be destroyed, whatever.

  Alternatively, drive it into a deep lake / old quarry.  Just make sure you erase the tire tracks from where it went in.

  Alternatively, drop it off in the bad part of town with the doors open and engine running.  It'll be stolen and run through a chop shop in minutes.  For extra paranoia points, buy a lot of paint and give the car a new paintjob before you drop it off.

  If you're really in a hurry, just take the plates off and torch the car -- soak it in gas inside and out, toss a road flare in.  The shell will be found but there won't be any fingerprints, DNA, etc.  You'll probably want to scratch out the VIN too.  http://www.autocheck.com/consumers/car-facts/vin-numbers/find-vin.do for where to find it.


  Getting a new car -

  Cover yourself up (e.g. hoodie and sunglasses, keep your head down) and hire someone to go into a junkyard and buy you a wreck.  The junkyard owner (who is easily findable) knows nothing about you.  The random citizen who bought it for you is not easily findable (being utterly random with no obvious connection to you or the junkyard) and never saw you enough to identify you.

  How moral is our protagonist?  If you did the 'hire someone' option above, you could kill them and bring their body with you until you can dispose of it.

  Alternatively, you could carjack a person in a deserted area, kill them, and bring the body until it can be disposed of.

  Ways to dispose of a body:

  - Best way is to dump it in a barrel of nitro-hydrochloric acid; it will even dissolve the gold fillings in their teeth and their wedding band, let alone their flesh and teeth.  Failing convenient chemical stores, you can:  

  - bury it in the woods
  - tie a few cinder blocks to it and throw it in the ocean.  Ideally puncture the stomach first so that gas buildup doesn't make it more buoyant after a few days
  - throw it in an incinerator
  - knock out the teeth to prevent dental matching, then pour gas on it and torch it to destroy face and fingerprints

  Easiest way would probably be for someone with a vested interest in not revealing its origins to take ownership of the car. So ... arrange for the car to be stolen.

  Leave the keys in the ignition and the car running in a bad neighborhood, put a post on Craig's List, contact known criminals, etc. Depending on the level of technology you have available, it wouldn't be all that difficult to anonymously set up someone to take it. They would never have to see your face, and so couldn't reveal information about you if they were caught (which they wouldn't be, assuming that you can hand over the paperwork).

  How long does it have to stay hidden for?  There's a big difference between planning for a couple of days and planning for a year or more.

  How about adjacent automated long term parking garages?  Don't know if you can just pay cash, but with a careful pre-arrangement you could probably disable the cameras and/or conceal your face.

    I like the idea. If this was a prepared attempt then that would be absolutely perfect. As is, this is an unplanned escape that has never been considered. The character is planning on the fly in the van and doesn't have time for much setup.

  Buy a house, park in the garage, stop paying the mortgage and let the bank deal with it when they reposess the house.

  ...what is the actual threat that someone is attempting to defend against, and what are the resrouces available? Without that you're mostly going to get useless answers.
  ```

  ```
  If you don't need the car later, you can abandon it at a trash dump for old cars, or forge papers to "return" it to a rental-car company.

  Why do I have to switch cars? Are the police watching for this particular car? If so, I'd probably just switch plates, drive along country roads, and give my car a crappy spray paint job.

  If I really need a different mode of transportation, hm. Carjacking or identity theft seem too difficult for me. Probably the easiest would be to look up someone who's selling a used car, and then lie through my teeth (sob story, fake name on bill of sale, pay with cash or forge check). Alternately, maybe I could acquire a fake ID and buy train tickets with cash.

  Of course, this is a very "lifeboat" scenario - all alone in the middle of the ocean. How about borrowing a friend's car? Having a friend buy your train tickets / rent a car. Call up my parents and get them to buy me a plane ticket - or even come pick me up.

  I don't know how common this is in other countries but in Melbourne, Australia parking on the side of the street is common in suburbia. So just park it behind another car in a random backstreet. Each household assumes it belongs to one of the others near by, bystander effect means it wont get reported for a month at least if it is in reasonable condition (i.e. it hasn't been in a gun fight). Then you walk to the nearest bus or train stop and disappear.
  ```

    I like the thought. It is a bit unpredictable as it depends on the homeowners not being nutty about parking. (I have, if nothing else, complete faith in the suburbanite ability to turn minor parking annoyances into apocalyptic threats to all they hold dear and precious.) That said it is, barring outliers, a great idea if you choose the location wisely.

  Drive it into deep water at night, or leave it deep in the wilderness as far away from the road it gets before getting stuck, and bring a bike in it. If the sizes work out so that can be a motorized bike, it might also count as the second vehicle.

  Are you sure we're not helping you commit an *actual* crime? ;)

  If I might offer a late entry to the mix. Buy a tarp for cars, bring the car to someplace semi-public pull into a driveway for a house that has a for rent sign. If you can manage it talk to the person you of the building for rent if you could rent the place for a few days and cover the vehicle with the tarp. Call for a taxi or take a bus or other form of public transportation. The tarp stops the car from being readily id'd and stops most people from lifting the tarp to see what is under it. Rent is a lot cheaper than buying a house outright, even for one month. Pay in cash and you are almost untraceable as you can get. The person you rent the house from might be able to ID you but for the short term you are golden.
