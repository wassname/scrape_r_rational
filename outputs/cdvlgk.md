## Rational fiction audiobooks/podcasts?

### Post:

Hey everyone! I'm looking for good rational fiction in audio format.

I know there are podcasts reading HPMOR, Worm, first few chapters of Pokemon, and now Mother of Learning. Is there anything else I'm unaware of? What other books beloved by this subreddit have audio versions?

  Try [Crystal Society](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1958.).

  The story is what Inside Out would have been if it looked inside the mind of an AI. I love how the book explores that concept.

  If you're listening to Worm you might be interested in the audiobooks for [Pact](http://www.mediamdpodcast.com/feed/podcast/pact-audiobook) and [Twig](http://audiotwig.dauber.kim/).

  In non-Wildbow works, [The Metropolitan Man](http://www.hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705) has an audiobook version, but I haven't listened to any of it myself.

    Thanks! I wasn't aware of this.

    I did love Metropolitan Man. I was short enough to just read it as it was.

  Friendship is Optimal is on YouTube in a few forms e.g.,  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FUZfnC--scCq2spqHEtF3v56Aq7rdoL

  Are you interested in how the rational authors get you to react or enjoy the stories? The Rationally Writing podcast breaks down various aspects of writing, how to make things work in writing, all with examples of popular works. Itâ€™s very well done. I love listening.
