## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  There exist a multitude of magical methods to [speak with plants](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-plants/) and [animals](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/speak-with-animals/). All evidence points towards plants and animals having sentience. It is soon widely (though not universally) agreed that eating plants and animals is unethical; similar to how the idea of eating dogs, cats, or dolphins is currently perceived.

  Exceptions to both the magic and ethical objection include fruits, fungi, algae, microbes, and animal products like eggs, milk, and honey. Most "vermin" are also exceptions, including all insects, arachnids, gastropods, and nematodes. Note however that nuts and seeds are widely viewed as ethically unacceptable for consumption, even though they haven't (yet) grown enough to be communicated with via any magic.

  * What does the diet and agricultural system of this setting look like? How do people get adequate nutrition?

  * How do people get textiles, dyes, cooking/heating fuel, or construction materials?

  * What would likely be some common dishes in this setting?

  * What is the view towards herbivores or carnivores - for example is it ethical to raise sheep for wool and milk even if they eat grass?
  ```

    Yeah, in the absence of ways to magically produce non-sentient nutrition, most of the world decides to abandon privileging sentient life in their ethical systems, and we see a world very different from the one we know.
    ```

    - u/Norseman2:
      ```
      There are a few magical ways to produce non-sentient nutrition:

      * [Stone to flesh:](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/stone-to-flesh/) A 3' diameter 10' long cylinder of stone can be transmuted into "a fleshy substance." The texture, flavor, and nutritional value would probably be similar to spam. It's a somewhat high level spell, so roughly only one in 31,000 people are able to cast it, though they could all cast this at least daily. The spell yields about 70 cubic feet of flesh, or roughly 4,170 pounds of product.

      * [Create food and water:](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/create-food-and-water/) This provides enough food to feed three people for a day per spellcaster level. It's a third-level spell, and roughly 1 in 200 people can cast it at least daily, and each of them would be able to feed at least 15 people when they do.

      * [Dream feast:](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dream-feast/) This can feed one person when cast. It's a 1st-level spell, and roughly 1 in 26 people can cast it at least daily.

      Taken together, these could easily provide about 25% of the nutritional needs of the population. If the spellcasters were tasked (or paid) to provide 100% of the world's food requirements, they would likely be able to do it, though it would take away a lot of their ability to use spells for other purposes like healing, teleportation, divination, etc.

        I can see a few 'ethical eating' communities forming around high-level spellcasters, but I can't see this sort of thing catching on beyond that. (The communities themselves will be short-lived, because they - for obvious reasons - collapse almost instantly once the spellcaster dies or leaves them).

        Some of them will be pretty much cults - and the spellcasters will often require heavy fees (up to and including "everything you own"). The result of this is that said communities would probably be looked down on by the wider world.
        ```

    I'm gonna be honest, this scenario seems like an existential nightmare. Given that it was the case, I can only imagine that the response of many people, rather than to find ways around the murder/mass slaughter of thousands or millions of sapients, would be to deny that sapience in the first place, or ignore/purposefully try not to think about it (considering that's a common enough way of tackling sources of existential dread in our world, as far as I'm aware). I mean, there's already plenty of human death in our world which could theoretically be avoided with minimal to moderate changes to lifestyle (for example, everyone decides to research diamond companies so that they can avoid buying blood diamonds), but... it's not the case that people do that. Because there's too much suffering to tackle every bit of the problem with alterations to lifestyles. Outrage fatigue plays a part in this, and I can only imagine that it must be more prevalent in this created world as well.

    But let's presume that people still try their best, because I like the optimistic spin, and happy stories make me happy. Stone and its derivatives (concrete, metal from ore, and so on) seem relatively okay, with the initial problem being the initial harvest. One work around the 'wood is immoral to harvest/farm' issue could be a funeral culture of harvesting the bodies of the dead so that they may provide in death as they did in life. Animals have their meat eaten and their bones turned into glue, trees have their wood forged into tools and houses, and so on, but this is treated very respectfully, perhaps with a culture of 'death-smiths' and related profession surrounding it. Most of these products would presumably be rare, valuable, and precious to their owners on a sentimental level.

    Coral reefs could theoretically be a source of concrete and decoration, if I remember correctly. They're made of polyps, which while animals, *might* be vermin depending on how you define it. If that is the case, then coral reefs could be an excellent source of material, and potentially dye? I'm not sure if dyes can be garnered from them, but if it is the case, then that might work.

    Silk would be even more valuable than normal. Not only can it be farmed entirely from 'vermin' creatures (silk-worms) but if you altered their diet a bit, you could have them be fungivores or carnivores. Interestingly, with the distinctions you make between vermin and larger animals, the existence of carnivorous insects is more moral than the existence of herbivorous ones (since while herbivorous insects eat the sapient plants, the carnivorous insects only eat the non-sapient herbivorous insects, with a few exceptions). This would have an interesting effect on the cultural perceptions of some of these vermin compared to earth, I think - caterpillars and butterflies being seen as sinful, empty plagues, while spiders are more of a heroic defence system by the earth to defend its inhabitants. Tailor this to your personal choice, of course, but I think it's an interesting route to explore.

    Fuel is a tricky one. If you have magic, then maybe an 'eternal flame' style of spell could be used, to burn without the need for wood or charcoal. It also creates the interesting aesthetic of towns clustered around magical fires, while living in the wilderness is immoral or dangerous depending on the individual. Perhaps government wizards go around fruit orchards, fungi fields, or insect farms on the outskirts of the nation to provide newly built settlements additional flames as required. This, of course, makes a lot of assumptions about your magic system, but I can't imagine an easy non-magical method off the top of my head, save for perhaps some strange flammable algae I'm not aware of.

    Shelter is an important note. Because it's so much harder to produce morally, I could certainly see more communal housing being a thing. Also, perhaps cave homes? I can imagine people taking over natural caverns as a community and then civilising them, hobbit hole style, to reduce the need for building materials.

    That's all I can think of right now, but I hope it helps you build this terrifying experience!

    I agree with others that this world would just evolve different morality and find ways to psycholically distance from the suffering.  Most people on our earth eat meat from pretty obviously conscious beings with very little cognitive dissonance.  If grass was literally sentient there's no way you'd survive while trying to tiptoe around killing
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Pigs are smarter than dogs, so the whole premise that we currently abhor the slaughter for consumption of sentient beings is flawed.
      ```

      - u/wren42:
        ```
        Yeah. Best case I could see is some sort of native american "respect the natural cycle" system where care is given to keep things as unexploited as possible and honor prey.  Worst case is murder factories where the sin is outsourced and everyone ignores the issues.
        ```

  - u/vanillafog:
    ```
    If technology has advanced far enough by the time this discovery is made, [cellular agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_agriculture) could replace raising live plants and animals. Meat grown from cell culture is presumably non-sentient as long as you're not growing brains. Whether a specific plant product can be ethically cultured depends on which parts of a plant are required for sentience. If you grow a log of wood in a vat, does it become sentient? What about a lettuce leaf?
    ```

    - u/Norseman2:
      ```
      Meat or wood grown in a cell culture would avoid sentience. It might exceed the 1700s-era technology level of the setting, but magic might be able to facilitate it or offer a similar approach.

      Whole lettuce leaves would probably be an issue. In real-life, [plant communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_communication) can be carried out with volatile organic compounds emitted by glands found on leaves, and received by receptors on the leaves of other plants. This can be used to warn nearby plants about danger, like crop-eating pests, and induce those plants to secrete compounds that would kill or repel pests, or else substances which would attract insects that would eat the pests. I haven't sifted through research on lettuce to see what's known about the extent of communication and response that lettuce leaves are capable of, but given a setting with magical lettuce that can hold a conversation, I suspect whole leaves would be too much of the plant.
      ```

  - u/meangreenking:
    ```
    There is a good argument that the spell merely makes animals/plants smart enough to speak and hold an intelligent conversation temporarily, not that they are inherently smart enough to do so. Presumably, this (or another justification) is the tune most people and cultures would take when the alternative is starving to death or admitting that you and everyone in your family is a ruthless mass murderer.

    That said, I do think a good answer to this would be breeding feed  "animals" that don't count as animals for the purposes of the spell, so while obviously our world has no reason to breed massive insects or spiders presumably they would have spent thousands of years doing just that.
    ```

  - u/plutonicHumanoid:
    ```
    Re: your last point, kinda gives the premise a very shaky foundation. If nearly everything is sentient then why should humans set different standards than everyone else? Just increasing living standards should be enough. Maybe it could be figured out which animals cause the least suffering in what they eat and those could be farmed. 

    Why no nuts or seeds? Can you still eat seeds as part of something else, like a strawberry?

    Algae vats would be viable if the infrastructure already exists.

    There’s going to be a weird intermediary period where people have to keep eating sentient life, that’ll be interesting.
    ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    Given that this references DnD, I assume this is the kind of magical world where Ents also exist, and the trees can talk to each other? In that case, it seems the only thing remotely close to ethical is to kill of all herbivorous and omnivorous animalia, living of their flesh for a short while but eventually dooming all the carnivores to starvation as well. During this intermediate time, do a bunch of research to  make sure all the animals (except for strict pollinators, probably mainly bees) are realy dead and will stay dead, try to expand and supply the ent population with tools to deal with any unforeseen complications or resurgence of animals, etc. Might want to spend some resources transferring knowledge and culture to the trees as well. As the ents, hopefully they'll make sure to maximally promote healthy trees and minimize shorter-lived plants. The ideal outcome here is the only living things on the planet are trees and ents (and needed non-sentient symbiotes like bacteria and mycorrhizal fungus and pollinators), that all have no frustrated needs or desires except occasionally the weather, and live for many centuries.

    In this situtation, the most ethical action is to carpet nuke the planet holy shit

  Wanted to share and get some feedback on my interpretation of the Pokémon universe, I feel like this interpretation solves most of the issues cannon has while still holding the sprit of the world:

  Pokémon are **aliens**. The Pokémon world is pretty much our world but which Pokémon appeared whatever number of years ago in from "somewhere else" (where and how exactly is not that important, you can make something rational along the lines of; arceus ported them over or Pokémon were originally just Mew with transform and became all the Pokémon we see now, or other shenanigans with the legendries, Noas arc style reality destruction, w/e). Also Pokemon are **energy beings.** As in, they are made from some sifi/magic shenanigans, and differentiate from humans and earth animals because they aren't fully physical. (I think from a more detailed perspective they could be something like a "projection" on the physical world, but practically they are as physical as anything else other than 1) pokeballs and 2) they can't die that easily (if they have blood/organs at all which can depend on the setting). 

  I feel like a setting like this fixes all the issues current interpretations have such as:  
  \- Do animals exist? (yes)   
  \- What is meat, do Pokémon eat each other? (maybe but they don't have to, nor do humans - but their "projections" are just as real as anything else so CAN be eaten -see: slowpoke tails)  
  \- How do pokeballs work? (Pokémon are energy beings)  
  \- Why can't you use the same space tech for anything else? (Because they are all purely matter - UNLESS, a possible "technological advancement" could be simulating Pokémon's nature with other things, this could make items which can specifically be held in containers with this "special matter" such as bikes, but humans will still not be able to use it.)  
  \- Why are Pokémon based on Animals/Human items? (If we go with some sort of scenario where Pokémon are created in some way, they would obviously mimic their environment. Or, since they are malleable as being made of energy at the core, they could "adapt")  
  \- If Pokémon are intelligent (which they can be) isn't this slavery? (Yes, but you can add some things with Pokémon largely not being against following trainers cos alien mindsets. - Or, one I like a lot which is the interpretation the story "dreaming of family" uses; for whatever reason Pokémon just get stronger when with a trainer, and most join willfully; they also have instincts which make them want to get stronger in the first place, and enjoy battling but are otherwise treated like family by most trainers.)   
  \- Why are tiny kids going on Pokémon Journeys? (This setting I feel would make the world safer in some ways but more dangerous in others; humans (and kids) would still be walking around with nukes in their pockets but there wouldn't be much reason for wild Pokémon to attack people; so a journey into the wild like this to have kids cultivate their own personal strength actually makes much more sense to me.)  
  \- What are pokemon moves/types? (Moves/types can be made possible by this same "energy", and this can also explain all the resistances/immunities/super effectiveness of types, with types being different types of energy a Pokémon is made up off/uses. This can explain matter-out-of-nothing and all the other shenanigans of the Pokémon universe which make no sense)  


  So what do you guys think? And if you like it, feel free to use any of this for your Pokémon fanfics- I love them XD.

    You make them sound like the protrusions into out universe of hgher-dimensional beings. Like the mice in Hitchhiker's Guide, but more energy-based.
