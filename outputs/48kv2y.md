  The reason you don't know about time traveling civilizations is because time travel allows them to enter/discover/create closed (but infinite) universe where they're the only effective civilization*, and given the insanity of the rest of the DC multiverse this is the only rational action for a sane civilization that cares about its long term survival.

  And because of time travel, its impossible to observe. As soon as they escape the multiverse, they retroactively make it always have been that way. The only way for this process to fail is for them to prevent the invention of time travel in the first place (by accident or design).

  The signs of successful time traveling civilizations are places where you would expect an advanced civilization to have developed, but it inexplicably never happened.

  [The linked post](#s "Note that *entropy* just refers to a powerful antagonist brought into being, not the physical concept. Although ") [Wiki](#s "that one seems to be caused by his punishment for time-travelling. What his time travel caused is that there's a multiverse rather than a universe.")

    No, Krona's interference is literally responsible for the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Or evil. Or the Antimatter Universe, where narrativium is reversed and the heroes always lose. [Or something](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--yD6I7o_c--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/18j2pz7ymrt1djpg.jpg). 

    It varies with every telling, really, but "entropy" is the one the fans have latched onto.

    I don't think it's ever been an enemy, though. You're probably thinking of the time Krona returned from the dead as a supervillain called Entropy.
