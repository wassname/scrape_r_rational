## [Q] Rational "Life is a Game" fics? (aka "the video game plot)

### Post:

I really enjoy the video game plot (e.g. "The Gamer", "The Games We Play", "Naruto:Ramen Days") and have read enough of them that I've having trouble finding new ones.  Does anyone have any suggestions that they particularly like?

      This is actually what got me to ask. I just blitzed the entire story in...24?...48?...very few hours. Really enjoyed it, and was sorry when it ran out. 

      Out of curiosity, do you have a reader-viewable timeline anywhere? I'm not clear on how long Juniper has been in-world, but I think it's only 2-3 weeks, even counting the downtime week they just had.

        The erogamer, which is really funny, and takes the implications of the premise shockingly seriously. 

        Most of the other example of this particular sub genre I have run across have really unlikable pro-tags, as they start behaving like powergamers while surrounded by people, rather than sprites. So, really, worth the candle and erogamer are it for things I will actually recommend

          Link, please? My Google fu is apparently weak, which is surprising in this case.

            Its a quest, but if you just want the story without the discussion around the voting, just hit the forward arrow on the index.

    Ooooh, I'd seen this posted but it was way down in my list since I didn't realize is was a Life is a Game fic. Bumped to the top. Thanks!
    ```

- u/EliezerYudkowsky:

  You listed some top ones already.  Off the top of my head I can only think to add:

  - I'm a Spider, So What (one of the legendary classics, start with the Blastron01 translation until it runs out, it bogs down after a while so don't feel obliged to keep reading)
  - Evil God Average / Jashin Average, got me on the LN kick that led to GirlIntercorrupted
  - /u/FeepingCreature would tell you to read The Erogamer, and I wouldn't dispute it. Tagline: "This is way more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest."

  EDIT: Like The Gamer and TGWP, these are LitRPG rather than Video Game Plot.

  No particular suggestion, but you might have more luck looking for "litrpg" - a lot of similar stories published under that genre.
  There'll be plenty of bad ones as usual but I'm sure you can find some.

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Ah, neat. I hadn't seen that term before. Thanks!

  If you don't mind NSFW, I was recently pointed to [Dream Drive](https://www.literotica.com/s/dream-drive-ch-01) and found it quite enjoyable. Standard SAO and The Gamer plot but very well-written characters, and of course more logical bent.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Looks well written, yeah, and the primary character is one that I suspect a lot of us could identify with. It dove into the sex a little too fast for me, but I suspect that the author is talented enough to produce good story. Thanks for the rec.

  I also second Log Horizon. One of the few anime titles the plot of which doesn’t turn into a complete mess by the time it reaches the last several episodes. 

  There are also some asian webnovels that you ought to check out:

  * [*Reincarnator*](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/) — “has some repeating tropes, but otherwise is well-written. Protag goes back in time to try saving humanity after a meta-verse merging event.” Unfortunately due to some translator scene drama it’s temporarily unavailable. 
   * [*King of the Battlefield*](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/the-king-of-the-battlefield/) — Except for the fact that it’s a bit too similar to Reincarnator, it’s a pretty decent read.
  * [*Terror Infinity*](http://www.wuxiaworld.com/ti-index/) —  ”[...] is a Chinese web serial that is technically a multi-crossover fanfic. The premise of the story is how a random group of people are forced to travel from one horror \ action movie into another and try to survive each one. Among the universes the protag has to travel through are also those from the following franchises (spoilers): Resident Evil, Alien, Final Destination, Nightmare on Elm Street.”
  * [*Life Mission*](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/life-mission/) — A virtual reality game called “Life” suddenly becomes real, transporting players to alternate dimensions (they don’t know that at first), making it possible to buy items from game store and bring them into real world, enhance their body, etc. The monsters in the game are “mutants”, and the lore suggests that some virus outbreak turned all people into such mutants.  Those who manage to not get infected got killed instead.
  * [*Evolution Theory of the Hunter*](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/evolution-theory-of-the-hunter/) — Dungeons and skillbooks existing in real world; each person can only learn one skillbook.

  All of these (except for maybe Log Horizon) have some penalties attached, for them to be called completely rational stories. But from all the currently available LitRPG stories that I’ve managed to find, these were the only ones that were more or less rational at all.

    Thank you, that's a lot of recs. 

    I have had very mixed results with anime, but in this case I'm really looking more for reading than watching. Still, workout distractions are a necessity, so I'll definitely check out Log Horizon. 

    Reanimator's description sounds really good, so I hope it comes back. I read the first page of KotB and couldn't get past the clumsy translation, but I'm sure it's great in the original. 

    Evolution Theory of the Hunter has a premise that made me laugh happily. Very Nodwick, which is a good thing. The prologue was well done so I'm definitely going to keep going. Thanks very much.

      Log horizon is also a light novel, so you could read one of the translations out there.
      ```

  - u/I_Hump_Rainbowz:
    ```
    Have you read Book Eating Magician? It is pretty well written and translated. Its protag is intelligent and it is about as rational as Log Horizon.

  Prequel Adventure, MSPA (and its prequels), Doki doki literature club, Harry potter and the natural 20, the erogamer, pokemon: the origin of species, 8-bit theater, "goblins" has some game elements, order of the stick.

    Pokemon the Origin of Species is NOT a video game plot btw

  I'm not sure anyone's mentioned it, but uh... [Homestuck](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&p=001901) is one, though... it's *exceedingly* long, be warned. Hilarious writing and crazy-good music, though.

  Check out [Log Horizon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon) The LN translation is significantly behind the anime, but if you're an anime watcher you'll probably love it.

  What's a video game plot?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Someone has their life turn into a video game. They have a character sheet with numeric stats, can mechanically advance their skills through combat, etc.
