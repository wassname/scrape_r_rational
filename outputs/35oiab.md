  I would really like to hear feedback on the conversations in this chapter.  Is anyone being too smart?  Have I handed the idiot ball to anyone that probably didn't deserve it?

  Allen (protagonist) is a marginal level 1 intelligence that sometimes lets his emotions get the better of him, but has (hopefully?) believable flashes of insight.

  Captain Marko and Riko should both be borderline level 2 intelligences with a tendency towards thinking in terms of order.

  Fobi and Lieutenants Baker and Davis should all three be fairly solid level 1 intelligences.  Fobi is far more violence prone than the other two, and has impulse control issues when it comes to dealing with predator type criminals.

  Brad is a solid level 1 intelligence character who is extremely sociopathic and understands violence and how people react to it on a level that none of the rest want to.

  Rikard is a marginal level 1 intelligence with some sociopathic tendencies, but much younger than Brad.

    My opinions on Allen, Marko, and Riko match what you were trying to get across.

    Baker and Davis don't speak and interact with the others enough for me to get a good judgement, but initial impressions are people who are good at their job (in law enforcement, not military where no one in the story is good at it). They seem slightly squeamish, but there are very good reasons for it.

    I wouldn't say that Fobi is borderline sociopathic, but rather have a overdeveloped sense of responsibility for the people under her protection (mostly because of the mama bear comment) and is therefore more aggressive towards people who commit crimes in areas under her watch. I hope you don't make her sociopathic, because having Brad, Riko, and Fobi all be sociopathic as compared to the narrator, Allen, when they make up the group of people with a history of violence makes me think Allen is an unreliable narrator or something slightly odd is off. Making Fobi be someone who has an extremely strong sense of duty and slightly impulsive fits the story much better.

    Brad matches all of the hallmarks of sociopathy except for the charisma. I heard that most sociopaths are very good at talking people into doing what they want which is why it fit Rikard so well. But that can be explained by confinement for roughly two decades from a young age.

    I can't judge anything about Rikard from this chapter since it's mostly body language that I can't interpret very well, but you did present him how you wanted to in previous chapters and nothing is out of character.

    There are some cases of poor thinking, but they all relate to their inability to understand how to best commit violence against another person and I outline some ideas they seem to miss in my comment on the story site.

    TL;DR - You did well with everyone except Fobi who comes off as too impulsive/aggressive rather than sociopathic.

    Yay! a new chapter... It's one of the things I look forward to every week (that and Shadows of the Limelight :-)

    My opinions on the characters matches what you're trying to get across although I would peg Allen as being higher than a marginal level 1 intelligence but without the benefits of experience and with very poor control of his emotions. It feels like he will mature into a borderline level 2 intelligence.

  I'm really enjoying this story.  I'm surprised more people aren't reading it, though I only started a few weeks ago.

  Is Set In Stone any good?

  My exams are over in a fortnight and I'm looking for new reading material.

    In my opinion, it is the best non-fanfic in /r/rational at the moment. (With the caveat that I haven't started Shadows of the Limelight yet, sorry /u/alexanderwales)

    Well, as the writer I'm almost certainly biased.  However, I've posted a link to every chapter (except chapter 2 for some reason that I can't remember) as I've written it, so you can poke through the responses if you like.  I don't start that many threads, so you can look [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/Farmerbob1/submitted/) and see the Set In Stone chapter threads.
