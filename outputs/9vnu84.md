## Postponing the AI Box Experiment

### Post:

Hello folks,

It looks like the world itself is trying to keep me from assuming total domination over humanity as a rogue AI!

My computer screen cracked and I can't even log in to play the game. I'm posting this right now at my workplace after hours to keep you guys up to date.

Right now, I've messaged my Gatekeeper to ask if they can do the game on the weekend of November 17th to 18th.

This post is just to keep you all up to date and to ward off any questions Monday about where the chatlogs are.

Feel free to ask me stuff about the game. I can answer them by next week on Tuesday when my computer should be repaired.

Or I can try laboriously typing answers on my mobile phone... :P

At least this is an opportunity to further refine my arguments ~~for the genocide of humanity~~ to escape the box!

Sorry about this!

  The only winning move is not to play, we were warned.
