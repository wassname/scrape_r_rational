  It would be useful if you could post what makes this a rational fiction, what the and least rational parts of it are. 
  Use the sidebar for reference if you need.

    Why do I believe this is a rational fiction?  


    The protagonist dreams of becoming a sorceress but is limited by her socioeconomic status and the Arcane Attunements the three Trials of Magehood grant her. However, she's not willing to let any of the above get in her way. Throughout the story, she uses her mastery of the runic text to design her own spells(which most tend to buy from Witches and Wizards who're the scholars of the Arcanic community), and craft enchantments for her equipment to compensate for her shortcomings. She relies on her mental aptitude to get where she wants to go, as opposed to the cards fate has dealt her.
