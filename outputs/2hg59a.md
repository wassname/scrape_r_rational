  To those who are sensitive about such things, the first chapter consists of the protagonist repeatedly and graphically committing suicide.

  If you skip forward to chapter two, the actual story starts.

  Edit: later chapters also have a few cases of graphic suicide and nudity.

  Not Safe for kids.

  I caught up to the current comic and added this to my RSS reader. There are a number of things that I'm quite curious about, but will likely be answered later. It's showing the same consideration as Fleep, which is a very good sign.

  Edit: [](#s "The power has unlimited range and works close to instantly, so the plan then is to subdue him and then ... do what? So far as I can see, there isn't a good way to control him. Maybe they'll try to figure out what he wants and then give it to him, but it's not really clear what he wants to me, which means it's certainly not clear to the OSS either. Also, it probably goes without saying, but the main character is a horrific and unrepentant murderer, but that doesn't really stop me from liking him.")

    It's because of the science, isn't it.

    I find it interesting that the author has presented, essentially, the ultimate form of a cluster suicide. Probably won't ever throw any thoughts that direction, but one can hope.
