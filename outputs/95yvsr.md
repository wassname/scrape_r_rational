## Which works contain many level three intelligent characters?

### Post:

I think I've noticed that a lot of fiction will have the main character be level three intelligent, but everyone else around them is lesser.
An obvious example is the TV show House, in which the MC is rarely outsmarted and never for long.
Sherlock Holmes and Artemis Fowl are other obvious examples (if they can be called level three intelligent).
In contrast, HPMOR has at least three obvious level three intelligent characters, (I'm not so sure about dumbledore) all though HP is still demonstrated as being levels above everyone else.

(Worm, Luminosity, The Good Student  and The Arithmancer have a few each, but still treat there main character's as special).

My guess is that this is because level three characters are difficult to get right, and that having everyone else be less smart makes the character stand out.

Are there any works in which intelligence is more of a norm, Where most major characters are demonstrated level two or three?

I've discovered I like "listening" to intelligent people think, and am greedy for more examples.

Thanks.

  Funny you should mention Holmes, because in [the essay where Yudkowsky defines level 3 intelligent characters](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level3intelligent), he specifically points to Sherlock Holmes as a *negative* example:

  >But when you look at what Sherlock Holmes does - you can’t go out and do it at home. Sherlock Holmes is not really operating by any sort of reproducible method. He is operating by magically finding the right clues and carrying out magically correct complicated chains of deduction. Maybe it’s just me, but it seems to me that reading Sherlock Holmes does not inspire you to go and do likewise. Holmes is a mutant superhero.

  The Ender's Shadow series/"Bean Quartet" is pretty good about having a large cast of intelligent characters that have to deal with real challenges using limited resources.  One thing that comes up several times throughout the series are scenarios where two parties have no way to communicate/coordinate, but they manage to arrive at a sort of Schelling point by thinking, "Okay, the person I'm trying to coordinate with is a smart person, so all I have to do right now is think 'what would a smart person do in their situation' and I'll have a pretty good idea of what their plan is and what they need me to do in order for it to succeed."

  In Shadow of the Hegemon, this happens when one person in captivity is trying to communicate messages to the outside world without their captors knowing.  The prisoner has to use a messaging method subtle and hidden enough that the captors won't detect it, and the rescuer has to both locate and decipher that message without ever having been told where to look for it.  Shadow of the Hegemon has three main viewpoint characters, and all of them are intelligent.  There's a similar case in Shadow of the Giant, where one character (who is ostensibly an honored guest, but is actually little more than a glorified prisoner) has to "communicate" his escape plan to the rescuer in plain view of the captors -- of course, because he's being watched, the only "communication" that really takes place here is "you're here at my behest, now figure out what I want you to do," and the rescuer has to deduce the fact that the prisoner is actually being held against his will, that he has a plan for escape, and the plan's nature soon becomes evident when answering the question "what plan would I devise if I were a captive smart person trying to coordinate with another smart person?"

  One of the other things that the Bean Quartet is also good about doing is showing how intelligent characters can still have epistemic blind spots (usually places where they rely too heavily on heuristics), and then showing how they go about recognizing and overcoming those blind spots, and also diagnosing how they developed those blind spots to avoid repeating similar patterns of thinking in the future.  So in that sense, there's actually a sense of "learning to be smarter," rather than simply being a story of "smart people doing smart things," even though the characters are all really intelligent to begin with. Another theme of the books is that being a rational person does not make you immune to irrational impulses, even when you recognize that those impulses are irrational.  For example, knowing "it would be irrational for me to gloat right now" does not magically remove your desire to gloat, and knowing the methods of psychological warfare that your captors are using against you does not magically make you immune to the psychological torment. The characters are smart, and a big part of being smart is trying to figure out how to deal with the limitations of being human.

  I don't think any of the characters you cited are level 3 intelligent, by EZ's definition. At best they're level 2. (and EZ's description of level 3 intelligent was kind of vague, actually).

  *Animorphs The Reckoning* and *Glimwarden* are often cited as having multiple protagonists with different perspective, who are all just as important, smart and interesting. Unfortunately, both of them are in hiatus right now.

  Trying to do this with *Pokemon*, hopefully somewhat successfully? Let me know if not, if you've tried it :)

  *Animorphs: The Reckoning* fits this too.

    !Animorphs is so so so good. I love it.

    I haven't tried Pokemon yet, mostly because I'm unfamiliar with the franchise.
    However I've heard good enough things about it that I might pick it up anyway.

    Would you recommend this to someone without knowledge of cannon?

      The main confusion will likely be from pokemon descriptions: I barely describe any of them, so you may have to google them if you want a picture. Other than that and some inside jokes and references, everything else should be accessible :)

      Sure, just look up the premise and setting of Pokemon (Red and Blue versions specifically, if that comes up in your research) and then read with Bulbapedia open in an adjacent tab, ready to look up anything that sounds like a DnD monster or has "Poké" in the name.

    Pretty much everyone acts rationally in that story. Even the guys you think act according to a trope only do it when they see no negative side effects of doing so.
    (Examples of that include: The Crazy Teacher, The Shonen Protagonist, The Overly Strict Mother, and whatever the hell Taiven is.)
    ```

      ```
      I think Taiven is [Genki Girl](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenkiGirl) but with a little more character depth than you normally see in Genki Girls.
      ```

      - u/Caliburn0:
        ```
        That seems to fit her as well. Although perhaps not to the extent of what is described on that page.

        The time loop has currently a limited number of months left, then there would be what happens after the loops are finished. I wouldn't estimate a long time left in the story through updates come every couple weeks or so.
        ```

      - u/Caliburn0:
        ```
        If the updates continue at this pace? I would estimate about half a year. Although it is difficult to say.

      According to [Mother of Learning's TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MotherOfLearning), Taiven is the  [Boisterous Bruiser](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoisterousBruiser).

    I have tried it, and liked it a lot.
    The only issue is I stopped a few dozen chapters in, and it's now very hard to find my place because of the looping.

    Planning to wait until it's finished.

    I also enjoyed The Good Student, for similar reasons to Mother Of Learning, but am waiting for that to be completed too.


    I agree with your thoughts on House, most of his "insites" were based on weird coincidences.
    And now I think about it, most of his commentary is Straw manning.

  ```
  The Wheel of Time series has many characters who I think fit the description. Then again there are literally over a hundred characters you need to keep track of over the series, so I guess it's a numbers game at that point. At least a few of them needed to be highly inteligent and competent.
  ```

  - u/GCU_JustTesting:
    ```
    Sorry. None of the wheel of time characters can even think about what another person might be thinking about. They are almost all frustratingly stupid.
