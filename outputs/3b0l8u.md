## [FF] Any rationalistic superhero fanfics out there?

### Post:

I'd prefer Batman or Superman in a rationalist setting (and I'd prefer their characterizations stay as close to the normal as possible; I like Batman's no-kill rule, for instance.) Any suggestions?

I already know of the Metropolitan Man.

Edit: I've also read Worm.

        Yes. Zoat is insane. 1.5k words, every night, for over a year now.

        I've read the entire story, and can second the recommendation.

      >the fic is very well integrated into Earth-16 as a whole. 

      Huh, it's actually set in an established continuity?  I had thought it was in a new one that the author created for the story.
      ```

      - u/Geminii27:
        ```
        The continuity diverges gradually due to the actions of the protagonist (and the butterfly effect), but it starts out canon (or very close to it).
        ```

      - u/clawclawbite:
        ```
        No, it is based on the Young Justice TV show, with other DC inspiring some blanks, and enough character instigated divergence that I don't expect a close follow of season 2.

      Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

      In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

      Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

      “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

      The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

      Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

      Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

      L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

        Sometimes Zoat comments on plot (future or current) in those threads. For example, he mentions other versions of the SI who are in other universes and who will eventually be crossing over and meeting each other, what the thread has been calling the Crisis of Infinite Pauls.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          Expanding on /u/JackStargazer's comment -- when Zoat comments on other Paul's in other dimensions, those comments take the form of short stories. There's a whole "blue lantern" thing that I wish he'd do more of -- ideally in preference to Renegade. 

          Oh, that's another thing to be aware of. He's doing two stories in parallel. The main one is about Paragon!Paul, the SI, where he's a good guy who makes allies. His story entries start with orange text. There's a side story about Renegade!Paul. He's a good guy...sort of? Also an utter asshat. Everyone in the thread (almost) *really* wants to see him fall on his face.  His story entries start with red, except for the current arc which is all about him so he's the default. 

          I mention this because if you're reading the story only thread you'll be baffled why occasionally Paul does something and then time drops back a few minutes and he does it again in a different and more asshat-ish way.
          ```

          - u/JackStargazer:
            ```
            The current arc also is going to be following Renegade primarily - while I don't like him nearly as much as !ParagonPaul, I tolerate him in his worst for moments when he gives his much needed The Reason You Suck Speeches. 

            The main issue with Renegade so far is that he hasn't failed at anything. In fact, outside of ParagonPaul having a higher maximum power level due to his [Spoiler](#s "Fusion with and becoming the Agent for the Ophidian, the Elemental Embodiment of Avarice - basically a medium-sized godlike entity"), Renegade's asshatishness has gotten equal or better results in almost every single mission he's been on before the last arc, where he missed out on a huge technological breakthrough bigtime by being needlessly antagonistic. 

            This has mostly, I think, been due to the fact that we only see Renegade in short violent bursts, doing the things he is best at doing - overwhelming force applied massively, very quickly - and nothing majorly subtle, which is ParagonPaul's forte. 

            Hopefully, with a whole arc, we will be able to see things for once not going perfectly for our Anti-Hero. I don't think he's been quite the Karma Houdini others in the thread seem to, but he's certainly due to a comeuppance. 

            Personally, I suspect that at some point he's going to go off the edge after somehow [Spoiler](#s "Losing Jade").

  [Fall of doc future](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) More rational than rationalist but with enough physics porn especially in the cresendo of *Skybreaker's Call* (book 2) to make it worth your while.

    Seconding *Fall of Doc Future*.

    I based The Volunteer from The Fall of Doc Future and the sequels partly on the Golden Age Superman (he started in 1938, so he's getting rather old) and partly on The Samaritan from Astro City--who was also based on Superman.  He isn't a viewpoint character in the first book, but he gets a bit more time in Skybreaker's Call.

  [Inviolate]( https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate) by scrivener. There's even an [audiobook version] (http://archiveofourown.org/works/2658290) Not really rational, some informed abilities, but still a fun read. 

  I've suggested it before, people keep shooting it full of holes as to why it's not ratfic, don't care, still awesome.

    I second this. Really good series although, sadly, seems to be abandoned. There's a fair amount of it though, and it ends at an acceptable point.

      It's not abandoned, though a combination of writer's block and going back to college HAS put a crimp in my writing. I hope to publish the next chapter before summer ends.

        Good to hear.  You should post a note to that effect, with a specific date.  It will give your audience something concrete and it will help with your motivation.

  You could ask about [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/parahumans).

  There's also The Gotham Man which is sorta-kinda this, except without actual superheroes; it's a audience-chooses-plot-fork story where Bruce Wayne isn't crazy enough to dress up like a bat and decides to be effective doing good instead. Google isn't showing me the link, but it's been here a few times. 

  I also have an original rational superhero series on Amazon right now, "The Change Storms". The premise is "what would society look like if superpowers were real, and contagious?"  It will eventually become rationalist, but that's in the next book. [First one is here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00XER9MPA?ie=UTF8&redirectFromSS=1&pc_redir=T1&noEncodingTag=1&fp=1)  if you want it. (They're on Amazon, so obviously, they are not free.)

  How to Succeed in Evil is pretty interesting, a little before Rationalist Fiction took off, but it mostly follows the rules.
