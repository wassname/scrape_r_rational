  Oh, by the way everyone, I need to own up:  /u/drageuth2 was the one who came up with the idea for black-hole-time-dilating Neklos out of the way. I just figured out how to make it not-suicidal.  I had forgotten to add the attribution, but it's up now. 

  *bow to the master*
  ```

  - u/drageuth2:
    ```
    To be fair, the black hole plan I came up with was more convoluted, more dangerous, and designed for _Afi_.  I would have never thought to try it against a god.  You've taken a decent idea and turned it into a completely brilliant one, so you deserve just as much credit!
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      What *was* your original idea, anyway?  I forget.  I just remembered that you had proposed this idea with a black hole, but not the details.  I think it was in [this old thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2a2vrk/q_if_you_were_jake_in_the_two_year_emperor_what/) but I couldn't find it.
      ```

      - u/drageuth2:
        ```
        I think the meat of it was to get Afi into a dimension-locked portable hole, PAO a singularty into it, and then close the hole before the gravity from the singularity reaches the entrance via a readied action.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          Ah.  So, basically this, then.
          ```

          - u/drageuth2:
            ```
            Basically, but my way leaves you with a hazardous portable hole that has to be disposed of, lest someone opens it and destroys the world.  And Neklos can probably get Afi out, whereas your way _takes care of Neklos directly_ and no other gods are gonna intervene on his behalf.  The good ones won't touch him, and the evil ones would rather take over his schemes for their own purposes.
            ```

  So is Suzy the most powerful mortal on the planet? I mean she did beat one if not the most powerful god in the universe even if she didnt kill him, that at least should give her a collosal level up. By the way does anyone know how much experience one would get by beating a god?

    I'm pretty sure the answer is "All of it".

  ***Woah.*** GOAT move Suze. Not quite sure how they survived, or what the hell that thing was that she flicked at Neklos, but this might be the most excited I've ever been for a new chapter.

  And where are the others? Were Suze and Jake the only survivors from that room?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    GOAT move?

    They survived because Suze totally speedbagged the rules.  Specifically, here's what she did:

    1. Pull a spell component from her pouch. (free action, takes zero time)
    1. Cast Plane Shift (standard action, you only get one per round)
    1. Cast Celerity (immediate action, provides a readied action to cast another spell)
    1. Using that readied action, cast PAO to create a black hole.

    The way readied actions work is that they interrupt another action zero time before that action happens. Because of this, a series of actions and readied actions resolves last-to-first.  So, here's what actually happened:

    1. The PAO went off, creating a black hole which would have trapped them in time dilation (which is what happened to Neklos)...
    1. Zero time later, the Plane Shift went off, dragging Suze and Jake (whom she was holding on to) out of the room and back to the Prime Material...
    1. Zero time later, as they were in the middle of Plane Shifting, she threw a piece of antimatter into the room.

    Where did the AM come from?  Well, every wizard has a [spell component pouch](http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Spell_Component_Pouch).  "[A] spell component pouch is assumed to [contain] all the material components and focuses needed for spellcasting, except for those components that have a specific cost, divine focuses, and focuses that wouldnâ€™t fit in a pouch. "

    The material component for the spell [Major Creation](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/majorCreation.htm) (which is based off of [Minor Creation](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/minorCreation.htm) and therefore has the same material component) is "A tiny piece of matter of the same sort of item you plan to create"  So, if you want to use Major Creation to produce antimatter, that means that your spell component pouch somehow contains antimatter...but hasn't blown up because *rules*.  A spell component pouch isn't magical, so it wasn't disrupted by the Disjunctions that the heroes were hit with back in the Receiving Room.

    The reason for the AM was to destroy the gems that were trapping everyone's souls (and material bodies), and then to destroy those material bodies.  With them dead, they can be resurrected from outside the hole.

    Neklos isn't dead, and he will Plane Shift out of the black hole and back to the Prime Material next round.  Of course, what he thinks of as "next round" will be several trillion years (or more) in the outside universe....


    EDIT:  I should have mentioned:  the reason she was able to do all this before Neklos could do anything was because she caught him in a [surprise round](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/initiative.htm).  He wasn't aware that she was a combatant, so he was caught flat-footed and unable to take any actions.

      GOAT: Greatest of All Time

      For some reason, in my first read-through, I totally missed the colons in that phrase. Now it makes sense. Thanks for the extra explanation, too: that "Zero time later" interruption thing is extremely abusable. Glad to see it used well.

      Gods can't time travel, right? Neklos is gonna be *pissed*.

      Amazingly thought-out, as usual. Thanks for another fantastic chapter, based /u/eaglejarl!

        Nope.  

        >Neklos is gonna be pissed.

        And he's welcome to tell the great(3||||||3)-grandchildren of the Big Damn Heroes all about it.  :>

          > 3||||||3

          Assuming those are supposed to be up arrows... I think that's an exaggeration. I mean, it's gonna be a long time, but that's a *really really really really really really* big number you posted there, at least when it comes to generational timescales.

        The point was exactly to get rid of his soul.  His soul is permanently bonded to the Godshard, which gives Neklos power over him.  He had no way of getting the shard out on his own, and no way to get rid of his soul completely.  Basically what he did was to make a lifeboat for himself by copying himself into a different body, then destroying the original one.  The new one has no soul and so it can't regenerate at the phylactery the way Afi can.  In fact, it can't heal *at all*, without the help of a complicated ritual that requires lab tools.  Still, it's better than being permanently under Neklos's thumb.

        Best of all, Neklos is *absolutely certain* that Afi is dead; Afi's soul is sitting right there in his hand, after all.  He'll never bother looking for a copy of Afi elsewhere.

      That all probably needs to be in the author's notes somewhere.

      Well done!

      Well that was super well thought out. I'm wondering if Suze is going to end up Empress in ~1.5 years. But I have the dreaded feeling that she's going to get too close to ascending at some point into the goddess of badassary and the other Gods erasing her before it happens. 

      Also kind of wishing that Suze was called Suzy instead. Then we could have gotten the line "Suzy do that thing!" before kicking Neklos into next week.
      ```

        > Well that was super well thought out.

        Thanks.  You have *no idea* how much time I spent figuring out all the little fiddly bits on that.

        > "Suzy do that thing!" 

        I don't recognize the reference and my Google-fu is failing.  Explain, please?

  Hmm. Death was just defeated through the proper use of secrets and knowledge.

  It looks like the new goddess is really working for them...
  ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  So. [spoiler] (#s "Suze DID go through the FLEJA! And then it was purposefully kept from people! Plans within plans were the obvious choice, with their own memories erased. Likely Programmed Amnesia on Suze to allow her to act here. I know they weren't all dumb enough to believe that they wouldn't be Mindscraped upon entering Afi's lair.")

  [spoiler] (#s "My question then is: what about the souls of the rest? A trapped soul is still Dead after all those explosions. They need to be resurrected now even if the traps were annihilated.")
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Suze:  yep.  :>

    The others:  see my big long response to seraphnb below.
    ```

- u/Solonarv:
  ```
  Quite the *Mindscrape* abuse there.

  That's a really large singularity, isn't an event horizon with a radius of [~20 AU](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=schwarzschild+radius+for+1+billion+solar+masses) a bit much?

  I am, as always, suitably impressed.
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    Yeah, I'm not seeing how that didn't just implode the whole pl....

    Wait a minute. Plane Shift. They were on a demiplane. Afi's base is on its own demiplane.

    They just effectively annihilated it. 

    And that didn't kill Neklos right away, because if it did he would have seen it coming weeks in advance.

    But when you are that close to an event horizon **time slows down.**

    So if Neklos can see death 20 weeks in advance, the time dilation on that plane, within METERS of a 1 billion solar mass singularity must be on the order of millions to one at least. Anything inside there won't die - to the perspective of the outside multiverse - for centuries, even maybe millennia.

    And the osmium, that was through FIRST, before the singularity took effect. So it will destroy the gems, and perhaps sever Death's hand, but not kill him. 

    Then the time dilation hits. The Plane Shift was part of the defining action, which Celerity was used in response to, so the Celerity effect happens a plank time length before the responding effect. That's not enough time for the gravity waves or time dilation to propagate to Suze/Jake, so they escape before it takes hold.

    Jesus, this is a convoluted combination of real world physics and D&D magic action economy manipulation.

    **Bravo.**

    Well, it's trapped inside an extradimensional space, so it won't actually be that big.  (And it won't affect the outside world.)

    As to why so big...it's to make sure that it doesn't evaporate anytime soon.  Probably wouldn't matter anyway, but Jake [REALLY wanted](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill) [to be sure](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheOnlyWayToBeSure).

      For the record, a 1-solar-mass black hole has a radius of about [3km](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=schwarzschild+radius+for+1+solar+mass) and takes 2 * 10^67 years to evaporate, which is 1.5 * 10^57 time the age of the universe.

      1 billion solar masses evaporate in 2 * 10^94 years, or 15 * 10^84 universes.

      One solar mass *might* have been enough, but you can never quite be sure :D
