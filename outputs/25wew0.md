## [D] Why don't we add religion to rationalist fiction?

### Post:

For any rational character, or rationally-minded society, it would provide a greater amount of conflict within the story. It could also open-up a broader audience as a way of appealing to people unfamiliar with our valued ideals. Attempting to ignore the impact of religion seems to dismiss the general public as a whole and - to a certain degree - foreign cultures. 

Moreover, many of the enjoyable parts of Yudokowsky's author tract fanfic "Methods of Rationality" has Rationalist Harry talking to Dumbledore about the flawed ideas of souls and an afterlife. 

Side note: it would probably be better to not attempt to strawman religious believers in their emotional capacity so that they don't feel it's scornful to their beliefs. I'm actually trying to do that with the novel that I've been writing after observing several Atheist Vs. Religious debates. It's actually quite fun making-up your own religion for a fictional setting. I can see why GRRM and JRRT did so in their stories.

  Fictional Deconstructions of religions are stories in which religions are true, or the evidence claimed by religions actually exists and then the most obvious God corresponding to these is inferred.  These can be helpful for breaking loose religious people from the trance of carefully not considering implications.

  E.g., writing a story about a hard-labouring Egyptian mother with no political power, wailing over the crib of her firstborn son.

  Some of the most effective atheistic material, I suspect, is by Terry Pratchett for similar reasons.

  I've advocated that serious rationalists need to stop paying attention to atheism after a certain point, because after a certain point atheism becomes bad practice for handling difficult questions; atheism is not difficult and trains you to think that rationality is always easy and that bad ideas are always obvious.

    If you define atheism as the lack of belief in god/s I don't see how it would help in handling *any* questions.

  The problem I have with invented religions in fiction  is that the author is completely free to make the religion true with hardly any repercussions for the story. Terry Pratchett plays around with this by having the gods be very definitely real and very definitely interfering with the mortals. It's hard to be an atheist in those worlds, because there is actual evidence for the gods. 

  On a more more meta level, it's not very useful to have gods in rationalist!fiction because it's often about celebrating the capabilities of *mere* mortals (and sometimes about more or less building a god). Including existing gods (especially of the omnipotent type) makes the actions of the protagonists mean less if the author isn't careful.

  Because it's boring. Religion and faith have already been gone over so many times, that they're often used as *the* epitome of irrationality. It's just so easy to dismantle religion (dude, do you even solomonoff?); any argument with religion would be mostly one-sided (unless of course you're writing a story where gods *do* exist). So writers focus on lesser known examples of irrationality instead.

  If, on the other hand, you are talking about world building, the people who write rational fiction tend to interact with 'rational' people. This group *tends* to take not believing in a god as a given, and sometimes have to do a double take when they remember that people actually *do* believe these things. If they don't mention religion in their stories, or it is only part of the background, that is because that is the way it is for *them* in real life.

  If you want an example of a rationalist story about religion i'd point you to [Hell is the Absence of God](http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/hell.html).

    That's not nearly as easy as you make it sound.  `K(x)` is incomputable, any approximation can be biased, and the *human mind's* approximation of "simplicity" is *very definitely* biased towards human-shaped thingies (see: Discworld series, all of).  Before any argument about Solomonoff Priors on God is going to work, you first have to solidly convince someone to revise their concept of universal simplicity to relate to normal, established Turing machines... and then you have to deal with the cognitive dissonance you're about to create by looking for which bits of a person's brain their religion roots in and figuring out what else can root in those pieces (because people don't allow themselves to walk around with incomplete personalities, I should know).

  Because most people tend to feel that these were the most wall-bangery parts of HPMoR, not because of "religion versus rationality", but because Canon!Potterverse simply and definitely *does* have an afterlife.  Strawmanning to make Potterverse more like (what we currently believe to be, with very strong Bayesian and error-minimization evidence) real life is simply not very artful.

  >Side note: it would probably be better to not attempt to strawman religious believers in their emotional capacity so that they don't feel it's scornful to their beliefs.

  Well yes.

  Here's a reversal for you: transhumanism and extropianism are religion-replacements for secularized, STEM-educated people.  I mean, come on, you're literally talking about movements that are based in changing the world to a radically ethically superior state, abolishing death, and creating Paradise.  Anyone who claims that religious yearnings play no part in this is a liar.

  EDIT: And that's not intended to be an insult to these two ideas.  Seriously.  I'm the guy who watched [Tim Minchin's *Storm*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U), got to the part where he says, "Isn't this all *enough?*" and basically yelled "NO YOU DUMB BASTARD!  IT ISN'T!" and fought to refrain from chucking my computer at the wall for daring to contain such idiocy.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:

    In regards to your "Storm" comment, I think Minchin was more talking about the view of some people who believe in the supernatural to express dissatisfaction about the "natural" universe by saying that it isn't good enough, or not liking that fantastic and beautiful things have known and mechanistic answers, and Minchin saying "why do you need supermaturalism to explain all these things? Why are these natural laws not enough for you? Why do you require ignorance of something in order to truly think it is beautiful?"  I dont think he was saying that the world is perfect and noone should try to improve it anymore because thats "enough". 

    At least, that was my interpretation on it.

    Why do people complain that HPMOR universe is different from cannon? Yudokowsky only used Harry Potter because that is easier than creating an entire new world, when trying to explain and show rationality. I find that what draws readers to HPMOR is the Harry Potter aspect rather than the rationality aspect, which is the opposite of what EY wants (although he wants as many readers for whatever reason as possible).

      Have you considered that most people are more likely to click on a thing and read it because it's fun than because someone claims to have an important message to preach?

      Now consider the base rate on preachers' messages actually being important.  Yeaaaaaah.

  Why the downvotes? This is a perfectly legitimate question...

  On topic, religion tends to function to fill in the gaps of society, be it by explaining events in the weather, codifying moral norms, creating support structures for the unfortunate, etc. 

  Like anything else it can go completely overboard and cancerous and radical, and there are as many interpretations as there are members. [Go figure](http://xkcd.com/927/). 

  Speaking as a (gasp!) Christian, and one who has been on several mission trips and witnessed a few miracles and first-hand accounts of plenty more, I'm perfectly fine with including religious topics in rationalist fiction.

  Edit: typos.

    It's pretty rare to find someone who hangs out in the rationalist community and is also religious, so I'm curious about a few things.

    I don't know if you've been to Less Wrong, but over there is a consensus that religion is pretty much a solved problem, and quite an easy one. In the [welcome threads](http://lesswrong.com/tag/welcome/) they say:

    > Bear in mind that many of us really, truly have given full consideration to theistic claims and found them to be false

    Yudkowsky thinks that you can't really be a proper rationalist if you believe in God. See [this blog post](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ql/my_childhood_role_model/):

    >Einstein was a nice fellow, but he talked a deal of nonsense about an impersonal God, which shows you how well he understood the art of careful thinking at a higher level of abstraction than his own field. 

    What do you think about this? Does this give you any discomfort or cognitive dissonance?
    ```

      Personally, I think you have to make an accounting for the fact that large portions of humanity possess an alief in some sort of god or gods, despite the fact that almost everyone has *expectations* that are *completely and utterly unconstrained* by God.  People who call themselves believers will give you weird looks if you actually predict and expect that God will carry out some particular act in the testable near future, and they *will*, in fact, tease you when He fails to do so (this is why people laugh at cults).

      Despite this, they will never stop claiming to believe in God, because most people don't separate alief and expectation.

      Personally, I went along that way for a long time, until I kinda found out about wholesale extropianism, and *then* the thought, "Plainly I wouldn't have been so incompetent or malicious at making the universe in the first place" hit me, and then I basically just rubbed out the mental check-box marked "belief in God" for good.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Reading up on the Alief concept. It seems similar to a belief based on tradition that one has followed. Example, monotheist feelings of shame for wanting to express one's sexuality. It seems strongly similar to the psychological and economist concepts of "the divided self" or "intrusive thoughts." But I'm not an expert so I'm in no place to give a definite answer about it.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          It's more like an "intuition":

          >In philosophy and psychology, an alief is an automatic or habitual belief-like attitude, particularly one that is in tension with a person’s explicit beliefs.[1]
          >
          >For example, a person standing on a transparent balcony may believe that they are safe, but alieve that they are in danger.

          In Kahneman terms, System 1 has aliefs, System 2 has beliefs.  When people fail to differentiate between the two (should "system 1" and "system 2" be an accurate way of cutting the mind into pieces at all!), they overload the word "believe" in rarely dangerous but often stupid ways.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            How is that functionally different from having intrusive thoughts based on past experiences?
            ```

    - u/AmeteurOpinions:
      ```
      > What do you think about this? Does this give you any discomfort or cognitive dissonance?

      Not really. If I'm supposed to judge the truth of Christianity based on the things I've seen in the world around me, then I am a freaking Christian. I have observed things *which do not make sense* without the presence of God. 

      I usually don't bother making anything out of it in groups like this because the discussions dead-end immediately, and trying to defeats the purpose of those events and testimonies in the first place. 

      Honestly the intersection between Rationality and Christianity is super fascinating to me, and so far the two of them get along just fine.

    Interesting. Can you provide proof?

    It'd be pretty groundbreaking if we had some hard evidence of something like physics-defying magic-y god shit going down.
