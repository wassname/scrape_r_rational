  I wonder if the Efreet, once they have Volo Ingenium, will themselves contractually inherit the ability to make their own Wishes.

  > “Consider quickly, our patience is not infinite. In the meantime, a word of warning, consideration for consideration- something truly wicked is coming, from over the eastern sea. You’d best be prepared, lest your best laid plans become a study in scarlet.”

  The Efreet are aware that the Concept has acquired Holmes. The Wish engine is out of service. And now Sauron has entered the game, bringing his own handforged memetic hazard to boot.

  Sean, if you're out there, Haley needs your help, now more than ever. The Concept is about to make its move.

  Unless it just did?

  Far out.

  Do you take requests for which pop culture stories get fed to the smoothie maker? If so, I appreciate you doing The Dark Tower before LOTR or Game of Thrones, but maybe some Princess Bride action :) ?

    You know I've never actually read The Princess Bride? Given the nature of this whole story that seems like a gross oversight, I think I'll put that on the read list.

  Oh man now I can't stop picturing Sean in the future being the old wizard running the magic shop-- always in the background, but also obscenely powerful so that the main characters can't just loot the place.

  At first I was a little leery about fanfiction being a considered a valid part of each story-verse since that opens up all sorts of different interpretations about how characters will behave in this story, but then I realized that this is basically what's been happening the whole time. Dunno why, but it feels weird to me to have a back door in to other stories through non-canon material. Does this mean that Sean can convince, say Hermione, to write a fanfiction about Star Wars so Sean can learn Force powers? They have Star Wars in Harry Potter, right?

    Getting someone to write a Worm fanfic where some rando gets Alexandria's vial and then promptly flies off into the sunset, never to be seen again, would also be pretty easy.
    ```

  ```
  Does the One Ring canonically exert mental influence over anyone who knows it's there? I thought it only hypnotized those who put it on. I'm not a LOTR buff, but it seems to me like the Council of Elrond would have gone a lot differently if everyone at the table was jonesing for it.

  Heya Sarsaparilla.... does the name "Six/Seven" mean anything to you?
  ```

- u/lmbfan:
  ```
  You know, Sean needs to get caught in a time loop ala Mother of Learning or Groundhog Exam Day.  Then he and Haley can meet as equals. There's just the problem of escaping...
