  So throwing this out there I think uriel dies at this conference. Perhaps with a misunderstanding of left or right( inb4 nonfallen angels have left and right switched around?)

    Who is going to maintain his machine then?

    Also, Interlude ×•, set in 2017:
    > We learned that Uriel, the only entity keeping any of this even slightly functional, has some serious issues of his own and does not entirely inspire confidence.

    Present tense, which implies Uriel is still alive.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Why is this in /r/Rational? Maybe if I was Jewish I would get it, but this doesn't seem like an attempt at rational fiction.
  ```

    ```
    It isn't. But [apparently it was decided it stays](/r/rational/comments/4sv6te/meta_is_unsong_rational_fic/).
    ```

  - u/noggin-scratcher:
    ```
    The sub is not necessarily strict on *only* truly rational fiction being posted - if it's sufficiently rational-adjacent to be enjoyed by the same sort of demographic/mindset as the people who have collected here, then it's probably fair game (self-regulating community, it keeps getting upvoted)

    Also the author is a part of the LessWrong/rational crowd; his blogging is more rational than his fiction.
