  And we're heading into the finale arc! I do love my climaxes - they're always fun to write, even if they do take a lot of effort to set up.

  Some decent news on the NTBS front: I've recently started writing again, so I do have a few chapters finished, and could in principle start updating relatively soon. The problem is that I was recently told that my job is being eliminated (as well as a hundred others), so finding a new one is taking up a lot of my time. Hopefully I will get back into the swing of it soon though, because I'm really excited about starting up with the Need to Become Stronger again. One's first love is always the dearest, after all :)
