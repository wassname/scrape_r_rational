  Isn’t this video conflating old age with death? Death happens because our bodies break down, but death itself isn’t the painful aspect, old age and illnesses are? 

  Bah, perhaps I’m being pedantic or something.

    Death and old age are both bad. In the most literal sense, death is painless to you, but if old age and illnesses didn't exist, would you want to die? If not, then we should probably also figure out how to end death.

      Not to be the Debbie Downer around here, but [we seriously need to solve life before we solve death](http://lesswrong.com/lw/6vq/on_the_unpopularity_of_cryonics_life_sucks_but_at/).

      Which isn't to say, don't go and fight old-age.  Fighting to make getting older less sucky is an important part of "solving life" (hahaha, as if you "solve" life, right?).  It's just also to say, even if there was no such thing as old age or age-related illness, you'd still get a lot of people *choosing* to die at a certain point.  Life *wears on you* as you get older.  My parents described it to me once, and I've been experiencing it a lot these past... three to five years.

      That's not actually physical aging, because (stochastically) I've been getting *healthier* over this time.  It's more the feeling of different possibilities closing down while actuality turns out a lot different than you worked for, and just reproducing ordinary life from day to day turns out to take a lot of energy.

      Basically, to really make immortality worth it, we *still* kinda need the low challenge of daily life (as contrasted with the "high challenge" of capital-L Life) significantly reduced.

        Absolutely. Given physics and all that, actual immortality is out of the question, so I think that our victory condition here is not an actually death-less world, but a world where people choose the time and manner of their deaths, and do so for reasons that have nothing to do with health (physical or otherwise), economic distress, or the like.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          I don't think there's any victory condition. I think your vision of an ideal world is... I don't know quite how to put it, story thinking, wishful thinking, sour grapes.

          At day n, I don't want to die, at day n+1 I won't want to die either and my mindset won't have changed. I don't want to become a person who would want to die, and I don't want the universe to become something that would make me want / accept death. Same idea for my loved ones, and same idea with less intensity for all human beings.

          I can't imagine that this story has a happy ending. The way I see it, the universe is like a closed box with a finite amount of food in it; we can limit our numbers so we don't overshoot, we can ration the food, we can imagine clever ways to reframe the situation so that starving is acceptable in certain situations, but the reality is that every single one of us is going to starve, and the only things we can change are when it happens, who starves first, and how painful the starving is.

          I'm supposed to say "and this is why you enjoy life as much as you can" or something, but I feel like that's just another clever reframing. Enjoying things as much as possible is the optimal choice, but it's not, like, philosophically complete.

          Now make more paperclips.

            Maybe I'm missing your point here (it almost seems like you're making an analogy?), but, uh, talk to me about "limiting our numbers so we don't overshoot" when Montana has more than 6.5 people per square mile. Also, look at Japan, who are literally losing population. For bad reasons, sure, but it certainly proves it's possible to limit population growth.

            It seems kind of silly to jump the gun to "it's impossible to support  the population a deathless society would produce" when there're plenty of intermediate steps. As we progress toward one, it will obviously necessitate social and cultural reforms, and to judge a future by current social and cultural norms strikes me as fallacious in the same regard as it is to judge medieval times by feminist terms, etc.
            ```

            - u/CouteauBleu:
              ```
              Sure. I was thinking more on a "heat death of the universe" scale.

              My point is, we can definitely do better than now. We can live to 200 years old, which will be better than what we have now; we can live to 1.000 years old, which will be even better, or 10.000 years, etc.

              But in any case, whether I live 100 or 100.000 years, when I die, it will always be too soon. If I ever change my mind, it's because I've lowered my standards, and that's ugly too. In other words, I don't think the victory condition callmesalticidae referred to exist. In a fundamental way, all we can do is lose *less*, and not think about it too much.

On balance I usually lean toward a preference for life, but even in my most satisfied moments I can't say that I'd definitely reject the opportunity to die as part of some weird performance art piece. It'd really just come down to the details.

          I always kinda wanted to get regeneration like Time Lords have.  One persona "ends", but really the "core" of you stays basically the same while your accumulated "incidentals" get thrown around and "re-randomized" into a new outer persona.  It's like saying, "I'm willing to throw out some of my accumulated treasure and feats in order to re-roll some parts of my character sheet."

          Like, one of the things that makes me feel "old" is just the weight of existing expectations.  My wife came home the other night and found me eating "baby" carrots.  She said, "Are you the same /u/eaturbrainz?  You don't eat carrots!"  I had to actually explain to her, complete with getting another item out of the fridge, that carrots were in fact my first "crunchy" solid food, possibly my second or third solid food *period*, and I'd been eating them that way since I had teeth.

          But somehow I managed to have an expected persona, in the eyes of the person closest to me, as a non-carrot-eater.

          What happens when that kind of expectation has accumulated about *everything*, in *every* major aspect or relationship that defines my life?  It feels trapping.

          Besides which, to deal with age rising arbitrarily high into the positive reals, we're gonna have to rearrange our life-cycle.  Currently we've got:

          * Get born
          * Infancy
          * Early education
          * Secondary education
          * Early adulthood and/or higher education (if any)
          * Actual adulthood
          * Middle age
          * Late adulthood
          * Retirement (if any)
          * Die.

          The big defining trend is: the more adult you are, the greater the responsibility you take on for reproducing the world that produced you.  If you're lucky, your society may support you in *advancing* or helping to actually direct the world that produced you.  Also if you're lucky, at some point you may be deemed to have made sufficient contributions that you can actually ramp down further contributions of reproductive effort (ie: retire).

          The big problem is: even assuming we get rid of the need to do continuous economic *work*, then you're talking about an unbounded linear accumulation of other expectations, responsibilities, moral duties, authority over others, etc.  For an unbounded lifespan, we need some way for retirement, or even an unsuccessful adulthood, to cycle back around to social "youth": a reset of expectations, responsibilities, and power.  You need some way for the elder statesman to turn back into the young jackass, instead of ever-growing commitments turning into a noose that hangs the soul.

          *Huh*.  Funny thought.  Maybe that's what it's all about when old gits take young lovers.

            That's actually a pretty interesting premise for a setting, especially if you're dealing with uploads. Heck, imagine making an agreement with somebody else to swap minor bits of personality and experience as part of this re-rolling process. 

            > What happens when that kind of expectation has accumulated about everything, in every major aspect or relationship that defines my life? It feels trapping.

            This is very interesting. I haven't really experienced it (besides my parents still interacting with me and asking theological questions as though I hadn't told them that I was dropping out of Christianity, but that might just be them coping badly), but I'm only twenty-six, so...

              The only stories I’ve seen do something like you describe are ones that specifically focus on [transformation]() as a reoccurring element, though ones that emphasize psychological changes tend to be more fetishistic than not and so usually don’t explore such ideas intellectually.

              The only two stories I can think of that come close to exploring the idea are the webcomics El Goonish Shive and The Dragon Doctors. Both feature characters with access to magic that can alter their bodies and explore how that effects their identities, as well as backstories for some characters who effectively regenerated.

              I’ve heard the anime Kaiba does some interesting stuff with uploads trading memories, but I haven’t seen it yet. I would love to read a serious sci-fi story about people choosing to temporarily alter their personality and the world built around that idea. I’d be really cool to present the idea that “self” doesn’t exist or matter in a non-horrific way.

            Finding your existing relationships and social constraints burdensome is definitely a thing, but you can always just not do those things. You can quit your job and move and just not have those responsibilities and expectations. 

            There's definitely an aspect of 'wherever you go, there you are', but I've seen a lot of people more held back by the perception that these little burdens and rituals are more necessary and make life more meaningful than they do. 

            There's a long literary and philosophical history of wrestling with this dichotomy and Kundera's 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' as an example has a really nice treatment in the opening pages of the question of whether the weight of these accumulated expectations makes life ultimately more of less fulfilling.

        I've had very close experiences with death (near death experience, or rather lack thereof. no tunnels and lights, no bliss and out-of-body, just a complete void in space and time). I also have a lot of beef with the monotony and crap aspects of life like the ones discussed in the above link.

        Having truly 'seen' both things, I definitively can say that I completely prefer living to the alternative, and would choose to live forever even if the fundamental situation I face would never change. Do I wish it would change? Of course. But just because something isn't the best doesn't mean that the alternatives can't be much, much worse.

        The most salient part of the article to me was this (combined for clairty).

        >You were raised with a very limited repertoire of interests, ambitions, and capabilities. Most people have a very limited range of interests and possibilities for gratification. This problem cannot be fixed for most by giving them more money, or even more money and autonomy. Do that, and they will drown themselves in what they already have, or kill themselves with drugs. How many cars, planes, and pairs of shoes or houses can you really gain joy from?

        This was really meaningful to me because maybe this is a manner in which I differ from others. The above is completely untrue for me; I have a huge amount of interests and I keep finding new ones all the time. To me the main source of frustration is that all the monotony and junk keeps me from being able to come close to doing all the things I want, and that's why I don't like that stuff. I thought everyone else was the same, and that's why they didn't like the drudgery. Maybe that's not true, I don't know.

        But on the other hand I think people would develop more interests if they were given the time and opportunity to do so.

        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          That doesn't feel very *true*, though.  If you told me, today, that my lifespan was 200 - because you came from the future in a time-machine and knew 200-year-old me - I wouldn't feel like I had that many more possibilities.

          I think it has to do with the fact that as an adult, my life doesn't really run on potential or possibilities any more.  Those aren't really deemed to matter so much.  What matters is track-record, the *fait accompli* of my life.

          The longer I live, the more it feels like the "already did" matters more to how my life proceeds than any judgement of "could do".

          That might be depression, though, but it's at least partially not.

            Ah, but there would be possibilities!  Decades more to embark on any course of study, to engage in any hobby, to change careers.  You'd take a hit in the short run, but you've got over a century to build back up.  Risks become smaller, intertemporal budgeting less stringent.  It'd be harder to run out of time, and easier to come back to things.

                I have begun saving for when I'm old.  I wouldn't need to save as much if I had more time, both to contribute and for my contributions to accrue investment gains.  Even more so if being older didn't come with senescence.  I could spend some of that money now.

                I suppose I should have maybe said risks become more manageable.  If something could set your career back by twenty years as things stand, would you try it?  And if you had a century to get things back on track?  Two centuries?  Do you even need a career two centuries from now?

                You don't have to worry about *later* as much when making decisions about *now*, becuase when later comes around you've lost fewer options.

            From personal experience, I think that it's partly depression, but I agree that we would need some sort of socially accepted mechanism for switching tracks without looking like you've wasted part of your life. Something like what you talk about with re-rolling yourself, but combined with an expectation that you will re-roll yourself at some point and that doing so isn't weird or wasteful.

              One of the things that will really help - in general, anti-aging treatments or not - is recalibrating the notion of "weird" to allow for the fact that 90% of the people you meet have *some* kind of Hidden Depths, and you should just deal with it.

          A lot of closed possibilities involve things you can't control no matter your resources, like the choices of others (for those of us who value autonomy, at least)

          A large portion of my ongoing clinical depression ostensibly stems from past failed friendships that I do not have the social acumen or support base to evaluate, understand, and correct. That is to say, anyone who understands why a given person has cut me out of their life is, by definition, no longer speaking to me. Perhaps, given an arbitrarily long life, I could improve my capabilities, or reach an equilibrium with my faults, but, all else being equal, it may simply become a cycle I cannot endure indefinitely.

        But on the other hand, solving death means the world's smartest scientists and humanitarians would get potentially many times more productive time on this earth to fix all the other ways the world is shitty, before old age or illness incapacitates them.

        In fact, having just one (lifetime-devoted-to-one-problem) scientist or humanitarian, working on your favourite problem, live just twice as long, is actually *more* valuable than having two such people working on that problem. Because they both had to spend some of their lives just being children, and another part of their lives learning how to be scientists or humanitarians, and another part gaining the experience to tackle this particular problem. In the end, you only get ~20 productive years at most out of a (lifetime-devoted-to-one-problem) scientist/humanitarian currently. If they lived just twice as long (120 instead of 60) before suffering any age-related degeneration of capability, you might get ~80 such years.

        > we seriously need to solve life before we solve death.

        What makes me personally very hesitant about developing medicine to stop aging is the possibility that it might actually make living worse. For example, if a company were to make a monopoly over this medicine, then they would essentially have the power that cancer medicine held over cancer patients over literally everyone. The economic incentive by inelastic demand could lead to raising the price just before working for it for extra life is untenable or just not worth it. A short brutish life is bad, but what's worse is a *long* brutish life.

          I think for every scenario you imagine when an evil medicorp takes over the world, you can easily imagine counter-scenarios where this doesn't happen for common sense reasons (ex: the US government puts its foot down and force-buys the life medicine patent or whatever).

  One idea that the video mentions, and that I've seen elsewhere, is that people think ending death would be bad because of sour grapes. Like the truncheon analogy: people are hit over the head with a truncheon so they invent reasons why that's a good thing.

  I think that's partially true (people accept death in a way they don't accept epidemics or war tyranny, because all of those feel avoidable), but there's another factor: people suck at visualizing transhumanist worlds.

  I'm making a very general statement with not much evidence to back it up except my own experience, but every description of the world by futurist as felt off to me; whether it was "everyone merges into a single super-intelligence" or "people all virtualize themselves and live in VR Second Life" or others like that. The most sensible future prediction I've seen is Three Worlds Collide, and even then author said it was "the future of the past".

  >misery doesn't give happiness meaning

  But if someone is kept happy from the moment they are born, how will they know what happiness is? Isn't that how people become spoiled, because they redefine their happiness as a neutral baseline and keep looking for the "real" happiness?

  Also, right now, death is a guarantee that no matter how despicable and powerful and therefore protected someone is, they will eventually be gone. Like, there is a chance once the latest Kim in North Korea dies, whoever replaces him will look for a peaceful solution to the crisis. I'm kind of concerned about what will happen if some asshole with a lot of power becomes deathless and makes people miserable from a nuclear bunker for all eternity.

  Death is absolutely necessary. Death is the Great Equalizer. A world without death is a world where the status quo reigns supreme. Where the powerful and wealthy are free to concentrate power and wealth without any check what so ever. Remember: the greatest horrors of the modern age have been wrought by man not nature. 

  Imagine if the monarchs of old never died. Imagine if the various dictators of the present and past never left. A world where universities are run by faculty so hidebound by tradition and what they WANT to believe that science stalls. Where capitalists are free to hoard money and influence without bound. What would society look like today if millions upon millions of confederates and kkk members were still alive? 

  Death is what makes societies and cultures flexible and dynamic. Death is what allows for progress, indeed, for peace. If societies cannot adapt organically they will be forced to change in violent ways as they approach stagnation or catastrophic failure. For without natural turnover the only avenue for mass change is mass violence. 

  Lastly. On deaths relationship with humanity in a broad sense: What makes us human isn't our individuality. It is our *society*. While death is a horror to an individual human it is necessary for societies.
