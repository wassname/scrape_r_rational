## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I just started listening to a new podcast called "[Sean Carroll's mindscape](http://seancarroll.libsyn.com/rss)" it's nice to listen to and this guy talks a lot about Bayesian rationality.

  I'm late to the Twitter party, any suggestions on good rationalists to follow?
