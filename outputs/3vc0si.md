  I think Fara may’ve unintentionally killed her sister during her dragon elimination quest without even knowing what she’s doing.

  And on a tangential note, when one says there’s an [incorporeal dragon in their garage,](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/The_Dragon_in_My_Garage) maybe they mean that the poor thing *had* to adopt this defence mechanism of gradually self-restricting its manifestations on reality to keep existing at least in some sense.

  Makes sense. Since dragons are impossible, clearly to exist they must have the power to change what is possible.

  Really reminds me of [Sam's SCP series on memetics](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3jsfgw/unforgettable_thats_what_you_are_scp_foundation/).

  Hmm, interesting. Sortof had an ending I disliked (that is the "This is a story and probably a false one. Or maybe it's real?" one) but it was surprisingly fun to read through

  This is a wonderful thing. Though It is a bit dubious in places, there aren't enough memetics, really, whether dragons change possibility or merely our memories of possibility.

  I really liked this. It did a good job of illustrating the rational argument for feminism: that racism and sexism are a form of bias, giving a false view of the world - and the past. They also distort the stories we tell and the genres we've built to place those stories in. As such, they should be opposed by anyone who values truth.

  The contrast between the work as a historically accurate story and the work as a fantasy was neat. "I would suspect that I have stumbled into another world" - nope, you've stumbled into another genre. Good luck! The title reinforces that - "The plausibility of dragons". Even in medieval times, dragons were implausible to a scholar. And yet from reading fantasy works you'd assume that they're *more* plausible than swordswomen. Why did it turn out this way? Well, it seems to work out for the dragons :P no surprise that they'd fight to continue it, to keep fantasy free from reality, history, and feminist critique. There's a deeper question in there - should *fantasy*, of all things, aim to be factual and based in reality even when telling stories - but on that topic I don't currently have an opinion worth sharing.

  And I liked the moral of the story too, with the final conclusion of the protagonists to go around editing their fantasy story to permit their existence - killing dragons, magic, and false ideas of the middle ages as they go.

    First off, the whole politics is spiders thing. Someone on /r/rational deleted their account after I discussed politics with them, much the same politics. If this is an emotional issue for you let me know and I'll stop. I don't want to drive you away from the community or anything. I figure if you're here, you're probably in favour of discussions, but if you're not, or if that changes, I'll step down.

    I'm not sure if there are any rules we should impose before we continue talking about spiders. If you have any let me know.

    Anyway, onward to the debate.

    I don't think most of the people who consider modern feminism harmful (myself included) would consider that to be untrue in any important way.

    >racism and sexism are a form of bias, giving a false view of the world 

    Is an entirely supportable sentence, for the most part. Even if there are "biotruths" or what have you, we still need to be striving for equality of opportunity.

    I don't think this is a good argument for modern feminism, because modern ferminism is pretty divorced from that particular view. Are you familiar with the idea of a [motte and bailey doctrine](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-words-words-words/).

    >That racism and sexism are a form of bias, giving a false view of the world

    Is an obvious good thing. At the very least it's not something I'm going to debate right now, because it being true or not shouldn't change my actions.

    Racism and sexism being bad is entirely defensible position, a talking point that only exists to make sure modern feminism is only ever debating assholes. It's the bailey in your motte and bailey. It's not a real political point.

    We're not criticizing modern feminism for views like "Everyone should have equal opportunity" or "Generations of poverty and strife are a bad thing".

    I'm personally against modern feminism because as a culture it seems to feel that it's *so* in the right that it can use evil tactics. It's so in the right that it can violate the practicalities of equality (of opportunity) to get results a bit faster.

    It's not because we don't think that a lot of social justice causes are very good, or that the far right is regressive and evil, it's just that social justice is increasingly populated by well intentioned extremists. People so convinced that they're in the right that they're willing to break [social geneva conventions](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/), for want of a better term.

      I'm way too invested in this account to delete it. I'm not going to stop participating in this community.  If I get really upset and decide that everything I said was so wrong as to be useless, I may delete my comments. 

      And I have no idea how to handle the spiders either, to be honest. I assume mods will start deleting things if the spider infestation grows out of control and becomes destructive.

      I think this is the only part of that first paragraph of my original comment with something to discuss. You agree with what I said, and go on to explain that you disagree with opinions and behaviours that you've seen grouped in with what I said. Ok. Sure. Seems reasonable? I'm not trying to start a debate over "is racism bad", rather one about "what does this story actually say about it? In what ways is it relevant to any point the author may have been making?". I want to talk about how this story handles it, which is why I was commenting *here*. 

      > I don't think this is a good argument for modern feminism, because modern ferminism is pretty divorced from that particular view. 

      Modern feminism tends to argue from morality more, at least that I've noticed. From the position that racism is wrong because it's immoral. However, the argument against racism-as-bias is the one that I think the story is making, and I think it's interesting in that context and also because it neatly ties into a general rationalist principle. It was also new to me, as I hadn't quite put those two concepts together before. 

      I don't feel the evil tactics thing is relevant, unless you think either that I or the author is engaging in that behaviour. I read your links: Scott made good arguments, as usual. Maybe it's just fundamental attribution error, but I don't think I engage in the behaviour he's concerned about, and I'd be a least a little bit worried if someone pointed out that I was in fact doing that. And a lot of the examples he pulls up seem like lot of debate over simple problems, but then again I'm pretty solidly third-wave sex-positive and intersectional, and there's certainly a lot of debate within feminism and between different branches. But honestly, I'm not sure how to defend my ideas from the kind of people who hang out around them, or from examples of bad things that those people have done.

        That seems pretty fair. "It did a good job of illustrating the rational argument for feminism" is a bit contentious, because now days feminism seems to mean more "the feminist phyle" including all those bad tactics, then particular feminist points like racism is bad.

        That's all I'm getting at, I don't think it can be called a rational argument for feminism, because feminism is a sub-culture not the policies it talks about.
