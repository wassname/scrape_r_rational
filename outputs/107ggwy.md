## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I recently read a good portion of Hard Enough on sufficient velocity because I saw it won some of the user choice awards. I'm posting this to de-rec it and save people the time of reading it. It has fun worldbuilding on top of the pokemon universe and is somewhat rational in terms of dealing with the realities of that extra worldbuilding into making the pokemon universe less cartoon-logic based, but that's about it. The rest of it is just a power fantasy that makes it clear this is all about making it so that the self insert is the greatest person ever. It's so in your face about it too, which at first I struggled to believe it was so over the top. I won't spoil in case you want to read, but it was just quite off putting and was a real shame given the otherwise promising writing.

  - u/tricky_labyrinth:
    ```
    Is it even that much of a power fantasy? It tries to clearly state he only won his high-tier fights (so far) due to one-time asymmetrical information advantages or the other side holding back hard. Seems to be struggling with self improvement so far too (after grabbing some low hanging SI fruit).

    Disagreed, FWIW, I recommend people give it a solid shot. It's reliably high quality, cares a lot about developing the setting and showing the details of running a good gym, and has a great update rate.

      Yeah, it's completely true that Brock is overpowered, but this is not the kind of story where power trumps everything, so it's still interesting.

  ```
  Good day,

  I am looking for a story about exploring, discovering, or learning magic. I'm not interested about a life in a magical world (like many fantasy worlds) or living the life of someone who learns magic (like Harry Potter).

  To give some context, I'm a physics student who has to think daily about repeatable phenomena and how they interact with other systems. So to me most magic in stories is more about what cool things one can do with their flashy superpowers (not that I mind), and less about the humbling experience of learning about a core part of one's reality.

  I have read mother of learning and it scratches some of that itch but it fundamentally is built on top of D&D's arbitrary magic system.

  And on top of that, I would like to avoid some Genre Savvy stories for a while because I have recently read A practical guide to Evil and that shit can't be outdone
  ```

  - u/DomesticatedDungeon:
    ```
    Do I get it right, that you're looking for stories featuring someone experimenting with magic, discovering underlying "rules of magic", etc? Also that "life in a magical world" and "someone who learns magic" just aren't what you're looking for, rather than should outright make titles containing them be excluded from search results? If so, here are some titles (not necessarily rational) that would match your request to various degrees.

    ---

    *(tags:*

     _• education — besides the personal research / experimentation, prot also gains knowledge from an educational system, books, or mentor;_

     _• extrasensory — the experimentation's mainly made possible due to prot's extrasensory traits._

     _• humexp — features human experimentation_

     _• dungeontag — prot's a dungeon)_

    ---

    • Web originals, misc

    •• [*Void Domain*](https://www.towercurator.com/void-domain/) by towercurator[demonology] [experimentation] [humexp] — the "scientist" character is not prot themselves, but their mentor figure.

    •• [*Dark Skies*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies) by Tigersight[soul magic] [extrasensory] [long] — takes a while before the relevant story themes kick in.

    •• [*Release that Witch*](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/release-that-witch/) by Er Mu[education] [long] — prot experiments to replicate real-world technological achievements (e.g. powder, firearms) through magic. Penalty point for the writer "cheating" and giving prot people with the right powers when he starts needing them.

    •• [*Tree of Aeons*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20568/tree-of-aeons-an-isekai-story/) by spaizzzer[LitRPG] [dungeontag] [extrasensory] [humexp] [rational] — underrated and underrecommended.

    •• [*Blue Core*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core) by InadvisablyCompelled[LitRPG] [dungeontag] — has some poorly executed sex scenes, which can be skipped.

    •• [*Frameshift*](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/vjx6as/c_rt_frameshift_now_complete_at_chapter_150/) by Pastafarian[harem] [dungeon] — this story didn't agree with me, but I think it technically matches your request. So maybe you'll end up liking it.

    • Fanfics

    •• [*Seed*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Seed) by TheAnt [parahumans] [humexp] [[Butcher](https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Butcher#Abilities_and_Powers)!fic] — if we define wormverse shenanigans as magic.

    •• HP fanfics

    ••• [*Blood Crest*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest) by Cauchy[soul magic] [necromancy] [education] — ~600K WL, WiP. Very good story in general. If not outright rational, then at least strives to be one.

    ••• [*Intricate Plots, LV & the*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8883971/1/Lord-Voldemort-and-the-Intricate-Plots) by Cauchy[time  magic] [prophecy magic] — this one's more like a collection of the writer's thoughts in a story form. Nevertheless, features some interesting ideas.

    ••• [*Temporal Beacon, HP & the*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon) by willyolioleo [education] [runic magic] — abandoned @~400k+ WL; has some bashing and other bad tropes, but the story in general is pretty interesting.

    ••• [*Too Young to Die*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die) by thebombhasbeenplanted[education] [humexp] [complete]

    ••• [*With Strength of Steel Wings*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings) by AngelaStarCat[education] — abandoned @~700k+ WL.

    ••• [*Firebird Trilogy, The*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FirebirdsSon) by Darth Marrs[education] [smut] [harem] [worldbuilding] — has many sex scenes; sex magic is integral to setting / plot.

    - u/Flashbunny:

      Thanks for the list. But respectfully, Tree of Aeons isn't recommended a lot because it's genuinely bad. IIRC it had egregious spelling and/or grammar issues and nothing interesting in the plot.

      Unless it's been revamped since I read it? This was several years ago.
      ```

      - u/lillarty:
        ```
        No, I read it last year and only got as far as I did through liberal usage of regex to fix as many issues as I could (the author so consistently makes the same mistakes that it's relatively easy to correct the story's SPAG errors). Even then, I can't say I really recommend it; too much of TreeTree's (seriously, that's his name and it never stops being stupid) abilities appear as a sort of "Oh, I guess he can do X now?" for me to even engage with the magic system.
        ```

      - u/DomesticatedDungeon:
        ```
        The text still needs a proofreader; the writer especially seems to have troubles with the its / it's thing. That being said, the story itself has a number of praiseworthy qualities, in my opinion: 

        1\) worldbuilding — whereas in many other stories a seemingly powerful character with flexible movement abilities ends up taking roots just in one city / country to make the story-writing easier, here the story / prot has expanded by now to cover >!several centuries in time, several planets / dimensions in space, and in a few cases several kilometers underground!< 

        2\) strategy — writer / prot often demonstrate ability to understand the importance of strategy for winning their battles and achieving their goals. Good amount of attention is given to things like infrastructure, population control / upkeep, dealing with externalities of those, etc.

         * IIRC, prot hasn't made any striking mistakes or blunders or far, either out of outright stupidity or the need to railroad the plot. One or two things come to mind, perhaps, but those could be realistic assumptions / mistakes to make in the heroes' position at the time.

        3\) shrewdness — writer / prot display a certain amount of understanding (and lack of romanticising) in regards to politics, geopolitics, propaganda, crowd control, etc. From a certain angle, the story reminds me of the Safehold series in this regard (sans the Christian religiosity aspect).

        4\) non-cliche perspective and plot development — in the first half of the story, the lack of >!plot armor!< for side- and background characters allowed the plot to develop in a non-cliche, and more realistic (given story premise) direction.
        ```

        - u/PresN:
          ```
          I think another aspect that makes Tree of Aeons hard to recommend is that in a sense it *is* a cliche perspective in this community: that of a sociopathic robot power maximizer. You'd be forgiven for forgetting that the tree is an isekai'd human, because within chapters it does nothing but give a justification for their "outsider" ideas. The most empathy they show for any other character after at *most* the first arc is a vague sense of fondness for an acolyte that they had for decades, and the most emotion they ever display is anger at being betrayed or attacked or fear at being attacked. It's just... "unfeeling AI rules over a community and grows its personal magical power, both with the sole goal of increasing its personal power, knowledge, and safety". It's certainly neat worldbuilding and an interesting idea, but it reads like watching a twitch stream of someone playing a tree-themed incremental game: numbers go up, and that's about it.
          ```

        - u/RohingyaWarrior:
          ```
          It's for those reasons that I'm still following it
          ```

  - u/MarbledMythos:
    ```
    You might enjoy Ra, which treats magic as a branch of physics, leading to magic as an engineering practice. The first half of the story puts an emphasis on ensuring the reader understands the basics, and also makes sure it still feels like magic.

    The second half of the story is _different_, but you would be hooked on it's own merits by that point.
    ```

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      Ra is one of the most disappointing stories I've ever read. Not the worst, it's still a solid story, but the premise and start of it were so great, then the second half so incredibly *different* that I find it hard to recommend.
      ```

      - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
        ```
        I second this. I enjoyed the story, both beginning and end, but the shift and reveals in the second half completely undermined any sense of wonder or discovery of the magic system built up in the first half. It certainly made the detail and worldbuilding the author put in seem kind of pointless.
        ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      qntm.org/ra, if I remember.

      I second this recommendation. The story is delicious, and magic is more an industrial/tinkering process than a mystical one. I think it fits.

    [The Essence of Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34710/the-essence-of-cultivation) was pretty good but is also a stub, so only read if you're fine with reading interesting beginnings.
    ```

  - u/lucidobservor:
    ```
    [The Way Ahead](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42202/the-way-ahead) seems like it might be exactly what you're looking for, if LitRPG magic works for you. It's about a physics student isekaied into another world, and spending most of his time tinkering with and doing science to his skills and magic.
    ```

      ```
      [A Budding Scientist in a Fantasy World](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41521/a-budding-scientist-in-a-fantasy-world) explores magic and the litRPG system, but it doesn't feel flashy to me.

      I liked [Haptic Imperative](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50082/haptic-imperative) for the cool magic in it.

      [Mage Errant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42267952-into-the-labyrinth) might scratch the flashy magic and learning aspects but I couldn't really get into it.
      ```

        [I Became a [Biologist] in a Fantasy World!](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33378/i-became-a-biologist-in-a-fantasy-world) also fits into the same archetype/subgenre. Very jargon heavy though. Seemed to be abandoned for almost 2 years before a solitary update dropped out of nowhere 6 weeks back.
        ```

  - u/dalekrule:
    ```
    Give a try at Ar'Kendrithyst. Sounds like what you're looking for.

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    Could have a look at [A Practical Guide to Sorcery](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34009/a-practical-guide-to-sorcery) (no relation to APGtE). The main character attends a magical university, where she learns a lot about the rules behind magic. Then she has to hastily put that theory into practise paying back a loan from criminals. In the process, she often pushes up against the boundaries of established magical theory.

  - u/tricky_labyrinth:

    I think https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49733/arcanum started doing this, but it's only just started and on hiatus.
    ```

  - u/kevin_p:
    ```
    You might find [Not Long Before the End](https://archive.org/details/Fantasy_Science_Fiction_v036n04_1969-04_PDF/page/n51/mode/2up) by Larry Niven interesting. It's a short story that in a surface sense is about a fight between a wizard and a swordsman, but the real underlying subject is the wizard's experiments into the nature of magic and the device he designed based on what he learned. Much shorter than most of what's been recommended so far, maybe 4k words in total.
    ```

- u/Rhamni:
  ```
  I've been reading a lot of cultivation and LitRPG/Progression Fantasy in the last year. I'm looking for more, but it's starting to feel like I've read most of the popular ones. Any decent rational stories where the power system makes sense and doesn't feel too arbitrary, and the MC goes about his quest for power in an enjoyable, rational way? Out of the books I've read so far, the best fits have been Mother of Learning and Bastion. Less rational but still very enjoyable: Dungeon Crawler Carl, Defiance of the Fall, Primal Hunter, He Who Fights With Monster, Virtuous Sons, and Dungeon Slayer.
  ```

  - u/FunkyFunker:
    ```
    When you say cultivation do you include translated webnovels? Because there's years worth of translated power progression stories, and if you rifle through them there are some more rational ones. Check out [Warlock of the Magus World](https://allnovelfull.com/warlock-of-the-magus-world.html) and ignore the trashy synopsis/ tags. I would say it's on the upper end of your 'less rational' list. Also, gets pretty evil at times.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      My goodness. A completed webnovel? Is that allowed?

      Thank you. I've never heard of it before, but will give it a try.

          I actually found RI to be a little too repetitive. Got about 800 chapters in before dropping, though that was years ago now, back when I first started reading the genre, so who knows how I would rate it now. I would put RI and WotMW at tier 2 overall for the genre; you have to give them a shot if you read the genre, but there is better.

  hi guys, I've been getting into the sourcebooks for Eclipse Phase and Cyberpunk Red and it has me in the mood for some sci-fi/cyberpunk, I'm looking for some long (>=250k words) fiction that features extensive body modification, bonus point for a body modded protagonist. it does not necessarily need to deal with transhumanism as a focus of the story, it's fine if it's just part of the setting but bonus points if it does.

  - u/lo4952:
    ```
    [Menschenjaeger](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39098/menschenjaeger) (260k) is a very good dystopian cyberpunk-ish story that doesn't *focus* on body modification, but does contain a decent chunk. Might not be exactly what you're looking for, but I would still recommend it for the characters alone. The MC is a gang enforcer / killer for hire living in what is basically a giant slum.

    Any Worm fanfiction involving Mannequin or Bonesaw would probably be right up your alley. Unfortunately since those two aren't Taylor there's basically no long fics about them. Certainly not 250k words.

    It's less cyberpunk body mods and more 'meaty,' but there's also [Maybe I'm A Lion](https://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthread.php/1870-Maybe-I-m-a-Lion-%28KnK-Prototype-Crossover%29) and [Compulsion](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/compulsion-worm-prototype.821228/): two Prototype crossovers with KnK Nasuverse and Worm respectively.

    [Symbiote](https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/chapter-1-a-meeting-of-the-minds/) by farmerbob1 probably qualifies.

    [Featherlight](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34670/featherlight) should work; the story follows a heavily augmented PI in a city where most people are biased against modded people.

  Recommending my own fic, for people that might be interested in the premise: [Diplomatic Overture](https://archiveofourown.org/works/44099640/chapters/110885952) involves a Galarian diplomat in the world of Pokemon attempting to push an ambitious piece of foreign policy: unification with Kalos. For those who are aware of the events of the games, this becomes understandably problematic to implement. Four chapters out of seven currently uploaded, the rest will be uploaded one a day for the next three days. It's a wee bit of an unlikely intersection between governmental worldbuilding and a franchise with an interesting understanding of the word 'canon', but I hope it might appeal to some people here like it appealed to me, as the writer :)

  Recommendations Needed

  I have been looking all over the internet for a story similar to Circular Godhood(Multicross). So far I have not been able to find one. The story is about your average guy who gained the power to travel to any fictional world. From movies to video games. He make a plan that would help him benefit the most from this ability. 

  I was wondering if anyone could help me look for something similar. Where the mc make a plan and thinks about it enough that any flaws should be spotted. So no drama that could have easily been avoided with some thinking. 

  Thanks in Advance.

  PS: MC is able to choose what world he will go to. So no random travel please:)

    If you are familiar with *Worm*, maybe *Companion Chronicles* might be what you're looking for? I usually recommend just the first major arc (a whole book in its own right)

    Granted, the protagonist isn't the main "jumper" who's calling the shots but it's the *only* "jumpchain" story that I know of that is actually decent in what is, as a whole, a rather trash genre.

      Intelligently written, uses the jumpchain concept well, and is long enough to have four complete jumps onscreen, plus various intermission and offscreen bits. On hiatus, but stopped between jumps/arcs.

    3-Adica, and its prequel Bit Players by Greg Egan fits this, but be warned that its a short story. Although more generally I would recommend most of his short stories, though only some of his novels.
