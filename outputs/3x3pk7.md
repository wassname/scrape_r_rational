[Here is a link](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3272901/1/Cistern-and-Chalice) that doesn't require registration. 

This story started out as a fun way of fleshing out the world of Erwt, which /u/thewalruss has been developing in tandem with a programmable magic system called "Time of Wizards". Figuring out the world-changing consequences of his magic system and cosmology has been a big part of the work with Erwt, and as a hobbyist writer I've been busy exploring various dramatic perspectives. This particular story grew to about 8000 words, and manages to show (or at least hint at) a lot of the possibilities and conflicts in what's turning out to be a fascinating world. 

edit: and here I thought Wattpad was a good thing. Sorry folks, I'm going to rehost to something that doesn't require people to register.

    There shouldn't be. Is there? I thought Wattpad was readable by anyone.

    edit: Ah shit.
