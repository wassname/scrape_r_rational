## "Those Born in the Light", a HSDxD SI

### Post:

I think this story has potential and might hit the right buttons for some of the people here:

DxD isn't really a setting you'd expect to find a rational fic in, but then again the whole "demons aren't really evil" shtick is something that lends itself to it well.
It's only in the beginning stages and still in a sort of prequel before any DxD story events happen (if they will even happen...can't tell because it begins far  in the past), but from what I've seen so far (about 10k words) it seems interesting. 
SI isn't a genre that has done well for itself outside of a select few gems, but so far this hasn't been cringy.

Short summary: A human mind is reincarnated as Raynare before the Dawn of Creation.

  This may not be entirely rational of me, but whenever I see "self insert", I downvote. 

  SI characters in general are generally really bad, for two reasons:

  1) They are the opposite of a rational character. They go into an illogical setting with knowledge and a (hopefully) logical approach to things, win a few battles easily by using pre-knowledge of the plot, and... That's it. No one ever really exploits this past "and then I helped best the boss early".

  2) It's usually terrible writing, from a technical standpoint. If the SI isn't some flavor of Sue, then they're just an unnecessary added character who visits the stages of the canon regardless. Their addition changes a few minor details, but the overall scheme of things I'd unaffected. 

  If your SI is to have so little impact, why not just change one of the existing characters to better match what you want your SI to do? 

  And, for this specific work, good fucking luck making DxD rational. I actually tried this myself, with attempts at a Rational!Issei, which I had to scrap because I was  changing literally everything about him, attempts at a Rational!DxD world with some OCs as new protagonists, which I had to scrap because I had to rewrite so much if the canon (seriously, fuck these 'balance breakers', fuck 'divine doubling/halving', fuck demon magic that just does whatever because I said so, and especially fuck 'divine doubling' because how the fuck does that even work and how has Issei not win everything by getting a hand grenade, hiding out in an alley, doubling it for a few days straight, pulling the pin, dropping it, and gating out as the landscape is reduced to loose particles from an explosion that would make the sub blush in envy). 

  I had to edit so many things that I had essentially filed off the serial numbers and was writing my own derivative fiction.

    I think you've been burned by the amount of crappy SI fiction there is, but the genre doesn't have an inherent conflict with rationalism, it's just that a lot of authors write these stories as a form of wish fullfillment, rather than making them good stories in their own right.

    Truly good SI fics, which deviate from canon significantly, exist, and those are usually the only ones worth reading because it means that author feels comfortable enough to write his own storyline rather than piggybacking off of a pre-set line of events without taking the character's actions into consideration. Bad authors simply aren't good at modeling the characters they have taken from other authors.

    I think SI fics are interesting because the character represents an outside context problem, so a good author is required to make antagonists adapt their methods in reaction to the SI's knowledge and capabilities. It's essentially very similar to time loop fics like MoL, except that the loop only occurs once.


    But yeah I see why you'd think that, I hope the rant helped.
