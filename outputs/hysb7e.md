## Rational Silmarilion Fanfiction?

### Post:

I remember reading a Rat Fic about the Silmarils being recovered by the sons of Fëanor in the modern age, but I can't seem to find it and I can't remember what it's called. Can someone help me out?

    I thought process was exactly: *Yes!* That's the one!... **FUCK.**

    Thank you.

      lintamande has also written [like a million glowfics](https://www.glowfic.com/users/34?page=8) either set in the Silmarillion at various points in the timeline, or exploring what if the Fëanorians were born in a different setting. 

      (But it's glowfic, so meandering, weirdly-formatted, crossover-heavy, and very much an acquired taste. Delve into the abyss at your own peril.)

        In fact, that's how I found this one when trying to answer the question.  Searching Google for what I could remember about the story found me nothing relevant, so I finally gave in and searched for "Feanor glowfic" and lintamande's name popped up.

        There's so many. Well I know what I'm doing for the rest of the year to distract myself.

          Don't try to read all of it. Even at reduced writing capacity lintamande(aka theunitofcaring) still writes it faster than you can read it.

      Happy to help!

  Technically sixth in a series of thematically related snippets, but while the others are good this one is better and stands perfectly well alone - I only found the others well afterwards.

  Takes place earlyish in the fourth age in Valinor, and reminds me a little of >!the happy ending of UNSONG!<.  More-or-less canon-compliant, though it takes the themes in a different direction.
