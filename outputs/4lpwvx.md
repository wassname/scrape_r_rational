## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I binge read Mother of Learning last week and I'm enjoying the story a lot. I do wonder about some things though.

  * Why doesn't Zorian try to find a way to shield his friend's mind from the cranium rats. He tells the truth to them and a lot of that information pieced together over several iterations could give a good idea of what he's up to, especially to someone with the time and resources of [Mother of Learning](#s "Red Robe"). They don't have good protection from mind reading and he has been shown them pieces of the puzzle.

  * The mana batteries. While he says that most forms of magical combat rely on making them explode from pressure and they can't be carried across iterations, he knows a lot more about spell formula that it may be possible to protect them from attack. And having more mana to cast more stuff would help him learn faster rather than needing so much rest along with providing reserves for more complicated spells.

  I've been thinking of the concept of self replenishing batteries like the well of souls that could then be mounted on golems and use the communication disks as relays to have them act like support. If he was smart with it he could have his own telepathically controlled "mage squad" to go against bigger threats and avoid risks. For example send them against [Mother of Learning](#s "Quatach-Ichl") while he remains away from harm and focuses on other plots. Heck I wonder if they got AI stuff in their universe given that they possess mind magics. He could given them a bigger degree of autonomy so he could focus on his own things without having to control everyone of their movements. Maybe dissect some cranium rats could give a good idea of how to build a basic rudimentary decentralized AI?

  Another interesting idea is learning if its possible to attach other stuff to his soul like shifters do. Maybe there's a way to bring artifacts across restarts without having to craft them from scratch?

  I've been thinking of an optimal strategy to get the most out of the cycles and I think spell formula, memory packets and soul magic were vital. Along with shaping but Zorian didn't know it was that useful until recently. I think if I was stuck in the cycle I would approach the problem like this:

  1. Learn everything possible about the cycle and try to uncover how time travel is possible.
  2. Learn some useful combat spells to stay alive, probably remain as far as possible from the city and monitor the invasion in case I didn't know I could survive being killed.
  3. Learn magic formula and focus on crafting enhancement artifacts to increase stats like strength, intelligence and mana.
  4. Find a way to create self replenishing mana batteries. I think it would take quite some time but the costs would be offset if I can use them to practice and replenish reserves along with using them to power constructs.
  5. Focus on golems and other constructs to scout and scrying/divination for information gathering.
  6. Provided I learned of the aranea, start working towards building up mind magic. Also memory packets would be useful by this point given that so much information would be building up.
  7. Start checking on soul magic and ways to protect myself from attack given that it seems to be the most dangerous threat after mind magic, offset only by not being as common as mind magic.
  8. Learn more advanced combat magic and only then after being sure I can defend myself from most basic-intermediate forms of death plan on the invasion.

  I think attacking the time traveler that could have about as much if not more experience than Zach was a mistake. They just didn't have deterrents and Zorian could have focused on more exotic spells that would be harder to counter so that he could surprise the third time traveler. It showed that unconventional strategies work very well against people that are used to seeing the same tactics over and over and aren't prepared for something like being shot with a gun.

  Honestly I think I'd be a lot more paranoid if I was stuck in a cycle with a conspiracy at work and potentially more time travelers tagging along. Then again in his shoes I'd probably not venture as far and learn about the aranea even later, if at all. He is a big risk taker I have to say.

  What are your thoughts on the fic so far? I've enjoyed it, so much that I couldn't find a good spot to stop reading but I still wonder how rational some of Zorian's actions are. Also ZorianxTaiven FTW :P

  I don't know who recommended me Shinsekai Yori here, but I just finished watching the whole 25 episodes and am pretty pissed off at him/her. 

  The anime is definitely not rationalist, the characters are definitely not competent in any way or form, and I'm seriously starting to doubt there is any rationality at all in it. 

  The sheer amount of idiot balls held through the whole series is maddening and, while it might be understandable considering that the structure of their society was not exactly conducive to free thought, it's unacceptable in any product that's touted as being RATIONAL.

  Spoilers ahead:

  - [Flight](#s "We saw Maria and Shisei flying and/or hovering, and considering that the powers themselves don't seem to have a power limit beyond the capacity to maintain the image in your head, why the hell wasn't EVERYONE flying? Especially in the end? What's the need for all those transportation tools if you can just use the Cantus for flying everywhere?")

  - [Incompetent Healers](#s "The whole using powers for healing is inconsistent. On one side they show using them for continuous healing on Squealer, on another what passes for EMTs wasn't able to save the overly-excitable fatty from a bullet wound. Talking about the damn EMTs, what the hell were they waiting for to assist him?")

  - [Incompetent warriors](#s "Well, warrior I guess. It seems that the only with some competence there is Shisei, because everyone else is completely incapable of putting up even a fucking barrier around themselves. Even the guy who was accompanying Saki at the end died against the worm, even if two simple layered barriers with the edge towards the enemy would have easily taken care of the issue. Through the whole damn series we see powers at times used in very VERY creative ways (the air bubbles? the illusion at the beginning during the game?), yet the most blindingly obvious uses of them seem to not be there.")

  - [Range?](#s "What's the matter with the range? That's shown to be very inconsistent as well, with characters stating a few meters to be the limit and then we see conscious long range power use and, most important of all, unconscious planetary-wide power use.")

  - [Mindreading?](#s "They can put "memory barriers" on people's minds to wall of some memories, and even replace said memories. Knowing this, how the hell haven't they developed mind-reading? How the hell aren't they routinely using that insanely versatile power for verifying lies and truth? How the hell aren't they using it for non-lethal takedown of Fiends?")

  - [Fiends](#s "And the fiends, oh boy the fiends. The sheer STUPIDITY of the whole concept is mind-blowing. It appears the consensus on the internet is split, some people say that Fiends can kill humans without issues because of genetic mutations, so they don't have the attack inhibition, some say it's their psychology changing, making them not consider humans part of their species. Obviously from what happened with Messiah it's clear that the Inhibition doesn't work for attacks against humans, but rather attacks against their own species, so the second explanation makes sense. Regardless, knowing this, it's absolutely nuts that NOBODY attempted to kill the Fiend by simply switching the point of view 'That is a monster, he's not human anymore, he has to die'. Hell, it's nuts nobody tried to kill the damn Messiah by simply equating it to a Bakenezumi (obvious from the back, since she wears the same clothes). The whole damn thing doesn't make sense, this whole psychological limitation is so ridiculously easy to game that it's just insane that nobody ever thought of it, in face of their own fucking death. Aside from that, what was the deal with that Doctor? How could he K without Death Feedback?")

  - [Sensory](#s "This one is really interesting. Considering the flexibility and extend of the power, and considering that Shun was tasked with feeling the unhatched chick and make it hatch sooner, it's obvious that this power provides a certain amount of sensory feedback. Thus, I wonder why it was never used and developed further for this purpose. I wonder if it's possible to feel the movement of objects you're controlling. If yes, considering that Shisei blew back an entire area full of poison, then it shouldn't be that hard to establish a sensory area by simply taking control of a small parts of air at regular intervals within it, and feeling it's movement as vibrations.")

  - [Reality manipulation?](#s "Same thing, judging by the matter with the Holy ground and with the Karma demons, and then with Tokyo, it seems that PK is not as much telekinesis as it is Reality Manipulation. If yes, holy shit, the possibilities go so far beyond what we've been shown that it's not even funny.")

  - [Bakenezumi](#s "What the fuck is the deal with that? Why did they have to splice Naked Mole Rats into the human genome when they could have just added the same attack inhibition they already have?")

  - [Bonobono and the same-sex relationships](#s "Omygod, that. Episode 8 was really ridiculous. The explanation for the encouragement of same-sex relationships being to avoid issues with pregnancy in a society capable of SPLITTING GENES is retarded beyond belief. Humans were using condoms made from animal skin back in the 17th century, and this advanced society with Cantus cannot easily take care of the pregnancy risk? What the fuck.")

    Wasn't a fan of the series either. A friend of mine recommended it to me because he said it was intellectually stimulating but I found it hard to finish.

    I understood that their culture had gone through a dark age after fighting the espers and had developed some rather retrograde doctrines which coupled with the loss of knowledge and the passing of generations turned into something more of a tradition with people forgetting why they had to perform those rituals or do culling in the first place.

    In the end the elders seemed to be the only ones in the know and the others just followed orders.

    By the way I found the idea of the elders of [elders plot](#s "leaving the kids abilities unlocked in order to have them as their successors to be very stupid. It only caused the turning of their best bet and the death of the others"). Saki doesn't seem particularly fit for a leading role either so I never understood what they were aiming to achieve with that.

    About the rest, I took it as them being under conditioning for so long that some of their creativity and curiosity were dampened in a way reminiscent of how 1984 created humans with a limited intellect to serve as cheap labor, except more subtle.

    Not to mention that the safety mechanism against human on human attack was a very evident vulnerability and I'm surprised no one had created countermeasures, especially since they had suffered from it beforehand.

    Overall I'll agree in that I also have problems considering it rational.

    If at all I'll say the [Ending Song](https://youtu.be/LV31EHwtayo) was its most redeemable trait.

    I don’t remember the series well enough to argue against all of your points (and some make sense anyway), but here are at least some weak points in your reasoning:

    > powers themselves don't seem to have a power limit beyond the capacity to maintain the image in your head

    The idea *I* got was that constantly maintaining focus on the intended “magic” (please ignore my possibly inaccurate terminology) was necessary, but not sufficient. So there would be more requirements involved which the authors didn’t elaborate on for various reasons (e.g. because world-building would require much more work in that case, like if JKR had to write whole books on magical theory for HP).

    > [range limits are] shown to be very inconsistent [..] unconscious planetary-wide power use.

    Unconscious and conscious types of “magic” could operate principally differently enough for ranges to vary so much between them. For instance, the unconscious effects of multiple individuals could “stack” together if they were directed to affect the same thing, the lack of requirement for focus could somehow factor into it, etc.

    > Fiends [..] it's absolutely nuts that NOBODY attempted to kill the Fiend by simply switching the point of view 'That is a monster, he's not human anymore, he has to die'. [..] 

    If you think about the psychological block as of a very powerful instinctual aversion to [killing], then it starts making more sense. It’s like how in our world most humans will be avert to kill or torture creatures of the in-group (other citizens of their country, other humans, pets, large animals in general, etc), only much stronger in effect and harder to “double-think” around. Though I feel like this would generate a certain percent of “psychopaths” in their world and much higher in numbers than the handful of canonic gouma and akki.

    > [Sensory] .. I wonder why it was never used and developed further for this purpose.

    *(Not really a weakness, this one — just wanted to add an opinion.)* My doylist understanding was that they just wanted to focus on the societal and psychological aspects \ ramifications of the story they wanted to tell.

    > [Bakenezumi] .. Why did they have to splice Naked Mole Rats into the human genome when they could have just added the same attack inhibition they already have?

    As explained in the anime and quoted in the [wiki:](http://shinsekaiyori.wikia.com/wiki/Queerats#History) 

    >[.] queerats [..] are actually descended from humans without psychokinesis. When humans who were able to use psychokinesis inserted attack inhibition and death feedback into their DNA to prevent acts of violence against each other, humans without psychokinesis became a problem, as death feedback depended on subconscious Cantus to stop liver and thyroid functions. The balance of power would then shift towards the non-Cantus users as they could freely kill without dying in return. To avoid a reversal of the existing power hierarchy, naked mole rat [..] genes were inserted into those humans' DNA until they could not be recognized as humans and thus would not trigger death feedback. 

    This also supports my counter-point of double-thinking not being something easily achievable for PK-wielders: if it were that easy, they wouldn’t have to change a significant chunk of their population on genetic level just to be able to attack them \ defend against them.

    Also, in case it’ll be relevant for anyone, the correct title is Shi**n**sekai Yori (“[shin](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%97%E3%82%93#Japanese)”=“new”, “[sekai](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%81%9B%E3%81%8B%E3%81%84#Japanese)”=“world”).

  I was thinking about having a story where the good guys, in order to achieve their ends must commit some level of human rights desecration or some other atrocities. It would make it such that while on their quest the antagonists basically do what they wants in the face of the public until they are able to regain favor, but I'm having trouble with getting good scenario. 

  Do any of you have examples i could look to for inspiration?

    This reminds me of Kiritstugu from Fate/Zero. He's basically a utilitarian magical Batman that always chooses the needs of the many over that of the few. His arc is about him coming to terms with all the horrible shit he's done and accepting how flawed his philosophy is. There's also Code Geass, where the protagonist decides to take on all of humanity's evil by himself in order to create a peaceful world for his sister. 

    For non-anime examples, try reading about Nietzsche's philosophy. He's the one who said:

    >He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster, for when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss also gazes into you

    Edit: I forgot to mention Psychopass! It's kinda the inverse your situation. The protagonist refuses to kill anyone, even if it meant letting the villain get away with horrible crimes. At some point, one has to question the use of a moral code that allows further harm all for the sake of not killing. If not killing leads to more death, is it really that good in the first place?
    ```

    - u/Faust91x:
      ```
      Fate/Zero is so good.

      I'd also suggest adding Death Note which is a lot like Code Geass although in that case Light is more selfish than Lelouch.

      And finally Watchmen! The antagonist's plan and the characters all make very questionable choices and the ending opens up some good debate on who was right.
      ```

      - u/That2009WeirdEmoKid:
        ```
        Yes! Totally agree on Watchmen. Everyone has a decent point they could argue for their cause. Death Note is great, but I don't think Light is a good example here. His argument goes out the window as soon as he tries to kill L. It's very hard to take him seriously when he goes about reaching his goals in such a childish way. Lelouch actually believed in what he preached, where Light just cared about how superior he was to everyone. He didn't have any consistent beliefs, he changed them to suit his ego and needs whenever necessary!
        ```

    - u/DeterminedThrowaway:
      ```
      > He's basically a utilitarian [...] accepting how flawed his philosophy is  

      Well crap. I consider myself a preference utilitarian, did this work present a legitimate criticism? Am I being naive, and if so can I be pointed towards some reading material that would help me become less naive/wrong?
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        More like "coming to terms with the gross cost of net positive utility", it's not actually a criticism *on its own terms* to note that utilitarianism can suggest things which are horrible out of context. 

        (imo it also falls into the common fallacy of not counting indirect consequences, and argues that utilitarianism is wrong because following it leads to bed outcomes!)
        ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    The two most obvious scenarios are an epidemic, and an evil army made of good people. For the second one, think World War II: the Nazis were definitely bad, and the Allies absolutely needed to stop them. But most of their military was made of regular soldiers who didn't deserve to die any more than French or British soldiers. So you're going to kill a bunch of innocent people if you want fight against the nazis, even if you only kill enemy soldiers.

    Psykers in 40k come to mind.  Free thinking makes a person genuinely susceptible to daemonic possession, which often has planet-level genocidal consequences.  Maybe something similar, where some new circumstance makes children with special gifts vulnerable to some effect with nightmarish consequences, such that killing the children is a defensible action?
    ```

  - u/Turniper:
    ```
    Fighting an enemy willing to use prisoners as instruments of biological warfare, or an enemy that can easily blend in to the general population, making mass surveillance and indefinite detainment one of the most effective ways to deal with them. Another fun situation would be a memetic hazard, like a page of the necronomicon, that turns everyone who views it into cultists whose greatest goal is to blend in and then expose as many people as possible to the hazard.
    ```

    - u/Dwood15:
      ```
      I like the idea of a memetic hazard. Perhaps if it was one which would be bad enough that it's not curable and could spread if unchecked, but slow enough to be trackable.

    I recently read a Worm fanfic where Scion was going to destroy all the worlds -- about 20 billion people -- but the heroes were getting useful information from Dinah to help fight him off. The only problem was that doing so was causing her intense pain. Is saving 20 billion lives an acceptable reason to torture an innocent 12-year-old girl?

    Personally, I consider the answer to be "obviously yes", but other readers disagreed.

    If you are dealing with a pandemic there are quite a few situations that might arise, where the best thing to do to save the greatest number, would be to slaughter a bunch of infected people. That's the first example that comes to mind at least.

    - In a superhero world, the antagonist has the power that anyone he touches falls in love with him. He's a politician, often attending rallies and shaking hands (every handshake earns him another voter-for-life) whose policies simplify down to enjoying the wealth and power that come with becoming President. But his mind-controlled voters are still otherwise innocent people...

    - Aliens have arrived, and they're shape shifters. Some of them have infiltrated human society, with the explicit aim of (kidnapping humans as pets/raising humans for meat/telepathically feeding on the sanity of humanity/other nefarious aims). It's not easy to tell them apart from the general population; while not invulnerable, they are tougher than a normal human and tend to carry advanced weaponry. New ones turn up faster than the protagonists can reliably identify old ones.

  I literary just ran into to the [Artifexian YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeh-pJYRZTBJDXMNZeWSUVA), but I think you folks might enjoy it. It seems to focus on discussions of the practical considerations of astronomy and geophysics when it comes to world building along with strangely language design considerations. Apologies to everyone who's also subscribed to /r/worldbuilding and probably saw this there already.
