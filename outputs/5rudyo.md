## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  The populist movement that has embraced Trump endorses ideas that are fundamentally incompatible with my views of what is morally right and factually true, and they are not open to persuation. When Trump was elected I committed to showing empathy towards those that disagreed with me, and I have failed in that. I now see them as deluded at best and openly prejudiced at worst. They frighten me more than anything else and I don't know what to do.

    The advice for you depends on what subproblem you are facing:
    * If this is causing emotional harm to you, attempt to limit your consumption of news about the current presidency and contact with supporters.
    * If you're worried and have enough mental fortitude to *help*,  you could donate time/resources to organizations; The ACLU and [International Refugee Defense Project](https://refugeerights.org/) are doing work against the most recent executive order.

    I'm Swedish and left wing even by local standards, but I have somehow found myself even more frustrated with the American left than its right. Trump is a complete asshole, and he's giving the Republicans everything they want on a silver platter *plus* plausible deniability they can turn to when his ship sinks. But there are so many incredibly hateful and counterproductive behaviours on the left. Try to understand their perspective here. I will start with saying some things about muslims that overgeneralizes and lacks context, but the point I want to get to is drawing a parallel that ends up just reinforcing the views of many Trump supporters. Please don't think I agree with everything I bring up, I am trying to illustrate the perspective of someone who is genuinely right wing, not just sick and tired of 'my camp' the left as I am.

    The muslims who commit acts of terrorism are a minuscule minority of muslims, many of them from war torn areas who never had a very good shot at life. Alright, fine, but the sympathy, compassion and respect for those terrorists is *way* higher among non-terrorist muslims than among non-muslims. 25% of British muslims think suicide bombings against British troops in the Middle East are a good thing. 12% think that suicide bombings *in Britain* could be a good thing. The number is 16% in Belgium. 18% of muslim students in the UK say they would not report a fellow muslim *whom they knew was planning a terrorist attack*. 25% of UK muslims say no muslim has an obligation to report any such knowledge. 37% say violence is justified if the target is a Jew. 45% of British Muslims agree that clerics preaching violence against the West represent "mainstream Islam". I got those numbers [here](http://www.thereligionofpeace.com/pages/articles/opinion-polls.aspx). That site is pushing an agenda, but the polls they link to are done by BBC Radio and other organizations, not all of which are crap. It's fairly undeniable that while only a small fraction of muslims use violence, a very sizeable minority think it's *good that they do*. A majority of muslims in the West are against violence, but that minority is not small. Attempts by the left to pretend that there is nothing to worry about are extremely counterproductive, and make a lot of people in the middle feel like the only people actually taking this cultural divide seriously are the asshats who are clearly racist but are at least not blind.

    Now. A while back when four black youths kidnapped a mentally handicapped white kid and tortured him with cigarette burns while livestreaming, there were a *lot* of people ho said 'racism has nothing to do with this, despite comments on tape along the lines of 'Fuck Trump! Fuck white people!, along with a slew of phrases that Breibart reporters probably hadn't dreamed of in their most racist narcissistic wet dreams they would ever be able to report on. The police chief said it was not racism that motivated them and that the only reason it was a hate crime was because the kid was handicapped. Before that we had the black church that was burned down where someone had sprayed 'Vote Trump' on the wall. The media and most of reddit immediately screamed "racist hate crime!" It then turned out it was a black church member who did it just so they could pretend evil rednecks were behind it, and that development was in the mainstream news cycle for less than a day, always with reporters saying how it turned out race had nothing to do with the incident. After the election white people got beat up in the street, sometimes on film, sometimes filmed by the attackers themselves, meaning there is now footage online for anyone to see of two dozen black kids spouting racial slurs while beating up a lone white boy and trashing his car yelling 'Fuck Trump'. Now I'm telling you, I know no matter how many examples I bring up, the response from the left will always be 'It's a tiny minority who commit crimes, you can't blame everyone on the left/all blacks/all muslims'.

    Now. While you have all that, you also have *millions* of people *in the US* who proudly shout 'Bash the Fash!' You have celebrities joking about how it's time someone bombed the White House. You have a /r/rational mod advocating violence. You have comments with thousands of upvotes in /r/politics saying people deserve to be beaten up for wearing a MAGA cap. You have people defending the actions of rioters in Berkley, even shouting 'Bash the fash!' *in the context of hundreds of masked people looting Starbucks and hitting an unconscious white kid in the head with a shovel*. And with all that, they also say Trump supporters are Nazis who overgeneralize and refuse to take part in civil discourse.

    I'm way to the left of most Americans on most issues, but the left in the US frightens me. It's becoming a monster *and* it's helping to radicalize the right. Everything is being made worse, day by day by day, and it's only going to keep getting worse every day that the left behaves this way. Because people in the middle and people on the right are not blind. They have their bubbles and their prejudices too. Some of them are definitely racist. But when so very many people on the left keep tolerating and even *promoting* violence when it's used against the right, and then say that Trump supporters are *Nazis*... I find it impossible to even identify with the left anymore. I want high taxes, awesome education and healthcare, I want a clean environment, I want solar energy, I want electric cars, I want stronger unions and labour safety regulations, I want a higher minimum wage... But I do not want anything to do with so very many people on the left. And it's making me sad and tired.

      Let's be clear here: these people are not advocating violence against Trump supporters, only the ones that literally *are* Nazis.

      I know that's not that much better, and there's a very real slippery slope that might lead to labeling more and more people Nazis or Nazi sympathizers.  I've spoken vocally in person and on facebook against violence, specifically calling out the couple liberal friends I have who cheered at the punching of Spencer. 

      But there's no need to make them seem more crazy by misrepresenting their justifications. The fact is that there are very clear indications of a resurgence in white supremacy in the US, not necessarily in number of people, but in their boldness and influence in government. People are afraid. Conservative fear of Muslims and immigrants is what elected Trump, and it's stoking liberal fear of racists and fascism. This cycle of fear is going to continue to drive both sides to the extremes, and that's the problem that needs to be addressed somehow.

        I think advocating violence at all, when one of the main draws of the alt-right is that liberals are trying to keep them down, is a tactical and emotion-driven mistake.

            The problem is that that net is being cast ludicrously widely.  I think a large chunk of the left was already primed to think of the Right as *evil*.  Think of the debate over the ACA, with it's undertones that all that nonsense about "economic reality" was just a smokescreen for the desire to see poor/old/sick/minority people die in the streets.  Think of the abortion debate; pro-choice isn't a natural consequences of a sincere belief in souls, it comes from a malevolent desire to control women's bodies.  Etc, etc, a pattern seen again and again.  So when the Nazi meme hits the stage, with Nazis as the perfect embodiment of Pure Evil, I think a lot of people were ready to accept that most/all of their opponents were driven by evil, and would *of course* support Nazism, even as actual Nazism is basically a fringe of a fringe of a fringe.  As Scott phrased it in his post-election article, I'm not saying they're on a slippery slope, I'm saying they're at the bottom, covered in dozens of feet of rocks and snow.

              Well, a bunch of Republican primary voters once cheered, "Let him die!  Let him die!" during a debate.

              But to be more accurate, there is no real fiscal problem with universal health-care in *any country but America*.  "Economic reality" is that other countries have managed appropriate universal insurance programs for *decades* -- even though the ACA is a piece of crap.

              So yes, saying America, for reasons like "it's big" or "it's diverse", cannot do things other countries have already done *for decades*, comes across as disingenuous.

                  Huh.  That's actually very weird to hear, since AFAIK that's relatively uncommon.  I've heard of money troubles for the British NHS, but not so much that it would be worth privatizing.  And as to systems in places like Germany or Italy or even Australia and New Zealand, no, nobody seems in a fiscal rush to move to privatized health-care.

                  For countries I've actually lived in, bizarrely enough, Israel has a Bismarck-style system and seems perfectly content with it.  I rarely hear complaints or politicization about money spent on health-care -- which is weird, since most other things get complained-about.

              I believe you mean pro-life? But meanwhile on the other side, pro-choice people don't just disagree about things like when something is given the rights of a person, or bodily autonomy, they're *baby murderers* who don't care about killing people as long as they get to have consequence-free sex.   Or the idea that Obama is literally a secret Muslim working with ISIL to bring down the USA from within.

              Seeing the other side as the embodiment of Pure Evil is not unique to the left.

              A few of them, sure, but to apply that description to "a large chunk of the Left" seems very hyperbolic.

                Right, meant pro-life.  And I would by no means say it's unique to the left, but it certainly seem to be much more of a *thing*.  Admittedly, this may be because I pay approximately zero attention to the actual pro-life zealots; if I were to find large sums of Pure Evil othering on the Right, that'd be my guess for location.

                >A few of them, sure, but to apply that description to "a large chunk of the Left" seems very hyperbolic.

                It seems to me that the number of people who support violence against "Nazis" is vastly larger than the number of actual Nazis.  Even if we assume everyone in the vague ballpark of the "alt right" qualifies as a Nazi, the "Smash the Fash" group seems much larger.  And more on point, the rhetoric I'm seeing from progressives indicates they think there are at least several million Nazis on the right, rather than maybe a half-dozen thousand.

                  This is true, and definitely troubling. The alt-right is disproportionately vocal and influential, and that makes it harder for us to argue that the violence is unnecessary.  I've had people ask me why I'm defending people who literally call for them to be killed or forcefully deported, and any answers I give them about principles of free speech and the value of maintaining the law don't emotionally satisfy their fear that the country is swiftly approaching a state where violence *would* be justified (as in, if actual lynching parties and pogroms start, I'm all for violent resistance, but we're nowhere near that point, and I don't think we're actually getting there anytime soon).

      I, and everyone I know IRL except for my anarchist friend who has always thought weird things, condemn violence, rioting, political physical attacks, and so on. We don't carry signs that say "shoot republicans" or whatever, we carry signs that say "equal rights for everyone" and we donate to the ACLU and Planned Parenthood.

      Fuck those people who would weak our movement by defending violent people. They're doing evil, and people who enable violent people with signs like "kill all the whites" and so on are also doing evil. I condemn these people.

      I also don't know who they are. I don't know them; most people don't know them. The vast, vast majority of leftists, like every leftist I know, is mostly just afraid and trying to do what they can to keep our society together and protect those who need protecting in a peaceful way. 

      I've been to the protests. I've talked to and been a protestor. We're not violent. We're just afraid, and trying to show that a lot of us don't agree with what's going on. We want to encourage our elected representatives to protect those who need protecting, and to tell women, gay people, black people, and middle eastern people... you'll be safe. We're here for you.

        So, I used to be one of those people who saw the crazy leftists on college campuses and on the internet and went "Who are these crazy kids? It sucks that these people are giving liberals a bad name." Most of my friends are liberal, some extremely so, but none have really fallen into any of the "Tumblrina/Feminazi/SJW" stereotypes that conservatives and libertarians love to bash.

        After this election is the first time I've ever seen some of my liberal friends showing some of the craziness. Not a lot, only like 2 out of the 20 or so I have, but those 2 are fully invested in the whole punching nazis thing.

        My other liberal friends and I have spoken out against it, so it's obviously still a minority, from my experience, but it's scary seeing how quickly people will justify violence just because the person being punched or doxxed is a "literal nazi."  I really think that the election of Trump has not just demonstrated the radicalization of the Right, but confirmed so many fears on the Left that the perception that actual fascism is on the rise in the USA requires violent resistance.

        And I've been asked by a couple people in one minority group or the other why I'm defending people who call for their extermination, and I can't really blame them for feeling betrayed, even while intellectually I still feel justified in insisting that violence is not the answer. They're scared that something akin to the not-too-distant Japanese internment camps will be next, and that all the peaceful protests in the world aren't going to stop that. And if that's the direction things are headed in, I can't say I disagree with them: I'm only against violence when it's not to confront violence. So I can see why, if people actually believe that lives and freedoms are in danger, they'll resort to violence.

        The worst part is this is all only going to continue to feed into more people on each side becoming more radical. I don't know what's going to break the cycle.

          Bingo!  The question is not, "Why are you being so tribalistic/sensationalistic?".  That assumes we've already examined the evidence, found that nothing is wrong and nobody's in danger, and thus started looking for alternate explanations as to why people behave *as if* in danger when actually not.

          The question is, "Well, *are* people in danger?"  Personally, I think when you actually examine the evidence, the answer is *yes*.  We are in danger.  *I* am in danger.

          But the discussion to have is about the probability of danger, as the explanation for endangered and enraged behavior with the most prior probability.  Hell, in addition to the prior probability, it's also the most *object-level* explanation, which shows that its prior should be robust against changing to different possible complexity priors.

            Yes, people are in danger. My friends and loved ones are in danger. But how much danger?  They're in danger from riding in cars and not exercising too. 

            Even if the chance has tripled in the last year, that only means going from .01% to .03%, or similar. So is it *probable* that they will be harmed by fascists, or only *possible*?  Rational beliefs are based on the former, not the latter, and right now, I don't see the evidence that punching and doxxing fascists actually prevents violence from minorities.

I've always thought it was a telling statistic that of the ~35 arrests made during the 90's Right-Wing Militia movement, all but two of them were reported by *other Right-Wing Militia members*.  I imagine those conversations went something like: [whispered tone] "Hi, is this the FBI?  Look, I joined this militia group, and we have a lot of fun getting drunk and shooting skeet in the woods, and bitching about Clinton, but this guy, Billy Placeholder?  He's talking about a fucking *shooting war with the US government*.  Will you please come arrest this fucker before he gets us all killed?"

          Yeah, but if we go by policy, most of the Republican Party are not conservatives in any Burkean or Chestertonian sense.  They're not taking a "wait and see" attitude towards social change.  They don't value stability, or even fiscal solvency.  They're basically just a coalition of military adventurists, tax-the-poor and subsidize-the-rich fiscal horrors, and people who believe in abolishing secularism.

          And now they have actual fascists among them.

          The Burkean and Chestertonian conservatives switched to the moderate wing of the Democrats, or just went full-on Libertarian, a long time ago.  I like those guys.  I'm friends with those guys.  They're an important counterbalance on people like me, in any possible society.

          But they were the *first* to condemn a visible fascist running for President.  Remember when the Weekly Standard and the National Review said, "Never Trump"?  *That* was conservative.

      I agree with most of your points, I am however uncomfortable with your (and others' on this site) blanket condemnation of violence.

      Yes, at this point in time violence is counterproductive if we want to affect the change we would like to see, which I assume to be a more liberal and/or egalitarian world with a rising standard of living and happiness for all, preferably along with a corresponding increase of rational thought in policy making and governance.

      However, from usage of the word in your post and those of others I get the strong impression that you are opposed to violence of any form, in any context and for any cause. 

      That, to me, seems to be a dangerous limitation to impose on yourself as it can seriously impede your ability to realize your core values, even ones that place a high or the highest value on human life.

      Or am I missing some subtlety that implies only senseless/undirected violence is to be disdained?

      Well... dramatic, well-publicized examples don't actually alter basic statistics.  Sure, that's a rationality thing to care about statistics instead of dramatic examples, but you're on /r/rational.

      >Now. While you have all that, you also have millions of people in the US who proudly shout 'Bash the Fash!'

      No.  This is just plain numerically wrong.  If we had millions of committed antifascists in the USA, *this government wouldn't be in power*.

      >You have celebrities joking about how it's time someone bombed the White House.

      Has the President tried not modeling himself after Mussolini?

      >You have people defending the actions of rioters in Berkley, even shouting 'Bash the fash!' in the context of hundreds of masked people looting Starbucks and hitting an unconscious white kid in the head with a shovel.

      Who's defending that?  Fucking hell, how the *fuck* do you defend beating an unconscious child as antifascist action?

      >But when so very many people on the left keep tolerating and even promoting violence when it's used against the right, and then say that Trump supporters are Nazis...

      Well, what's your assessment of whether they *actually are Nazis*?  I mean, I rate them as Mussolini supporters: a lot of them were outright conned, a lot voted for the Republican-branded ham sandwich over the Democratic ham sandwich (but ultimately aren't committed fascist ideologues), and... a core of them are fascists.

      *Why can't it be happening here*, given all the appearances saying it *is* happening here?  Why does this have to be the Left's fault, when the Right holds every branch of government, and has held 2/3 for the past six or seven years?

      In fact, in general, why should political problems be blamed on the people who *don't have power*, rather than those who do?

      And speaking of supporting violence, [how](http://www.newsweek.com/2016/02/12/right-wing-extremists-militants-bigger-threat-america-isis-jihadists-422743.html) [much](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/the-other-terror-threat.html) [evidence](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/01/west-point-report-americas-violent-far-right/319302/) needs to come in that *far-right violence is a severe social problem*, a greater threat than Islamist terror actually, before you're willing to believe it even exists?

      How many people have to die for people to stop believing the far-right are innocent lambs?

      Hell, I don't even *commit* violence.  I just support violence against the far-right when it acquires state power, because far-right governments have a tendency to throw me into death camps.  Auschwitz was a thing, remember?

      >I want high taxes, awesome education and healthcare, I want a clean environment, I want solar energy, I want electric cars, I want stronger unions and labour safety regulations, I want a higher minimum wage...

      Unfortunately, most people on the American "left" *don't* actually want strong unions, higher wages, or stronger labor safety regulations.  Witness the Democratic primary campaign.

      I feel similarly, and I also worry that the issues with perception of the American left aren't going to be fixable.  The people responsible likely aren't going to change their mind or behave any differently, at least not as long as they still feel like the tribe has mainstream support, and this will only mean the people in the middle increasingly distrust not only the radical left but also the mainstream culture that supports it and liberalism in general.  As liberalism comes to appear less and less desirable to identify with, Americans who still choose a side will more and more side with the right, and the left will undergo a sort of evaporative cooling in which, to an extent, the only people who want to associate with it anymore are the ones who legitimately don't mind or even advocate the actions of the radical left.  If that happens, then liberalism will suffer a sharp decline in popularity as it becomes widely known as the party full of hateful bigots and conservatism gains mainstream support.

      Eventually, however, things could still turn out fine for the left as an ideology.  If the radical left becomes as ridiculed for their vitriol as they should be, then some of them may stop feeling like being in the liberal tribe justifies atrocities against other tribes if they receive only scorn from the community instead of praise or blind eyes.  It's also possible that the remnants of the tribe would collapse in on itself and redefine itself as something different, which would free up the concept of being in the liberal tribe for the people who once couldn't stand being associated with the now not-liberals.  From the other side of things, with more centrists or even liberals on the conservative side, the party as a whole might drift closer to center, making the parts of conservatism which are denounced by liberals less prominent in the tribe.

      Always remember that the same people will still be there with roughly the same opinions, no matter which labels and groups they fall under.  Even if being 'liberal' falls out of style because of entitled radical liberals, the nature and opinions of the voterbase hasn't changed much at all, and we'll sooner or later settle into new groups and labels that let us adequately express our divisions against each other like normal.

  Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [Handy discussion links and previous threads here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing).


  ----


  Still plugging away (ugh, I promised I wouldn’t say that!).  [The current feature document is coming along nicely](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SlYaK6vZ0OmkQsuVOMCIOMb6nPIU9I1vKMTFMEL0Wk8/edit?usp=sharing), but it’s still got some major systems missing and plenty of information to be filled in. My goal is to make a concerted effort to get this sucker at least 90% completed by the end of the weekend.  Wish me luck.


  ----


  This week saw some discussion that has made some last-minute changes to a few of the systems we’d previously designed.  First is the evolution system, which is now a generic class upgrade system, which takes a unit of one species and moves it to another, with enough leeway to ignore certain stats when overwriting with the new species info (such as, for instance, a kill count, or earned EVs).  


  This actually permits us to roll the finecky transform and mindswapping concepts into this system; transform will now just be a class upgrade that reverts itself after a period of time.  Stats will no longer have to be split along mind/body/whathaveyou, or at least not at a *systemic* level.  


  It’s funny how this sort of thing comes about; someone had brought up the idea of a DnD mod that utilized multiclass features, and looking at it from that standpoint was what made all of this click into place, replacing a rather unnecessarily complex system with something elegant.  You never know what angle inspiration will come from.


  ----


  In addition to the above, we are now knee-deep in a red-hot debate over how exactly to organize the Aspect system.  For those of you just tuning in, Aspects are essentially sub-types; applications of a particular power in a particular way that allows moves to be organized into move families of related tactics, applications, or mentalities.  


  Psychic has the clearest need for Aspects; there are moves that encompass Teleportation, Telekinesis, Telepathy, Barriers, and psychic Blasts.  All of these are enabled by being a Psychic, but it would make sense that, if I had two Alakazam, one specializes in producing Barriers while another is a Teleportation demon.  Using moves of a particular aspect trains an EV in that Aspect, which then makes learning moves that are similar that much easier.


  Previously, [Aspects were organized on a per-type basis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wOK33rveJVSFhKKg3TtAeDjYRZexI4sYhcfaujmsUJU/edit?usp=sharing), meaning that you’d have your Fire Aspects and your Water Aspects and if you ever had a second type of move or an HM injected (adding a new type), then you would essentially start from scratch--your stats would of course be the same, but scaling off a new Aspect and Type that was now EV of 0.


  Currently, the channel seems to be leaning towards instead using a [more generic Aspect organization](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AvQVkN5tP-9zYiix3kXweSdSf_OytgB9fRTN3IZnKtw/edit?usp=sharing), with maybe ten or so Aspects that encompass things such as Energy Manipulation or Matter Manipulation or what have you. Using Fire Spin as a Charizard would exercise your Energy Manipulation Aspect, and if later you had Thunderbolt injected, while you would initially start at a disadvantage due to the brand new type, eventually all of the EVs you had invested into Energy Manipulation would apply to the new shiny Thunderbolt.  This Thunderbolt would thus be stronger than if your Charizard had instead been a pure physical fighter.


  I myself am still a little apprehensive about this, but I can see some of its advantages.  We’ll see how it ends up.

    This game better have a long tutorial, it sounds cool but every time I've tried to get into a complicated combat system I hit a wall. What's the main gameplay loop?
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      A very valid concern. 

      The core gameplay loop itself isn't *conceptually* all that different from canon Pokemon.  You wander around in the woods until you run into something worth fighting, at which point the game switches to a turn-based grid strategy view and you pull out your first pokemon.  You select your moves, they select their moves, and you see who comes out alive.  The devil's in the details--you now have to consider positioning, Area of Effect, endurance drain over multiple matches, and, of course, lethality.  In addition, wild (and tamed) pokemon have their own goals and natures--a timid pokemon is just going to bolt, while an aggressive one might get the the drop on *you*.  

      But at the end of the day, you'd play it (on the surface) very similarly to canon.  The trick, I think, is to A: build the systems in such a way that they feel intuitive even when you *can't* see their underlying mechanics, and B: permit access to those underlying mechanics the more you progress.

      The original gen 1 games had it right with EVs--even if some people would jump down my throat for saying that.  The original intent for that system (I'd bet) was to make it so that there was a difference in power between the pokemon that had been trained by the player via the grind to level 100, and the pokemon who had eaten 100 rare candies.  This system was not revealed to the player--it was intended to *feel* stronger, that if you were to compare the first kind of pokemon to the second there'd be no contest which was stronger.  

      The issue came later, with online play, where suddenly everyone was level 100, and to be competitive you had to have the best EVs, which was really still a hidden system and so you had no good way of reading the inner workings.  It had gone from an intuition-based system to just another stat.

      Which brings us to Aspects (and similar systems).  If I have an Alakazam who has spammed Teleport, and an Alakazam who has spammed Psybeam, they are both going to be effective at different things--the first can teleport a few hexes more each jump, and the second can deal proportionally more damage.  In addition, the first will find more advanced Teleport moves are much faster to learn, while the second finds that advancing to Psychic is a very straightforward advancement.

      It is not necessary to know that Aspects even exist to get this sort of intuitive feel--and this is true for more than half the systems I've designed.  There are ways in-game to get this info--various Psychics who will read your pokemon's status for a fee, advanced pokedex plugins that let you get a readout, advanced pokemon center analysis, etc.  But if you ignored all of that and just played through the game, you'd do just fine--just like a casual player in canon doesn't have to give a rat's ass about Natures, EVs, or IVs to still enjoy playing.  And if it *doesn't* click, well, then as far as you know, this Alakazam is genetically predisposed to Teleport, and this one to Psybeam, and that's that.

      There will definitely be a tutorial of some sort, but the game is intended to be explored and figured out.  I won't just drop you at the main menu like Dwarf Fortress or Nethack, but since the game is intended to have procedurally generated worlds, it won't be structured in such a way that allows for a gentle difficulty curve in every situation.  Plus, as a roguelike, it's sort of assumed you'll die a lot.  Start playing, manipulate the system as well as you can, fail somehow, die, wash, rinse, repeat. The second or the fifth or the twentieth time you play through maybe you don't even know some of these systems exist, but as you explore and stumble upon hints in-game and have "aha!" moments, you'll slowly get better at not dying, and eventually can abuse the system in your favor and have the world eating out the palm of your hand.

      Or you won't, and you'll "just" get through the game.  That's the goal, anyhow.  Sorry for the wall of text.

  A cool (though obvious) pattern in map projections that I only just noticed...  
  \- Meridians and parallels are evenly-spaced: Simple compromise (equirectangular, azimuthal equidistant)  
  \- Parallel spacing is compressed (i.e., meridians are shortened) near the edge of the map: Equal-area (Lambert equal-area azimuthal, Lambert equal-area azimuthal)  
  \- Meridian spacing is compressed (i.e., parallels are shortened) near the edge of the map: Equal-area (sinusoidal, Werner)  
  \- Parallel spacing is expanded (i.e., meridians are extended) near the edge of the map: Conformal (Mercator, stereographic)

  I was thinking about map projections because my next pointless programming project involves the extension of my previous Delaunay-triangulation-/Voronoi-diagram-/relative-neighborhood-graph-drawing program(s) from planes and toruses to spheres. On the other hand, however, I'm also involved in a just-started campaign of *[Crusader Kings 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/crusaderkings)*. Deciding which activity is more worth my effort isn't too difficult: The CK2 campaign provides *both* enormous amounts of fun (both in the playing and in the summarizing) *and* a non-negligible sum of prestige (when I disseminate the summary), while the fun and prestige that can be gained from writing *yet another* network-drawing program and *maybe* bothering to post an explanation and demonstration somewhere (even if it incorporates several map projections) is significantly more limited.

  Stupid question time:

  I was rereading the Metropolitan Man recently, and it gave rise to a question.

  Would Luthor / people that sympathize with Luthor be more or less concerned about a more alien / high functioning autistic spectrum-ish Superman (meaning either completely not raised on Earth, or raised on Earth but largely detached from a lot of the general moral programing of most people)

  Like, something along the lines of:

  "Yeah. I like your entertainment, food, etc. and there's a lot of neat things you people do. I'm not really here to be a super hero, though. If something comes up that will cause sufficient disruption to these things, like an asteroid, I'll deal with it. If you fucks decide to launch all the nukes to wipe yourselves out, I'll deal with it. Otherwise, there's enough backlog of said entertainment that anything short of an extinction event / knocking you back to the ston eage in mass doesn't really concern me. You want that really cool (non-weapon, I said I'm not here for politics and I meant it) space thing put in orbit so you can skip the fuel issue getting it there? Sure. Hook me up with lifetime netflix, internet, and steam. Want something else done that's basically trivial for me and a pain in the ass for you? Well, I'm following this fanfiction and it doesn't update as often as I'd like. Maybe you should pay that guy/girl to get on it? Stop that reactor from melting down? You know, I'd really like a new season of Firefly. Friends? Loves ones? Nah. I'm not an idiot. I'm basically a nacient God as far as you're concerned. Developing attachments is a good way of giving myself a weakness. The variety that's bad for me and you. Me because why should I give you a way to hurt me? You because that risks what I would do if you successfully emotionally attacked me. And going by your history / fiction, someone totally would, and statistics say they'd eventually succeed. Better to just avoid that.

  Why am I concerned with the human race? As far as I can tell, I'm immortal. I can also travel near/at the speed of light. Space is still really goddamned big and empty, and I have no desire to spend hundreds of thousands of years searching for other forms of sentient life that makes interesting things and hoping they're compatable. Do you know how irritating it would be to spend 250,000 years finally finding the sentient Blorb race and finding out that their form of entertainment are sound waves in a range I can't hear coupled with chemical stimulation of body parts I don't have?

  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play some FFXV and binge some Star Trek while dicking around on reddit at my house on the moon because frankly listening to all the horrible stuff happening on Earth all the time is irritating."

    I think I'd be concerned that he'd change in what he found amusing in his long, lonely, friendless immortal existence. This is a Superman who's still only lived, at most, a few decades? (he mentions the possibility of traveling for 250ky, so maybe his values are fairly inflexible? OFC b/c of time dilation that journey would be near-instantaneous for him, subjectively, depending on how close exactly to c he's traveling... as well, if yellow sunlight is still needed for his abilities to function, he might run dry traveling through the vast emptiness of space... but that's beside the point)

    So I'd worry that after a few decades or centuries of shits and giggles, what tickles his fancy would drift and he'd decide to give being a sadistic god-king a try. A Superman with a rigid moral code would be less likely to do that.

    Though I suppose our abilities to entertain might keep pace with Superman's hunger for entertainment. Who knows what delights the Netflix and Steam of 2117 would bring?
