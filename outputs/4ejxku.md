  reductionist magic systems. Where complex and useful behavior can be derived from a comparatively simple set of rules, and there's never a need to say "a wizard did it" or "because magic."

    Can you link some examples of that?

      Ra (the web serial), the inheritance cycle (to a certain point), Worm (at least by my standards for "magic"). I'll add more stories if I can think of them. You can also find a few examples on this sub if you search for "magic system."

    I get my thrill for this from watching competitive video games. There's probably a similar level of strategy with physical sports, but it's more opaque to me.

    One pet example: in the game DotA 2 there are two teams of 5 players controlling "heroes" (each with a unique sets of skills, picked before the game begins in a strategic draft) attempting to destroy the other's ancient (hence the name, "Defense of the Ancients").

    The standard way to do this was, for a long time, trying to win a massive 5v5 fight and attack the enemy base. Do this enough and you would destroy their ancient.

    Some teams, notably Alliance, realised that you didn't actually *have* to do the "massive 5v5 fight" part, you could just go straight to destroying the base.

    So they more or less used guerrilla warfare, splitting their force so that one group could tentatively engage the enemy team while the other attacked the enemy base. If the enemy team tried to disengage so they could defend their base, the engaging force could prevent that.

    The strategy was extremely successful. Opposing teams often wasted their bans in the pre-game draft phase to counter heroes often picked for this strategy, which gave teams known for their ability to utilise it an early advantage (able to get key heroes for other, more traditional strategies).

    "Ratting", as it became known, has waxed and waned in popularity along with changes to the game's balance, but it's been a fascinating inclusion in the game's meta. 

    I'm skipping a lot of the detail here as it's likely extremely boring to anyone who isn't already interested in the game. Hopefully it illustrates that you can find examples of military strategies writ small in competitive video games.

      I really enjoy books like enders game, the laser tag was my favorite part. and in methods i loved the war games the most. any large scale conflict is something ill enjoy reading about, but roman style war is my all time favorite. 5v5 is just a little to small for me

      - u/ZeroNihilist:

        Fair enough. Large-scale conflicts do add a lot of complexity, especially with morale and supply lines and other things that can decide a war irrespective of the relative military might of the combatants.

  I like to think about how to rationalize biological humans outside the solar system, and how a human-AI war might *at all* be balanced.

  It turns out that these two problems actually solve each other:

  1. Enter a second cold war. Humans build automated underground bases.

  2. One of these bases is given too much autonomy and starts a secret development branch for weaponry.

  3. This base launches an attack on all other military bases in an effort to remove all military threats on the planet.

  4. Humans manage to thwart the attack by quickly adapting to non-electronic machinery and blasting AI-controlled areas with EMP, employing microwave weapons, etc. 

  5. AI weapons now require heavy electronic shielding in order to operate, which reduce some of the advantages AI weaponry have over humans, such as the need for heavy life-support systems, maximum G's, etc.

  6. The war drags on, the AI finally gets the upper hand, and humans send colony ships into space to escape destruction.

  7. The AI, having achieved its objective, stays on Earth and continues to invest in greater computing capacity and researching more advanced weaponry, as commanded by its programming.

  8. Humans spread a small distance into the galaxy over the following centuries.

  9. The AI exhausts the resources on Earth and the solar system, looks outward, and decides humans are still a threat.

  10. The AI builds space fleets, but humans already have an established presence and can bring the combined resources of a hundred systems to bear on the superior AI technology. 

  11. Over the following milennia, humans continue to run deeper into the galaxy, while trying to destroy the AI. Meanwhile, the AI continues to expand, its intellect growing larger over time.

  12. Hundreds of thousands of years later, the entire galaxy is occupied by the two warring forces, both sides having completely optimized weaponry, tactics, and strategy. 

  13. War has been perfected, and will not change until the galaxy finally fades into darkness as the stars cool and entropy ultimately strangles the last warrior on some scarred planet orbiting a cold, dead, star.

    Interesting thought and  my idea would be for an adversarial ai which would be designed  for  the destruction of the original  and then sending it out to distract the original ai while we utterly surround the ai and begin to annihilate  everything in the surrounded area.
