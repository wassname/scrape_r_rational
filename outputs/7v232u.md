## It has been 48 days since r!Animorphs chapter 44 came out. I'm beginning to crack.

### Post:

We all know /u/TK17Studios is busy with rationalist bootcamp and other writing projects, but I think flakes of my soul are starting to crack and fall off waiting for the next update. No word from the author and no update in sight. Help me. Help me.

I guess what I'm trying to say is...

  More than a year since the preview for the next "the games we play" book was posted and 2 months since the last HP natural 20 update after a year+ hiatus.

  I think the best way to read these might be to just wait until a book is finished.

    You know, I was getting kind of antsy because I'd gone more than a week without updating *Worth the Candle*, but that sort of puts it in perspective.

    (The last *A Song of Ice and Fire* book came out 2399 days ago, and it's been 1769 days since the second book in the *Kingkiller Chronicles* series was released, if that helps further put wait times in perspective.)

      Different strokes and all. On one end, you have GRRM and Rothfuss, and on the other you have writing machine like Sanderson. 

      P.S. I remember you mentioning an onset of SAD. Is that still the culprit behind the update schedule change?
      ```

      - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
        ```
        Mostly. It's more that two of the things that help most with SAD, sleeping proper hours and exercising, eat up so much of my writing time. I've been sort of cutting into my sleeping time once again, which I think has paid dividends in terms of output but definitely also starts to show up in my mood; I'll be more comfortable doing that as the days start to get longer. I wouldn't say that I'm suffering from SAD now, more that I'm chafing under the treatments.

        But the other thing is that I've just been writing longer chapters, and grouping those chapters together, which makes it seem like less writing. I wrote 12,000 words in the last 8 days, which is 1,500 words per day, and (IMO) would look more impressive as 3,000 word chapters every other day than what it's going to be, which is probably three +5,000 word chapters a few days from now.

        As for why *that's* been happening, it's partly that I like to group things by their plot beats, and those plot beats have gotten longer, and it's partly that added complexity means that I want to have more time to think about (and edit) things after they're written. Might change after the current book is done and there's a different subject that gets a different treatment?

        (Stephen King has said that you should never spend longer than a season writing a book, because your writing will naturally change with the seasons and the things you wanted to capture will shift in your head, and there might be some of that going on too.)

          As a reader I’ve really appreciated how you group the plot beats together and find it well worth the wait.

          That explains why all his books have such weird endings lol

          I'm very glad to hear that 12k words of Worth The Candle is coming.  Will look forward to that!

          Don't have much to say, other than that I enjoy and appreciate your work. Been anxiously awaiting the next chapter, but I'm all for waiting if it makes it even better. Kudos to you, /u/cthulhuraejepson.

          ... Still the best nom de plume ever, IMO. Or at least the best this month ;-)

      GRRM IS NOT AN EXCUSE

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    But then you might never experience some great stories because the fact is many of them will never be finished (fanfiction and other online stories especially). I think the best way to read them is to just enjoy each chapter for what it's worth. Or being a bit more sardonic: adapt ratfic tenet #1 to "neatly wrapped endings don't happen solely because the plot requires it."

      I don't really enjoy reading unfinished stories if there are lots of big cliffhangers.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        Pretty much every chapter of r!Animorphs is cliffhangered, and the most recent ones worse than most.

    How poetic. The eyelash hairs are palpable.

  For every literary masterpiece that gets completed, I'm guessing there are probably more which don't. It's just that it's only people who read serial novels who are aware of this fact. For everyone else, they only read works that are already completed.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    r!Animorphs will be completed within the next 15 months unless I die or have a drastically disastrous change in circumstances.

    You forgot about people like me who read webcomics. At least you get whole chapters from updates instead of single pages.

  The last two chapters took a lot out of me. I'm holding out hope that somehow everyone is magically okay.

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Well we don't know how many or even who is going to die because it's more or less random who everyone morphs into as they die. On the plus side, as long as even one of them survives everyone is going to make it assuming they ever get some method of creating additional bodies from morph forms.
    ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    They took a lot out of me, as well.  <3

  Energy energy energy. Sending good vibes your way.

  (Of course a caveat that we know that,  like cheese, bananas, and viewers of Michael Bay films, a good story needs time to mature, and we don't want to rush you if you are not ready.)

    Reporting in.  Uh.  ... AMA?
    ```

    - u/royishere:
      ```
      Would you rather fight 100 visser three-sized ducks, or one duck-sized visser three?

      Assume that Visser Three is controlling the body of a duck that is not currently morph-capable. He is not allowed to leave the duck, nor is he allowed time to plan.

      The ducks are the size of the visser's andalite body. They are also hungry.
      ```

    - u/Mowtom_:
      ```
      Assuming the AMA is serious:

      Can you give a date by which you are 50% confident the next chapter will be published?
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        50% confident by Feb 11 (late PM PST)
        80% confident by Feb 14

        A lot of this has to do with the fact that I've done a sprint of work and have specifically slotted some time "off" in the next 14 days.
        ```

            Have been writing today.  Will be doing some writing tomorrow and Friday.  Somewhat hesitant to make another formal prediction?  But I have as an accountability goal in other contexts (e.g. work, house) to finish the chapter by Tuesday.
