## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [It's been recommended here before](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/do0x61/rt_c_ff_demonology_and_the_triphasic_model_of/), but not in a Monday Request and Recommendation thread, so I'll throw it out:

  [Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593) is a fanfic of the [Good Omens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens_(TV_series\)) TV series, though I've only read the books and didn't miss much.

  The premise: After the events in the book, mostly everyone "normal" forgets about the almost-apocalypse. Crowley and Aziraphale move in together. However, Crowley still gets flashbacks to when he drove to Aziraphale's book shop and found it in flames with his partner nowhere nearby. At his partner's urging, he books an appointment with psychotherapist Aubrey Thyme. The story is told from her PoV, and is rational - perhaps even rationalist - in that the characters have their own consistent personalities and goals, their own hangups, and strategies. 

  The story uses the therapist's PoV very well, in that it talks about the current state of psychotherapeutical research and common strategies. The beginning was especially amusing, because Thyme is a very sharp and observant person, but she has *absolutely* no frame of reference to approach a literal demon with.

  The book managed to keep my interest throughout, and I almost read it in one sitting. It sticks the landing, too, and leaves the characters with a satisfying conclusion.

      > How much canon knowledge is required to fully understand and appreciate the story?

      Fully understand: very little - you find out about all the relevant background information as Aubrey does. There *is* something that Crowley refuses to tell her and you never find out what it is in the story, but it's not required. 

      Appreciate: you will not appreciate this story unless you've either read Good Omens or watched the recent miniseries. It is fan wank of the highest caliber, giving closure to a story you didn't even realize needed it.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Hm, Crowley and Aziraphale's arc is roughly half the story. That would be required knowledge. The second half is barely touched on at all.

      I'll put the relevant bits in spoiler:

      >!After the Earth was created 6000 years ago, Crowley was the snake who tempted Eve into eating the apple of knowledge. Aziraphale was the Angel who guarded the gate to Eden through which Adam and Even were exiled; he gave them his flaming sword. They were then sent out by respectively Heaven and Hell to keep tabs on humans and further their respective sides' agenda. However, they both came to... apprechiate Humanity, and each other's company, more than their superiors.!<

      >!Azi set up a bookstore, while Crowley had an apartment. Both often met up during their tasks, tipping each other off about bullshit their bosses were pulling, small favours like that.!<

      >!So when Crowley gets the task to start the apocalypse, the Final Battle, he and Aziraphale work together to stop it. I *think* in the TV show they have an argument about running away from earth to Alpha Centauri, but I'm not quite clear on it, it wasn't in the book but is referenced in the fic.!< 

      >!Then Azi is sent to heaven while his bookstore is burnt down by a Witch hunter, and Crowley arrives on the scene to find the store burning and his friend missing. Later, they meet up and stop the apocalypse (part of the second half of the plot which is irrelevant for the fic).!< 

      >!In the end Heaven and Hell try to execute them via respectively holy water and hellflame for being traitors, butt hat fails, because they switched bodies and thus were immune to the chosen execution method (this is not in the book, but I looked it up because it is relevant for the fic). Now everyone is afraid of them because they don't know *what* they are, and leaves them alone.!<

  I'd like to remove my recommendation for the Lightbringer series by Brent Weeks.. Last book came out, and while it's great and the ending is satisfying I don't think people here would enjoy it. I'll keep it at that to avoid spoilers if needed I can elaborate.

        I would be genuinely unsurprised if people in the world of Delve are intentionally bad at math - like the upper classes keep things like the concept of zero and decimal number systems (not to mention calculus or linear algebra) away from the populace, because this is literally a world where math can be converted into power.

          This one can kinda be explained because Rain apparently did something very risky/dumb when he got >!a rare class and overmana'ed, which allows him to learn really fast.!< So he can mentally min/max his build mentally because the hardest part is remembering the calculations, not the calculation themselves.

          I kinda doubt they don't know math because you need math for all sorts of things: construction, finance, trade, cooking, medicine, manufacturing, tax collection, just off the top of my head. Though I think they don't have a standard system to measure distance either (IIRC everything is "strides" so I'm not sure if that's relative or what). The upper classes could be keeping advanced maths a secret, but that would make life (for them) harder in general.

          Or it could be an over-reliance on their system interfaces, that gives them what they need so they only do very basic calculations or just go with what feels right.

          e: maybe spoilers
          ```

          - u/Retbull:
            ```
            At least one person has stated they don't understand the concept of zero. It's not crazy to think they might not have math.
            ```

            - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
              ```
              They understand the *concept* of nothing, they just don't have a *symbol* for it. Rain also explained it really badly - he used "1" and "10" and how adding 0*10 to 100 gives you 100. Which makes sense to us, but there's no reason someone using a different system would get that. Roman numerals worked well for almost 2000 years without a zero.

              I think the idea of having nothing, or no effect, shows they get the concept. But the idea that *nothing can be something* is kinda hard to wrap your head around. It took us until the 13th century before we got 0. We invented calculus and algebra without 0 being around.

              e: This is how Jamus explained to Rain why they got along without it,

              >“See here? These are numbers in my language. That there is the symbol for ‘one’, and those two together mean ‘ten’. The round character on the end is a zero. When you write a one and a zero next to each other like that, you get ten. Two ones next to each other make eleven, a one and a two is twelve, and so on.”


              >“Oh, I think I’ve heard of this.” Jamus said, “The position of the digits matters, right? Twelve is one ten plus two ones?”

              >“Yup, you got it. So ten is one ten plus zero ones. A hundred is one hundred, zero tens, and zero ones. Written like this, see?” Rain pointed. “The zeros are there to pad out the number, that way you know the one is in the hundred’s place.”

              >“Humm. I can see the appeal, but-”

              >“But what?” Rain sighed in exasperation. “These are much easier to work with than your numbers are. See here?” He pointed to some scribbles on the opposing page. “I was trying to do math with the value system you all seem to use, but it did not go well. I had to keep converting back and forth. How do you even multiply anything with these?”

              >“Most people don’t bother, or at least, not to that level,” Jamus said, nodding to the cramped script in Rain’s notebook. “For day-to-day life, simple ratios are enough. Overkill, even. Knowing that a skill will boost damage by one part in ten is good enough.”

              >“Come on! You just used a fraction for crying out loud! How can’t you have zero!?”

              >“I don’t know what to tell you, Rain,” Jamus shrugged. “As I said, I’ve heard of systems like the one you are describing, but it isn’t what I was raised with. Some people don’t even see numbers when they interact with the system. If you want to know more, you’ll have to talk to a real scholar, not just a dabbler like me. Remind me to introduce you to Staavo when we get back to Fel Sadanis. I think you’d get along.”
              ```

              - u/IICVX:
                ```
                Basically, Rain is _literally the worst teacher ever_. 

                But yeah a lot of the math he does is only "easy" because he's using a modern numeral system. Division in Roman numerals is dang hard. Which is why it wouldn't surprise me if noble scholars have their own system of mathematics.
                ```

                - u/Bowbreaker:
                  ```
                  Rain is generally not the brightest or most knowledgeable. In the latest chapter he claimed that in his world people don't really have servants/house keepers beyond the super rich and actually believed it. And in general he's really bad at explaining anything from his own world ever. He's also oblivious to how his "cool outfit" makes him look to others. But the worst one yet was when he accurately told the cops just how big of a threat he is.
                  ```

                  - u/IICVX:
                    ```
                    > But the worst one yet was when he accurately told the cops just how big of a threat he is.

                    "Hello, is this the police? Yes I'd like to report that I can turn an entire city block around myself into a flaming maelstrom with a single thought. How often can I do that? Why, pretty much whenever! And with no outward warning, either! It's just like flipping a switch, bam everything's on fire. Sure, I'll just stay right here while the bomb squad swings by. It's funny how they call them a bomb squad and not a bomb *defusal* squad, you know, since their job is to- oh, this is the **actual** bomb squad, armed with bombs? Cool, I'd love to meet them!"

                    That's Rain.
                    ```

                    - u/Bowbreaker:
                      ```
                      I'm just happy that as of yet he still seems to be believably stupid, as opposed to holding out-of-character idiot balls. Or at least enough so that my SoD remains more or less intact.
                      ```

                      - u/meterion:
                        ```
                        Eh, he's very close to being "Too Dumb To Live" in my opinion. Or at least, he's never holding an idiot ball because the idiot ball was baked into his very character. It's only thanks to smarter characters babysitting his mistakes that he hasn't ended up in a shallow grave somewhere

                        My issue with Rain is that he seems incapable of learning. Even after he gets burned time and time again for showing off his unbalanced magical abilities, he just goes ahead and does it again. He is incapable of keeping a low profile mere hours after thinking how fragile his build is.

                        Literally this dude gets back from multiple brushes with death, the need to be discreet hammered into him, and the first thing he does is charge thousands of mana into heating pads in minutes, in a quest that almost everyone in the guild is probably familiar with and will know how abnormal that is. Let alone the above-discussed "hey dudes who are supposed to protect towns from OP adventurers, have I ever told you that I could kill hundreds of people here in less than a second with no warning, and have previously displayed no hesitation about using unknown AoE spells in public?"
                        ```

                        - u/Bowbreaker:
                          ```
                          I'd say that he simply hasn't internalized that people could target him personally due to his abilities and otherwise is used to fully disclosing useful information. But then if he were that trusting, why does he literally walk through town *and* sleep in armor despite having been repeatedly told that it makes him look bad.
                          ```

                          - u/xamueljones:
                            ```
                            I thought that armor thing was brilliantly done. It's a way to show Rain's slowly increasing paranoia about getting hurt or killed without being too obvious. Rain has literally never taken off the armor ever since he first put it on.

                            It's not stated out right, but Rain is *scared* to be defenseless without his armor. It's just that he has a tendency to overshare with those he trusts so it looks like he is being naive. Remember that he actually *understated* his damage output to the Watch when it wouldn't result in a lie.
                            ```

                        - u/xamueljones:
                          ```
                          I feel it only looks like Rain isn't learning because it seems like less time has passed than it really has. Rain hasn't spent very much time in the world by the latest chapter. It's only been a month and he's been having language difficulties for the first few weeks.

                          I've read ahead in the patreon chapters and Rain is getting more discreet, but I think the author is showing him learning incrementally. First Rain is learning to not say anything explicit to the Watch other than what's needed to answer the questions. Then he's learning to hold back with his skills instead of going as strong as he can.

                          It's just a bit slow.
                          ```

                      ```
                      It seems pretty clear to me that the had some kind of unknown magical truth detection going on there, and he is not smart enough to lawyer lie by stating this that are true in a misleading manner. He probably would have been caught out if he tried to lie

  - u/GlimmervoidG:
    ```
    You could try the Orthogonal trilogy by Greg Egan. It's an alternate reality where the universe has a positive-definite Riemannian metric, rather than a pseudo-Riemannian metric (i.e. our universe.) An entire alternate physics spills out from there, which the characters exploit to save their world. One of the things it does is occasionally stop the action and pose thought experiments which demonstrate elements of cosmology. For example, red light is slower than violet light, so why is the sun white? (Because it doesn't matter how fast an individual photon is. If you send out 10 red photons and 10 violet photons, they're all going to reach the destination at some point. Since the rate of entry is the same, the rate of exit will also be the same).

  I've been enjoying [Nanocultivation Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy) recently - it's somewhat rational, in that it spends some time exploring what it would mean to have easy self-replicating nanotech, a post-singularity intelligence, a litrpg-ish system, and what xianxia-style cultivation could be for.

  The first three or so chapters are a bit dire, and I don't think you'd miss anything particularly important if you skipped straight to chapter 4, but at that point it really takes off; the story manages to blend good cheer with a post-apocalyptic setting in a really intriguing way.

    *[Isekai Speedrun](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21107/isekai-speedrun)*

    >✓isekai

    >~LitRPG

    >✓good worldbuilding

    I don’t think this story’s been recommended here before. The premise is of a speedrunner that’s specialising on a particular game accidentally ending up in that game when trying to find yet another glitch to shave off some more time from his runtimes. The writer likely drew inspiration from Castlevania / Metroidvania games, as well as games like Dark Souls and Mass Effect.

    PROs:

    * excellent worldbuilding — meticulous and carefully designed locations, characters, world lore, and character backstories;
    * the writer’s [ShownTheirWork](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShownTheirWork) about speedrunning communities, as well as their mentality, subculture slang, and so on;
    * good-to-excellent characterisations: the protag feels like a speedrunner, the vigeogame’s main characters have unique and detailed backgrounds, the videogame is populated with random encounters that can leave an impression, etc;
    * due to its premise has a vibe of mid-to-late chapters of a time loop story;
    * features some beautifully implemented rare-to-encounter ideas. 

    CONs:

    * the first several chapters are a bit rough around the edges;
    * the story’s technically abandoned after the ending of the first plot arc. That plot arc itself can be treated as a good enough ending point though;
    * a few eventually revealed (non-critical) explanations are somewhat lacking;
    * ? it’s not trying to meet the established standards and expectations of a "properly well written" story;
    * ? to me, at least, it felt like the game’s characters’ personalities became somewhat subdued in the second half of the story to accommodate the planned plot progression. Though perhaps this could be explained by the protag being able to "push the right buttons" due to knowing from all his replays how each character would react to a range of possible inputs.

The main character, a Chinese keyboard warrior, was isekai-ed into the body of a recently dead magically-induced suicide victim in Magic Britain, trying to find a way home in a deadly world.

    The first volume builds up slowly and felt like a magic buddy cop webnovel, but the end of the first arc made me fall in love.

      It's well written, but I wouldn't call it rational, particularly the worldbuilding. The constant war, death and destruction really shouldn't be sustainable.

      The LitRPG aspect is light. There are classes and skills, but those are automatically assigned. No munchkinry whatsoever.

      There are an Antinium (ant people) civilisation and goblin tribes though. Those are pretty unique.

        That's occasionally lampshaded though, so I suspect there's some unrevealed backstory that explains it.

        And people do try and munchkin their builds by concentrating on activities that promote the build they want, or refrain from activities that might lead to undesirable builds.

    That one felt like a real bait and switch. The first few books made it seem like it was going to be an uplift/technology overwhelms magic type series and by the end it completely switches to where the tech/uplift is back burnered pretty heavily. It wasn't bad, but I was caught off guard by the change.

      Have you ever read an uplift story with a sattisfying ending? Almost always you there is something wrong with it. I like the over rushed approach he took here.

  I'd love to read more transhumanist/posthuman novels. For example, I've enjoyed all of the following:

  * *[Quarantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine_(Egan_novel\))*, *[Permutation City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City)* and *[Schild's Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schild%27s_Ladder)* by Greg Egan
  * *[Blood Music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Music_(novel\))* by Greg Bear
  * *[Icon-Violet](https://www.amazon.com/Icon-Violet-Simon-Fay-ebook/dp/B01LY1S4O0/)* by Simon Fay 
  * *[Recursion](https://www.amazon.com/Recursion-Tony-Ballantyne/dp/0553589288)* by Tony Balantine
  * *[Blindsight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight_(Watts_novel\))* and *[Echopraxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echopraxia_(novel\))* by Peter Watts

  Can anyone recommend books/webserials with similar themes that explore the concept of identity and changing facets of the human condition in distant futures?

  I'd be interested in any stories which focus on the philosophical implications of: human society evolving so far as to be barely recognizable by today's standards, humanity making itself obsolete, consciousness upload, people editing their own personalities, consciousness copies, etc.

    [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) takes place in an alternate 1920ies, but the later arcs dive into that sort of stuff a lot.

    Premise: The British Crown continued the Frankenstein experiments, and conquered the world with zombie armies. 200 years later, Academies keep pushing the envelope of what's biologically possible, to enhance a ruling class of Nobles. Main characters are a group of Academy projects who were created in vats or from human children. Twig is the story of them growing up.

    Not yet mentioned, Charlie Stross's _Accelerando_ and _Glasshouse_.
    ```

    - u/-main:
      ```
      Gonna second the recommendation for Glasshouse, as far as far-future works dealing with complexity of post-human identity go. 

      I don't think Accelerando is nearly as good these days, tbh. The early chapters were trying to be 5-minutes-into-the-future in the early 2000's, and some of the cultural references haven't aged well.

        It was assembled out of a bunch of short stories, and his first “novel”, but the concepts it surfaces are fascinating.

    I really liked [Diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_\(novel\)) by Greg Egan as well. It's tied with Schild's Ladder for my favorite Greg Egan book, and it ticks pretty much every box in your comment.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      Also _Incandescence_. It's like the soeciety of Diaspora in a galaxy that's full of life.

    The Quantum Thief and its sequels are an excellent example of this topic.

    Alastair Reynolds does a pretty good far-future transhumanist story - I'd start with Revelation Space.

    There's also Richard K. Morgan's Altered Carbon, which explores identity versus body in a world where both can be swapped around at will. Also, ultraviolence. 

    There's David Brin's Kiln People, which again is all about identity and stuff. Unfortunately it's a one-shot, not a series. 

    If you just want unrecognizably far future madness, there's Dan Simmons' Hyperion series - it's got tech so far advanced it's basically magic. 

    Some of Iain M. Banks' novels also deal with identity though I don't know if it's a major theme most of the time; you might particularly like the opening of Excession, though.

    [Homo Deus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus) is a speculative pop-sci books about the future. It mostly bases itself in how trends from the past are likely to change the future, but isn't particularly optimistic if that's what you're after. It's not an amazing book, but entertaining enough. Picked it up before a 8 hour train trip and never continued where I left off. 

    If you're okay with fanfiction there's [Psi Effect](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/psi-effect-aka-chryssalid-writes-a-me-xcom-crossover.303390/). X-com operatives go undercover posing as Asari to infiltrate the Citadel. Everything you mentioned play part in the story, but if you're just after philosophy there's thousands of comments in the two threads discussing everything you talked about. (No knowledge of Mass Effect or X-com required, it's very detached from canon. I read it before I played x-com)

  Just got caught up with [A Hero’s War](https://m.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War) it’s a pretty fun fantasy uplift story similar to [Destiny’s Crucible](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01I8DTAKQ?notRedirectToSDP=1&ref_=dbs_mng_calw_0&storeType=ebooks) , but with magic.

  Currently looking for anything similar.

  I started reading [Moonlight](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28420/moonlight) recently. So far it's pretty good, though I'm only about five chapters in. It's about a transsexual man living in a society that is pretty segregated: men learn to fight, women to heal. He's expected to be a good daughter, grow up to be a healer, and have kids. 

  The story follows the MC as he tries to find a place where he can be himself without being burned at the stake for being a heretic.

  I am late to it but I feel like the show Goblin Slayer is super crunchy rationalist.  However no one noticed becuase it was anime as hell.
  ```

  - u/kmsxkuse:
    ```
    Anime is perfectly fine here. One of the few regularly upvoted content here is a Dragonball Z fanfic and another is a Naruto fanfic. I cant quite remember their names off the top of my head. If you look through the recommendations, recommendations are often categorized by anime work they're based off of.

    Goblin Slayer though is one of the mainstream munchkin anime but there not much pushing the boundaries of munchkind.

    Yes, its rational but the plot itself is fairly shallow. That could just be the flaws if the translation though. I can count on one hand good translated eastern literature and not a single one of them I would consider good enough to even surpass simple english crack fics.

    It's a good introduction to munchkining and rational literature in general.
    ```

    - u/VapeKarlMarx:
      ```
      I kinda liked how the plot was shallow.  It was more relatable.

      If you think about rational fiction like worm there isn't as much that relates to a regular setting. I am not talking shit, just like emotionally I don't connect with superheros as well.  I can emotionally empathize with my tool getting dirty and not working like the swords in goblin Slayer though.
