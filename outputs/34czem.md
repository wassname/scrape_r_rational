  ```
  * [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](http://www.smbc-comics.com/): lots of math, science fiction, graph jokes, multi-layered humor, updates every goddamned day, don't forget about the red button, [here's my favorite](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305)
  * NSFW! [Oglaf](http://oglaf.com/): exceptionally funny, lots of deconstructions of fantasy tropes, often dirty, [here's my favorite](http://oglaf.com/labyrinth/)
  * [Bouletcorp](http://english.bouletcorp.com/): wonderful art, interesting stories, delivered at random intervals, often long-form comics, [here's my favorite](http://english.bouletcorp.com/2014/09/05/kingdom-lost/)
  ```

    Bouletcorp is lovely! Unused to reading the long form ones though.
    ```

  - u/Airgineer1:
    ```
    That Bouletcorp strip was quite good. Thanks for sharing!
    ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    Holy cow, he inked [that whole picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9B9pOSWFCE) from scratch with no guide lines or anything.
    ```

  - u/ancientcampus:
    ```
    Oh, wow! I'd never read Boulet's stuff before (save for Augie and the Green Knight which I'm still waiting on), but that comic was awesome. Thanks!
    ```

  ```
  [Kill six billion demons](http://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/kill-six-billion-demons-chapter-1/). Simply amazing. Otherworldly. Lots and lots of giant, busy pages of surreal landscapes. Don't worry about the early artwork; it switches to full color pretty quick.
  ```

  Looking for group:

  Some murderous PCs change the word. 

  Mystic revolution:

  VR mmo. Unlike SAO, this one actually behaves like the internet

  Wayrift:

  sequel to final fantasy IV (no need to play the game, but it helps)

  Homestuck

  Paradox Space:

  Homestuck semi-cannon fancomics

  Erfworld (This one is especially good):

  Strategy gamer goes to a silly sounding but surprisingly gritty strategy game world where everything is a pun.

  Vattu/Rice Boy:

  Set in overside, a world reminiscent of the wizard of oz and alice in wonerland. 

  Planet of hats:

  Star trek tos parodys

  darths and doids:

  what if star wars was a tabletop rpg camapien 

  nerd rage/awkward zombie:

  video game jokes

  the gamer:

  In a world of anime metahumans, one young man gets the power to interact with the world like its some kind of mmorpg. *furious munchkinery intensifies*

  tower of god:

  many world are contained within the tower. many try to cimb to the top and find riches and power, but few sucessed. Amazing character design, epic combat, just go read it.

  xkcd:

  if you haven't read it, just do

  (terrible) summaries ~~eventually~~ now

  Look at the other recomandations they have stuff the I'm too lazy to put up here

  I can't believe no one has mentioned [ Unsounded](http://www.casualvillain.com/Unsounded/comic/ch01/ch01_01.html) yet. You see that first page? THE ENTIRE COMIC IS THAT PRETTY AND IT UPDATES **THREE TIMES A WEEK**.

  The artist makes great use of the medium in other ways; some panels extend far beyond normal page size, or move in subtle ways. Characters are all great, contains many fun dialogues and just read it already.
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Check out www.sssscomic.com , whole comic is just gorgeous as well. Less manga-y and updates *five times a week*.
    ```

    This is fantastic.

  ```
  [Order of the Stick](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html) doesn't seem to have been mentioned. It's neat.
  ```

- u/Timewinders:
  ```
  [It's a Hard Life](http://itsahardlife.smackjeeves.com/comics/1214481/chapter-1-page-1-cover/) is a pokemon comic series that tells a story about a Nuzlocke run (basically, if a pokemon faints then it's considered dead and you can't use it again). Not rational at all, but the story is surprisingly touching and has high stakes because the pokemon can die at any time. It also makes the unusual decision of having the pokemon be able to speak, which I think works since it means the story has a pretty varied cast even though it focuses on the joourney of a single trainer. It also has more of an impact that way when one of the pokemon dies.
