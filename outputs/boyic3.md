  This has actually grabbed me - I'm going to keep following this.

  Anyone who gets stuck on chapter 2, there's no link to chapter 3 at the bottom - you'll have to find another route.

    Thanks for letting me know. I've fixed this and added a link to the bottom of Chapter 2 to get to the third. There is also a link in the menu which takes you to the latest chapter, and a table of contents. 

    Appreciate the note!

  Hmm. Seems well written, and the first chapter was captivating enough to make me want to keep reading. I'll be interested to see where this goes!

  >!The comment about willpower was interesting. It could have referred to resisting social pressure, or curiosity - or perhaps, a magical effect.!<
