  I noticed it's been a while since this was posted here (https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6bhvej/marked_for_death_chapter_127_applying_a_pin/, 1 year ago).

  Granted, I think it never got much discussion because, well, it's posted on a forum, a lot of the chatter happens there.
  Still, for any new redditors, look here, it's alive and going strong.

    There's a [story-only thread](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest-story-only.24793/) for those of us who just want to read a great story.

    I don't know whether I can sell it that well. Worldbuilding-wise, it's naruto fanfiction, but one where the authors take liberties to make the world make some sense. The world benefits from adversary optimisation - all the quest players are looking for 'obvious' exploits or inconsistencies in the world, and those are either fixed, incorporated into the world as something people were already doing, or exploited by the main character.

    The story itself is about a team of ninja who are forced to defect from their village as they are sent on a suicide mission. The main character's (who is largely controlled by the quest players) goals evolve pretty quickly from "let's survive" to "this world is fucked up, let's fix it". Queue adventure!

    That's the rationalist-fiction-appealing part. Add a sprinkle of humour, heartbreaking characters, great ambition, and a sprinkling of RNG ensuring fights are not completely predictable.

      You mean Cue adventure.

      As for the quest, the authors have taken great pains to ensure that the setting makes sense and every actor is rational.

    What makes this story worth reading to me is the amazing characterization. 

    All the characters are rational, have agency, and feel more real than any other story I've read.

    Also it's a quest. ~~There is no plot~~; what happens is determined by player decisions and dice rolls. It's a fun change of pace from the usual story.

      Actually, there is. There's a QM timeline with things going on in the background that will be very much in the foreground at a certain point. Some interesting upcoming dates on that timeline.

        A romcom with plot? Unheard of!
        ```

        I'll look forward to it. Thanks for the effort!
