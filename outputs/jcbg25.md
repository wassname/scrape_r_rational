## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  Among Us is a rational game. All gameplay is founded on deduction, planning, and charisma, rather than mechanical skill. And as compared to games like 'werewolf', personal popularity matters significantly less.

  Would recommend.

  An incomplete taxonomy of sports and bar games

  Been thinking about this a bit, seems like the kind of nonsense you all would enjoy.

  **Goal games**: Two teams compete to get the same object to goals on the opposite ends of the play area.
  The pure version - just get the ball to that side of the field - is pretty dumb. Picking up the ball
  and running to the goal with it is boring (and requires tackling to be stopped), so most versions invent
  some reason you can't do that, like a handling restriction (feet only, sticks only), movement restriction
  (no running with the ball) or awkward field (iceskates, horseback, water). The other problem that's typically
  addressed is throwing the object into the goal, which is usually handled by making the goal small and putting
  a dedicated goal-keeper in front, sometimes handled by putting the goal somewhere hard to reach (basketball),
  or sometimes handled by requiring someone catch the object in the goal (American football, ultimate frisbee).

  Examples include football, the other football, basketball, hockey, lacrosse, polo, rugby, ultimate
  frisbee, and handball. In video games there's Rocket League, and in bar games there's foosball.

  These tend to be the most popular sports.

  It's pretty easy to invent a new one of these by coming up with a reason you can't just run with the ball.
  For example, I'm not aware of any versions that stop this by making the ball too awkward to handle, which
  could be done by using a very large beach ball.

  MOBAs (League of Legends, DOTA, et all) are very distant cousins that use three "objects" on three fields,
  which might be an interesting angle to explore. Take some ball game, give it three fields,
  allow players (but not balls) to freely run between fields, and give each team between 2x and 3x the
  usual number of players, so they're always a little short.


  **Net games**: Two teams with two separate play areas compete to make the object touch the ground in the
  opposing team's play area. Typically there's a net the object has to go over, which prevents just spiking
  the object directly into the ground. Some of these are played by hitting the object directly and some are
  played by hitting the object with a racket.

  Examples include tennis, badminton, table tennis, and volleyball.

  These tend to be less popular than goal games. I suspect because the net restricts the maximum size of the
  play field (anything more than one throw / racket hit away from the net is unreachable), and popular games
  tend to be physically large.


  **Safe haven games**: One member of one team throws the object to a member of the second team, who attempts
  to hit it into the field. Doing so successfully permits the second team to run around on the field in an
  attempt to complete laps before the object is retrieved. Some areas of the field are "safe" for runners,
  in all other areas the player can be removed by someone posessing the object. Yeah, baseball and cricket
  are weird games.

  Examples include baseball, cricket, kickball, softball, and tee ball.

  These are not as popular as goal games, but there are countries where one of these is the biggest sport.

  I feel like these would be improved by making the challenge easier and the field more complex,
  so the question becomes where to hit the ball, rather than whether the ball can be hit. Like kickball but
  with more bases, branching choices of bases, and bases to the sides of and behind the kicker.

  **Target games**: Two teams take turns to land an object as close to the center of the target as possible.

  In games where the object travels perpendicular to the target, teams take all their shots at once and
  get points based on where they land. Examples include darts, archery, and shooting.

  In games where the object travels parallel to the target, teams take turns making shots, possibly moving
  the opponent's objects, and at the end only shots closer to the target than all opponent's shots are scored.
  Examples include curling, shuffleboard, crokinole, and bocce ball.

  The version of scoring used by the parallel games just seems flat out more interesting.

  It might be interesting to combine one of these with the pitching element from a safe haven game.

  Has anyone here read the Japanese light novel So I’m a Spider, So What? It’s rational, or at least rational adjacent, and definitely the best litrpg isekai out there, and the best of the traditional JP isekais.

  Everything in the story has a purpose or deeper meaning. The System actually has a very important role and meaning, and it’s mechanics are pretty interesting. The MC is full of personality and approaches her situation quite rationally, although she can be a bit goofy at times, but never to the detriment of the story. And the few decision fuck ups serve to further her character growth and fix her flaws and understanding of herself.

  She’ll grind out her skills, even constantly damaging herself or setting herself on fire to train her abilities up to the max. In particular she sets out to give a new companion the most optimized training regimen possible, which stomps all over most of the other people in the world, old and super powerful beings excluded.

  The author is also quite masterful in crafting his story, he loves to put in red herrings and sneaky foreshadowing throughout the series, and the major plot twists never feel cheap.

  The character writing in this series is handled really well, the interactions, backstories, and quirks of all the characters really play into their relationships with each other. Every character’s backstory from their previous life, their experience in their new life, and their goals all play an important part to the character as a whole and to the overarching story, it’s handled really well, like in the crucial details that set the monster reincarnations apart from the rest of the reincarnations, or Katia feeling conflicted about going from a boy in his previous life to a noblewoman now, and her conflicting emotions towards her previously best friend. There’s also the POVs of other characters, in particular another isekai’d classmate, who reincarnates as a human prince and is in the complete opposite of the MC’s position and is your “typical generic isekai protagonist.” This dynamic is actually one of the best parts of the series, it puts into perspective all of the MC’s struggles and beliefs and strength, and plays an important role in the story, especially in the effectiveness of each person’s goals and their motivation as they fight on two opposing sides of a conflict.

  This series is really phenomenal, it’s essentially the typical JP isekai, but made perfect. I’m surprised I’ve never seen it mentioned on the sub before, it’s to JP isekai like what Cradle(and FMoC) is to xianxia.

    I'm reading the very-slowly-updating manga. It mostly lives off of the "I'm a spider" thing, very little of the subtle writing you describe seems to have made it over. I'd say its good, but kinda average? Solid craft but not more.
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      I’m going to be honest, I think the manga is a very poor adaptation of the light novel. The story is generally split into two portions, the first part with the MC grinding levels in the labyrinth and generally more comedy-oriented and generic, while the rest of the story takes place in the overarching world, with interactions between the other characters and a focus on the larger plot. This latter part of the story is where all the great writing and plot reveals that totally change the perception of the story come into play, and the manga hasn’t reached that far.

      The manga seems to go all in on the comedy aspect of the series, and even among the parts of the story it covers, it cuts out the POV of Shun, said human prince and generic isekai protagonist, which takes up half of each volume so far and provides crucial worldbuilding and sets up important plot points and red herrings for the future. 

      The manga is a poor experience of the story that basically cuts out half the content it even covers, and hasn’t reached the shift in the story that really changes the entire story, and won’t reach there for a while at the pace it’s currently releasing. I’d highly recommend the light novels, because the later volumes are spectacular, especially when they delve into the blossoming friendship between Kumoko, Ariel, and Sophia and the plot reveals.

        Absolutely fair. Its just... the manga is one of the better litrpg manga adaptions and its still very mediocre.

          I understand what you mean, litrpgs and especially litrpg isekais are usually pretty bad, the litrpg is usually meant to serve to shore up the author’s weakness in writing combat or a shallow and irrelevant attempt at appealing to readers through a game-esque world. Then they also fall into the shortcomings of the progression fantasy genre, which is very difficult to write well, much less for completely amateur authors which typically tend to write said litrpg and progression fantasy novels.

          I’ve been reading a lot of litrpgs and isekais myself, and I totally understand what you mean. There’s a lot of trash in the genre, especially when the litrpg or isekai aspect doesn’t even matter to the story for many of these series. It can be quite frustrating.

          That’s what I really appreciate about Spider, it’s that the litrpg elements and System actually play a major role in the story. There are lots of mysteries hidden within it, and the way it’s explored and becomes relevant really makes it unique among litrpg isekais.

          Really though, the litrpg and System isn’t even the main focus of Spider, which is why there are occasionally readers that are confused and dislike the series and drop it when the series shifts to focus less on power leveling. At first it seems like it’s just another litrpg grinding-focused novel, but it completely shifts away from that aspect to focus more on character interactions and the plot, which can turn away fans that came for the litrpg. It’s just one part of a larger story, but the way every element of the story comes together is done really well. I was personally very impressed when it became more character-oriented.

          I’ve always found isekai to be a really interesting genre ripe with possibilities, and was constantly disappointed with the same trope-y, low quality, generic, and shallow isekais that don’t take advantage of the setting. Spider takes this set up and actually makes it interesting and well-written in every element, from a litrpg System that’s interesting and important, with even the fact that the reincarnations have “cheats” being extremely important to the overarching plot, a MC that has actual personality and a functioning brain(and one of the better representations of a completely antisocial person), characters that are unique and well-written and add layers and depth to the character interactions, motivations, desires, backgrounds, and contrast against each other in the overarching conflict, and a plot that doesn’t have constant exposition dumps and respects the reader’s intelligence and is actually well-written. The twists and turns, foreshadowing and red herrings, and major reveals are all really well handled and never cheap, and is a lot better than what you’d expect from an isekai. Literally, some of the biggest twists are foreshadowed from the very first chapter or even earlier.

          But perhaps this is all just my bias, overhyping things up has never served well for anyone, so take my words and opinion with a grain of salt. People have different tastes and I might as well have very trash tastes for all you know. This is just what I feel as a person that read to the very latest in both the light novel and web novel, and a lot of these things don’t become apparent until quite a ways in. It’s much better than other litrpg isekais and isekais in general, for however much that’s worth.

          I will 100% say that for those looking for an well-written and unique “normal” isekai, there’s nothing that does the genre better than Spider. The illustrations are really cute too.

    I liked the first half. >!Unfortunately the second half utterly ruined even my enjoyment of the first half. The whole time I was looking forward to what would happen when she finally met people again, only to timeskip and shift perspective away from the only character I actually cared about. Honestly, the second half was a mediocre story only barely related to the first half, excepting how it made all the build up in the first half feel ruined.!<

    I would also like to throw in my praise for this. A lot of the light novel is easily available on Kindle, which makes accessing it far easier to access than other Isekai novels. The writing is fast paced and amusing. The translation is great and easily understandable.  There's more foreshadowing than other LNs I've read and the main character is quirky and excellent to follow.

    Possibly my favorite part of the series is how realistic the characters feel. They're frustrated by the limitations of the system they find themselves in and are afraid of how unknowns might affect them so they're constantly working to gain any edge they can.

  So, I've recently been thinking about the simulation hypothesis for a bit. In short, the simulation hypothesis is the hypothesis that we - our world, out universe, and all that is in it - is all one great big simulation, running on one great big computer.

  Let's step away from the question of 'why' for a moment, and simply consider the mechanics of it. Now, unless the Great Big Computer is capable of literally infinite computation, it's clear that it cannot simulate itself (down to the last decimal place, the last subatomic particle) while also simulating any extra matter. Does that imply that our universe is simulated on a computer bigger than the universe? No, because it is possible to *cheat*. If we don't simulate every last particle to every last decimal place, then we can simulate more matter on less computer.

  Modern FPS games, for example, might simulate a bullet. But they won't simulate every electron, every proton, every neutron in the bullet, saving an inordinate amount of calculation.

  And, interestingly, looking at the physical laws of out universe... I do notice that everything is *quantized*. There's a minimal electrical charge, and all charges are integer multiples of that minimum. (Apparently that minimum is one-third the charge on an electron - you get some quarks that use that one-third figure). If the minimal electrical charge in the universe that holds the Great Big Computer is not quantized, then an immense amount of information can be stored in those further decimal places; allowing a small piece of computronium to hold a much larger piece of our universe.

  The other way that one can cheat is by simulating the universe in parts. Simulate this part for ten seconds, then that part for ten seconds, then that part for ten seconds, and so on - once you've done enough parts, then the entire universe has been simulated (piecemeal) for ten seconds. But, in order to get this right, then you need to be sure that *this* bit of the universe won't (significantly) affect *that* bit for the ten-second interval. And, again, there is a law in our universe that would appear to permit this; relativity tells us that nothing goes faster than light, so as long as those parts are more then ten light-seconds apart, all is good.

  And separate solar systems are *way* more than ten light-seconds apart.

  --------------

  But then it struck me. If, somehow, my vague, idle musing is somehow on track - if these natural laws are indeed in place to make our world more computable (and thus make it possible for an outer universe with indescribably more powerful computers to simulate us), then that implies that the outer universe does *not* have these same limitations in place. That out there, they can have an electrical charge of a zillionth of an electron, or fire a bullet at ten times the speed of light. (Or maybe the speed of light out there is infinite, and everything runs on Newtonian physics).

  But - if that is true - and it seems plausible to me - then it means that we are *not* a simulation of their history. (It's possible that that was originally intended; but as soon as we began to discover these simulated physical laws, as soon as we began, to to speak, to identify the stage settings, then we must have diverged from their history. Slightly at first... but hugely by now).

  And yet... we still exist. Therefore the simulation is still running. And if they weren't running us as a re-run of their own historical eras... then why *is* our simulation still running? What's the point of simulating our universe?

  (I have a few guesses, but I'm interested to hear what other people think)
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    It feels like you're burying *a lot* of assumptions in your reasoning. (eg that whatever forms of life run in the universe simulating ours has values and desires even remotely understandable by us)
    ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      Yeah, there are a lot of assumptions buried in there. It's idle musing, not rigorous study.

      It's certainly possible that the values and desires of the Simulators who run the universe are in some way outside of our experience. However, there doesn't seem to be any sort of interesting way to muse further along those lines...
      ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    The problem with looking at reality and saying "look at how it was designed to be computed" is that computers are subject to the psychical limitations of reality. A large enough simulation built in a reality with speed of light limitations would have to implement similar speed of light limitations in order to operate performantly as an example.

    I think you're mixing up correlation and causation. I suspect you're actually looking at the limitation in our own ability to compute things, but from the other direction.
    ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      I've been trying to avoid limiting my idle musings by the requirements of our world's computation capabilities; though I have been assuming that information theory is the same in our world and in this theoretical outer world, and trying to find the limits of that only. While it's true (for example) that a system built in a reality with speed-of-light limitations will gain better performance from being built with speed-of-light limitations, it also seems true that a system built in a universe *without* speed-of-light limitations would *also* gain performance improvements from being built with speed-of-light limitations. So I don't think that we can (or should) assume that the universe which is simulating us (if we are, indeed, simulated) has those limitations.

    I'm gonna reply in 2 sections first the what then the why.

    ***********

    There is a minimum mass, charge, etc. because infinity is a mathematical impossibility. We use it in calculus but only as a shortcut, and ask any mathematician and they will tell you infinity is not a number and that infinity, as a numerical value, does not exist. If infinity doesn't exist, neither does 1/inf. For this case we have other shortcuts such as the limit of 1/x as x approaches positive infinity, also denoted as 0^+. In this case the shortcut works for calculus but in other types of analysis it's not enough. Thus we have a quantity defined as the smallest positive real number (again in a shortcut sense, it has no actual value) often denoted as ε or ε_0.  But this is another short cut. After all if ε/2 can be calculated then we were wrong about the value of ε.

    What all this boils down to is that the smallest possible number is a finite number.  ε_0 is a countable value despite the fact that we don't usually care what this value is, and just treat it as "basically zero." This is fine. If we multiply anything by ε, we get a number so small that we can usually drop it from the equation without loss of accuracy or generality (unless the entire equation is multiplied in which case we set it to the side as a multiplication factor and work with the rest of the equation). If we add ε to a number we get the same number back with a rounding error so small it may as well not even be there.  But the point of the number in the first place is just as another shortcut to deal with infinite and infinitesimal amounts despite the fact that these are both not amounts, or values, and in fact neither exists in a mathematical sense.

    So where does this leave us? Well, for

    1. conventional mathematics breaks if we don't eventually define a minimum value, because the most basic operations depend on countability, and going below this arbitrary point we use logical analysis methods, or avoid quantifying things in the conventional way, or we define a new smallest number.

    2. ε is not a permittivity constant here.  If the value matters we're getting away from the point of having a value defined as "basically 1/inf but a real number"

    3.  Quarks may be one of the types of elementary particles in the Standard Model, but nobody considers that model to be a final form.  A few decades ago, Hadrons were considered the elementary particles. Several decades ago Atoms were. Before 1905 many scientists even believed Atoms to be an illusion and the closest known thing to an elementary particle may have been a speck of dust or an iron filing if they even considered elementary particles as a meaningful term.

    In conclusion, **tldr**, the smallest numbers we use and define are there as a convenience and because we haven't observed anything smaller *yet*.  They are not by themselves evidence of a simulation.

    ***********

    As for why someone would simulate our universe, a few religions attempt to answer this.  I'm partial to the interpretation that the engineer of our simulation is creating a lot of souls for a project and this simulation tests the quality of said souls.  The souls are thrown into a simulated world full of suffering and those who successfully relieve the suffering of other souls beyond a certain threshold while keeping the resource expenditure below a certain threshold pass the quality check and become part of the project, while the rest are broken back down to their raw materials and reworked into new souls.

    ***********

    P.S. I want you all to know I typed this all on mobile. So, you know, all the standard disclaimers.

      Sorry, but this is nonsense.

      First, "infinity is a mathematical impossibility" is wrong,
      because there are many mathematical theories that allow manipulation of a concept we'd call "infinity".

      Second, you claim that because there is no infinity, there must be a smallest nonzero number. This is again wrong: the real numbers do not have an infinity, but they also do not have a smallest nonzero number. You say "the most basic operations depends on countability" but again, this is false for the real numbers.

      A priori, there's no reason to think a universe couldn't be based on real numbers. If we think otherwise, it's because our own universe seems to operate out of smallest discrete units, but here we are hypothesizing the existence of other universes. Those universes do not need to have physics remotely resembling our own. They simply need to have the ability to perform computation. They might have physics based on real numbers at the most fundamental level, or possibly something even more exotic.

      However, even ignoring the simulation-hypothesis / other-universes thing, your post is simply full of wrong claims about pure mathematics, like that "conventional mathematics breaks if we don't eventually define a minimum value".
      ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      Disclaimers noted.

      As to your first point; I'm not entirely sure that I agree with it, but even if you are right and there is a minimal epsilon, then it does not follow that all charges must be an integer multiple of that minimum. After all, 1.5*epsilon is still greater than epsilon; and even if there is a minimum, one and a half times that minimum is greater than the minimum. Yet, ever since Millikan's oil drop experiment in 1909, we've been able to base our scientific endeavours on the idea that charge is always an *integer* multiple of the minimum charge.

      --------------

      That is certainly a possible reason for our universe, and one that can be applied beneficially in everyday life. It *could* be a way to generate new intelligences, with some  sort of a filter on the output; and attempting to self-select for that *particular* filter will certainly improve the world as it stands.
      ```

      - u/MilesSand:
        ```
        But why should that matter?  Let's say for the sake of argument that the elementary particles under the Standard Model are actually made up of "substrings" vibrating at a particular set of frequencies that resonate in certain ways.  While we could have any combination of "substrings" and frequencies, the resulting compound (elementary) particles only interact with other compound (elemebtary) particles if they resonate in a similar way.  We'd get the same integer multiple effects despite the existence of an even smaller particle. I'm not saying that these substrings exist, but that their existence provides one potential alternative reason for the integer multiples of charge.  Thus we don't have proof positive that the smallest particles we have theories about are the actual smallest particles full stop. 

        But as to the point about infinities which you probably question, paradoxes arise if infinitesimal and infinite values are treated as real. So to avoid paradox we either find a math error that's been undiscovered for centuries, or conclude an elementary particle must exist.

        I'll restate the point I'm trying to make as I've gotten off on tangents and rambled in both posts now:  *the existence of an elementary particle doesn't imply a simulation because an elementary particle, or a set of elementary particles, must exist anyway.*

        ***********

        Do you have a possible reason? The "why" seems like a very open ended concept.

Id also like some beta readers as I am returning back to writing a Worm/Cosmere fiction I had a lot of work done on but lost everything when my motherboard and harddrive failed after an electrical surge.

  Additionally does anyone know good sites to host a podcast for free/cheap? I want to try my hand at audio narration for stories now that I have a functioning computer again.

  Furthermore I was just introduced to a game on Steam called Hades that has finally exited early access and it's so much fun. Id highly recommend it for anyone that likes roguelikes or even if you don't. The game has a permanent power system so you do gain strength even if you fail your run. It has so many additional bells and whistles that it feels like a completely different game from other roguelikes. Highly recommend.
