## Seeking authors willing to allow a website to post their stories.

### Post:

I recently registered the domain rationalfiction.com and plan to create a rational fiction forum/blog. I need from any creative authors stories that they are willing to share. I will not be profiteering or monetizing on these stories other than ad traffic. If you are interested in posting your story to this website as a first posts story please comment or message.

  I'm writing something over at flickegon.wordpress.com (Decagon, and I'm working on a new draft at the moment) that I would be up for reposting on your site. Though I'm not sure what you mean by "first posts story." Posting only the first chapter?

    I think OP means that your story would be the first post(s) on the site.

      Alright, cool, thanks. Note: That was the first draft, which I stopped writing. I've since then majorly retooled the idea.
