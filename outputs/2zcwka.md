## [Q][D]On the application of "Applied Rationality"

### Post:

First of all, this thread is not really about rational or rationalist fiction.

I'm a bit afraid that I may be posting in the wrong subreddit. I know of r/fallacy, r/gametheory, r/freethought, and r/logic, which are dedicated to fallacies, game theory, "science is best", and mathematical logic, respectively. However, r/fallacy is stuck as some sort of esoteric fallacy philosophy, game theory is playing film critic of the world, freethought is link-centric, and none addresses the use of rational thought in day to day life. And of course, there's r/rational, which is my best choice. But I'd much rather post appropriately.

The reason I ask is because I've begun working on a systematic formula for rational discussion, and I don't know where to share it with. I've grown quite restless with all these "debates" where two completely different things are argued for, or empirically supported rebukes simply count towards "points" and do nothing to change anybody's mind. 

In essence, it involves recording all arguments as declarative statements (with references), recording all counter-arguments as declarative statements (with references), assessing the strength of all statements (using those references) and drafting new arguments from the aftermath (and repeating). Its aim is to reduce miscommunication and force participants to actually update their beliefs when faced with convincing evidence.

I've only have the experience of a few university courses in psychology, formal logic and research methods, so it would be neat having more experienced people on board. I don't really see it going anywhere; perhaps a few small mock debates to test it out, but I imagine it'll never catch on. It's in a grey area where it might be useful for civilian debates while requiring too much effort.

  This sounds really interesting.

  One thing you could do to make this more popular is translate a regular debate - something like a Presidential debate - into this format.

  Another thing is allowing refutations whenever an arguer feels like it - people aren't going to change their mind if they think of a comeback two weeks later.

    Great idea with translating a debate. You comment actually just reminded me that the inception of this idea came during the presidential debates. Real-time update of such a debate log by fact checkers could work to reign the debates back from being sophist popularity contests. I'll start working on it.

    I'm having trouble understanding the second part. Could you perhaps clarify with an example?

    Cheers, thanks for the comment.

  Here's the thing.

  I would look into argument mapping as it has many of the characteristics you mention.

  I would also look into http://www.debatepedia.org/ , as they also seem to have a similar goal, although I think the format could be better

    http://honestargument.com/ is another website you should check.  Even if you eschew their format for something different, being aware of other formats that exist can help you tweak your own

    Thanks for the content, they inspired a few new ideas.

  I had a similar idea, for a graph-theoretic representation of argumentation to canonize arguments for and against certain positions. The idea would be to take all of the replicated work done across internet arguments (objections and refutations, noting fallacies, etc). Whatever website hosted it would need to be easy to reference, and it could be used as a source of arguments, evidence, and beliefs.

  Of course, the point behind internet arguments is to get offended and solidify your position further along, so it wouldn't really do much for those who don't care about being right, but otherwise I think it's a good idea. There could also be representations of debates and arguments in the form of the graph, where each statement would be transcribed into its graph-theoretic representation, and all of the arguments/evidence for and against each statement would be plainly visible.

  The idea would require (re: be helped along significantly by) a social media button, kind of like the social button rolls at the end of blog posts, or something similarly ubiquitous to long-form argument. I can think of many ways to improve on the current state of debate graphs, and I suspect this sort of thing might be what EY designed and gave to a friend to execute.

  In the end, the biggest obstacles would be popularity and resistance to the format. It would probably function as a thread-killer, and the way to prevent it from becoming a gish gallop would have to be the social element on the graph itself. Ultimately, though, I don't think trusting users is a very good way to ensure neutrality/objectivity, so some form of curation would be required.

  Enter the AGI.

    Awesome idea. I imagine that such a rendering of the arguments would make it easier to follow the debate, compared to my list form.

    You gave me a vision of people referring to past debate logs in the way court systems refer to previous case rulings. 

    "As has been concluded by *Josh v. Gerald, 2016, reddit*, calling someone Genghis Khan is analogous to Godwin's Law. I bring this as support to my claim that the referring to me as Kim Il Sung, another historical dictator, is also in violation of Godwin's Law."

    Indeed, it's quite dry, and having a neutral third party seems required no matter what. But I'm hoping it's a cool little way to practice logic and rationality.

    PS. I'm pretty sure a lot of what you said went over my head. Thanks for the comment, and sorry for anything I've missed!

      Thanks. It's not exactly a workable idea, and I'm in over my head just going to college and finding a job, so I guess it's just out there now.

      It would be awesome if it was actually likely to change anything. But I'm being pessimistic.
      ```

        Eh. I honestly don't see anyone ever using this. Consider it realism with a healthy dose of anti-positivity bias bias. Ha. Cheers mate, good luck.

  This sounds cool and interesting, and I wish you the best of luck. It might be worth checking out /r/lesswrong, which is a subreddit related to the Less Wrong rationalist community. Other places to check out include the comments section of the blog [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/). 

  /r/rational, despite the name, is actually a subreddit devoted to rational and rationalist fiction (and fanfiction). You'll certainly find people in /r/rational interested in what you're doing here-- many will share your interests. Hopefully in this thread and at the communities I linked you find what you're looking for. 

  All that being said, I will be downvoting this post to reduce its visibility on this subreddit. I wish to discourage divergence from the core goal of r/rational , even when I think the thread is good, like this one is.
  ```

    Thanks! Lesswrong seems to be the subreddit I was looking for.

    I know, /r/rational is my favourite subreddit. And I'm cool with the downvote, I can see that it's a valid reason. Cheers!
