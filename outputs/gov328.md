  To some degree Zach is just messing around, but the loops are basically "real" and filled with real people. He does care about the people in the loops and views them with empathy. And he really has nothing better to do, with a month of time meaning very little to him considering that he's spent well over a decade in the time loop reliving the same month over and over (in chapter 7, he estimates at least 200 loops, and doesn't actually remember the beginning). I think even as early as chapter 8 or 9, Zach tells Zorian that he spends most loops just noping out of Cyoria and wandering around, only rarely spending loops at the academy.

  Even Zorian, who is worried that the time loop could run out of magic, is the same way- he's rational, but he's also realistic and doesn't always follow the "optimum" path to become an ultimate archmage by abusing the timeloop. Furthermore, Zorian doesn't think Zach is conscious of any sort of limit on the time loop or what his long-term goal needs to be to end it.

  Also Zach explicitly mentions that he's tried to befriend everyone, but Zorian's never opened up to him before (since he's kind of an antisocial nerd with an over-inflated ego and an inferiority complex towards his brother), so this is just a chance for Zach to experience something new from that front. We already saw Zach helping out Neolu in the first loop we see, and we know she's not looping, so it's clear that he doesn't care about "wasted" effort.

  Much later we are told that Zach tried to befriend everyone at school. He tried to teach them, to protect them and he tested if doing so would improve the outcome of the invasion (and if they ended up surviving it or not).
  ```

    ```
    More to the point, he has befriended everyone, but this is the first time he has had success with Zorian.

    Heâ€™s really just trying to keep it going.
    ```

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  From Zach's perspective, he's been in this loop for literal *decades*, with no end in sight.  For all he knows, it will go on forever, until the invaders are defeated (Zorian quickly figures out that it won't, but Zach isn't that attentive a student of magical theory).

  How would you even define "waste of time" when your time is seemingly unlimited?
