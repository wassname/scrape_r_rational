## are the words "Eternal Golden Braid" an anagram or something?

### Post:

I see you folks are reading GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach. The book is filled with so many puzzles and self-referential jokes; I remember wondering when I read it years ago why he used that peculiar, specific phrase "an Eternal Golden Braid". Does that have some hidden meaning? An anagram or an encrypted message? I couldn't figure it out.

  Well, it also has the initial letters G, E, and B, albeit in different order.

    Yeah, that's part of what makes it suspicious. Makes it's an anagram in another language?

      Douglas Hofstafdter is fluent in French and spent some time translating his book himself. Mr. Tortoise becomes Madame Tortue to better fit the gender of the noun in that language.

        do you have any more info / reference on that translation bit? He's not listed among the official translators of the French edition.

        edit: also there's no evident anagram to "eternal golden braid" or its parts in French

  No, just an anag-ac-strapolation.

  I mean, it's an anagram [for a lot of things](http://wordsmith.org/anagram/anagram.cgi?anagram=eternal+golden+braid&t=1000&a=n). But I don't think that it's an anagram for anything specific. (Douglas Hofstadter took over a column called "Mathematical Games" from Martin Gardner and renamed it as "Metamagical Themas", so he is a fan of anagrams.)
