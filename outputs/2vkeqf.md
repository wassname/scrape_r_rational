## [Q] Rational polyamory fanfics?

### Post:

It occurs to me that I've never read a story in the romance genre, or with a romance component, that takes the same approach to romantic "everyone wants someone that wants someone else" problems that HPMOR does to saving-the-world type problems.

HPMOR gives Harry a gift—an operational understanding of human cognitive biases. But it strengthens the setting, such that this doesn't automatically solve everything. In fact, rational!Harry's gift makes him "dream bigger"—set his sights on goals canon!Harry could never achieve. Because of this, rational!Harry's life is actually *harder* than canon!Harry's, despite his gifts.

Imagine a fanfiction for your standard harem anime (let's say Ranma): one male protagonist, lots and lots of girls that want to be in an exclusive relationship with that protagonist, and other guys that want those girls, and so on. A canon!Ranma, who actually had shrugged up enough determination to not be stuck in negative-episodic-continuity-land, would likely merely be interested in making a choice of one girl, and permanently discouraging the rest.

If one were to give Ranma a gift for romantic insight, the canonical problem-set would be decimated. But a rational!Ranma would dream bigger, wouldn't he? I would imagine a rational!Ranma would actually want *everyone*, not just him, to be in a happy relationship; for no one to continually attack him out of jealousy, for none of his friends to pine over him, etc. And because of all the unrequited love, love for those already in relationships, mutual-exclusivity conflicts, etc. in his own relationship isocahedron, creating multiple overlapping pairings is really the only way he could create any sort of long-lasting equilibrium.

Now, I've seen a lot of stories where characters who are monogamous in canon end up spontaneously entering into polyamorous relationships by author fiat. Real people don't do that. Have you ever tried to convince a monogamous partner to practice polyamory? It's *hard*, and in the end, just not in some people's natures.

What I've never seen is a story where some characters start as *really monogamous*—not just "lipstick monogamous"—but where this is causing them lots of pain that could be solved by them being *not* monogamous—and then it occurs to one character to just *not be monogamous*, who then starts trying to get everyone else on-board with this with every shred of pain that might entail. An author-granted gift for romantic insight, in this case, merely ensures that this venture won't be doomed before it even begins.

  So, I've never seen that in fanfic. I'm not actually sure that I've seen it in regular fiction either - every time I've seen someone make an "open, honest attempt at polyamory" it's been in a very negative light, and either it ends in a trainwreck or with monogamy having been proven to be the One True way to have relationships.

  If you were to write this, I think you'd start running into problems really quickly, mostly through derailing characters. As you've said, polyamory just isn't for some people, and if you want the conclusion to be that everyone is in one big multiple-pairing situation, you have to make the call that they're all for it, which ... is basically author fiat, which you want to avoid.

  (If you want to write it, I think this is the sort of thing that would work better as original fiction. If you're having trouble thinking up characters, just use characters from your favorite shows/books and file off the serial numbers.)

    Ah, no, I never said I wanted the conclusion to be anything in particular. I would expect the result to be a *more optimal* relationship graph than the original one, but not a *maximally-connected* one. In the end, it really just wouldn't work out optimally for *some* people (and they'll have to settle for the protagonist introducing them to someone who is almost-but-not-quite the person they wanted, and might be an even better fit for them though they might not agree, etc.)

  Polyamory is an extra type of relationship (sub)graph and keeping it on the table would be helpful for some people, but it's weird to me to portray it as a rationalist's solution to relationship problems.  It solves a specific handful of cases, but doesn't even touch the actual problem.  Relationships are dramatic because not everyone's ideal relationship graph is the same.  (And I like that problem; it's part of the human experience.)

  Your question does remind me of [this hilarious post on Things of Interest](http://qntm.org/gay) where the author takes a rigid database schema that only allows heterosexual marriage, iteratively applies good database design principles to it, and finds the database's concept of marriage getting more and more liberal with each improvement.  Eventually he blows past allowing gay marriage, into polyamory, and then further still into something truly strange.

  The story "Kyon: Big Damn Hero" is the one you want to read. Definitely.

   Here: http://soulriders.net/brian/fanfic/kbdh/ or https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5844698/1/Kyon-Big-Damn-Hero.
  The relationship-building starts effectively at Chapter 18, so you should read that one first. 
  Sadly it wont be updated anymore, but I'm sure you'll find what you search for here.

  Alternatively, I point you towards "Time Braid" (https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid), but it's much less pronounced here than in KBDH.

  "She's the Man"/Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" rational fic?

  Viola and Sebastian are twins from a faraway kingdom. Viola is a sorceress, Sebastian is a knight. When they get shipwrecked in a chauvinistic enemy kingdom, they become separated, each believing the other to have drowned. Viola must pretend to be a man in order to find employment. She finds work as the personal bodyguard of Duke Orsino, a jolly, insightful and unfortunately sexist older nobleman, who she eventually falls in love with. Duke Orsino however is in love with a countess named Olivia, who falls in love with both twins before she realizes they're different people. Sebastian is generally oblivious to anything involving people and relationships.

  Realizing the messy web of unrequited affection and accidental deception between her friends and acquaintances, Viola must find a way to resolve all of their relationship troubles, defend Duke Orsino from assasins, thwart a plot to ruin the reputation of the household of Olivia, not be discovered as a woman or illegal immigrant from a foreign kingdom, find out what REALLY happened to Sebastian when they shipwrecked AND all this without losing her job and current residence in the process.

    I really want more Shakespeare ratfics. [The *Romeo and Juliet* proposal was awesome](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1tftsf/can_we_have_threads_dedicated_to_brainstorming/ce7jmdf), and so was [*Hamlet and the Philosopher's Stone*](http://lesswrong.com/lw/86m/fiction_hamlet_and_the_philosophers_stone/). And this sounds plain great.

  It's not a fanfic, but "The Moon's a Harsh Mistress" features polyamorous relationships, is SciFi, and is mostly rational (not rationalist). A relatively plausible explanation is provided, and at least one healthy family relationship is explored.

  Personally I'm skeptical about the concept of long term, committed (in the context) polyamorous relationships, particularly if the relationships form a cyclic graph. Seems like too many opportunities for factions to form with 4+ individuals intertwined.

  Granted, given the current cultural norms, it seems like there aren't many opportunities for these situations to arise so it's hard to find evidence one way or another, and the deck is stacked against people who are interested in pursuing such a relationship.

  Polygamous relationships usually have an external force (cultural/religious) which probably helps to mediate issues and increase the incentive to resolve problems instead of dissolving the relationship.

  Wow...looking back on history and at today's issues with marriage, there's so many possible discrimination against potential marriages. Let me count up the ones we've thought of so far. Including types of marriages we've abolished.

  First started a marriage of husband and wife of the same ethnicity and religion.

  Then came marriage of husband and wife. (Eliminate prejudice against race and internal beliefs)

  Up came marriage of adult husband and adult wife. (Generate prejudice against marriages to anyone under 18)

  Next is marriage of person to person. (Eliminate prejudice against gender or sex)

  Now it's marriage of person to person to person to..... (Eliminate prejudice against number of partners)

  What will we think of next?!!

  Marriage of sapient being to sapient being to sapient being.... (Eliminate prejudice against uplifted animals, AI, aliens, and anything else in the set of mind space who share utility functions corresponding to the idea of intense commitment)

  Is there any type of marriages I missed? I can only think of open marriages, but that's about having sex with someone you aren't married to and not who you're marrying which doesn't really fit the theme above.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    You missed marriages to (and between) children, though I'd argue that we're probably better eliminating those.

  I don't think it qualifies as rational, but I have read one Ranma fic somewhat close to what you describe. It's called [Couch Trips](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/804058/1/Couch-Trips), and the elevator pitch is "after the end of the series, Ranma meets a psychologist and begins getting therapy." It's polyamorous and you can see from the pitch why this reminds me of it.

  But it's much more of a general romance/drama sort of fic and less of a rational one.

  >creating multiple overlapping pairings is really the only way

  If you only allow major canon characters, that is. Without such a fictional constraint on the allowed cast, the problem would be much better solved by involving more people.
  ```

  - u/derefr:
    ```
    I'm presuming here that one of the constraints is that there are, at the very least, one set of two people who both are attracted to one currently-monogamous person who would be okay with either of them, but not both; and where both of the suitors have declared a deontological "spiritual bond" or somesuch that prevents them from being maximally happy unless they get to spend *some* time with that person in a relationship context. (This is a pretty ubiquitous setup in romance settings, no? Without it, things are *too* easy.)

    Outside of polyamory (or posthuman multiple instantiation), the only way this kind of story usually ends is in tragedy for at least one party, if not all.
