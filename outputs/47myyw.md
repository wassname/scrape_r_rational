## [Q] Plausible reasons for technology to not work in a fantasy setting?

### Post:

Basically the title says it all. I've always had a lot of trouble understanding why technology wouldn't work in any world that mostly resembles our own. Why wouldn't a steam engine work in any world in which water can be boiled into pressurized steam? Electrical technology can be as simple as running a current through a filament to create light. I don't think there are any fantasy worlds which don't have steam or electrical phenomena of any kind.

A fantasy setting is still highly desirable for many reasons related to story-telling. But in order to pass basic plausibility tests, there needs to be a good reason why technology doesn't work.

  A lot of technology is invented when there is a problem that needs to be solved. However, this means that if magic can solve the problem more easily than through technology, then technology simply won't develop.

  If a simple cantrip can make a floating ball of light, then you won't go through the 100+ failed attempts by Edison to make the light bulb.

  In addition, a rarely noticed requirement for technology is mass production and intrastructure. A lot of times, people write stories about how someone from the present goes back in time and revolutionize society with their futuristic knowledge. **BUT** they often forget that most of technology is ruinously expensive unless it's common as dirt.

  Building pipes for plumbing? Requires specialized skills to build it and maintain it.

  Control of electricity for work? Requires a lot of equipment to harness it and convert it into something actually useful.

  Plastic? Requires a highly refined and complicated process which is expensive unless you are producing plastic at the level of thousands of pounds.

  Either way, most of common technology we see is only useful/profitable if it's implemented on a society-wide scale which is one of it's main strengths. Civilization requires technology to function and technology requires a civilization to implement it. It's a feedback loop which ensures actual technological development to maintain a civilization. Otherwise if it was easy for a small group to reproduce everything our society makes, then the world would be a lot more fractured into smaller groups and more anarchic in nature.

  That's why there is so little technology in fantasy worlds. When there is magic which easily reproduces anything our modern-day society can make, we don't develop into a futuristic post-scarcity society but rather a medieval one where all of the power is concentrated into the hands of a few people (yeah we kinda have that today, but imagine a godlike warlord who can control your every action/thought as compared to a rich CEO).

  I'm actually happy technology is so difficult to create and maintain on any scale other than that of a large society, because it either requires cooperation or extreme slavery to even function and we have eliminated slaves a long time ago.

  It means that humans *need* to work together for any hope of survival and it encourages cooperative personality traits to spread (go read [The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042FZRPC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1) if you don't believe me).

  TL;DR - Yes technology may still work, but in a world where magic does the same thing more easily and cheaply, then there will be no motivation to create the technology. Even if technology can be more flexible and versatile than magic, it still needs to require a significant percentage of wealthy/influential people to agree that it's better than magic *and* be willing use it when in the early stages it's going to be clearly shittier than magical alternatives.

  It's the problem of convincing people to go for long-term potential on the order of generations over short-term benefits.

    Considering behavioral scientists exaggerate their findings (US more so) and behavior genetics is [not as valid a field](http://www.nature.com/news/smart-genes-prove-elusive-1.15858#/ref-link-2) as some would think, information released after the publication of this book, I will apply a greater scrutiny to this book when reading it, not that I think it is entirely wrong. 

    A [study last](http://phys.org/news/2015-11-nature-nurture-human-brains-evolved.html) year suggests there is something to civilization affecting our biology. Regardless, I am more critical of these pop science books.

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I sort of agree with you about pop science books, but I think that this book has a lot of pretty reliable references to back up most of what it finds. Because most of the book is about finding examples of how humans may have changed in the last 10,000 years such as lactose tolerance and an IQ shift among Ashkenazi Jews (they make up ~0.02% of the population, but over 25% of Nobel Prize winners are Ashkenazi Jews).

      So I think the book has found pretty reliable changes that can be considered to be the result of a genetic mutation and the authors use these changes as proof to challenge the idea that humans has stopped evolving since we developed civilization.

    Good explanation. I'd thought of this myself but it does require that magic be fairly ubiquitous, which rules out a fair number of fantasy worlds. I'd think that given the convenience factor and easy scalability of technology, some form of magic would have to be accessible to most households to prevent technology from being kickstarted.

    Furthermore, if technology really does work but is repressed by the magic-using elite, so long as the world has a long enough history, it seems to me that technology vs. magic would necessarily have to be one of the major points of conflict. That's good for some storylines but doesn't thematically fit well in a story that wants to be pure fantasy but doesn't want to be stupid and irrational.

      Think of it like this:

      In our world, a rich mine owner has a problem: his mines keep filling up with water. He has lots of money to throw at the problem, so he looks around for someone he can pay to solve it. He hires an engineer who develops the first industrial steam engine to pump the water out of the mines. The engine is patented, and now access to steam power is limited only by one's ability to pay for the engine and it's fuel.

      In a fantasy world, the mine owner looks around for someone he can pay to solve his flooding problem. He hires a wizard, who summons a water elemental to move the water out of the mine and binds it for a year and a day.

      Most of the really world-changing inventions in our world, the ones that sparked things like the industrial revolution, were created by scholars of various sorts such as engineers and chemists, who were either rich themselves or were hired to solve problems by rich people. These inventions became commonplace and eventually reached the point of benefiting the common man because once invented they required no special ability to manufacture and operate, just training and resources.  In a fantasy world it is wizards and alchemists (and priests and druids etc) that the rich go to for new solutions, and in contrast to the real world, the solutions those specialists come up with cannot trickle down to the common man because they require magical abilities at least to create, often to operate (or cast). Thus you tend not to get a magical revolution, because the "technology" of magic remains restricted to the elite.

      If you want a technological revolution, though, it's fairly easy to justify in the form of a culture or subculture or even a powerful individual who distrusts magic and wizards and so spends the extra effort to create mundane solutions. Even better when those mundane solutions spread and are then improved upon by magical inventors, ex. "Ah, this clever fellow has invented a mechanical bellows device which an do work by heating water with fire. You know, I could get the same effect with an enchanted hot plate and a decanter of endless water and we'd never have to buy coal again."

        Also worth noting that early technological progress was very slow for a number of reasons in the real world, most of which still apply in the typical fantasy world like lack of universal education, lack of demand, slow communication between the educated elite, lack of cooperation between rival countries.

        Interesting things can happen in a fantasy world if you allow one or more of those restrictions to break down and start pushing into an age of thaumaturgical rather than technological progress. Most don't go that direction though because it means doing a lot of work to nail down scientific principles behind magic to define the limits of that progress.

          One thing that REALLY bothers me regarding magic is how so few worlds have knowledge-sharing magic, that would allow, for example, to educate a layman to the level of a university professor with a single spell, or something like internet (but mind-to-mind).

          It does make sense from the a story perspective (good luck writing a compelling story in that kind of world), but not so much in a realistic society.
          ```

          - u/half_dragon_dire:
            ```
            You don't even have to go that extreme (which to be fair, would be pretty heavy, even Wish-level magic in most fantasy worlds) to have an extreme effect on society.

            Most magic systems actually treat violating thermodynamics as a much easier problem than manipulating minds. Perpetual motion, or at least something practically indistinguishable from it, seems to be easy in most fantasy worlds, which should be HUGE. Getting easier access to more energy (human muscle, animal muscle, fire, coal, oil, nuclear) has been a major driver of technological progress, and magic undercuts a huge amount of that.

            Communication is also a big deal. Even in the modern world getting messages to the other side of the world is a big deal. It requires high power transmitters and huge antenna arrays, laying thousands of miles of cable over land and sea, or expending gigajoules of energy putting satellites into orbit. In a magical world, it's as simple as casting Sending. Just the difference having a couple of magic mirrors in every university that can link to each other would be profound. The webcomic Dungeon Grind had a gag recently with a magical tome for dungeon delvers which was linked to hundreds of other tomes so that anything written in one appeared in all the others, and used it as a joke on Wikipedia and social networking. But just imagine if every magical library had a book like that. Imagine all the other ways a magical world could ape our modern information technology society.

  What is "simple" about "Join together copper and zinc by means of a cloth soaked in brine and it will shock you, sometimes, if you touch it just right, until the mechanism gets tired and then never works again, and by this process you can replace candles somehow"?

  In the real world, basic steam-driven aeolipiles were described around 15 BCE, and static electricity has likely been known since before we were H. sapiens. We proceeded to do absolutely nothing with this knowledge until the 1700s. The simplest, most plausible, *true* reason is that people don't have enough information to have thought of it yet, and their metallurgy and infrastructure isn't good enough to make reliable use of it anyway.

  One option is to add back the "+C" term so often missing from integrals back onto them - especially in Maxwells equations. If you can't turn mechanical motion of a magnetic field back into current, you can't make a generator. That "+C" term could often be negative, or vary, as long as the equation still works in situations that rationality call for as needing it. 

  Steam-wise, do you really want to anger the local water spirits that much by cooking them into air? I mean, they're not mad in the normal flow of things, but if someone exploits them regularly outside of their normal expected workload and lifestyle, they may just quit working.

    The second one is probably my favorite explanation: the world looks superficially similar to our own but is fundamentally different. The myriad forces that govern all interactions in the world are not impersonal but in fact semi-sentient and willful. They behave in predictable ways most of the time but there can always be exceptions, especially when they encounter something truly novel.

      Especially when they feel they're being exploited, which means some things may work fine (trains, because they're considered noble and powerful) while others may not (power stations, because it seems as slave labor to work that boring for that long).

        You have two branches of maintenance and development: Technicians and skilled tradesmen who do what they do today, and shamans who have to convince the spirits to actually work like they're supposed to. Or to work in ways they really *aren't* supposed to.

          I really like this idea, actually. A world where sometimes the hardest part about making a cup of tea is persuading the water to boil.

  First off, do *humans* work in that setting? Humans are extremely complicated machines that can be destroyed by something as small as [slightly increasing the weight of water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water#Toxicity_in_humans). If they work, there's not much that will break. So if you want real-world humans to enter your fantasy world and not die, but then to find that their smart phones stopped working, that's not going to make a whole lot of sense.

  If you're making the world out of whole cloth, with a race that physically resembles but is distinct from humans, then you can do a lot to justify it. Can water be boiled in your universe? Perhaps boiling it away requires far more energy than you're likely to get. Or maybe steam is extremely corrosive, and the machinery is likely to break down. Or maybe your world doesn't have a lot of metal, and can't spare enough to make trains.

  And why do you say those fantasy universes have electrical phenomena? Because they have lightning? Maybe that's just Zeus throwing spears or something. Or maybe it's kind of like electricity, but there's no electromagnetism. Electricity stops looking as impressive if you can't send it through a coil and move stuff around with it.

  But even then, any world with anything like people has self-repairing self-replicating technology.

  It is fairly common for people to have magic resistance. You don't want someone to be able to kill people easily by causing aneurysms. It could be that magic keeps technology from working, but humans can live because they can keep the magic out, and they just haven't figured out how to keep the magic out of their steam engines.

  I read in a work, possibly a Harry Potter fic, that technology didn't work around magic because of spacial warps that left microscopic tearing in pretty much everything. Something that didn't matter at all for a plant, hardly mattered to magical human life (who were more sturdy than magic-free humans), mattered just a bit more for precise clockwork like pocketwatches, but would slowly but surely decay any circuitry or microchips into tiny silicon bricks.

  So a simple hand crank generator would work, and so would a lightbulb. But no electric computers.

  Counterexample: *The Guardians of the Flame* is a series of books by Joel Rosenberg in which a group of modern American college kids get sent to a fantasy world. One of the is a civil engineering student who, over the course of years, revolutionizes the world by introducing steam and basic gunpowder and etc. I might be looking at it through nostalgia goggles, but I remember it being well-written and a lot of fun.

  I built a fantasy setting that was on a young world, where we (and elves, dwarves, and what not) all evolved in the first age of life. So, there simply were no fossil fuels or petroleum. So a certain level of technology existed, but nothing that required gas, coal, or petrochemicals was possible. I know it's pseudo-scientific, but shit, guys, there were dragons.
