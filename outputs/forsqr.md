## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

    If it's thousands of years, then I think it's essentially impossible. There are a few things at play:

    * Transcription errors. Given a generation cycle of approximately twenty years, a thousand years will require fifty successive copies. That's fifty instances of parents teaching their children things. Even if everyone was trying to, it's unlikely that you would get the same message out the end through this intergenerational game of telephone.
    * Drift. Even if things aren't copied wrong, you'll still have to deal with things changing in one form or another. Linguistic drift is probably one of the easiest and most well-studied examples, meaning that on the other end of your thousand years, people will no longer be mutually intelligible to their ancestors. Institutional drift is another big example: people will be trying to push things one way or another, or forces will be acting on institutions, and they'll slowly become different from what they were. This will happen with cultural values and stories as well. And on top of that, farmers will probably be engaging in selective breeding, whether intentionally or not, meaning that your domesticated plants and animals will be different.
    * Erosion. Lingual, cultural, and institutional erosion are all a given. Less obviously, there will be changes to geography over the course of a thousand years, with changes to landscapes and soil quality, buildings and cities will have to undergo periodic repairs or replacements, especially if they're not building with sustainability or durability in mind. Some of this "erosion" will be in the form of warfare.
    * Unexpected events and system fragility. Wars, diseases, famines, natural disasters, and black swans will come at any civilization like a freight train, and unless the civilization/culture/institutions are far more robust than any historical ones, they'll be changed by either the impacts the outside event has, or the ways in which these systems respond. Some of these don't even need to be that "big": a new species of insect evolving that wipes out a monoculture could have huge ramifications on textiles or food, for example.

    Now, at the end of all this, you might get a civilization that looks more or less like it did at the start, if you squint, but "the past is a foreign country" really applies, and on the scale of a thousand years, even without much 'progress' I would expect that the past would be sufficiently foreign that it only makes sense to call it the same entity if you're taking a broad view of continuity.
    ```

      As an addendum to this: what might we expect to stay the same?

      It's my personal belief that geography, resources, crops, and domestic animals drive something like 90% of cultures. Given a thousand years, there's a decent chance that some of that stuff will have stayed the same. On Earth, latitude won't have changed, meaning that you'll have roughly the same growing seasons (minus the difference in the plants and planting technologies), your drainage basins will only have shifted a little bit, and unless resources get depleted or ruined somehow, those will probably be the same too.

      Crops and animals will have changed, whether through selective breeding, new species from different latitudes, or new farming techniques making different domestications viable, but not by *that* much, since latitude stays the same, weather is probably *mostly* the same, and the plants are within very similar confines.

      That being the case, it's not too wild to think that things might to be *that* different a thousand years down the line. If the animals and plants are mostly the same, perhaps with different breeds, then you'll have the same or similar textiles, which will lend themselves the same or similar techniques, which will lend themselves to a few common elements of fashion.

      If the wood, metals, stone, clay, etc. haven't changed much, with no significant new stores opened up through advances in technique, then a lot of the buildings will probably look similar, because there are limits to what you can done if one of your starting conditions is "your buildings are all made of pine" or "you don't have trees available to you" or something like that.

      The underlying realities of these things that *might* stay static can allow for *some* amount of apparent stasis, or if not stasis, then commonality between two time periods. You just need to be careful to account for how these things have not changed, minus the drift, erosion, and errors. They would be different, but some very large things stay the same, which might make some smaller things stay the same, which might allow not *too* much difference, if you're squinting.
      ```

  - u/WhoTookBibet:

    I think the "easiest" way to have static technology levels make sense is through interventionist higher powers.

    If the Deity of Farming doesn't get Godpoints^TM from the use of animal-pulled plows they may withhold magical benefits from anyone who uses one, or even from any community that has someone who uses one. The Deity of Fire may get a significant portion of their Faith income from the use of candles and torches, so anyone trying to make a basic lightbulb is a threat and gets the Inquisition brought down on them.

    If Deities raise the bar for how useful a new technology has to be high enough (through generous use of blessing, accessible rituals, boons, etc.) and actively punish innovation a society could plausibly maintain the same tech level for long periods of time. Basically, the easiest way to keep society stagnant is to introduce sufficiently powerful actors who have a vested interest in stagnation.

        Excellent points! I agree that indefinite stasis isn't possible with my suggestions. On the plus side "Magic vs. Technology" and "Infighting Among the Gods" are both pretty fun story topics, so it failed in a way that can have interesting things written about it.

      Why have I never seen an uplift story in which the protagonist is chased by the Inquisition for making a lightbulb?

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    I can't say much re institutions and culture, but *technological* stasis is pretty easy to achieve if you arbitrarily remove given elements or just deposit them in a hard-to-use form. For example, one of my worlds has no fossil fuels, and another of my worlds is missing not only fossil fuels but iron ore (it exists as a trace element, because many organisms need it to live, but it's incredibly difficult to convert that into a usable amount of iron).

        Maybe! My understanding is that steam really depended on coal, because (1) charcoal isn't an effective enough fuel source for widespread steam power and, more importantly, (2) good steam engines require a quality of steel which cannot be produced without coal-fueled fires (which is why we couldn't have gotten Greek steam engines--they didn't have the metallurgy to create steam engines which wouldn't burst).

    Much of LOTR doesn't make sense, starting with the part where most of the bloody map is empty.  But I'd like to point out that the middle ages themselves were very far from stagnant.  The culture, technology, and worldview of any given country would be very different in 1300 than it was in 700 or even 1000.  I realize the OP didn't claim otherwise, but this is something a lot of people don't appreciate enough--plenty of growth and development happened in the middle ages.

    With that said, consider Pournelle's Janissaries (I'm probably spelling it wrong).  It's not super-plausible--in fact, it's ridiculous in many ways--but >!aliens periodically seed Tran with human settlers, who are kept from developing technologically by the aliens betraying and bombing them as soon as they stop being useful.!<  Admittedly, an extreme and contrived solution, but the series was fun in a watch-an-author-play-Civilization way.  A pity he died before he could complete it.

        Maybe because we don't live very long. Institutions are made up of people, so they change by definition when enough of the people in it die off. If you have institutions of immortals, they might not change very much for thousands of years. Even if they are purely human institutions they might have advisors or individuals in the perifery which are immortal and somewhat keep them pointed in the same direction. Depends on the setting of course. For instance, I think they had records of 8000 years or something in ASoIaF. That seems ridiculous.

    There are many ways of forcing a medieval stasis. To name a few:

    - A higher power with some incentive to keep the stasis going. 

    - The current technology level, combined with magic, is just adequate enough for people to not spend much effort improving on it. 

    - Magic is more useful than technology, but takes far longer to advance, resulting in a slow rate of progress. 

    - The resources available in our world does not have the same availability in yours. 

    - The laws of physics / chemistry / sciences are different in your universe. 

    - There is some inherent danger in some key technological development not present in our world that hinders the development. 

    - There is some constant outside threat that forces people to focus on a specific area rather than to improve things generally. 

    - There is some prevalent belief that technological progress is bad, and that belief is strong enough to last centuries. 

    - Your humans are different from ours, and have inherently different psychological wants and needs.

      From Vernor Vinge's "Taja Grimm's World", they had aliens remove all the easily accessible metal deposits. The people living on that world tried to make do with fiberglass, but it is hard to bootstrap an industrial base without iron, copper, etc.  This was written in the 1970's, and it isn't clear that actually removing all the easy to access metals on a planetary surface would result in a viable ecosystem (need iron for hemoglobin, for example).
      ```

      - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
        ```
        I think that biologically accessible metals are going to be placed in a different category than mineral deposits by any aliens with such a plan. You need to do a lot of chemical work to turn a chunk of iron ore into something non-toxic and usable by the body (or rather, a great many bodies, again: you want non-toxic), and you're not going to be smithing many horseshoes by getting your peasants to donate buckets of blood.

        That's true enough. Was just thinking on the fly when I wrote that.

        As for magic examples, there can be many. For example:

        - It's a parallel to modern physical research - mages need years of high-quality education, then come up with theories, work in teams and expend many resources in advancing magical knowledge. 

        - A rare resource is necessary for magic, which can only be obtained in limited amounts.

        - Magic is based on saying the correct sequence of sounds, so discovering magic is just trying different sequences until it works. 

        - Magical knowledge is beyond the scope of man, and people must petition to the gods or the elves or whoever for it, doing various tasks over extended periods of time. 

        - Magic is discovered, not created, and people must delve into old ruins in order to find the ancient scrolls that contain new spells.

        - Mages are extremely rare, and entire countries are built around a support structure in order to cater to them.

        - Advancing magic is based on blind luck, so people just wait around for the next meteor containing magical knowledge to strike.

        - Magic is fading, and all the effort is put into trying to stop that from happening. 

        - Advancing magic requires international cooperation, and politics and diplomacy drastically slows everything down. 

        Et cetera.

    My solution is repeated apocalypse, requiring divine powers to implement a hard reset.

    When you concentrate people together with superior agriculture techniques, people get closer to making a breakthrough. If there's an industrialising economy, that concentrates capital and money enough that people can make investments. New technology lets you do new things.

    Perhaps they tap into the elemental plane of fire, create a pinprick that just keeps expanding. Perhaps they make magic grey goo. Perhaps they figure out a way to get recursively more powerful and accidentally kill the world. There have to be all kinds of ways to kill the world with magic, especially the sort of organized and well-resourced magic that an industrialising civilization can muster. It's Bostrom's Fragile World hypothesis taken to its logical conclusion.

    Those who have really deep bunkers and can survive the surface being erased and loaded again from backup get very unhappy about this sort of thing. The survivors are those who inherently distrust any unsafe innovation: innovative cultures get erased.

    I'd like to note a lot of fantasy settings (like LOTR, Elder Scrolls, Warhammer etc) aren't in stasis but in active decline. Every event is a lesser echo of a greater past event. 

    236 years before the events of Skyrim the Empire had a [space station.](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Battlespire)

    In Practical Guide to Evil the explanation for their technological stagnancy is that a race of higher technology (gnomes) basically keeps everyone else in the dirt by sending "red letters" every time a civilization researches in a direction they forbid. If you receive three red letters, the gnomes wipe your civilization. That is one way of doing it.

  So I've recently read Ultimate Rock, Paper, Scissors (https://mangadex.org/chapter/582800/1) for the first time and it makes me want to write a similar narrative but with a bunch of supernatural characters playing poker. 

  So far I have 8 player characters more or less roughed out, their motivations and their basic methodology of how they plan to win. (They aren't named yet so I'll just label them based on their inspiration). 




  Character| Basic Methodology | Motivation
  ---|---|----
  Leprechaun| Luck | Wants to find the rest of his gold
  Vampire| Mental Control (Thralls) | Wants to be at peace with her dead lover
  Oracle| Future Sight | Wants to heal her injuries
  Alien| Statistical Analysis | Wants to return home
  Satori| Mind Reading | Wants to restore his status as a mountain god
  Dragon | Bribery/ Intimidation | Wants to have the most coveted treasure hoard
  Witch | Limited Magic | Wants to find her lost mentor
  Scam Artist | Cheating | Wants to elevate his family's standard of living

  The setting of the world I think will end up being vaguely modern day. We'll only be seeing these characters interacting in a single location while playing their game so I might just allude to things rather that flesh out unimportant factors.

  One thing I'm mulling over however is how to incorporate chips into the game properly. The prize for winning is a pseudo-wish and not a set monetary value. My gut reaction is to just make it so the chips are worth one each and players start out with only 10 each or something like that.

  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

    Maybe they have to pay a price in order to get in, and the value of that price is equivalent to 10 (or however many) tokens. 

    Importantly, *the price to be paid is proportional to the value of the wish desired*, which helps to equalize things since some people's wishes seem to be more valuable than other people's (and it explains why nobody has come here with the intent to conquer the world or end death or whatever--besides something of that scale probably being beyond the power of the game to provide, if I've understood you correctly, nobody who wants those things is in a position to pay a sufficient price for it). 

    What this means, in practice, is that if you feel like you aren't going to win, then you can withdraw and, so long as you have at least 10 (or however many) tokens left, you don't have to actually pay the price. This can give an additional wrinkle for some characters, as they begin to weigh the odds of success and wonder whether they should try to leave the table while they're still ahead.

  I've been thinking about creating a world where every species, sentient and not, asexually reproduces. There'd be a lot of consequences to this, so, assuming they don't get wiped out by disease or mutation, what sort of world would this be?

    Assuming they evolved this way, their entire psychology and social dynamics would be different. Copies would cooperate with each other much more than people in the real world do. They might see each other like cells making up a single organism. 

    I'd suggest reading an evolutionary psychology book for a more complete view.
