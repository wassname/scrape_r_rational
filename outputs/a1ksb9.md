  Well, this is a bit of a swift kick in the nuts. I can empathize with thinking one's writing is poor, as can anybody who's ever put words to paper. But *The Game of Champions*, removed because of qualms about quality? That's not an explanation, it's the punchline of a joke, and not a particularly funny one. TGoC was a strong contender for my favorite fic of all time, certainly in the top ten. I don't even know what to say. 
  &nbsp;

  Nothing to be done but archive everything, I suppose, and put it in with Post's *Manifest Destiny* and other assorted stories that have vanished from the internet. DLP's work by author subforum still has the text for a few of Lamora's works, if anyone else wants to nab them, though hastily saved HTML files don't make for the best reading experience. Still, I managed to acquire: *By The Victors, The Legend Yet Grew, The Last Son of Fire,* and *The Gravehand of Morrighan'nan*. According to the Wayback Machine, nothing but his Skyrim and Pokémon fics were ever uploaded to FF.net anyway, so I don't think I'm missing anything...

  Funnily enough, if L. Lamora is a handle, he is following the path of his namesakes author.

  The guy who wrote the lies of Locke lamora was destroyed by the divorce of his wife, stopped writing for years, abandoned several projects, and when he was finally pushed to release the novel he had already been paid an advance on (that last clause is supposition) it was notably below the standards of his previous writing.
  ```

    To be clear, I wish the man only the best.  I think he's a great writer with a talent few if any could replicate, I just also think that he loved his wife very much and hasn't recovered from her leaving him.  My name is Oliver Horsey, and once I finally realised that the Lies of Locke Lamora was essentially Oliver Twist Fan-fiction (and appreciated that my name shares the same number of syllables as Locke's original name) I have really appreciated Jean Tannen saying \~'shit, I would've changed my name too'

  It's really a shame, because when I started Origin of Species I got a lot of recommendations to read a lot of Pokemon fanfic, and Game of Champions was the only one I really enjoyed. I'd hoped to see where he took his story when he picked it up again for more cross-contamination of ideas, but looks like I'm going it alone.

  A more recent story, Pokemon: The Line, was good too, but even shorter and also unfinished. It anyone else has others to recommend (not Sun Soul or Traveler, I tried but couldn't get into them) that are similar, feel free to share.

    My favorite overall is Wild Pokemon. Starts out kinda bad, but by chapter 3 the aesthetic, tonal, and thematic appeal is apparent.

  I noticed you're missing the WIP chapter that he posted piecemeal shortly after the final published chapter. I put it together a few years ago locally.

  Warning, it's an even stronger cliffhanger than what the published story ends on.

    Thanks, I'd never seen this!

  Knowing this is dead. Are there any other fanfics like this? This was by far my favorite of all pokemon fics I had read
  ```

  - u/Saintsant:
    ```
    Not in the Pokémon fandom, sadly. *The Origin of Species* is solidly written, but tackles the setting differently and (in my opinion) with less passion. Truly *The Game of Champions* was the very best, like no one ever was.
    ```

    - u/KiritosWings:
      ```
      I do enjoy Origin of Species quite a bit but I have to agree. What are other works that come to this quality that you might know of in other fandoms?
      ```

      - u/Saintsant:
        ```
        Just off the top of my head, *Fargo* for PMMM (complete, with a sequel currently in progress) on FF.net, *Hammered Down* for Bleach (also complete on FF.net, with a sporadically updating sequel), *Maybe I'm a Lion*, a Kara no Kyoukai/Prototype crossover on Beast's Lair (abandoned, but with an enormous amount of enjoyable content), and *Weaver Nine* for Worm (likely abandoned, but at the conclusion of a gripping arc).
        ```

- u/eroticas:
  ```
  Wow, did no one tell him how popular and appreciated his work was?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    He knows, but thinks that their opinions are, essentially, the opinions of uneducated rabble.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      That's... Kind of funny and sad.

      Also a bit worrying, re the author's emotional health. To have a really popular story, but be so convinced it's trash that you take it down like that... That doesn't sound like his head's in a good place.

  If this is the rational Pokémon fic I think it is, I really want to reread it. I’m having trouble opening it in the mega app though, it’s in my offline folder and doesn’t seem to have any content.
  ```

- u/hyphenomicon:
  ```
  I wish people wouldn't delete writing they think is trash. Partly, because they're sometimes wrong, but also because I think that making bad fiction publicly available is a public good. In English classes, you're only ever exposed to exemplary works (at least in theory). There's never any time dedicated to examining bad works to look at them to try and figure out why they're bad, or mediocre works to see what stopped them from becoming great. One of the reasons I like reading amateur fiction and fanfiction is that I can often see the seams of the craftsmanship, and getting to examine them makes me a better reader and writer generally.

    Hear, hear! I still keep my shit up, although it's a bit hard to find since Critics United so graciously removed my stories from FFNET.

  He also said he would release a summary of the rest of the story at some point.
  ```

  - u/knives-san:
    ```
    He did? Any source for this?

  THANK YOU. He deleted it when I was just halfway reading it, and I couldn't stand not knowing how it continued. I searched the net, used the wayback machine, looked in every forum... I had lost all hope. Thank you

- u/BaggyOz:
  ```
  Does anybody care give a brief summary of what the story is? Does it stop at a natural point or does it end in a cliffhanger?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    The format of the story makes the ending a cliff regardless of where your stop. It's so damn insanely good that it's worth it anyway. More than being a good fanfic, TGoC is one of the best *stories* that I've ever read, period.

    In brief, it's a loose retelling of the RGBY games, with FR/LG elements also appearing.
    ```

- u/Areign:
  ```
  Out of curiosity, if this didn't live up to his standards, did he manage to write something else that he thought did?
  ```

  - u/TacticalTable:
    ```
    So, I don't think he does fanfiction anymore. I found him on an old forum awhile back, and honestly? It seems like his writing has still gotten progressively stronger over time. He has a mastery over powerful and evocative speech, and it's only gotten better.

    His story is a cynical, angsty view of a world, but its so damn solid that he could get a book deal with it, if he got the confidence back.
