  Oh snap, did Rain just turn into a Wuxia Cultivator?

  Essence is the power of the 'soul', and he can improve his soul through expending EXP.  Rain is already stronger in his soul than other people of his level, as noted by the Watch's truthtelling ability.

  Rain's most recent development arc is the difference between stats and potential, and how you can raise up potential, then later raise up stats.  It sounds like he's going to (eventually) take it to the meta level and do that with his soul -eg level cap.  That's completely setting breaking.  I guess it explains how the Majistraal (and everyone else) used to be orders of magnitude more powerful in the past.

  Still, it's amusing that he's (eventually) going to figure out how to raise his level cap... by sitting and meditating.  Effectively a wuxia cultivator.

  Also find it amusing that people on royal road hate this chapter so much and call it filler.  Last week, I joked that the story was about Rain sitting down and doing math and that it was the best part of the story, but it really is.  Crazy that they think it's filler, while I think this is potentially one of the most important chapters in the story.

    My current guess is that the Majistraal were the ones to create the system, and before that their mages originally worked by manipulating mana directly. 

    As a patron, regarding this chapter, (tiny spoiler) >!this chapter definitely seems *very* important, as you predicted!<. 

    Readers on RoyalRoad have... interesting tastes. A lot of the top stories on the site are just trash - as in clearly written with little to no forethought and sometimes very little writing skill. Basically: "your boos mean nothing to me, I've seen what makes you cheer". 

    (And RoyalRoad is *also* the home to some excellent amateur fiction that clearly has a lot of effort and thought put into it, just to be clear.)

      I’ve always felt like I was shooting my ratings in the foot by not having more murder, sexual assault, and numbers going steadily upward.  

      Not gonna change though!

        [The Daily Grind](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15925/the-daily-grind) is great! Did you end up seeing a long-term impact from the whole boys kissing thing?

          ```
          I absolutely did!  In about a week, I dropped forty-ish ranks on Royalroad, and since then have slid another sixty or so.  It kinda sucks, but at the same time... I don't ever want to change how I write to appease people who give one star ratings to anything that's mildly gay.

          Also, the first person who ever dropped into my discord server to tell me they liked the story had been shipping James and Anesh for twenty chapters, and I could never disappoint *him*.

      Question regarding the patron chapters: Do they come out faster, as in is the gap between free and patron widening, or is it just a short one-time boost of chapters?
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Same pace.

        Any time a chapter is posted on RoyalRoad, a new chapter is also posted on the Patreon. So today chapter 99 was released on patreon.

        IIRC this is also the case with thursday bonus chapters when they happen.

        The gap between the chapters on patreon and royalroad hasn't increased while I've been a patron (a few months now), I don't think.

    Eh, I do feel like it could have been conveyed so much better. It was super important information but it *felt* like filler, which is just as bad on a writing level.

    It IS the best part! Rain sciencing the magic system is really satisfying.

    >Also find it amusing that people on royal road hate this chapter so much and call it filler.

    Hah, just wait until next week, they might get even more pissed. All the buildup just turns into him >!getting a fucking pet. And for a moment you think the pet is somehow gonna be a secret to him leveling up somehow like maybe he can level up pets. Nope, just a fucking pet that Rain finds cute.!<. It almost made me cancel my Patreon subscription. I'm 8 chapters ahead and >!nothing OP has come out of this little session!<. I like the math and detail in delve, but much of it is starting to seem self-serving. Its math and numbers for the sake of numbers. But none of it is playing into the story heavily.

    1. Rain seems to have gotten no advantage from his heavy use of math. Someone not knowing any math could copy his exact build specs. No one chooses to do so, because its mostly a horrible build for an adventurer.
    2. Rain has not discovered anything new or interesting due to math or munchkinry. In fact, without his armor and gear, he'd be horribly underpowered for his level because he chose a highly specialized build path. Doing something like Amelia's build and diverse skill set probably would have been way more useful for him.
    ```

      > Doing something like Amelia's build and diverse skill set probably would have been way more useful for him.

      Not. He needed to get the language fast. He needed to get the XP fast. He would be horribly underleveled for the stuff he does right now with other builds.

      He also gets a lot of friends because he can fill their mana.

      This is literally the one build that let him, as a noob, rise to where he is right now. And because this is a story, it's the build that allows him to beat his future challenges, because he is unique and can do stuff that others can not. Instead of being "the chosen one" and having some OP power, he is working with the same system everyeone else is.
      ```

        >Not. He needed to get the language fast. He needed to get the XP fast. He would be horribly underleveled for the stuff he does right now with other builds.

        I think we know that now in hindsight. How the hell could he have known these things when he chose his build? That undermines a bit of the rationalist premise for the story. He stumbled onto a decent build for a transmigrator.

        A dynamo focused on straight-up magic spells rather than auras might have also been a deadly combination. It's clear the dynamo aspect of his build is what allows him to get so many XP points so quickly.

    ```
    Royal Road readers are used to quantity. So if chapters like this in twice per week releases they wouldn't complain as much.

    Its hard to see that quality decreses quantity when you are casual reader.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Yeah, I had someone tell me "To be honest, 4 chapters in a month for a fiction start does not look very promising..."  Personally, I've always thought that a consistent once-per-week cycle was pretty good so this really took me by surprise.  Sure, it was four chapters, but it was almost 25,000 words.
      ```

  - u/IgonnaBe3:
    ```
    I mean, the revelation i guess is pretty important but the chapter itself was really short and without much fanfare. This revelation is the only thing really worth mentioning here. It is important for the setting but on its own its not a difficult discovery for rain i feel like. In general i am pretty annoyed with the latest chapters where rain is stuck in a hole and doesnt use his skills to try and break rocks. I would feel like immolate and refrigerate  would make the rock brittle and he could also try to purify rocks as well. He might also train at the same time as well and it might improve his soul strenght....

    instead he does pushups which....are important i guess but i dont think he super needs it in this situation. Its just weird and kills the pacing of the story for me.

    There's like a direct analogy to fundamental research vs practical applications here - gotta have a long, boring Manhattan Project in order to drop a Little Boy.
    ```

  - u/Brell4Evar:
    ```
    How would he be able to raise his level cap, I wonder?

    Abuse of over-health and over-stamina are used to heal and restore fatigue. Is there a way to cancel unlocked skill paths to receive a deluge of over-experience?
    ```

    - u/zorianteron:
      ```
      Ah, but it's essence he needs, not experience!
      ```

  - u/Raszhivyk:
    ```
    I had the same thought when he started figuring out how to strain his soul the way he wants. Is he going to escape that cave a level 30 to 40 monster? Or is going to be something even weirder, where his level doesn't increase, but his capabilities do in some strange fashion.
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      My guess is that he's still exploring the connection between essence and experience, and he'll keep exploring it until he's out for a long time longer.  Like, another 50+ chapters away.

      He's only got five days of food (less since I don't think he accounted for exercise), and with his new exp exploit (708k in day, which is ridiculously faster than previously), the story would simply fall apart if he could gain a dozen levels in a week.  

      Still, there's a lot of stuff it can be useful for until he figures it out.  All the non-level fuzzy stuff seems to scale with it.  But if he can start to break down some of the RPG-ness of the system, he can get all sorts of benefits without a strict level increase.
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        > and with his new exp exploit (708k in day, which is ridiculously faster than previously),

        He should be able to easily get 20x that, if he figures it out.  Refrigerate, Extend, Amplify = 450 mana/s.  Channel 1% to bring it down to 4.5/s, and alternate 1:2 Refrigerate:Winter to keep his mana up.  Instead of 8.2 XP/sec, he'd be averaging 150 XP/s (from one-third of 450/s from Refrigerate).

        He could get ~650/s if he *really* tried, though.  Refrigerate, extend, amplify, focus = 1350 mana/s * 0.01 channel (reduces it to 9-10 DPS), with possible flipflopping with Immolate to deal with the mageburn.  Alternate offensive aura use with Winter singularities ~1:1 for sustainability, and he's good.

        Now I want Velika get him a Blue and tell him to only come back when he's capped again.  Heck, he might even surpass Carten's bets if that happens.

        EDIT: Channel goes down to 0%, doesn't it?  1350 XP/s, there he goes.
        ```

    - u/clawclawbite:
      ```
      I think he is going to be surprised by some of the class options when he hits 25 from all of this.
      ```

- u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
  ```
  Huh, surprised Rain didn't immediately figure out that channel mastery is getting the xp for the mana that it reduces.

  Velocity at 100% for a minute is 600 mana. At 90% its 540 mana, so 60 mana saved by channel = 60 xp. At 80% is 480 mana, so 120 mana saved is 120 xp.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    That's true but you have to see it from his viewpoint. It's ridiculously counter-intuitive for him to gain *more* exp when he spends *less* mana on his skills. In a game that would be considered a glitch. But he isn't in a game but rather an alternate world.

    He'll probably figure it out sooner or later, but for now his assumptions will get in the way.
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      Also, the fact that he's not writing stuff down and systematically plotting this stuff out. When he's got a chance to breathe and think a bit more deeply about the numbers he's getting he'll probably be able to work it out.
      ```

      - u/Luck732:
        ```
        Yeah, Rain is under a ton of pressure, from a lot of different sources right now. I don’t think he is thinking 100% clearly
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          but he has so much Clarity how could that happen
          ```

          - u/Luck732:
            ```
            Clarity, despite the name, doesn’t actually make him think more clearly. The overmana side effect improves his memory, but it doesn’t give any benefits to how calm he is
            ```

- u/ulyssessword:
  ```
  It's too bad Rain doesn't know calculus, he would've figured out that it's almost time to switch to training sync instead (assuming his initial training predictions were both off by the same amount).

  - Effective Strength = (Base + Tolerance) * Sync

  Writing that as symbols:

  - E = TS

  Taking the derivative with respect to time:

  - dE/dt = T dS/dt + S dT/dt

  He can only train one of them at a time, so the formula has two options:

  - dE/dt = 47(0/day) + 0.24(5/day)
  - dE/dt = 47(0.02/day) + 0.24(0/day)

  Solving:

  - dE/dt (Tolerance training) = 1.2/day
  - dE/dt (Sync training) = 0.94/day

  For reference, sync training before the tolerance training would have given a predicted 0.56 points per day.  Assuming that he doesn't change his predicted relative rate of gains, he should switch over when (Base + Tolerance) = 60, so he's about halfway there now.
  ```

- u/DeepTundra:
  ```
  >His words echoed hollowly in the room, then he took a deep breath and shouted. “HEY! SOMEONE GET ME OUT OF HERE! I’M DOING MATH, AND IT IS DRIVING ME INSANE!”

  This is how I feel when people talk about purposefully using Bayes’ Theorem for everyday estimations.

  Anyway, I couldn’t decide if this was the author lampshading how little Rain’s monofocus build attempt with math has actually helped him.
  ```
