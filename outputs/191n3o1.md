## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  I decided to look back upon all the fics I read in 2023 and compiled them into a list.

  - Format: `Score/10: Title [Author] [Fandom] [Misc]`.
  - The scores are a snappy enumeration of my personal rating system. `2/10` means I read for some amount before putting it on hold and theoretically might someday give it another shot but eh, `4/10` means I'm much more likely to give it another shot, `6/10` means I read through all the chapters that was there at the time and enjoyed my time aplenty, `8/10` means I enjoyed it even more, and `10/10` means I enjoyed it so much they're a contender for being among my favorite fics of all time.
  - Only a small percentage of what are `2/10` are included in this list, so this list isn't bloated by fics that my feelings about are mostly summarised as "eh". Consider them a honorable mentions.
  - If it's not a fanfic but instead an original work, it will use `[Original]`.
  - Misc tags: `[SI]` Self-Insert, `[Multi-SI]` Multiple Self-Inserts, `[FI]` Friend-Insert, `[OC]` Original Character, `[Crossover]` Crossover which expands as the work goes on, `[NSFW]` Probably something I got from QuestionableQuesting, `[<100k]` Less than 100k words long.

  If you find anything wrong with the list, like wrong links or a typo somewhere, feel free to let me know.

    Some of those ratings are fightin' words, I really love TransDim, but nice job actually keeping track. I should really do that but it's really tough for me to remember and go through the effort of rating and keeping that rating up to date. Going to have to check a lot of these out.
    ```

    - u/greenweird:
      ```
      Being on the list at all actually means I think they're at least kinda decent lol. Real fighting words would be me listing all the fics I just immediately drop and said "nope", which perhaps the highest profile among them are Skitterdoc 2077.

      Also I'm now realizing that the reason why January is somehow empty might be that I just didn't find *anything* worth reading and just dropped everything.
      ```

    - u/greenweird:
      ```
      I kinda felt like TransDim just pales in comparison to *Unfortunately, I'm not a Hero*, ~~which unfortunely wasn't in the list because my feeling about it is in a bit of a limbo and isn't neatly summarized in any of my ratings~~ oh wait nvm it's actually in the list, but I only rated it a 4/10. It could really go as high as an 8/10 if I didn't just put it on hold because reasons.

      The way I keep track of them is that I download every fics I read as epub, and when I finish I move them into the appropriate folder. I like to have offline copies of the things I like lol.
      ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) has a handy plugin, "FanFicFare", which can be installed under "Preferences" -> "Get plugins to enhance Calibre". If you decide to install it, you will want to configure it as follows:

        * Select "Epub" as the default download format to avoid technical issues
        * Select "Update Epub if New Chapters" as the default download mode
        * Select "Download from URLs" in the FFF menu, enter the URLs of the fics (or RoyalRoad serials) that you are following and wait for them to be downloaded
        * Periodically select the followed fics/serials in Calibre and hit "Update existing FanFiction Books" in the FFF menu, which will download new chapters
        * If you are using Kindle, connect your Kindle to the PC, select the updated fics/serials in Calibre and click "Send to Device"; the conversion from Epub to Mobi/AZW3 is automatic

        If you have a lot of ebooks in Calibre, you may want to create separate Calibre "libraries" for different fandoms, RR serials, etc. That way you can just select all entries in a library before clicking the "update" button.

        The advantage of this method compared to WebToPub is that FFF only downloads new chapters. It's much faster and more convenient, especially for longer works.
        ```

      - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
        ```
        I do like Unfortunately, but I really really don't love it, the core thematic narrative is kind of weak and unfocused, and I had trouble caring about the increasingly large cast, and this one really pushed Hachiman's hypercompetence to extremes, with how much his raw intelligence and understanding of modern earth stuff lets him outcompete the rest of the planet. There were good things about it, the Kunoichi were hilarious and there were several standout character moments, but overall it's a recommendation with caveats. 

        TransDim was just about everything I could've wanted from it, except for a fully written final Act and a stronger core narrative after Book 1.

    I just have one very important question:

    Why is this scale out of 10?
    ```

    - u/greenweird:
      ```
      mostly because that feels like more normal, closer to how people would scores things. `score/5` would be more accurate to how I scores them but a 5/5 and a 3/5 didn't feel quite as intuitive as a 10/10 or a 6/10.

    I'm sorry but I can't take your ratings seriously. Calling Godclads 4/10 and Gacha God 10/10 is just insane. Both of those are in the 5-8 out of 10 range on any remotely objective scale. Like, I disliked a lot stylistically in godclads, but it's way better than a 4/10. And I haven't read gacha god, but I've read 2 of that author's other fics, and neither of them are anywhere near 10/10 territory.
    ```

    - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
      ```
      > remotely objective scale

      The only evaluation criteria stated above are:

      * enjoyment by the poster
      * likelihood of giving a text another shot
      ```

    - u/greenweird:
      ```
      I posted my comment as a reply to another comment but now I'm kinda curious if the two fics you read lines up with what I had also previously read, because I initially thought the same and veered off of the author before *Gacha God* and *Legends Never Dies* changed my mind. The ones I've read were *Going Native* and *Risk It All*, which I rated "2/10", and *See No Evil* which is a "4/10". (all three wasn't in the list because I read them in 2022)

      Edit:

      > Both of those are in the 5-8 out of 10 range on any remotely objective scale.

      Hnnn yeah I was fussing about that too when I wrote the list. Arguably `2, 4, 6, 8, 10` reflects poorly of my actual opinion and is very exaggrated, and perhaps something like `5, 6, 7, 8, 9` fits better. It seems I ultimately went with the former because it looks neater? ~~and maybe to provoke discussions lol~~
      ```

      - u/NnaelKysumu:
        ```
        Ideas-guy has polished his writing a lot. I'm in the same case where I couldn't get into Going Native at all, but now I'm following pretty much every single one of his fictions.
        ```

    - u/Space_To_Growth:
      ```
      I would encourage you to reflect on what motivated you to write this reply. De-reccing a specific fic is okay and so is disagreeing with ratings, but 'I can't take you seriously' and 'you're objectively wrong' sounds really negative. Discouraging folks from sharing big high labour recommendation lists is one of the absolutely last things we want to do as a community.
      ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      I think it's more of an emotional rating system rather than any objective english class thing. Godclads absolutely has better writing chops than Gacha God or any of Idea Guy's other stuff, but I can see why someone would be thrown off immediately upon starting it.
      ```

      - u/greenweird:
        ```
        Yeah that's pretty much it, and what /u/ahasuerus_isfdb said. Honestly there's a lot of fics on a 4/10 or lower that probably deserves much higher score like perhaps *Gone Native: Earth Saga* and *Jackal Among Snakes*, but objectively I have harder time mustering the motivation to read them, whereas stuffs that's 6/10 or higher I just immediately finish.

At long last, I could finally do what I ever wanted to do - experiment for the fun of it!

      Ya know, it's kind of funny. If I don't know if a fic is going to be completed, if the time stretches between each update, and I really wanted to see what was going to happen next... that's rough.

      If, on the other hand, I come across something where the last update was 5 years ago before I even start on it, I don't mind that as much. Then it can be fun to speculate on what might have been, on where things might have gone plot-wise. And maybe imagine my own ending.

    A new one from an established author [Pandora Unchained](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/78050/pandora-unchained-a-cultivation-progression-fantasy) has some promise. Good start though it needs some editing. We will have to see if the MC's cheat skills at the start even out into something more entertaining.

  How do people feel about [Changeling?](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/75345/changeling)

  A Journey of Black and Red was one of my favorite series back in the day, but I feel like Mecanimus took a turn for the worse. Too many "epic" moments without the pre-requisite setup, low stakes, and peanut gallery PoV praise chapters.

  Saw Changeling was his newest series, and wondering if people with a similar opinion would recommend Changeling as a return to form.

  - u/Darkpiplumon:

    I do agree that Changeling is worse than Journey or Calamitous Bob. Or at least is just not my jam.

    While noticeably worse, it's still entertaining. If you do enjoy Mecanimus' writing, go ahead. I can't say much has changed in the last 20 chapters compared to the first 20, so if you don't like it now...

    &#x200B;

    Oh, I'm also hijacking this post to gush about how good Journey of Black and Red is. Very. Very good. Satisfactorily completed, great cast of characters and humor. Great way of showing vampires and other supernatural thingies.  The best of Mecanimus' work.

    I will say that, while very entertaining, the beginning is not how the rest of the story goes. The MC struggles a lot at the start, as the weakling newbie she is. Weak to strong and all that jazz.

    I'm a big fan of Mecanimus, and have thoroughly enjoyed Journey of Black and Red and The Calamitous Bob.

    I don't know about Changeling yet. I started reading the first chapter, and just sort of bounced off of it for whatever reason. I'll definitely give it a try again when the mood strikes me.

  I was putting it off but I finally picked up Butcher of Gadobhra, it has a ton of info dump to start off with but the author starts to work it into the story as the plot goes on. Its pretty fun at the start to see how the characters bypass the limitations set upon them but the main cast do become overpowered fairly quickly and the story very quickly develops the theme of "No matter what, the mc will plot armor this", which takes away from some of the fun early on. I liked the kingdom building aspect of it and they still manage to keep us vs the world aspect of it balanced enough till now.   


  Which leads to me asking for suggestions for any kingdom/town building works that you've come across recently

  Has anyone read [Chaotic Craftsman worships the Cube](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41656/chaotic-craftsman-worships-the-cube)? I started the first 10 chapters and it seems that the character is quite thoughtful but not too sure how rational it can be or if it’s following those premises.

    I haven't tried it, but I feel like being in the "Popular This Week" section on Royal Road is practically a de-rec if a story isn't also in Rising Stars or Best Rated. Anyone else feel the same way?

      I've found that Royal Road pretty much follows the rules of most other online rating systems - if it's below a 4.5/5, it's absolute garbage.

        I kinda want to take this as a challenge, but I haven't read anything from Royal Road ~~Legends~~ recently, so the stuffs I scrounge up are all old favorites that I haven't read in a really long while.

        - 4.31/5: [Daybreak on Hyperion (re) [Aorii]](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43678/daybreak-on-hyperion-re) (I've only read the [old version](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42771/daybreak-on-hyperion-legacy))
        - 4.47/5: [Overseer [Solistia]](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/1233/overseer)
        - 4.41/5: [Displaced [IrateRapscallion]](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15538/displaced)
        - 4.46/5: [A Hero's War [jseah]](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war)
        - 4.48/5: [Worth the Candle [Alexander Wales]](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle) (wait, *this* is below 4.5?)

        ...I guess the fact that they're all only *just* below 4.5 kinda proves your point.

        While that's true generally, I think the RR votership also imposes a voting penalty on works that aren't "webfiction", even if they aren't trash. This means that more experimental stuff or something that might do well as an actual published book gets a hit.
        ```

      - u/NTaya:
        ```
        I've thoroughly enjoyed works rated, e.g., ~7 on IMDb or ~4 on RoyalRoad (I think a few books I liked are below 4 on GoodReads also?). I wouldn't recommend any of those to *everyone*, but they perform well in their niche. Even reviews aren't a good metric—some of the negative ones to *Worth the Candle* are utterly insane.

    Its a decent story story that didn't slap me in the face with a lack of rationality.

    It wouldn't be a good novel, but it's a good web serial. On the low level, the writing is not stellar but decent (I'd say it gets somewhat better than the first 10 chapters, but not a lot); on a high level, there is an overarching plot, but it's not usually the focus, and it's not incredibly detailed. I think it does whatever's left in in between those two levels pretty well! It's formulaic, but I mean that in a good way; it executes some standard ideas pretty well, and if you enjoy them, it's easy to keep reading.

    One of the more notable formulas that it executes pretty well is the "spite" formula. Think the Count of Monte Cristo, or if you want a more down-to-earth comparison, think all those Harry Potter fanfics where Harry is unjustly imprisoned in Azkaban. In Chaotic Craftsman, which is a LitRPG setting where the main character quickly becomes overpowered, this is hard to pull off. The solution is that the main character gets his power in a way that's unconventional or not widely known, making it easy for future antagonists to dismiss him as insignificant. Then they gain the audience's dislike somehow, often by being a jerk to the main character because they see him as irrelevant, and then they get their just comeuppance.

    In terms of rationality, the story usually doesn't do too badly, though it doesn't stand out either. However, the main way it fails to follow the rules in the sidebar of this subreddit is related to the "spite" formula I described above: occasionally, in order to make the antagonist of the story arc sufficiently unimpressed with the main character, we have to hit whoever it is with the idiot ball several times first. (This tends to be more necessary as the story goes on and the main character becomes objectively more impressive, but fortunately, it's not a regular thing.) For instance, the most recent story arc (which I'm going to describe without spoilers) has a conflict entirely predicated on the characters not talking about the reason they have beef with each other. It's not 100% stupid: it's a reasonably plausible misunderstanding to occur, and plausible that neither side would clarify. But it's maybe 50% stupid, because either side really making a genuine effort to avoid the conflict, instead of leaning into being offended, would have neutralized the plot line.

  Can anyone recommend good military history podcasts? I convinced my father to listen to the History of Rome and Revolutions podcasts by Mike Duncan and he liked them, but wanted one with the same level of professionalism that Duncan has, while instead focusing on military history, particularly pivotal battles. I don't really listen to military history podcasts so I can't give him any direct recommendations, and just googling "military podcasts" then sending him the link feels insufficient.

    I assume you know of Dan Carlin's [Hardcore History](https://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/)? It's the OG history podcast and it's great, though not exclusively about military history. You can listen to the recent episodes for free, or you can buy older episodes. 

    If you don't mind youtube, I like the following:

    [SandRhoman History](https://www.youtube.com/@SandRhomanHistory) - Focusing mostly on late medieval, early modern Europe. 

    [Historia Civilis](https://www.youtube.com/@HistoriaCivilis) - Focusing on Rome. 

    [History Marche](https://www.youtube.com/@HistoryMarche) - The highest production value videos, though I still prefer the others.
