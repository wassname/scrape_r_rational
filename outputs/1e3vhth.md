## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Main recs:

  [Industrial Strength Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57011/industrial-strength-magic) by Macronomicon, Featuring Perry, a genius son of 2 superhero parents who finally got his power, in world ripe for exploiting. I'm reccing this here again because it completed on patreon last month and is 2-3 weeks or so off from finishing on Royal Road. ISM has some amazingly creative power usage, awesome worldbuilding, and really intense showdowns and set piece action sequences, but the pacing is inconsistent and the plot sometimes feels aimless and meandering. While I do strongly recommend it, it can't be denied that it's one of Macronomicon's most... unpolished works(all of which I recommend, though with various caveats). Still better than the vast majority of the dross out there, to be clear, just not this author's best effort imo. 

  [Alexandra Quick and the Wizard War](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14342598/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Wizard-War) - Book 6 of the Alexandra Quick series. Imagine if after HP finished an old dude with serious writing chops set out to write an american version set in the same universe... but discarded almost all the things that make fanfiction writing easier than normal writing; an established setting, charaters that the readers known and already like, and vague sequence of plot/structure to either conform to or subvert. Imagine if they did that. somehow made it work, and then kept at it for the better part of 20 years, and you get the Alexandra Quick series. Its absolutely unique. I haven't read HP since 2007, but to my mind this series has already surpassed it in most ways. 

  [Elydes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/67742/elydes) - An original high magic SI transmigration story, with the protagonist specialising in magic. A while ago /u/thephrastusbombastus recommended this here and I kind of shit on it because it features a lot of my pet peeves very prominently (e.g. the SI comes from the modern world but that rarely actually matters except insofar as his inner monologue and his morals, which never actually matters for the plot) but I picked it up again recently and quickly caught up, so here I am, eating my words. Yes, a lot of my criticisms are still valid, but I was too harsh. Elydes has several points in its favour, all which are in short supply elsewhere: decent prose, good magic system, good power scaling, and a~~n unobnoxious~~relatable MC. It's actually incredible how rare even one of those are, let alone all together. So... yeah. Eatin' ma words.

    I personally found the Alexandra Quick series intolerable, because of the main character's personality. Does she get less headstrong in the new book?

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I'd agree she's pretty bad in the first book, but becomes more nuanced in each book as she grows up. She's still headstrong though, it's her defining character trait/flaw. I'd say it's somewhat comparable to Taylor from worm.
      ```

      - u/grekhaus:
        ```
        Her being headstrong in the first book felt okay, because it's a realistic character flaw for a kid that age. Especially one who is suddenly being discriminated against and is pushing back against that. But by the fourth book, she'd been burned so many times by acting like that and she still doesn't even hesitate. I couldn't bring myself to finish the fifth book, given how things had gone.

    > Industrial Strength Magic

    While I can see why other people would love it, it's a de-rec from me because ISM feels like yet another Macronomicon story with the same protagonist, under a different coat of paint. His stories are great for amazing power usage and interesting worldbuilding, but they don't deliver very well for good characterization, emotionality, or drama. IIRC the author has said before that he doesn't experience emotions the same way as most people, but the lack of any good heart-tugging in his stories makes them feel a bit dead and samey after a while, at least for me.
    ```

    - u/jacksofalltrades1:
      ```
      For what it's worth, in Industrial Strength Magic the MC explores his own psychopathy a bit. One of the stats he can pump points into is attunement, and when that stat becomes too much higher than the others, the MC really slides into full-on psychopathy. 

      It took me a while to figure out why I like his stories. They don't have heart tugging moments (which I do really like in other stories). They are funny, though. Most of all I see them as agency porn - no other characters I have read just up and do stuff as much as his characters do.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        > Most of all I see them as agency porn - no other characters I have read just up and do stuff as much as his characters do.

        That's a great way to put it! I always found Macro's secret sauce hard to describe, but you nailed it.  The way I've come to think of it is that his stuff is "dynamic to a fault". For better or worse, he never truly lingers on any aspect of his worlds, whether they're plot devices/elements, scenarios, locations, side character, protagonist trauma or any type of pathos in general, and even power level. Even when you wish he would stick around and explore a scenario or relationship or power dynamic, things tends to be either moving forward or they're left behind. When I first encountered his stuff 5 or so years ago it was a huge breath of fresh air compared to the typical rr/webnovel fare, but since then it lost its shine a bit. 

        The culmination of this tendency Macro has is how, immediately following the climax of an arc when the protagonists has just reached a new, unprecedented new peak in their power... everything is snatched away somehow and they reset to zero, having to start all over from scratch in a brand new power framework. Macro does multiple times in at least 3 separate works that I can think of, and I've hated since the first, The Outer Sphere(his breakout success), where he did it 100 chapters in and it lost him like 80% of his audience and tanked that fic's rating. The subsequent times have never been as bad as that, but why he keeps doing it I'll never understand.

          > but why he keeps doing it I'll never understand

          I mean, the obvious explanation is that he's writing for himself and the readership is incidental, which imho is the optimal strategy for the best art, though obviously the efficacy of that strategy is up to personal preference.
          ```

          - u/aaannnnnnooo:
            ```
            It's also not an objectively terrible thing to do--except in progression fantasy. Stitch Worlds features power resets and using different power systems that are interesting and their inclusions adds to the story but their inclusion also makes the series not be progression fantasy and instead general fantasy, where power resets between books is far more common a trope.

            The audience hating it is bad signposting by the author rather than being a bad idea; the first Stitched Worlds book is a fairly typical litRPG which just exacerbates the issue.
            ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      Seems fairly obvious the author is on the psychopathy spectrum (no judgement). Reading his novels is kind of like reading a Wales novel, except that instead of all characters having mild autism, they have mild psychopathy, i.e. disinhibition and etc. Most characters are frank and overly rational negotiators in a way that most people aren't, for example. I personally enjoy them, it helps to know what you're getting going in.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        > psychopathy spectrum 

        You probably mean to say sociopath, I imagine? They're functionally the same, with psychopathy having a more violent, unstable, criminal connotation. Regardless, I would question either term being applied to Macronomicon because of how he writes fictional characters(or any other author for that matter). Not because it's offensive or anything, it's just too subjective and spurious.
        ```

        - u/Amonwilde:
          ```
          Honestly both terms are BS, but in my experience there is a phycopathy spectrum (I did look it up before posting and decided on psychopathy, but I don't really think there's a valid difference reflected in reality rather than in the literature, and you don't really lay out any reasons to prefer one or the other other than stigma, and both are stigmatizing). I have a couple acquaintance that fit into a a category with similar traits that include risktaking, indifference (but not lack of understanding) of social cues, little internalized morality, etc. They're often quite rational and are not criminal, though the traits probably put them at some increased risk.

          Obviously my opinion is subjective. I'm painting with a broad brush, but I actually think it's slightly less spurious than you're suggesting. (Not that you really say why it's spurious, though I'm pretty low confidence myself on the claim.) Macronomicon has really only written one protagonist across ~4 major novels, they all have a distinct reasoning process that is decidedely psychopathic (or sociopathic if you prefer). Further, unless he's carefully writing a character a different way (the chemical controller in Industrial Strength, for example, or the gentle tinker girlfriend), his other characters tend to be be bold, uninhibited rationalists with decent social skills. 

          While there's a failure mode in attributing characterizations to the author (you can't attribute much to Nobokov for writing Lolita, though folks do), I think a reasonable reading of Macronomicon's oeuvre is that his main characters are all wizard self-inserts, and he writes others to think the way he thinks. It would be odd to slant things so much that way if he didn't trend that way himself, and his author notes and comments have a similar tone to the ubiquitous MC tone. Finally, he's also said he thinks differently from others, and specifically with regard to these traits.

          Anyway, my spurious and subjective two bits.
          ```

    I really like what I've read of Alexandra Quick so far, but I'm not sure what Elydes is trying to do in its world building.

    The first chapters spend so long setting up this interesting situation , where the main character is born into the bottom rung of a racial and magical caste system. Living under a colonial society that dispossesses and starves his people while constantly dealing with them in bad faith, but then the main character seems to look down on his people and disagree with them for becoming resentful and turning to insurgency.

    It spends so long setting up this fraught situation for the character to get drawn into, and then has the main character ignore it to keep grinding skills , with a few lines to say that his people should learn their place and just try to keep bargaining for small concessions. Maybe it gets better later on, but it was so jarring that it completely snapped me out of the fic.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      Yeah, the story's main problem in the beginning is the pacing and the lack of narrative tension. [Here's my counter-rec](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/16lwd15/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/k185abo/?context=3) from the last time this was recommended, which I apparently forgot to link above. 

      I do think the story gets better the older he gets, which is why I recommended it. Is that worth reading a hundreds of thousands of words to get to? I guess that's up to the individual. The author also made several changes to the version published on amazon, maybe that's better?

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    The Prince of Nothing series by R. Scott Bakker and its follow-up would fit the first part of your request, that of hijacking a religion. 

    The premise is: Kellhus is a child of the dunyain, a philosophical order that has been hidden for millennia in the far wilderness, breeding human like cattle, selecting for physical and intellectual excellence. From there he is sent into the world, the second to ever leave the dunyain, with the sole objective finding and killing the first, his father. In order to do so he must join and dominate a crusade and ensure it serves his own ends.

        I thought of some more that might match what you're looking for. You've probably read these first few, but in case you haven't. 

        Rational:   

        * Speaker for the Dead - , the protagonist inadvertently starts a secular religion in the previous book Ender's game, and this one(set thousands of years later) explores it a bit. 
        * Stranger in a Strange Land - A seminal scifi book from the 60's, the protagonist founds another secular religion after growing up among martians. 
        * Lord of Light - A classic by Zelazny about the exploitation of religion for selfish ends.
        * Oryx and Crake - Religion doesn't really figure much in the first book, but it becomes a major theme of the sequels. 

        Not rational(?):    

        * Tree of Aeons - SI transmigrates into an immortal spirit tree psychopomp and breaks the setting, eventually becoming an >!SPOILER: interdimensional god-king!<. This story has many, many flaws, but it's one of only two multi-generational magitech uplift kingdom builders out there and the other one is even worse in a lot of ways, so what can you do. 
        * Lord of the Mysteries - Haven't read this yet, but it's been recommended here and elsewhere a lot. I believe the MC eventually founds a religion.
        ```

        - u/serge_cell:
          ```
          > Lord of the Mysteries

          I didn't see anything of MC accomplished as founding a religion. Secret society slash xianxia-like magical sect sure. But nothing like "worship generate power", magical/divine or political.
          ```

        - u/Samuning:
          ```
          Funny, I've never actually read any of those classics, despite them being on the wishlist forever. Guess I have a reason to start digging through them.

          Thanks!

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I'm guessing you've already read Dune? If not, I'd recommend it. It's not fully rational, but one of its big themes is codified religion. 

    Secondly, Slumrat Rising kind of gets into this. It has a xianxia setting based on hermeticism and medieval christian cosmology (sort of). The recent couple arcs have been about how to imagine a better world. Due to in-world events this is somewhat hard to do and it's better to start from the religion-end of it, and there's discussion on how to make a religion that achieves prosocial goals.
    ```

    - u/Samuning:
      ```
      Yeah, have read Dune. Though it may be time to reread Messiah.

      Thanks, will check out Slumrat Rising!

    The Foundation series by Isaac Asimov is a sci-fi take on this. Math historian realizes the benevolent empire is about to die, leading to a chaotic dark age in the galaxy, so he sets out to shorten the 'inevitable' dark age and guide humanity toward a stable and happy future.

    It's a sci-fi classic. For good reason.

  I've recently been exposed to a very particular genre, the "infiltrating a magical school" one. It combines the mystery/spy genre with the magical school/university/whatever ones.
  Some examples:

  [Saving the school would have been easier as a cafeteria worker](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/saving-the-school-would-have-been-easier-as-a-cafeteria-worker.1160221/#post-100999789) (also on RR)

  From the author of the recent [Youjo Senki/Pokemon ](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-fair-l-y-contentious-pokemon-journey-pokemon-youjo-senki.1173147/) and slightly less recent [Megamind/Worm](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/heroes-are-made-worm-megamind.1162743/#post-101368323) crossovers (also good, give them a read), this is a pretty decent story, despite the "quirky" LN title aside, and the self insert/cool and edgy animeman tones at the beginning.
  OP MC is ordered to infiltrate the School for Nobles of the "we're currently at peace but we really don't like each other" enemy country, in order to stop a big demon summoning. That or blow up the whole school and kill all the students, either is fine. 
  The MC has some unique capabilities that allow him to do the forementioned infiltration, but is really not trained for it, and it looks like usual politicking may be the reason for his orders.
  Interesting world building and cool story so far. 


  Secondly, there's [Confessions of the magpie wizard](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27872/confessions-of-the-magpie-wizard/chapter/416384/book-1-prologue). Here, the half demon kinda demon nobility MC is voluntold to pretend to be a human survivor, and joins the Magical Academy for Killing Demons in Our War Against the Demons.

  I was going to explain more about the story and the MACDOWAD, but I've just realized that it's very much stubbed on RR, so you can't read anything unless you want to pay or commit piracy. 


  Both of these stories are pretty good (even if they're not great-great), and should definitely have more readers.  Especially compared to other fiction you may find on Royal Road. 
  If you have recommendations of similar themes, please do share. Comedy and Romance are fine, but I'm less interested in "Katarina-esque" stuff.


  ---
  Bonus recommendations!
  Some blast from the past that I've just remembered. 

  The first one, [Daybreak on Hyperion ](https://samaran-daybreak.com/index.php/2020/11/14/volume-1-chapter-1/) I honestly don't remember that much about this one, other than it being pretty dense and me eventually dropping it. It starts with what may look like standard Isekai invocation stuff, similar to Familiar of Zero, but it quickly becomes clear it's something very different.

  Despite my less than stellar description, I do believe it may be suited for more rationalistic readers. It explores themes such as transgenderism, war and economics, inter kingdom politics and stuff like that. It's the kind of book that I felt I could have enjoyed a lot more if I was smarter.

  Secondly, there's the (finished!) light novel [Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria](https://katdon.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/light-novels-utsuro-no-hako-to-zero-no-maria-volume-1/), Hakomari for its friends or "The Empty Box and the Zeroth Maria" for its less weeb acquaintances. There may be other translations out there, or you may just buy it, there probably is an official English translation out somewhere.

  Anyway, without getting into that many spoilers, there are like 6 volumes of this story, and each of them there's a game or theme. There's a ROB out there fulfilling their court-mandated Make a Wish Foundation appearances with pretty bad results for everyone involved. Time loop, memory loss, Danganronpa-like murder mystery, doppelganger stuff (may have misremembered or made some of them up), our intrepid hero will have to solve the puzzle in order to continue living a quiet life! And not have himself and his loved experience a fate worse than death!

  Some heavy stuff in the books, and I wasn't a fun of the ending. If you aren't allergic to light novels, and you can find a good translation, it is pretty good. 
  And even if you aren't that much of a fan of anime high school stuff, the first novel has an unordered time loop going on. We as readers reveal through time too. Loop 20-> 3-> 4-> 11 -> 0 and so on. So I'd recommend it just based on this premise.

    If you like the "infiltrating a magic school" setting, you might like The Demon Prince Goes To The Academy. 


    The titular demon prince is actually the author of the novel who was transmigrated into the novel with a system attached to himself. The system part is done very tastefully, it's not in your face and mostly just adds a dimension to the story without overcomplicating it. The story is very good in the beginning, the protagonist makes pretty well thought out decisions, and he actually has a personality. Unfortunately, after around 300 chapters there's a big turning point, and the genre of the story kind of changes, although technically it is foreshadowed for a long time. Anyways, I'd recommend trying it out, you can find fairly good translations online.

  # Contest / Prediction Market

  A few weeks ago I planned to set up a sorta-prediction market for which stories I might like to free up my to-read list on RR. I finally sent a call to my acquaintances, so I might as well post it here. 

  I can't offer y'all the same reward as to my acquaintances (we live in the same country; I can't send money or buy Steam games to people outside of CIS), so the reward for the winner will be a bit different. I'll buy the winner either Factorio, or the DLC to Factorio that comes out on the 21st of October (it's priced the same as the base game), or a $20 virtual card active for one week that you can use to buy stuff on the Internet.

  The voting, both for my acquaintances and for you, closes 2024-07-21 20:59 UTC.

  *Edit:* I'll read through all stories recommended at least once. Dropping the story in the first ~2k words is -10 points, reading it until the ~50k words mark is +10 points, everything else is between those two values. I'll be done with reading and announce my judgement in 7-35 days after the voting closes depending on the number of entries; I might post weekly updates here with recs/derecs here, but no promises.

  # Entries

  My abbreviated to-read list, featuring only stuff I might reasonably want to read now based on the description/tags, sorted in decending order of length (1st is ~3kk words, last is ~70k).

  # What I like

  What I like, in no particular order:

  1. Inhuman protagonists and/or PoVs. Not "human in a funny hat" like a vampire or mermaid or someone transmigrated into a goblin keeping all the past memories. I look at anyone bipedal with suspicion because it implies convergent evolution. Hell, the very presence of legs makes me squint if something tries to pass as a "non-human lead."

  2. Romance or friendship of a human-ish character with an inhuman character as described above.

    2.1. Unusual romance in general.

  3. Either OP protags played for funsies, or weak (optionally -to-strong-to-OP) protags played seriously.

  4. Slow burn with painstakingly detailed worldbuilding, character development (not necessarily of the MC), and introspection.

  5. Villain protagonists who are not extremely evil but obviously not moral. Bonus points for literally being on the defined evil side of the setting.

  6. Hard magic systems and hard science fiction; the harder, the better.

  7. Breaking/glitching out the systems that govern the world (e.g., in fantasy, xianxia, and the like).

  8. Intelligent and, more importantly, curious protagonists who explore as much as possible the situation they found themselves in.

   8.1. Paired with this, an overarching mystery.

  9. Engaging prose.

  10. Characters making realistic mistakes based on what knowledge they have at the time.

  11. Time loops (NB: without save points; everything should reset permanently).

  What I don't like, in descending order of how likely it is to make me nope out of the story:

  1. SPaG errors of any kind.

    1.1. Typos are also not welcome—but if those are indeed rare typos and not persistent mistakes, they are not as terrible.

  2. Stupid characters and/or characters who are not curious.

    2.1. Characters who are smart in a trope-y way and not realistically. E.g., you can't follow Sherlock Holmes deductions because in real life, he would've been pulling them out of his ass.

    2.NB: Silly characters who have weird goals (like "befriend everyone in sight") who try to achieve their goal in a rational manner are actually very welcome.

  3. Extremely fast pace, especially with frequent time skips and/or glossing over how characters achieve their goals or do stuff in general.

  4. Sexual content (NB: sometimes it's not a dealbreaker, depends on how it's handled).

  Works that have a headstart of sorts in my mind, in no particular order:

  1. Thresholder (I like the author).

  2. The Gods Are Bastards and Hoard (I *really* like the author).

  3. Cinnamon Bun and Reach Heaven Via Feng Shui Engineering (I read the first few chapters a year+ ago and moderately liked them).

  4. Demesne, Super Supportive, Ave Xia Rem Y, Virtuous Sons, To the Far Shore, The Years of Apocalypse (were recommended, though sometimes lukewarmly, on r/rational).

  Works with a reverse-headstart:

  1. Borne Of Caution (I dropped it on chapter two because it was not what I expected, but I was so nitpicky with that expectation that I'm fully willing to give it a second chance).

  2. Virtuous Sons (I read the first few chapters years ago and was not gripped, though from the technical point of view the story was solid).

  # Misc

  You can ask me for the list of recs people have made so far, if you are interested or think it could influence your vote. If you *really* want, you can make anti-recs which would award points inversely—but I obviously would only check the works that have at least one rec on them, so de-recing something that hasn't been rec'd is pointless.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    I'm the author of *Reach Heaven Via Feng Shui Engineering*, let me go through your list to see if I can inform you better.

    * Inhuman protagonists and/or PoVs - no. Latest arc has a non-human character, but their psychology is human, which is what I think you are referring to.

    * Romance - no romance.

    * OP protags - deuteragonist can be described this way, and is played somewhat comedically; protagonist is fighting uphill.

    * Slow burn w/ worldbuilding, character development, introspection - one of the goals of the story is playing with the tropes of the xianxia genre. I have been told by some readers that they like the worldbuilding and introspection, thinking of character goals and so on, and I try to put work into it. Wherever it's slow burn or not is subjective.

    * Villain protagonists - protagonist is a trickster, but morality of their society would place them solidly on the good side.

    * Hard magic systems - I have magic blueprints in the story.

    * Breaking/glitching out magic - no.

    * Intelligent, curious protagonists - yes, very.

    * overarching mystery - there is an overarching mystery, though it had not been the central focus so far compared to more immediate problems.  

    * Engaging prose - subjective, in the past I had very big disagreements with people over this sort of question. Prose I find engaging is one they don't, and vice versa, so I will refrain from commenting.

    * Characters making realistic mistakes - yes.

    * Time loops - no, but time dilation is a common aspect.

    * SPaG errors - subjective, there are errors, how big of a deal they are is up to you. Some of them are made deliberately as a stylistic choice, mostly things around specific xianxia phrases I like. If you read the first few chapters already you would already be familiar with the degree to which this affects you, and just as a result of writing more words this presumably improves as the story goes on.

    * Stupid characters - not among the main cast, at least in my opinion.

    * Extremely fast pace - subjective. Time skips are infrequent, there is no glossing over - arguably I go into far too much detail on some things.

    * Sexual content - there is no sex on screen, though it is mentioned.


    In regards to the recommendations, I have not read most of these. I would recommend Reach Heaven Via Feng Shui Engineering, Thresholder and The Gods Are Bastards, and un-recommend Virtuous Sons (the way the story is written its hard to tell what information people know or don't know, or figure out why they do certain things). Super Supportive gets a very slightly positive rating - I think it technically fits most of the points on this list, but I don't think it is going for the underlying preferences, if that makes sense.

    Below fics are some of the best xeno-fiction I've read, with actual inhuman protagonist, who go on to have friendship with humans.

    [Onward to Providence](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/onward-to-providence-alien-trucker-with-goldfish-stowaways-original-fiction.616857/) Alien trader/merchant who ends up transporting humans as cargo due to certain treaties. Slow burn, and great worldbuilding with actual "alien" aliens.

    [Shining Wyrm](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shining-wyrm-the-blood-immaculate-original-fantasy-dragon-fiction.1110837/) Actual dragon raised by humans, with a very interesting cast of side characters. Lots of character development.


    For the evil protagonist, I'll have to recommend the gold standard for this genre, [Reverend Insanity](https://novelbin.me/novel-book/reverend-insanity). Extremely rational protagonist, focusing on self-improvement with the final goal of seeking immortality. He is not exactly evil, but extremely self-serving, which leads him to commit evil acts for the sake of profits and his interests. One caveat is going to be that the prose isn't going to be great, as this is a translation from the original chinese webnovel.
    ```

  - u/AviusAedifex:
    ```
    Tenebroum fits pretty well. Evil inhuman protagonist, and slow burn with a big focus on worldbuilding. Personally I wasn't a huge fan, it has the usual problem which is that because the protagonist is evil, most of the people he's up against aren't that much worse, which I find really boring. Otherwise it fits 1 very well, as well as 3, 4, 5(he's straight up evil), 8, and 9, but I'm not the best at judging prose. It's probably the best fit out of your list, although I've only tried liked a third so that's not saying much

    [Father of Monstrosity](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/62577/father-of-monstrosity-also-available-on-amazon) is another similar one. The protagonist himself is human although is very into *humane* clothing, but his upbringing wasn't human and it features the very cool, but very rare power of fleshcrafting. It's also finished, and pretty short(only 600 pages), and remains good throughout, even if the last arc and the ending are clearly rushed.

    The Flower That Bloomed Nowhere fits 4, 8, 10, but definitely not 11, with a big focus on 4 over everything else. It has time loop as a tag, but it's very different than something like Mother of Learning, so don't go in expecting it to be the focus. It's a great mystery with interesting world building. Zero progression and a few fights, so it's very out of the norm as far as Royalroad goes. I recommend it, but it is long and very slow.

    If you're taking recommendations I'd add Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint which is a Korean webnovel, although it also has a very solid manhwa adaptation. Features a lot of 7 which isn't as common in western webnovels as eastern ones, unfortunately. It does 8 pretty well too. It's the best Korean webnovel I've read. Does everything really well. Except for the prose maybe. I've read so many translated web novels that I don't care about the prose unless it's really, *really* bad.
    ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    A lot of these stories are good at getting you to read 50k+ words, but I think Super Supportive is your best bet for what you say you like. It won't match with your every preference, but it'll make up for it and hit some of them at novel angles.
    ```

- u/icekiss83:
  ```
  I want to recommend the story Hoard: https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/76478/hoard

  Except for the MC himself, most notable characters are not human. Most of the non-humans are a group of dragons. And I am absolutely fascinated by how well their alien thought process is shown to us. The biggest power the MC has, is being able to understand their thought process, and improve their social relations to him and amongst each other thanks to that. Which is such a big breath of fresh air in comparison to the increasing fight prowess normally marking the MC as getting stronger.
  Even apart from the dragons, there is lots of fascinating world building going on, which is a pleasure to read.

  In the newest released chapter on RR (46 - The Truth Reflects Well on You), the MC has finally figured out what a (mostly?) antagonistic character is trying to achieve with regards to him. At this point I can definitely say that this is a very intelligent and well written adversary. Big props to the story for having nobody carry the idiot ball (as far as I can see)! Also big props to the story for having dropped all necessary hints so that we the readers could figure it out before the MC, if we were good enough.

  Lastly, I just enjoy the generally upbeat vibe this story has. Stuff is messy, but the MC got a big lucky break, and is now hard at work entrenching it, and using this lever to make his environment a lastingly better place. And with that, the world.

  I started reading this story as a guilty pleasure (dragons! harem!), but by now think it is truly a gem of a story, and at least rational-adjacent. I'll let you be the judges where precisely to sort it in. ;-)
  ```

  - u/AccretingViaGravitas:
    ```
    I think it's worth mentioning that it's going on hiatus for now so the author can work on editing manuscripts.

    But if you can get past the dragon harem aspect of the story, it's relatively wholesome and upbeat. I'm also enjoying it, similar style to The Gods Are Bastards as you might expect from the same author.
    ```

  ```
  Does anyone have any great rational zombie apocalypse recommendations? I really enjoyed the “After it happened” series by Devon C Ford. Not specially zombies but more post apocalypse survival.
  ```

  - u/LaziIy:
    ```
    I enjoyed the first two books of [Don't feed the dark](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/6245/dont-feed-the-dark), it does have a bit of a frustrating human element to it since you feel as though some cast are straight tropes out of movies but it was a fun read back then. Author quit the work though just as a heads up.

      I'd argue against World War Z- it is a bit lacking in internal consistency and gives the distinct impression of a world set up so popular or "rule of cool" solutions to zombie apocalypses are the best way to proceed. 

      Try this for a more internally consistent fic that treats World War Z as in-universe propaganda:
