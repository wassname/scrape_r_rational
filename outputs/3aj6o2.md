## The End of GEB's Hitatus

### Post:

This is an apology and a warning.

I am sorry for stopping so abruptly with the read through of **Godel, Escher, Bah: An Eternal Golden Braid**.

Fortunately, I will be posting the next chapter, Chapter XVI: Self-Ref and Self-Rep, on Sunday at 5 PM Eastern Time.

I already have the post ready to go. This is just to allow people to get the chance to read the chapter before I post.

Here's the links to all of the [previous discussions](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2yys1i/lets_start_the_read_through/) if you want to refresh your memory on the previous chapters.
