  I'm really looking forward to the day Catherine figures out how to murder that freaking Bard.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    Aww, I like her.
    ```

- u/Oaden:
  ```
  Sabbah was kinda so expected that i didn't expect her to be the one to actually fall. That is of course, presuming bard speaks true

  I guess Ash priestess was the additional weight that was missing that black was thinking of?

  So that means the Tyrant send several caravans, with one fake ritual, one real ritual and as set up for a story of maidens and monsters

  What a muddled chapter. I went back and forth on where the axe was going to fall - Captain, Warlock, Black...

  I am still not convinced that Captain was killed, because like Black says:

  >“Third, I needed the monster to be the one attacking,” the Bard continued nonchalantly. “That was the easy one. Love, Amadeus. Love always fucks you over. All I had to do was suggest Champion join White after the wall fell, and your dear friend stepped in.”

  >It wouldn’t be enough, Amadeus thought. They’d only fought once before, and not on that story. **There (sic) lacked weight.**

  While Champion is from a culture of more, er, "traditional" heroes (a la Heracles), she is given the opportunity to leave in the last chapter.

  >“I don’t suppose you could just go back to Levant?” Sabah asked. “Leave the Empire alone. I’m fairly sure Black would not pursue if you just stuck to your borders.”

  Not to mention that Sabah still has her unknown third aspect to rely upon. And Wekesa fails to confirm before being cut off. AND Bard uses the future tense describing how Sabah "will die." She's already been wrong about who would bite it with Hedge/Warlock.

  On the other hand, it could be argued that the Beast could be killed:

  >“She’s not fighting Captain,” the Bard said. **“She’s fighting a monster...."**

  ... because by the end of the fight, Sabah lets the Beast take over. Similar to the Nemean Lion, it's definitely a traditional story for the hero to kill the beast that preys upon virgins. But it does feel lacking compared to, say, the story of a woman avenging her sister's death. And even if the Beast is killed, that's only one aspect of Sabah - she's no longer the Cursed, she's the Captain. I weigh the odds in favor of her being seriously injured or losing an aspect over her being killed. But I'm not, like, going to flip a coin on it!

  Meanwhile, two heroes are (seemingly) confirmed dead, White is severely injured and likely a captive of the Tyrant, and I can't imagine Champion is feeling too great after her fight. The side of Good doesn't seem to be looking so great right now. Granted, Black is beaten to hell and back, Warlock is close to being tapped, we don't know the outcome of Ranger's fight with the Queen of Summer, and Assassin is very oddly MIA after seemingly being tasked with taking out Bard (Interlude: Cadenza). So I guess Evil's taken a beating too.

  Black's reaction to Sabah's possible death seems... odd. He's laid out plans to kill each of the Calamities, and knows it must happen sometime or Catherine's in deep trouble. So it doesn't seem like he should be too upset if she did die here. 

  I dunno, overall it feels like this was anticlimactic. Although the fights were awesomely described. And props to the last line:

  >“This one feels like a sin, doesn’t it?” she mused. “Remember that, when the gears start turning.”

  ... which, if you missed it, references the Legion's famous motto:

  >“One grace, victory. One sin, defeat.”
  ```

  ```
  Hm. Seems like Nicae fell and half the heroes are dead in exchange for the Captain. (RIP my favorite calamity ;_;) Does that count as a draw? Because it seems like a pattern of 3 is in the making for Bard vs. the forces of Evil.

  I guess the sisters are together in death now. And we didn't even get to see Captain's third aspect, dang.
  ```

- u/Mgmtheo:
  ```
  RIP Captain. Press F to pay respects.

  ```
  Personally, I’m not too sure that she’s dead. Like she said, if you’re strong enough, you can out muscle Fate itself. Even if the Bard gave the Champion a power up, I’m not sure if that’s enough to let her beat Captain.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    In addition, champion already used two aspects, while Captain only used one, and the last one of those is secret. Warlock also has one unused secret aspect. Really seems like Calamities should have enough bang on their side to wrap this up. Maybe priestess gets resurrected somehow?
    ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  Lots of confusion at the end!
  ```

- u/TwoxMachina:
  ```
  Meh, I'm just pissed the Tyrant kill-stealed Black.

  Someone should finish him off.
  ```

  - u/JdubCT:
    ```
    Tyrant is an amazing antagonist. Mostly because he's totally fucking crazy and still fun to read. Bard, however, I could do without. Someone needs to shank her in the cosmic eyeball so she doesn't respawn.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Well he actually didn't kill white though
    ```

    - u/TwoxMachina:
      ```
      I would be less pissed if the Tyrant killed off White
      ```

      - u/Oaden:
        ```
        Maybe he recruits white to join the hierarch. They both have rather fucked perspectives on justice
        ```

- u/Yes_This_Is_God:
  ```
  Writing was off in this chapter.

  Plot progression was disappointing. Off screen death was weird.
  ```

  - u/mojojo46:
    ```
    I won't believe she's dead till we see the body *and* have the body confirmed by Black operating at peak rationality with no emotional penalties.
    ```

  - u/PrettyDecentSort:
    ```
    Tyrant and Bard are both definitely reliable narrators.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I don't think Tyrant is a reliable narrator. I think he has more insight than most characters, but I believe he has significantly less figured out than he thinks he does.  

      Additionally, Bard definitely believes she pulled it off, but she's been mistaken before. Tyrant has blindsided her at least twice in this arc (Hieroarch, and taking White).

      The door is open for unexpected shenanigans. However, I don't believe Sabah is walking away from this one.
      ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    She didn't die yet.

    >Would you like me to tell you how your friend is going to die?

    Note the future tense.
    ```

    - u/swaskowi:
      ```
      Yeah and then later Wekesa says

      >“Amadeus,” his oldest friend’s voice replied. “She’s…”


      Which implies death, or something else horrific, to me at least.


       Does anyone else remember the chapter/significance of the coin? It rang a bell but I couldn't find it.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Something to do with Judgement of the Heavens... I'll see if I can find it.

        Edit: that was easier than I thought it would be, [here](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/03/08/heroic-interlude-arraignment/):  

        > “I do not judge,” the White Knight said.  

        > The silver coin appeared in his open palm, as it always did. As a child, Hanno had seen the laws of men fail.  

        > ...  

        >  He flipped the coin, watched it spin in the air. It landed on his palm. The crossed silver swords, not the laurels. The Seraphim had rendered their judgement.
        ```

      - u/Oaden:
        ```
        Lat we saw he she was in a different domain though, and we know from the previous champion vs black encounter that Wekesa can't actually see in those.

        So, A, she's already out and dead/dying, or B, its to signify that she is out of his reach.  Moments before bard says:     “She’s not fighting Captain,” the Bard said. “She’s fighting a monster. ‘s why I picked Champion. The domain, big guy. She was bound to let out the Beast in that.” (like literally 2 lines earlier)

        So either Bard doesn't know that Captain is already dead, or cap dies in the max ten seconds that passed
        ```

- u/JdubCT:
  ```
  Whelp. We knew the Calamities couldn't be around and kicking for Catherine's story to hit full speed. Of all of them I suspect Warlock and Assassin to survive. The rest could go either way.
  ```
