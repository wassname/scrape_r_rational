## Charles Stross on consistency in world-building, and why he thinks rational fiction is better (without actually saying that)

  I'm a regular reader of his blog (and his books) and think that he expresses opinions like this pretty regularly. There was a part in *The Rhesus Chart* where the narrative turns toward the minutia of blood procurement through the NHS, and I always got the sense that Stross was one of those authors that got some visceral joy in doing that research and presenting it to the reader as a backbone of reality threaded through the fantastical -- and without those sorts of things, writing would be lifeless and dull, and maybe not worth doing.

  There are bits like this in pretty much everything that I've read by him, and I think that he short-sells it a little bit in this article by saying that it's about backbone -- but it might be that he sees some of his signature digressions as burlesque and includes them anyway. (I would probably say that kind of showy, ostentatious worldbuilding/research is catnip for /r/rational, but I'm not sure that general tastes are so aligned with my own.)

    Yep. He's my go to example of an author who has, in fact, Done The Research. I don't know if it's otherwise rational, but his worldbuilding always feels, well, tightly coupled with reality. Partially it's the fascinating and complex and relevant detail, where he's actually researched something and brought back pieces of it to intertwine with the plot.

    But it's also that, like some rational fanfic, his work often feels like a deconstruction. Because he starts with some common trope or setting and then *takes it seriously*, pulling apart the assumptions underlying the genre. 

    Like the Laundry Files. Start with Cthulu being real, but we don't see it, that implies a masquerade. Add in the national security implications of lovecraftian threats to get a government agency, and voila, super secret agents with magic! But hold on: have you *seen* the bureaucractic *nightmare* that is the British Civil Service? You think this is gonna be James Bond with added spellslinging? Haha, no, the *real* threats here (in book eight) are the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act of 2010, and the insidious threat of *private outsourcing*. 

    Or the start of the Family Trade: here, come be wisked away into a portal fantasy where you're the long-lost princess of a medieval realm! Where they have stong opinions on women's rights, because medieval realm. And trade in hard drugs, because smuggling is the easiest way to monetise an alternative reality. So it's a crime family, and you've just joined the mafia. And if your family-by-blood can go there, but most people can't, then it's probably a genetically linked trait. Right? So then *those* things combine into a brutally strict breeding program and poltitcally contentious genetics research inside that crime family... And then you know what happens to crime families that deal drugs? The DEA goes after them. And American law enforcement discovering alternate realities? Hey, it's our best friend 'national security implications'! Set just fifteen years ago in the time where America was freaking out about terrorists and starting wars... Suddenly our whimsical lost-princess isekai story is something else entirely.

    It's catnip for me at least. I love that style of writing. The thing that first *really* grabbed my attention in HPMoR, for example, was when Harry learned about an alternate currency based on gold and silver and immediately started thinking about the abitrage  opportunity. That sort of thing is excellent, and the alternative -- where you just have that currency in your setting without thinking about it, or import your worldbuilding straight from 60's sci fi -- it just isn't. It's a failure to think, putting neat narrative above how reality would actually go.

      Eh, tbh sometimes he fucks things up and then it's glaring. Singularity Sky was pretty much ruined for me when I noticed that the whole elaborate "time travel-but not really" trick a lot of the plot centered around did not make any sense whatsoever the way it was described. I can normally look past stuff like that but here it clashed with how enormously self-satisfied he apparently felt with throwing words like "space-like interval" and "causal light cone" around without properly thinking about what they mean.

        He's actually said the reason there'll never be a sequel to that story is because he messed up the dueling time travel thing so badly that the setting is unrecoverable. (And tried time travel again with Palimpsest, with much better results).

        So you're not alone in thinking that aspect of that story was a mistake.

    Very much catnip for me. He'd make a great guest for your podcast, if you could get him. The Laundry series is essentially Cthulhu, Delta Green, James Bond and BOFH fanfic anyway.

      Stross is a good author, but a very confident and judgmental person. I don't know that he'd be receptive to an invitation to what he would see as an amateur writer's podcast. I guess asking can't hurt anything except feelings.

  > You can't write a novel of contemporary life in the UK today without acknowledging that almost everybody is clutching a softly-glowing fondleslab that grants instant access to the sum total of human knowledge, provides an easy avenue for school bullies to get at their victims out-of-hours, tracks and quantifies their relationships (badly), and taunts them constantly with the prospect of the abolition of privacy in return for endless emotionally inappropriate cat videos. We're living in a world where invisible flying killer robots murder wedding parties in Kandahar, a billionaire is about to send a sports car out past Mars, and loneliness is a contagious epidemic. We live with constant low-level anxiety and trauma induced by our current media climate, tracking bizarre manufactured crises that distract and dismay us and keep us constantly emotionally off-balance. These things are the worms in the heart of the mainstream novel of the 21st century. You don't have to extract them and put them on public display, but if they aren't lurking in the implied spaces of your story your protagonists will strike a false note, alienated from the very society they are supposed to illuminate.

  I draw a major line between "hard" sci-fi and "space opera" as he calls it. 

  Star wars and most sci-fi setting dramas are the latter.  

  Hard sci-fi generally has little if any action that exists purely for dramatic.  It explores ideas, it asks 'what if' and provides thought experiments for scientific and philosophical edge cases. 

  Blindsight was a good example of this.
