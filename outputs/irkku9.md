## Thoughts on Tenet? (no spoilers/off topic)

### Post:

I watched it the other day and I absolutely loved it.  Personally I think it's Nolan at his best, and great performances all around. So I was quite surprised when I came home and looked at the mixed reviews. Though my local theater showed it with subtitles (Portuguese) so I didn't notice the main complaint which is apparently the sound mixing. 

I confess I was a bit afraid it wouldn't make much sense after watching the trailer, but it all seems to ckeck out brilliantly. 

I wonder what people here thought of it, if anyone saw it. Having more of a rational-reading background than a movie-watching background.

  I saw it in english and felt like it needed subtitles. Several characters had very thick foreign accents and when they spoke quietly against a loud soundtrack I pretty much had to *guess* what they were saying. The worst character in this regard was Pria - the actor's native language is apparently Gujerati ("the 6th most common language in India") and I missed a *lot* of her lines.

  The fact that I couldn't tell what people were saying substantially detracted from the film experience and made it much more confusing than it needed to be.

    Yeah, I would have loved to have watched it with subtitles. I really didn't understand a word of it, and apparently our theatre had turned the bass *down* from what it was meant to be. I really struggled to follow what was happening half the time. It's annoying as the concept seemed so solid. 

    (DW I live in a jurisdiction with no covid for 150 days, theatres are fine!)

  I love Nolan, and I will watch this, but not in theaters due to covid. I won't go to a theater this year and probably not all of next year either to be honest. 

  If they had released this digitally day one I would have gladly paid $30-40 to watch it online because I want to support Nolan and the industry but I guess they want to leave that money on the table while they futility try to push back the arrival of the day-one digital simultaneous release. Because theaters know once that happens it's over for probably half their business. When I have the option to just watch it at home opening night I'll almost certainly never go to a theater again except for event movies a couple of times a year, and that's independent of covid.

    I saw it in a New Jersey AMC theater and it felt pretty safe because *everybody else* is thinking like you are and not going. They've removed half the seats from the seating chart they make available and the theater is *still* mostly empty!

    So you're sharing a *huge* well-ventilated room - a room with enough air conditioning to quietly stay cool with 200 people in it - with less than a dozen other people, all of whom are wearing masks nearly all of the time and none of whom are seated directly next to you.

        You actually DO have something pretty close to a guarantee of that. If you buy your tickets same-day online you can check different times and see how full the theater is by what seats on the map are marked as unavailable. If the theater is nearly empty, buy a ticket and go; if it's half-full, hold off and try again on some other mid-afternoon mid-week seating option.

        I mean, sure, the theater COULD suddenly fill up with last-minute in-person ticket buyers...but that's not the way to bet. (Anyway, it worked for me.)

    Agreed on all points. The theater and film industry are going to have to to reinvent themselves. The price to see a movie in theaters has been inceasing while the comparitive benefits of doing so have been decreasing for a long time. Covid destroying the industries inertia is going to make the effects of those trends hit hard. 

    I don't know what they're going to do though, $30-$40 dollars for a digital viewing might not be enough for them. That's too much for me to watch it individually but probably not enough for film makers if I watch it with one other person let alone a group. Not to mention if this became common home theaters and larger home group watching would increase. I feel bad for the industry but also 100% expect them to hurt consumers when compensating.

  I think I'm one of the few people who dislike this movie. I can't wrap my mind around how reversed entities work. 

  Consider the scene where the protagonist fights his reversed doppelganger, who (for unfathomable reasons) decides to shoot at him thrice with a pistol. He steps into the room, notices the bullet holes and deduces that the gunshots take place in the future. But wait, does that mean the glass was always cracked prior to this, up to the point reversed!Protagonist unpulls the trigger? Does that mean that some years ago a construction crew built the room and installed glass panels with bullet holes already in them?

  The whole part about explosions causing hypothermia felt like an asspull. 

  Dialogue was very hard to make out.

  Another thing I didn't get was the time rush and failure condition. You have a big bad that's threatening to stash the keys to a time capsule containing a superweapon that may be used to end the world in future? Why is there a time pressure? You literally have all the time in the world to stop him because 1. You can reverse and revisit the site again at any point in it's past and 2. Even if he did succeed in burying the site/sending the signal, you have the next 200 years to find the keys at your leisure. 

  I feel like Nolan added complexity for the sake of complexity itself and to me that's never a good thing. I felt similarly disappointed at the end of Interstellar when they went on that spiel about love transcending time.

    I think the "bullet holes in the glass before the shooting" thing is probably my least favorite part of the conceit, but the explanation is not that they were manufactured that way, but that there are limits to how far back in time reversed physics actually affects things. So in the case of the window, from the perspective of someone moving forward in time, the cracks just "appear" all at once.

    Similarly, if a reversed piece of glass was hit with a normal bullet, then from the perspective of someone going back in time, the glass would suddenly "appear" to have a hole. In theory, anyway.

    Like I said, probably my least favorite part of the conceit, because it would be better if things were symmetrical, and is (IIRC, only saw it once) never addressed in the movie.
    ```

      I think it gets even crazier if you consider the inertial reference frame of "reversed" objects. 

      Imagine you shot a thug with a "reversed" bullet and it didn't penetrate all the way through... so they wake up that morning with a bullet already inside them? But after they have breakfast and realise it's their last day on the job, they still have to go to work, confront you and get shot by you, and finally that bullet gets sucked out back into a gun.

      Or maybe the bullet must remain spatially relative to the room, in which case they walk into the room that morning, see a bullet floating in mid-air, and somehow transport that bullet into themselves so it can be unfired by your weapon.
      ```

    I think it works if you want it to work. For example, for the bullets; they were made some years ago, the protagonist acquired them, they went through the 'twister' at the freeport, shot into the glass, and then they kept travelling backwards until they were melted in the forge where the glass panels were made.




    For Andrei, he would plan the room and order the panels, then the panel makers would contact him, bewildered, about the panels coming out of the forge already with bullet holes. Maybe not something he expected when making the order, but not too surprising either. It would let him know that there would be a firefight there.




    Sure, none of this is explained in the movie, but that's also part of the enjoyment right? Maybe a bit of a stretch.




    Twister is the name of the time reversing machine in my theater subtitles, I didn't catch the dialogue
    ```

    - u/fish312:
      ```
      Wait so if you shot a person with a "reversed" bullet and it didn't penetrate all the way through... they could have been... born with a bullet inside them? Lived their whole life with a bullet stuck inside their body, until it finally gets sucked out back into a gun a few decades later?

      I do enjoy a good movie even if it has a ridiculous plot so long as it's internally self consistent, which is why I find these logical incongruities rather jarring.

      As a footnote, just realized the heat-to-cold reversal of the explosion that saved the protagonist also should mean that the internal combustion engine of any car, as well as any explosive based firearm, would fail to operate the instant they were reversed.
      ```

      - u/oindividuo:
        ```
        Yeah I get it, it's mostly a matter of taste anyway.




        It makes enough sense that I can trick myself. Just don't poke around too much ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

  I only saw it once and will have to see it again to be sure (though I was paying very close attention), but it appeared to me that he actually managed to execute a single-timeline time travel plot brilliantly and without any plot holes.

  Can definitely see how the movie may be confusing to people who haven't read a lot of time travel fiction; half of my friend group had some trouble getting it .The character writing was also a bit stilted at times.

  Still, I also loved the movie. it didn't assume the watchers were idiots,it had brilliant cinematography and action and I was engaged from start to finish. Definitely recommend it to people in this sub.

  Overall, best Bond film I've ever seen.

  - u/oindividuo:
    ```
    Good, that's great to hear. I agree on the characters, but I feel like at this point the audience should be expected to watch a Nolan movie for the plot, not the characters.

    I snorted at the Bond comparison :)

  It’s a really good execution of the premise. There is a little bit of hand waving in terms of how certain things work to drive the plot, and obviously if you want to nitpick you can question the physics of it, but it’s very impressive how much Nolan trusts the audience‘s intelligence.

  If you’re seeing it in English, you should request a closed caption device or see a subtitled screening. For me the sound mix didn’t stop me understanding anything crucial, but there are definitely some loud scenes where I was straining to work out what was being said, and a couple of those are complicated enough that it did detract from the experience. I think the issue is worse in IMAX theatres with louder bass and also depends on how good you are at picking out speech from noise and understanding foreign accents; I’ve definitely heard of multiple people who couldn’t understand half the dialogue. 

  Also, don’t watch the final trailer which gives too much away IMO.

  The mixed reviews seem to be largely down to reviewers who couldn’t understand the mechanics of what was going on. Even some positive reviews say things like “don’t worry about understanding the plot, just enjoy the ride”. And audience reviews are full of angry people who just couldn’t understand what was happening (and not because of the sound mix, although I’m sure that didn’t help).

  There were a few points that I felt a teensy bit iffy about, if we're talking plot points:


  >!\-hiding a piece of technology makes much less sense than destroying it!<

  >!\-sending a piece of technology to the past is more difficult and less secure than sending it to, say, space!<

  >!\-as I understood the climax, the tech was being buried, and hence would only be recoverable by the future because they'd know where to look for it. All that the governments of our time needed to do was dig it up?!<

  >!\-They spoke often of ignorance being  a strength, but they never really went into why? Like. There was no big traitor problem, and it seems like they wanted to do something with ensuring closed time loops, but they never really went into it!<

  I've heard some knocking the characters as flat, which I wouldn't say is necessarily unfair, but on the whole I definitely enjoyed it, and I was pretty easily able to suspend my disbelief for the above list. I'd give it a strong 7/10.
  ```

  - u/oindividuo:
    ```
    The nitpicks are fair, but for me it was also easy to ignore them and forget, and just go along with the ride. I'm sure you already know this, but >!something that delves deep into ignorance in a self consistent timeline is hpmor!<
    ```

- u/Asviloka:
  ```
  Yeah, there were times I had no idea what was being said. I did wish for subtitles more than once.

  I kinda feel it executed its premise almost too well, it felt like just an action movie that happened to have time reversal in it. I know it must have been insane to shoot and make it work, but it looks so smooth it feels like it undersells itself a bit.  I gave it a solid 8, but I was hoping for more.  It's so much less twisty than I'd hoped. Maybe I just love overly-complicated time travel plots too much to appreciate something simpler.

  But then again, I keep thinking about it, and while some things were obvious even from the beginning, I wonder if I was missing something. I need to see it again.
