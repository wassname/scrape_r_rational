## Does Worth the Candle get any better?

### Post:

**Edit**: Thanks for the discussion. Lots of people who did read further seem to feel my sentiment, and lots more don't. I think I'll read another 10 or so since that seems to be a turning point. I did not intend to insult the author/the writing, rather my personal feelings of the problem.

Was told to post here. Spoilers are welcome if it helps explain.    
    
Currently around chapter ~70 and I have doubts. It seems to be well regarded and I can see it being set-up for something great but it's starting to be a slog. Here are my concerns:            
    
* I don't like the computer system. When he actively gets error messages and a character is named null pointer. It cheapens everything       
    
* The meta commentary is getting too much. It's neat that they meta talk about narratives and whatnot, but instead of feeling clever or neat now, it feels like it's trying too hard to be clever.     
     
* The romance/harem building is not for me. The main cast has 3 females who all have high loyalty and like him. The one male character is shunted to the side. The women's characterization are so cringy. Feels like some awful anime.        
      * Maniac pixie dream girl with a ~sad past~, jealous of the hot big boobed princess and new innocent girl.
      * Haughty sexy smart princess who eventually falls for him. Surprise, she's secretly jealous of pixie girl for being so carefree.
      * Naive girl with unloving father, who no one trusts...except for MC. Of course she loves him for his basic kindness 5 chapters in.
      * The one guy is never really described. All the women have their chests and features described and compared to the minutia. The explanation is he's a dwarf with a big beard so you can't see his expression. 

* The self-aware r/menwritingwomen is also terrible which luckily seems to be toned down. "The big booby princess was like my perfect dream girl. I know women don't like to be objectified but awoooga her curvy curves."                                
         
All this I can ignore, I've certainly read worse, but the payoff doesn't seem to be coming. The whole evil soul mage tutor ended in a pretty fruitless "will he betray won't he betray" and it barely advanced the plot/power level beyond basic soul magic.

  Can't comment on the computer stuff. Never paid much attention to it.

  The Meta narrative *is* the point. They're trying to find out to which degree their universe is being fucked with. I don't foresee this changing, ever.

  The romance stuff is a subversion of the usual isekai self-insert trope. The Dwarf isn't actually male, there's been reference to that already by chapter 70 IIRC, and his feelings for the main character are a pretty big (ongoing) topic.

  No the part you're at I already considered great.

  \>computer system, meta commentary

  as in the title, the whole situation is contrived and trying to extract meaning from it if any exists is the protagonists primary motivation and largely the crux of the plot

  \>characters relationships

  pretty much everything you describe undergoes a 180 degree turn around at some point but if you're going to quite you can just read the spoilers

  \>The self-aware [r/menwritingwomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/menwritingwomen/) is also terrible

  This is the only part I don't get. This is a sub largely dedicated to people who are squeamish about sex complaining about how it gets referenced in the media. Even the title gets routinely mocked since they regularly feature romance novels written by women. How this relates to WtC which treats sexuality pretty realistically with all the weird abortive awkwardness of having to navigate around a partner who has their own understanding of how these things work is beyond me.

  Unless it's just that the protagonist is straight. In which case yes the protagonist remains straight. Well mostly.

    Are you sure that's the same r/menwritingwomen? It's my impression that the sub is about overly male gaze-y portrayals of women ranging from cringe to creepy, in particular when it's supposed to be from a woman's POV. Yeah, they don't really keep to the "from a woman's POV" part very strictly, but it's definitely not just people being squeamish about sex.
    ```

    - u/i6i:
      ```
      The last time I remember seeing them on  the front page  was a post about werewolf erotica written by a woman that was supposed to be "in the spirit of the sub" now clicking there I find people arguing that male POV characters describing women doesn't count. That it does count because male characters are just the authors vehicals. It does count because of the abundance of awful misogynistic POV (misogyny defined as mention of breasts here which is wow). And finally that it would be fine except no women get the same treatment because *women absolutely never produce the same kind of observations and have sexual feelings thar are so completely different than gets posted there*. 

      Yeah self-aware r/menwritingwomen sounds like the opposit of r/menwritingwomen. Upset at weird language used to tell people a character is attractive is as coherent a theme as I can find.

  I'm just going to address the harem thing, since it's the criticism that I think best shows you might be missing the point:

  This is not a harem isekai power fantasy.

  It's a *subversion* and meta commentary on harem isekai power fantasies.

  The main character is explicitly in a world that was created to give him exactly the experience in those "awful anime," but he's *aware* of that and knows reality would not be that simple.

  Furthermore, he as a protagonist is not that simple. He's got so many issues, so much baggage and self-awareness, that he makes the standard harem isekai power fantasy protagonist look like the cartoon cutout that they often are.

  So if you're worried about it all becoming some saccharine sexy male fantasy, I can assure you nothing of the sort happens. It only looks like that's what's coming because that's how subversions work. Hunter x Hunter has a whole season of (relatively) bland and generic shonen storylines just so that when things go off the rails, it feels much more impactful.

  I can spoil things if you want more specific concerns addressed, but hopefully that helps. In general, the story may not be for you if you dislike meta-story awareness and commentary and purposeful subversion. But at the very least you should be aware that that's what it is, rather than think the author is just setting up yet another male fantasy wankfest.

    How, though? How is this story a subversion? The trope is played entirely straight for at least the first 80 chapters. 

    Possibly it's subverted later in the story, but 80 chapters is like half a million words, more than the entirety of LotR. If you use a trope straight for that long I don't think it's unfair for readers to judge you by it, regardless of what happens afterwards.

      What is his harem? He clearly only has one clear girlfriend and is pretty clearly monogamous. He explicitly does not want the "key to the 7 locks" achievemnt or quest or whatever. I haven't read a few latest episodes yet, though.

      Now if it is isekai power fantasy? Well, he does get pretty pwerful and the goal is kinda to become a god to fix everything.

        All these girls are explicitly interested in him though, and look up to him as their savior and messiah (even though he treats them like shit). They are defined in terms of their relationship with him - heck even in universe they were created for him. 

        Whether he's actually sleeping with them or not is immaterial to the trope. It's still a harem fantasy, just with a little bit of "Look at me being a gentleman by only sleeping with one of them!"-sauce on top of it.

          Importantly, they are *aware* that this is what's going on (as is he). And because they're not one-dimensional, the story is in part about how they deal with it.

          This is how it's a deconstruction of harem fantasy. 

          *Watchmen* takes complex believable characters - with their mess of feelings, ideals, past traumas, and personal failings - and shows what happens when they decide to put on a costume and go beat up hooligans. Spoiler, you don't get *Batman*. 

          *Worth the Candle* takes complex believable characters, and shows what happens when they find out that they've literally been created to be stereotypical romantic interests, for a guy with plenty of baggage of his own. Spoiler, you don't get... [*Love Hina*? I don't watch much anime, I've only seen harem played straight in fanfics/webfics.]

          You do get a whole lot of meta talk though, so if you're not into that you're gonna have a bad time.

          Yea I just checked wikipedia for the genre.

          >These protagonists usually end up with a harem accidentally, because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time due to some unforeseeable circumstance or random chance. Most protagonists don't even want the harems they start, as they mostly only have one main love interest and all other members of their harem simply fall in love with him or her because they deeply admire some part of their personality, and the protagonist can't bring themselves to tell them to leave.

          I was wrong.

          I thought it was kind of a requirement that even if MC has a main girl, he'd be more open for anything.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            I don't think you're wrong at all. The literal definition of a harem may be that the character has a bunch of men/women who are in love with them, but it's generally used to mean that there are romantic shenanigans going on between multiple of them.

            If that's not happening, it's not *really* a harem, imo. Otherwise it would be literally impossible to subvert a harem trope without just... Not including the trope.
            ```

            - u/alexanderwales:
              ```
              The traditional harem story has a lot of elements to it, not all of which need to be included, but most of which are simply outgrowths of narrative requirements and/or mercenary storytelling.

              * The harem will include a large cast of female characters who have some level of attraction (almost always some level of mutual) with the main character.
              * There are very few other male characters, though that's at least partly a result of how many characters a harem typically has and where it can devote its screentime.
              * The protagonist will fail to make a choice or escalate any of the relationships in anything but minor ways, because if he did, then the story would either be over, or become complicated in a way that runs counter to the fantasy. This tends to result in a cluster of common character traits, e.g. oblivious, naive, romantically passive, indecisive, nebbish, etc.
              * The plot will run these romances in parallel as much as possible (rather than doing them one by one in sequence).
              * There's typically a 'one true pairing' that gets the majority of the focus, and if there's a resolution at the end, then it resolves with the OTP getting together in some permanent way.
              * The work will attempt to tease as many of these relationships as possible.

              The stock harem plot is intended to appeal to as many people as possible, to sell as much merch as possible, and to continue on as long as it can before it buckles under the weight of a plot that goes nowhere. It's *sometimes* paired with some other genre, like an adventure, but it doesn't have to be, and it's pretty common for the harem elements to be stitched on.

              (There are lots of stock romance things that show up in harem stories naturally, since a harem is, at its core, just a bunch of romances that are going at the same time.)

              As to whether *Worth the Candle* is or is not a harem, or whether or to what extent it's a subversion, deconstruction, or reconstruction, I don't really care that much. If I wanted to focus exclusively on skewering the idea or picking it apart for what I thought was interesting about it, then I would probably write a completely different story than the one I wrote.
              ```

              - u/DaystarEld:
                ```
                Good summary, but I find it interesting to note how many of those popular-harem-story aspects actually are about the harem *not* forming, compared to the stories I've read where harems (male or female centered) do fully form and get explored, which means the conflicts and relationships and drama involved can be very different.

                Maybe my take on harems is skewed by this; if most people's only exposure to harem stories involves someone being indecisive or maintaining monogamy, then WtC probably looks a lot more like one to them than to me, even if it still deconstructs most of those listed aspects.

                (For those interested in reading a "fulfilled harem," the Meredith Gentry series by Laurel K. Hamilton is probably my favorite one, as it's paired with a great modern-supernatural setting involving fae court drama and occasional monster fighting. NSFW obviously)

                - u/Roxolan:
                  ```
                  Yeah. There's harem *comedy*, where the protagonist spends a lot of time saying "it's not what it looks like!" as he bounces from sultry seductresses to well-endowed clumsy girls, and everyone treats him kind of like a puppy. And then there's harem *fantasy*, where a cast of possibly-bisexual possibly-nonmonogamous (with a one-penis policy) girls, in awe of the protagonist's sheer awesomeness, learn to share him or make peace with his choice of mate. (Flip genders as appropriate.)

                  I see the later more in cheap fanfic/webfic, because those aren't shy about just giving their target audience everything they want all the time. 

                  To the extent that WtC is a harem deconstruction, it's a deconstruction of harem fantasy. (I often mentally compare it to *Fimbulwinter*, by William Brown of local *Time Braid* fame.) "A key for seven locks" is not a comedy achievement.

              Well if the character killed the girls himself one by one and the text wouldn't cover those parts and the other characters would expose that by revealing weird stuff more and more in the end?

              What if the character was asexual and aromantical and had literally no interest in the "harem"?

              What if they were just after him for something and then leave him, so they were not really love interests?

                The first and third just sound like "twist endings," and the second maaaaybe a subversion? It seems more like a comedic premise to me, not a trope being subverted. I wouldn't die on that hill though, maybe that's an acceptable example to most people, but it wouldn't really be able to address most of the tropes without an MC that faces the same sorts of challenges.
                ```

                - u/kaukamieli:

                  Not twist endings, first would be hinted, and they keep dying along the way.

                  Third doesn't also have to happen in the end. Twist, sure. But it wound give a chance to change the type of the story midway and give new goals or something.

                  Ofc would depend on the story, writer, etc , but that's my vision.

                  Edit: watched million yen women. From harem to horror pretty fast. :D Or thriller or something.

                    I mean well written twist endings have the twist hinted at. If what you actually mean is that the other characters are working toward discovering the truth, that just sounds like a crime drama/thriller, yeah :P 

                    It would be pretty neat to see harem story where all the girls suspect each other of killing one-another off but it turns out to be the guy.

      I honestly don't see anything at all that plays the trope straight, *except for* the premise that there are more than 2 girls that simultaneously like him that he finds attractive. I'm not sure how exactly anyone could subvert harem tropes if having the premise itself is enough to be considered playing it straight.

        Isn't that true of the large majority of harem stories? Or, cause this isn't an anime, let's say "love triangle+" stories. He has romantic drama with pretty much all of them, including explicitly sexual scenes, bit doesn't sleep/date rhe.m. I think "actually dates 0 to 1 members of the harem" is very standard for the genre.
        ```

        - u/erwgv3g34:
          ```
          It is pretty common for harem stories to end in monogamy, yes, but it's important to note that this usually doesn't happen until the _end_ of the story. Part of the appeal of harems is the illusion that the protagonist could get together with _any_ of the girls in the harem (even when it's pretty obvious _who_ he's going to end up with, like in _Love Hina_). That way viewers, who self-insert as the MC, can fantasize about getting together with whichever member of the harem most appeals to them. This is one of the reasons why harem protagonists are so passive and clueless about romance[1]; if they actively decided to peruse one of the girls, and she accepted, there would be no more story. Having the protagonist start dating one of the girls in a committed monogamous relationship halfway through the show would be like a fantasy novel protagonist who kills the dark lord halfway through the book. It's like, "shit, what the hell do we do now?"

          [1] Another reason is that harem anime is a deliberate inversion of the way things work in the real world. In real life, men pursue and women chose; a normal guy has to approach a lot of girls and suffer a lot of rejections to get any results, and even extremely attractive guys simply get a better reception to their advances rather than being actively approached by women. In harem stories, a bunch of extremely attractive girls are attracted to a random loser for no reason, and they romantically pursue _him_. It's like if there was a show about a recent university graduate with a BA in English from the local community college who, instead of sending out hundred of resumes and failing to get a single interview, gets competing unsolicited six-figure employment offers from NASA, Google, and Apple; pure wish-fulfillment fantasy.

  - u/Dufaer:
    ```
    I agree. There's been so many stock characters over the years that it's hard to invent someone, whom you can't pigeonhole into one such category, if you squint hard enough.

    Additionally, tropes are not bad.

    Look for example at how Sanderson brainstorms characters. He basically goes: Give me a character archetype + an unusual job that does not fit that archetype + a dark secret they have (or a similar schema) - and bam! There's your character outline. Sure, you need to embed the character into your setting, give them a distinctive voice and mannerism, etc., but the three initial variables can basically generate enough variety for a whole setting.

    As for tests, the Wikipedia page for the [Bechdel test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) lists some related tests, but they are all quite weak.
    I guess you could always try mentally switching all the character's genders and see how you feel about the story then, but that's basically checking for gender-neutrality, rather than for realistically written genders.
    ```

    - u/hyphenomicon:
      ```
      Mentally flipping characters' sex is a good idea even if it's not a perfect test, I think in many cases it should be relatively clear when something is awkward due to the test being flawed versus awkward due to sexist characterization.

      One thing I like to do is try to look at the events of the story from the perspective of the character who is NOT the same sex as the author, knowing only what they know.  What do these events look like to her? Do her actions make sense?  Is the protagonist showing her empathy?  Can you imagine anyone you know thinking like that?

      Yeah. To be clear, I am not interested in demonizing your criticism: you have a wholly legitimate right to your own views.

      My problem is that, when unacquainted with some critic's history, I have no good way to distinguish insightful from illegitimate criticism except gut checks. Unfortunately, I think there are many people who would tar good books as bad just for bizarre ideological reasons, which taints my impression of such criticisms as a class. I would like to get beyond that.

      Taking inspiration from your comment, I suppose one thing that is helpful is moving beyond "X is sexist" and into discussions of the consequences of that supposed sexism, "judging by the fruits". Then I can assess whether some choice of the author is sexist by observing whether it impoverishes a story or not, relative to some posited non-sexist counterfactual. If it does not, that is an argument against its being sexist. If a choice actively enhances a story, that is a very strong argument against its being sexist. These are indirect tests, and would be easy to mock, but I think still very good ones.

      This risks collapsing into my personal preferences vindicating themselves, but I think that's a much better risk to court than the risk of being talked into disliking things I'd otherwise enjoy, provided I earnestly try to see the world from others' view.

      Getting back to this topic, then, I wonder what you think a less superficial version of each or any of these women might look like. 

      My perspective is that Amaryllis is intentionally supposed to be creepily well-suited for Juniper in many ways, but she shows depth through her nearly autistic ruthlessness. I agree Fenn is a somewhat boring character, but I think she's a necessary archetype - she is important via her effects on others in the group, and for her flavor, and I don't think it's at all wrong or bad for authors to extract utility from their creations in that way. And I think Valencia could stand to be made a little darker and less innocent, overtly (there are some hints she is terrifying, later in the story, but they are not as drawn out as I'd like). But I wouldn't really chalk these down to sexism, I suppose because I strongly enjoy the story and description of these characters overall. 

      I guess another point, generally, is that we should try to weigh good against bad in our assessment of different characters' quality.

      The main draw of the story, for me, is a combination of the meta-commentary and the RPG "build" elements, many of which are somewhat standard "Gamer" story tropes but especially well-executed. I almost see the character interactions as an extension of both these draws, which might be part of why we have such different impressions of the work. Have you played any RPG video games with party interaction systems, like Mass Effect or similar?

      Additionally, the work is unfinished, and it's not clear to me how these might change as it goes forward. I have trust in AlexanderWales as an author, which might be playing a role here - my expectation is that at least some of the issues I have with characters in the story are there so that they can experience character development.

      You've been a helpful sounding board for me, thanks for provoking these thoughts.

        By the in-progress mark, I think it's clear that she just has a boring *facade*, whose overuse (with Juniper enabling her) is not healthy. She's as complex a person as the other characters underneath.

      FWIW, I read and enjoy the story and am up to current.  Very little further development has been given to most female characters beyond the archetypical role.  it is decidedly NOT an anime harem, and there are actually some really insightful developments in a few the relationships that deal with heavy topics well.  But the characters aren't that deep...Amaryllis is still brilliant beautiful chaste closed off emotional lady, Fenn remains the spunky sexy rogue, Val is the weird doting but manipulative babygirl sub, and other characters introduced are just as one-note.   The story is basically a series of "encounters" or battles, with NPC dialogue in between where you check in on each character to see they haven't really changed much.  It's kinda like playing something like mass effect.

    That's *a* major point, but I definitely wouldn't call it "the entire point", what with the combination of the story's focus on the main character's development, and the author's own statements about how personal it is to him and how it's a self-insert fic. I am equally uncaring about isekai as a genre, but IMO the story is really a recounting of the sort of issues the author had to work through, many of which resonate with me.
    ```

    - u/steelong:
      ```
      I see.  I didn't realize the main character's personal issues were such an important point for the author.  I think it's because those issues really don't resonate with me at all, so my mind just kind of glossed over them.  If anything, it made me dislike the main character a little bit.

      On the other hand, hardly any of the problems faced by characters in Ward and Worm are relatable to me, but I cared a lot more about what happened to them, and never developed that same dislike for them.  So maybe there's a difference in writing style that caused me to kind of check out of Worth the Candle.

Even at a young age I was the kind of person who got things out in the open and avoided letting drama fester behind the scenes.

          Even that wouldn't have been much of a problem, except the story just kept coming up with reasons to have June flash-back or inner monologue (or even outer monologue) about his feelings about this one particular bit of highschool drama-turned-tragedy.  In Worm, the progress of events causes Taylor to realize how petty her earlier troubles were while still being affected by them.  For all June's progress, the story itself seemed to wallow in those problems.

          >!The straw that broke the camel's back was when they went into that big hole that had the haunted mansion in it and it just tied back into all of that drama all over again after a long stretch of not bringing it up that much.  I just kind of noped out after that.!<

  Null Pointer is the peak amount of computery stuff in the story, but it sticks around.

  The meta commentary increases. Later on, other characters will buy into the idea that they're living in a narrative so much that the main character gets sick of it.

  The harem thing continues, but is increasingly played for subversion or horror. There's definitely a payoff here. The main character is a bad boyfriend and it has consequences. "Naive girl" falls for everyone who shows her basic kindness, and ends up with a steady boyfriend outside of the group. In the most recent chapters, something goes very, very wrong harem-wise.

  There's a few different angles here; but I think that there is an underlying ur-criticism.   


  Based on the direction of your specific criticisms, some word choice, and the content of some of your replies on this subject, I suspect that you are reading this through a particular ideological viewpoint which is tainting your experience.   


  \>  All this I can ignore, I've certainly read worse, but the payoff doesn't seem to be coming. The whole evil soul mage tutor ended in a pretty fruitless "will he betray won't he betray" and it barely advanced the plot/power level beyond basic soul magic. 

  \>  The meta commentary is getting too much. It's neat that they meta talk about narratives and whatnot, but instead of feeling clever or neat now, it feels like it's trying too hard to be clever.   
  I suspect that you got here via litrpg, not via rational fiction lines. The payoff the intended audience is looking for is possibly not the same one you are looking for.   


  The expected payoff here is a setting up a story in a genre which is typically filled with specific and counterfactual tropes, and then having a rational actor interact with that environment in such a way which \*actually makes sense\* given the facts and situations in evidence. The payoff is not 'Protagonist becomes overpowered in game' (though this does happen later on).   


  The meta commentary \*is\* the payoff. If this isn't your thing, then it probably doesn't 'get better' from your perspective, because this element only becomes more pronounced as the story progresses. It \*is\* the story.  


  Take note of the fact that the protaganist is a D&D DM, not a MMO powergamer - this is emblematic of the differences in approach compared to more typical litrpg.  


  \>  I don't like the computer system. When he actively gets error messages and a character is named null pointer. It cheapens everything   


  You either get this kind of humor or you don't, some of it is pretty 'in-joke'.  


  Ok, about the harem thing. Based on the direction of your specific criticisms, some word choice, and the content of some of your replies on this subject, I suspect that you are reading this through a particular ideological viewpoint which is tainting your experience. That said, a few points;  


  \>  The one male character is shunted to the side.   
  There are no male characters who are recognized as 'companions' by the game layer. Grak is not male. He may signal male, but the fact that he is not male is relevant.   


  \>  The women's characterization are so cringy. Feels like some awful anime. ...  


  \>  The self-aware 📷[r/menwritingwomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/menwritingwomen/) is also terrible which luckily seems to be toned down. "The big booby princess was like my perfect dream girl. I know women don't like to be objectified but awoooga her curvy curves."   


  I'll be honest, this is difficult to respond to, because there is a personal taste aspect here... but I hard disagree with your overall point, to such an extent that I do not understand how you can draw these conclusions having actually read the story. A few ideas to consider;  


  * the protagonist is an unreliable narrator, who is 17-18. Typically unreasonably precocious and analytical as most rational stories tend to be, but at least this author makes some attempt at the intrinsic bias associated with the history of the protagonist and the follow-on effects of how that should influence story viewpoint.
  * the 'romance plot' of the 'haughty sexy princess' is literally centered on her asexuality and the existential horror of being manufactured to be a love interest in a story. I suspect that they will eventually 'end up together', but it will be as a conclusion or extension for that plot line toward the end of the work, not as the 'first brick' in a harem.
  * the 'manic pixie dream girl' trope is all but explicitly called out later on, just like every other genre trope that has been introduced.
  * the 'new innocent girl' is a slow-burn character, don't jump to conclusions here.
  * there is no harem here. there is no sign of a harem here. there is a setup for a harem that is heavily lampshaded, but the entire point of that setup is for the protaganist to reject it, not to be worn down until they accept it.

      A Practical Guide is really good, but it has a lot more less good (tho still very hq compared to other fiction) chapters/arcs.

Also really really good of course, maybe the best Time Loop story, but it's a lot more straightforward and compared to WotC it's nearly one-dimensional (of course, that comparison wouldnt be fair - they are doing different things).

      Ward - I don't know. Worm is my favourite longform story, yet I gave up on Ward after trying multiple times. I don't even want to talk about why it's disappointing for me as a Worm fan.

        About Guide, at the start I would agree, first book I wold say on average below WtC level. But it is consistently getting better. At books 4 and 5 I would personally put it as best active work.

        Of course those are preferences, there isn't really a point discussing if Guide or WtC is 'objectively' better.

  It doesn't come up much, but it's _blatantly obvious_ that Juniper is in a computer simulation. _How_ and _why_ are the big mysteries of _Worth the Candle_, along with what the hell happened to Arthur. If that bothers you because "it's not real", well, maybe read Eliezer Yudkowsky's [sequence on reductionism](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Reductionism_(sequence\))? Whatever _is_, is real.

  >The meta commentary is getting too much. It's neat that they meta talk about narratives and whatnot, but instead of feeling clever or neat now, it feels like it's trying too hard to be clever.

  I agree that the narrative stuff gets to be too much at some point, but thankfully it gets dialed down in recent chapters.

  >The romance/harem building is not for me. The main cast has 3 females who all have high loyalty and like him. The one male character is shunted to the side. The women's characterization are so cringy. Feels like some awful anime.

  >* Maniac pixie dream girl with a ~sad past~, jealous of the hot big boobed princess and new innocent girl.
  >* Haughty sexy smart princess who eventually falls for him. Surprise, she's secretly jealous of pixie girl for being so carefree.
  >* Naive girl with unloving father, who no one trusts...except for MC. Of course she loves him for his basic kindness 5 chapters in.
  >* The one guy is never really described. All the women have their chests and features described and compared to the minutia. The explanation is he's a dwarf with a big beard so you can't see his expression.

  _Worth the Candle_ is a deconstruction of the Isekai LitRPG anime/manga/light novel genre, and one of the tropes it deconstructs is the harem trope. But you can't deconstruct the harem trope without a harem. This is hard to explain because you haven't gotten to it yet, but Juniper has a talk with someone in chapter 79 that elaborates on why things are the way they are. In fact, I recommend you keep reading until at least that point, because chapter 79 is a wham chapter that completely recontextualizes the story, and you are so close.

  >The self-aware r/menwritingwomen is also terrible which luckily seems to be toned down. "The big booby princess was like my perfect dream girl. I know women don't like to be objectified but awoooga her curvy curves."

  This is a first-person POV narrative, and Juniper is a straight teenage male with a healthy sex drive. He is going to _notice_ when women are young and beautiful and have big tits, the same way a woman in a romance novel _notices_ that a guy is tall and muscular and has a big bank account. It would be _unrealistic_ if he didn't mention it; it would make me wonder if he was gay or suffering from low testosterone.

- u/Memes_Of_Production:

  Im actually gonna call out people (yes, this includes you Author-of-the-story!) who describe Worth The Candle's harem elements as a "subversion" - it really isnt. The word subversion is very loosely defined so under some definitions I am sure it is, but the main protagonist totally does have a harem, he is dating one of them and has complicated sexual  \~stuff\~ with others (to avoid spoilers). The harem is not subverted - its just a much more complex story with real consequences instead of fluffy anime stuff, and lots of meta elements.

  However, if you absolutely hate harem stories and dating stories more widely? Then you arent going to like those parts of the story - the appeal is that some people actually do like those things, and there is a market out there for stories like that involving real people. I think the same applies to the meta elements - lots of stories just have a few meta moments, this story is Full Meta and commits to those.

  As such, I would say you wont like this story, and should maybe drop it. Though I agree with some others that the Fallather arc was one of the low points, and your complaint about the male characters not getting enough screen time will be fixed going forward - Grak in particular will get a ton more screen time and be the third-most-fleshed out character by pretty much any metric. If you think that is enough for you to keep going, then do, but "meta-harem-worldbuilding" will continue to be core to the story.

There are definitely people who apply any or all of those labels, in whole or in part, to various parts of the story, but it's something that I make efforts to shy away from.

    ```

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:
      ```
      I def don't want to go full definitional debate, but in the end what is the "played straight" of a genre? Media actually have a ton of diversity on how they approach things - outside of "there is a cast of characters into the main character" harem/romance stories go all over. Even in the anime world, they go from typical (Urusei Yatsura) to weird sci fi (Haruhi Suzumiya) to completely batshit (School Days). I dont think the idea of this "core" story is as mythical as it is real. (Individual tropes, as opposed to genres, as more standardized and therefore easier to subvert)

      I also think the word "harem" might be doing some damage here - its an anime term, but Worth the Candle is a western fantasy, an isekai, and, well, a book! It might also make the "harem" label seem like an insult, when it is not at all. Just to say that a big part of the story is dealing with romantic relationship drama from multiple participants. Tons of YA books are also "harem" stories, aka love triangle stories, we just use different terms. Of course WtC is not Urusei Yatsura, but I dont think anyone here was claiming that.

Amaryllis is ace and not interested, at least till the later parts of the story. They all have complicated relationships because it's a well written story, but I would say it's about as far from a harem as is reasonably possible given that the DM literally dumps him into a harem story.!<
    ```

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:
      ```
      This takes the presumption though that harem stories are...definitionally bad? I dont think the term should be used at all if that is the case! WtC is an adult story, so the harem aspects have full adult aspects, and I mean it isnt animated slice of life cartoon so yeah it doesnt work like Tenchi Muyo!

      I will note that your list here is "the characters however don't hook up with the main character", but...thats a definitional trope of a harem show! The main character does not get into a relationship with the harem is a pretty core premise. And in normal shows (As opposed to porn) its normally for character reasons.

      As I said in another comment, harem is a term we were porting over from anime, but of course WtC is not a slice of life, status quo is god animated comedy, so it doesnt look like those. The OP referred to the harem-style elements so its the word were used, but really its just a term for the generic idea of love triangles, romance plots, etc. Maybe we can just use those terms instead, I dont think harem adds much even if it is "technically" correct.
      ```

      - u/Watchful1:
        ```
        But it's not that the characters don't hook up with the protagonist, it's that the protagonist doesn't want to hook up. The whole point of the trope is that it's a fantasy of having multiple relationships at the same time. I would say that a love triangle or regular romance plots don't match at all, since those are, usually, centered in a conflict of someone having to choose between different relationships.

        Which is, indeed, what's happening in WtC. Even back when Fenn was around, Juniper explicitly chooses Fenn over pursuing Amaryllis. That doesn't fit a harem trope at all.

        The DM definitely intended it to be a harem, and I have no doubt that if Juniper had decided to pursue that it would have worked out for him. But him choosing not to do so is exactly what makes it subverting.
        ```

        - u/Memes_Of_Production:
          ```
          "Doesn't want to hook up" also descibes large numbers of actual-harem shows, if that whats we want to go by though. Just to take a few:

          Urusei Yatsura - Ataru is uninterested in Lum and bored of his dating-at-the-start girlfriend, preferring to be single, rarely expresses interest.

          Sword Art Online (the grandaddy of Isekai Harem) - Kiroto meets and dates his canon girlfriend, then proceeds to meet and reject a litany of female characters so much so that they are known by fans as the "spurned women's club".

          Ouran Highschool Club - To flip genders, Haruhi dates Tamaki but only ever has flirtatious or tension-filled moments with the others, never actual other relationships.

          I could obviously keep going, but I made sure to name the super-famous ones here, shows that define a genre. Sure there are harem shows where the main character does sleep with everyone, its just not at all a standard trope in the genre. 

          I will bet that when all is said and done, Juniper will have engaged in sexual relationships with more of his "harem" than the median harem protagonist. 

          I do prefer to use love triangle etc not because WtC doesnt have these "harem" elements, but because the word "harem" is a poisoned well to mean "raunchy animated comedy", which WtC obviously isnt. The OP used the word harem, and there is an aspect of harem/love triangle media in WtC that is part of its appeal, and which it plays straight. But of course it is not Ranma 1/2.

            I think the Spurned Women's Club classification actually should be its own genre rather than lumped in with Harem, personally. It's a MUCH more common trope, there's a lot of genre fiction where a male protagonist who's just SO handsome and strong and virtuous that women keep falling for him, but he has his one true love and they're left to pine.

            Lumping that in with Harem is to me just further diluting the trope/genre to the point of near meaninglessness.

              I think thats just pretty inherent with genre tags though - and its contextual here. We are using harem in reference to Worth the Candle - which only has harem elements, but is primarily an isekai story. So its logical to compare it to the big isekai stories out there that have harem elements, as opposed to a straight romantic comedy. To talk about an isekai story subverting anything without being able to mention SAO would I think be a hard sell - and there are in fact unique tropes to the "isekai power protagonist's harem" that other shows wont have.

              (but I am team "the harem genre tag is not helpful, we are only using it cause OP used it", for what thats worth)

                True. Now that I think of it longer, it's really just a common subtrope of a Mary Sue in most cases.

          In a lot of cases in harem anime the MC's participation is either accidental or semi unwilling. This helps to maintain a relatable "I never thought this would happen to me" factor. The MC is varying degrees of attracted to, indifferent to, terrified by, and affectionate towards members in his harem, but they are all attracted to him. Negima! Is a big example of this but it's pretty common. Even in Love Hina he's just trying to find somewhere affordable to live.

          Edit: In the older fate stay/night anime he's not even socially aware enough to notice that they like him, and is oblivious when they get jealous and fight over him.

      You’re using the literal definition of harem instead of the colloquial one everyone else uses. Explicit, canonical romance between multiple party members is not required, only the potential. The reader is expected to be able to self-insert and fantasize about any particular member of the harem, regardless of what would actually be a good relationship.
      ```

      - u/Watchful1:

        Sure, but isn't the point that it's something the protagonist wants? At this point he pretty clearly doesn't want to be in a romantic relationship with anyone other than Amaryllis. And even though throughout the story potential relationships are thrust in his face all the time, he rejects them.

        I'm not denying that the DM created it as a harem trope, it's just that, yeah, Juniper is subverting it.

          Joon being in a relationship with only one of several possible options is perfectly within normal standards of a harem story. It’s not subversive at all. Only recently has the story done anything that “subverts” the traditional harem setup. For the vast majority of its text, WtC has always been a harem story since Val joined.

            This just sounds like how real life works for a lot of rich/attractive men and women. There's a bunch of people they could probably be with, and they choose one. I think that's too broad a definition of "harem story" to be useful.

          A lot of times the side relationships in a harem are there to create awkward drama for the MC and the OTP. E.g. His crush catches him in a compromising position with one of the side girls that he doesn't actually like. Now he has to ensure his crush that she's his one and only, but he's softhearted and doesn't want to hurt the other girl's feelings either, so he won't be direct.

          This has the added meta benefit of creating a "moment" for fans of the side girl.

  The entire point is the meta narrative. He's thrown into a world with specific tropes, but he's aware of them and tries to work around it. Everyone definitely diverges more from their roles as the story goes on.

    Haven't read Worth the Candle yet but mean to get to it soon, it comes up on this subreddit a lot. Is this handled sort of similarly to Practical Guide to Evil, it has some similar themes.
    ```

    - u/derefr:
      ```
      In PGtE, narrative is basically its own magic system—something hardwired into the setting, existing "above" or "outside" the Gods. The Gods *grant* people Names or Roles, but then they just *have* them, no takesy-backsies, and can do whatever they like with them. (Some people lose a Name or Role, but for reasons to do with no longer fitting the criteria that the Name itself checks and enforces, rather than by divine fiat.) I.e. "If you adopt a puppy, it's yours, and the pound can't take it back. But it *could* run away."

      In WtC, meanwhile, "narrative" is just a sort of [teleology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) the characters are modelling—a way to analyze effects in the world through the lens of the motivations of God. They assume (not without reason) that there exists a God that steers+nudges the world around them in the way that a DM steers+nudges a D&D campaign, with the goal of creating a compelling narrative for some hypothetical external audience. Mentions of "narrative" are just shorthand for referring to God fucking with them due to this drive it has; sort of like mentions of "capitalism" might be shorthand for referring to corporations fucking with you due to greed. This kind of "Narrative" has no mechanical existence; it's not a set of physical in-setting laws to deduce or predict. It's just a part of the psychology of a very powerful person the protagonists—and everyone else in the setting—are under the thumb of.

      Practical Guide to Evil has heavy meta themes, but it's as a part of the world everyone is living in, it's just something that's accepted and part of it. Worth the Candle is, and this comes up fairly early so it's not a big spoiler, a world where the protagonist designed the world, and then was dumped into it. It's like a dungeons and dragons adventure where the DM is dumped into the game. So he knows all the tropes and world building stuff and isn't really big into following along with it, but it's still forced on him anyway.

      I didn't like Practical Guide, specifically because the meta narrative stuff is just part of the world and you have to live with it. Oh, these two characters have already had two fights, so the third one is just going to go this way because that's how the narrative works. Worth the Candle is more, and this is the point in the story where the dwarf joins the party and dwarves come from reclusive underground societies. And then it spends the rest his plot totally taking that narrative apart because the protagonist realizes it and doesn't play along.

      I share OP's opinion about the soul mage plotline. It seemed a bit too obvious and there was no big payoff at the end of it. But it's still fairly well done and most of the rest of the story doesn't have that problem.

        Well, yes and no. It spends a long time setting that up as the default, so that it can play around with the idea later. It gets a lot more interesting than "you can't fight only twice".

  I like it very much, I guess it's not for you? It's mostly interesting to me because of worldbuilding. I already stole a lot of it for my d&d  campaign and it works great, clearly a lot of experience with "worldbuilding for drama" went into it and I love that. I would never think to include SCP memetics in D&D and I got inspired and did and it was great. The whole conception of souls as fossil fuel and afterlife as a curse is also very inspiring.

  The payoff I expect is explanation of the whole deal with Arthur and Junpier, the world and why they ended up there.

  As for women and relationships - they aren't the focus for me, and they are certainly written better than in 90% of isekai stories anyway.

  "Does WoT change in later chapters?"  


  FTFY.

  Seriously, keep it positive. You don't like it, that's fine, and try to do constructive criticism. If that's something you struggle with, use "I" statements: "it cheapens it for me", "I feel like it's trying too hard to be clever". That won't necessarily lead to constructive criticism, but I certainly feel like it helps me out when I'm trying to, myself.  


  As to your specific points -   
  \- Seems pretty clear to me that the "computery" stuff is just a... description layer? on top of something that's more real. No-one else gets the LitRPG perks, although they might be able to pull off similar effects. "Null pointer" actually means something, I'm pretty sure, although it's still just my own guesswork.  
  \-  I agree that the meta-narrative analysis getting to be a bit much, but I don't get the "too clever". For me it's the usual "too much" when it just makes sense to plan the shit out of everything, which means you get bogged down in planning for tiny spurts of violence. Consequence of people at national power levels doing things intelligently, AFAICT.  
  \- I think you're really missing the deep, weird nuance to the "harem", particularly how each character is both their own person, \_and\_ an emotional foil for something in particularly about Juniper, \_and\_ the existential and moral questioning that comes from that duality.   


  I don't think you'll like how it progresses (with a couple of exceptions) as it just gets deeper into the stuff that you're not liking.... but I'm also not hearing you actually tuning into the aspects that I find amazing about those elements. I do agree with you about wondering if the payoff is coming; the story is dealing with some heavy and painful stuff - I mean, the plot practically starts with Arthur's death - and it'll pay off if June "gets better", and that translates to "everyone else gets better". We're seeing that, it's just slow - Grak's story as it goes is a really good example, although it's not really done.

  I think I got to the latest update a few months ago but I never bothered going back to see if there are more chapters.

  Frankly, it was getting really boring.  There's a bit of action, and then chapters and chapters of discussion of what happened, what he wants to do and what he should do, and he doesn't actually do it.  Didn't go do some quest, then chapters about he how regrets not going to do that when he received the quest.

  Plot is not becoming any faster later. It's going more into direction of moral didactic. If you don't like it to chapter 70 chances you will like it even less later.

  I agree in a general way. WtC is at its best when it’s exploring tabletop RPG tropes instead of reconstructing isekai, but the latter isn’t all that great even though it’s better than ever.
