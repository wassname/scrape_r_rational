## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  >Morally, it really comes down to a choice of which kind of hammer hurts wronged innocent powerless people the least. (Which can often mean offering no hammer that can truly be used to "deal with" obviously-evil people.)

  Which is why I'm so nervous about people attacking free speech lately.

    Also worth noting that the people who are "obviously-evil" to you aren't necessarily actually obviously-evil - and, indeed, when the powerful are using all available hammers to attack the powerless, they often think they're attacking something obviously-evil.

    Can you give an example of this?  Because I'm having a hard time thinking of any examples that fit into this more than they do into the second one.  If both people are speaking then can't any observers listen to whoever they want to?  Unless you mean two people literally speaking at the same time and one of them is literally shouting too loudly.

      Not sure this was the intended reading, but the first thing that came to mind was online personalities rallying their base for one reason or another. Popularity is power, and if you're sufficiently popular you can send thousands of people to flood every channel of communication with smears, misrepresentations, and various darks arts of discourse. (A perfect outside observer *could* look at the evidence and make their own determination, but outside observers are generally imperfect and subject to be swayed by the dark arts.)

      Edit: Coincidentally, I happened to come across [this paper](https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/guides/obscenity-indecency-profanity-faq) half an hour later on the Russian "Firehose of Falsehood" method of propoganda.

      Not sure if this was the intended reading, but money in politics and large budgets spent on marketing materials. 

      Remember when you were just supposed to not use your real name/identity online? Well a lot of money was spent on getting rid of that idea, and there wasn't really an organized counter-shouting.

      Students at the university of toronto has shouted down several people speaking about men's rights issues, and while I haven't looked into it in depth what I've seen hasn't suggested that the speakers were misogynists.

      Those are three different types of power, and three different times something like that has happened. Of course all of those were coupled with some form of institutional power...

    * another problem with restricting free speech is that in a restricted environment people fail to develop resistance to propaganda. So any propaganda that manages to leak through (esp. unnoticed) will have more devastating effects on the community.

     * a government restricting free speech is a government confessing in three things, IMO: in its impotency in certain regards, in its laziness, and in its desire to abuse the above-mentioned vulnerability on its own.

    * \>If you let people speak freely, the powerful will shout down the powerless. — this can at least partially be solved by designing a platform that makes shouting someone down harder. Reddit’s hierarchial tree structure was an improvement over bulletin boards, but the next big thing has been failing to show itself for quite a while by now. Google wave \ Discord are a thing, but they’d fail to work as a large open forum solution.

    * \>the evil people will use their social power to paint nice people as evil — or as trolls, which is why I think it shouldn’t matter whether or not your opponent is actually trying to troll anyone. What should matter instead is whether their comment is worthy of attention and answering.

  This started out as one thing then turned into another, then another, but I decided to post it anyway because it feels like it's something I should be proud to say even if I'm not totally sure what it is or whether it means anything because it really does describe what I'm thinking right now.

  I wonder if we need a better way to describe the mindset of a rationalist character than munchkinry. I've come to think that the defining characteristic of a munchkin character isn't creative use of mechanics or outsmarting opponents, but an explicit desire to break the game they're in and take control of the plot for themselves. 

  I've heard two schools of thought in RPGs about what to do about munchkins since they stop anyone else from having fun how they want to. One says that the GM needs to be smart enough to keep the munchkin under control and ensure the rules can't be exploited. The other says the munchkin shouldn't be allowed to play the game in the first place since they violate the social contract between players.

  For a while I subscribed to the former, but now I think the latter makes more sense since the entire point of the game is to have fun within the shared rule set. Should the same idea be applied to rational fiction? Do rationalists always need to try and break the story they're in rather than just come up with smart plans and deductions?

  I might have a different perspective on this than most rationalists since I'm technically still religious. I can see how those that aren't would view the GM of reality as someone who forced them into a game they didn't want to play and seek to knock the board over, but I'm kind of okay with the existence of death even if I don't see it as *good*.

  I'm still in favor of transhumanism and reducing human suffering however we can, but I still instinctively flinch at the idea that death should be eliminated. I don't like it that people die and want everyone to live longer and better, but I've accepted death as an inherent part of life and see attempts to outright destroy death instead of merely fighting against it as hubristic.

  The RPG analogy is getting away from me, but I guess I just don't like stories with munchkins very much. I don't really want to read stories about people trying to become God as if it's a completely sane and logical thing for anyone to do. It's not really something I relate to or feel satisfaction from seeing.

  I still love HPMOR and other stories about intelligent characters with big ambitions, but they're not what I want to read these days. Recently, the stories that I liked most were about people achieving limited personal success in a conflict that effected their life more than others. Not all of them were mundane, but even when magic or superpowers were involved I liked when they didn't effect the world around the protagonist very much.

  When I was a teenager the idea of munchkinry made me feel empowered to break out of the bad situations I was stuck in, but now that I'm about to graduate from college I just want to be happy in my little corner of the world. I still care about people and try to help when I can, but whereas I once rejected the idea of contentment I now aspire to it.

  I once felt like I could do anything and needed that at the time, maybe I still need it, but these days it seems more like a pipe dream I grew out of. Rationality has become a rote part of my way of thinking and it's helped me immensely, but awareness of biases and inefficiencies hasn't necessarily made them easier to eliminate as of late.

  It could be that I came down with depression over the past year and a half so I've made it my goal to simply survive rather than thrive, but I don't think that's where this is all coming from. I've been feeling really good lately and still feel good now. Things could be going better and part of me says I should be working harder and smarter, but it feels okay even if I don't.

  I guess that's the reason I wanted to write all of this. I may be a Ravenclaw, but my recent melancholy makes me think I can learn from Hufflepuff. This is one of the few communities I identify as a member of, so I want to just be friends with you guys and read entertaining stories. I don't really care about the rational part that much anymore. I wonder if should even still be here.

    There are different levels of munchkinry in tabletop games which I think should be treated differently. There's **Rules-As-Written munchkinry** that makes no sense within the context of the simulation, like trying to hide behind a tower shield and claiming that the tower shield is hidden as well because on page whatever of the Player's Handbook blah blah blah. That's stupid, it makes no sense, and doesn't actually work within the world ... yet some people will insist on it, even in the face of the DM flatly saying no, and those people can get the fuck out.

    Then there's **Rules-As-Intended muchkinry**, where you aren't actually breaking the simulation by descending into rulebook legalese, but *are* ending up with ridiculous stuff like throwing boulders made of titanium for 14425d6 damage, probably through some combination of things that were never balanced against each other (because the two or three relevant books were written several years apart). This is slightly less annoying, but depending on how good the combination or exploit is it might be the case that the GM *can't* fix it short of just saying "you can't do that" which (in my experience) can create an unhealthy metagame of munchkins seeing what they can get away with. It comes from a better place though - not wanting to break the system, necessarily, but wanting to have a good, competently built character. The only problem is that if one player is taking it to extremes, the others probably should be too, and there are some extremes which are allowed by certain combinations of rules but which make the game unplayable.

    (I feel the same way about videogame speedruns, actually. Speedruns that abuse glitching through walls and skipping cutscenes by exiting to the main menu just don't do anything for me, because they aren't seeking the thing I actually watch speedruns for, which is mastery of the game. It might just be a difference in what I define as "the game".)

    As it relates to prose fiction, I think that munchkinry stories which completely contradict the world created by the original work/system don't tend to hold that much interest to me, mostly because they break the shared suspension of disbelief that I come to prose for in the first place. It's worse when no one else within the world is aware of these things that can be munchkined, since that break SOD even more. And of course it's a real challenge to include munchkinry while also keeping character in focus, and most authors aren't up to the task. Typically it just reads as a character set up for perfect success and an author trying to show how smart he is.

    For rational fanfiction, I think there's a justification/exploitation axis. If you read a work of fiction and there's something that doesn't make that much sense, do you assume it's a crack to work your fingers in, or do you think about how to fix that crack? I think of myself as falling more on the justification side of things, which is why I tend to like reading those more. I still *like* clever exploits, but they have to take place within the framework of the world and make sense as novel creations, rather than hinging on something the original creator/author forgot or glossed over, if that makes sense. Part of that is definitely a desire to be enraptured in the world rather than thrust outside it.

      It was an iridium boulder, for 262,000,000d6 damage.

      As for in-game munchkinry, there's an even better level, I believe.  When I come up with a clever but absurd exploit, I just *tell my group*.  We share a laugh, I get my ego boost, and the game continues on as normal.  When I find an overpowered by justifiable exploit, I keep it in reserve for a desperate moment, and then retire the tactic as part of a gentleman's agreement with the GM.

      I totally agree with you, so I feel really guilty for thinking *A Bluer Shade of White* is an example of munchkinry I don't like. It's not a bad story, I enjoyed it overall and really liked your take on Elsa, it's just that Olaf becoming a Seed AI wasn't something I wanted to read about in a Frozen story.

      I get what you were doing with the idea that Elsa had incredibly versatile powers with no known limit, but it still didn't feel satisfying to read. Then again, I felt basically the same way about *The Rules of Wishing* so what do I know? Maybe it's just the difference in themes from the source material.

      EDIT: Thinking back, I actually did like nearly all of the clever exploits characters came up with in both stories. It was the plot points that followed those exploits that I didn't enjoy very much. The way munchkins unexpectedly alter the story must be the problem I have rather than the munchkinry itself.

      one of the things I find difficult is knowing how deeply I have to justify the rules of the fictional world. So like, here's some things that happen. Why? Because these things happen. Why do those things happen? With fictional worlds it sometimes feels like there has to be some inconsistency in the rules otherwise you can't *really* justify them. Like, the reader is on the explain/worship/ignore decision tree/web and they get locked out of the explain option much too soon while they still have questions. And when they try to give what would normally be the obvious answers to those questions the entire fictional world falls apart.

      Maybe part of the reason for that is that I just don't know enough about the rules of the universe we actually live in, but somehow I just get the impression that if I try to put some weird fantasy element into a story I won't be able to write it in a way that doesn't seriously break the suspension of disbelief of every intelligent physicist who might stumble across it. I mean, the first setting I seriously tried to work with in rational fiction was yugioh or something like it, and no matter what I did I could not get the yugioh universe to work in a way that made any sense at all. Some people said that rational fic doesn't require the setting to be self-consistent, just predictable in its behavior, except that a smart protagonist would still want to know why and the universe would yield no actual answers, just a jumbled mess. And only in regards to a particular aspect of reality, which happens to be a trading card game. And I cannot for the life of me figure out how to answer the question of why a magic-ritual game that simulates actual combat between summoners have such a special place in the laws of reality, nor why the universe won't answer that question no matter what experiments you try. There has to be an answer and there is no answer that I can think of and that seems like it would be REALLY relevant to the plot of a rational yugioh fic and a rational yugioh protagonist would WANT TO KNOW THAT.

      Maybe I should have gone with a different setting than yugioh for my first rat!fic?

        > There has to be an answer and there is no answer that I can think of

        In cases like that I usually go with a higher-dimension entity that is acting as an arbiter for enforcing that specific whimsical set of rules. 

        For instance: sometime in the past the population of the Earth has decided to wage wars non-violently, and ended up choosing the card game’s simulation as the setting. Optionally, the participants also have their memories altered before entering the arena with a new personality.

        Or: [A powerful entity](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfVillainThreat) decided to enforce a specific set of rules on a specific dimension (or a pocket dimension, metaverse— whatever) for some reason or another (that’s what their moral system dictates them to do, [they were bored,](http://gravitytales.com/novel/reincarnator) etc).

        Both explanations work, but now you’ll have to keep in mind the character of this “hidden” entity and negotiate any changes to the canon with it, trying to reach a consistent outcome. Then you’ll likely also have to ripple through the whole timeline of the setting, retroactively changing all of its history to match the negotiated changes (since it’s unlikely that your character(s) was the first in that universe to think about investigating \ using that specific loophole).

        Problems with this: 1) You’ll still have to work out an answer that would *logically* make sense (resolution of paradoxes). 2) If you go deep enough, the modified setting becomes very different from the canon (even if it *is* more consistent) and you lose part of your audience due to lack of empathy. 3) Simulating\projecting the meta-entity in your mind *and* simulating the whole canon-setting in 4D (3S+1T) to find out what the outcome will be looking like is going to be dauntingly difficult — at least if you don’t cut some corners (which is another problem by itself).

          I mean, if you go far enough with this idea, you basically end up with the *actual* explanation for what we observe in any fictional universe: someone out here in the real world decided to make it so. The problem with that explanation *in-universe*, of course, is that once you postulate a vastly more powerful intelligent entity capable of messing with you, pretty much every observation you make becomes suspect. It no longer becomes possible to deduce things from within the context of the fictional universe, because there's always the possibility that some capricious being might decide to overturn your prediction just for the heck of it.

          I don't have a link, but there was actually a short story inspired by the 2-4-6 scene between Harry and Hermione in HPMoR (chapter 8, I believe) set in a different universe where the laws of physics *were* determined by a capricious entity, which basically explores this exact idea. If anyone knows what I'm talking about and has a link, that'd be great.

      > There's Rules-As-Written munchkinry [...] Then there's Rules-As-Intended muchkinry,

      There’s also the muchkinry as a result of merely exploring the setting too deeply. Often you’ll either have to partially zombify your character, for them to ignore a glaring opportunity or inconsistency in front of them, or to proceed with the exploration that will likely result in poking at the inconsistency or loophole even more and lampshading it to others.

      I feel like the first one is straining the SoD while the second one puts too much work and expectations on the setting’s DM (an RPG tabletop’s DM, a group-story’s creator, you yourself, etc).

      One compromise solution to this is to keep the meta-discussion open with the DM and clarify beforehand digging how deep (and in what directions) is expected to be ok. 

      Another thing likely to help is discussing beforehand what type of experiences are all the other players hoping to get from that particular game. I.e. if the majority of the party is just looking to be lazing about in taverns, singing on a lute and whatnot, the one or two players who are trying to concentrate on deep exploration of the setting and loophole abuse will likely be perceived as game-spoilers by others.

    A while ago I was trying to piece together a more concrete definition of what makes rational fiction, since the sidebar and most other definitions are a combination of general good writing tips  (such as 'nothing happens because the plot requires it') and descriptions of what tends to *happen* in rational fiction (like 'the antagonist shouldn't be evil, they should have valid arguments of their own'), rather than what makes it rational.  You can tell writers of *any* genre that having things happen *just* because the plot demands it should be avoided at all costs, and I can easily envision a rational fiction in which the protagonists are in a world of pantheistic gods and the God of Evil is the main antagonist.

    I haven't pieced it together fully, but I think I figured out a part of what makes a rational fic.  One of the core virtues, the ones fights are resolved by and which carry the hero to victory, is intelligence.  Think of your Generic Action Show, where at the climax the protagonist is fighting the final boss, and gets overwhelmed.  But the hero hangs on!  Through his Determination and conviction in What He Believes In the hero gets a second wind and reaches victory.  That's obviously an idealized scenario, and it's not like all rational fiction *fails* to express this virtue (similarly, it's not like Generic Action Shows fail to express the virtue of intelligence), but the core virtue in rational fiction, above all or at least most others, is intelligence, cleverness, or some associated trait.

    Again, I don't think that's the whole picture.  But it explains things like why the well-known rational fics tend to have anti-climaxes more than usual, because the final showdown doesn't have to drag on long enough for the hero to show the Strength Of His Beliefs.  Instead, the core virtue of intelligence can be shown off in how the hero weaved a trap for the enemy along the entire story, or how the hero's plans were versatile enough to handle whatever the villain threw at him, or how despite being utterly blindsided the hero can analyze the situation and come up with a workable plan, and none of those explicitly require the final fight against the villain to last a long time, or for the hero to be put in dire straights and forced to reach deep within themselves for the strength to go on.

      So what you're saying is that Jimmy Neutron is the ultimate rational fiction.
      ```

      - u/InfernoVulpix:
        ```
        That's a good point.  Jimmy Neutron isn't rational fiction, but places a high emphasis on intelligence and plans for winning.  So, what separates the likes of Jimmy Neutron from the likes of The Metropolitan Man or HPMOR?  I'm just sounding things out right now, trying to see what makes sense.

        A possible option is that, while Jimmy Neutron ostensibly values intelligence, the intelligence is to rational behaviour as technobabble is to actual technological behaviour.  For this to be true, I would want to find that Jimmy Neutron's displays of intelligence and planning only superficially exemplify the virtue of intelligence, and more honestly exemplify the virtue of willpower.

        Looking at my vague memories of the show, the most I can remember is that episodes tend to involve some goofy problem spiraling out of control, until Jimmy focuses really hard and comes up with a big plan to save the day, his 'brain blasts'.  This reminds me of what you often see in certain fights in action shows, mostly against gimmicky enemy-of-the-week characters but frequently against more important foes as well.  The enemy appears unbeatable, outclassing the hero and clearly winning, but then the hero notices a critical weakness and immediately develops a plan to exploit that one weakness.

        For instance, suppose the enemy is in a giant mech with invincible armour and is steamrolling the heroes, but then the hero notices that the mech's giant beam attack leaves the mouth vulnerable, and formulates a plan to strike then.  That would not be out of place in many shonen anime, and in fact I think I've actually seen it a few times.  I wouldn't say that this makes the show rational, however, far from it.  My original statement is satisfied in that the battle is won and lost based on the awareness and plan-building of the hero, but I would argue, in this case, that spotting the weak point is the 'second wind' of the standard Willpower-based fight, and the hero's intelligence is being used as a *method* to emphasize the core willpower virtue by which the fight was survived and eventually won.  I'm not 100% confident on that, but it feels right.

        So if we say that Jimmy Neutron's Brain Blasts is, for all intents and purposes, identical to noticing that the mouth is vulnerable when preparing the giant beam attack, then even though Jimmy Neutron is a show about a genius who solves his problems by being super smart at them and making good plans and such, it's structured in such a way that Jimmy Neutron's fights are won by his willpower and conviction, with his intelligence as merely a tool to facilitate success, for as much as intelligence is given the 'spotlight'.

        Or, you know, I could be totally wrong and just building up a tower of justifications.  I'll have to think on it some more.

      Interesting, but I disagree.

      I think the main part of rational fiction is employing [Level One Intelligent characters](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent); that is, every relevant character makes a honest effort towards achieving their goals, instead of being a plot device.

      * It's not about consistency: the world could be inconsistent to the point of ridicule, but as long as the characters recognize and take into account (and possibly exploit) the inconsistency, it's fine.

      * It's not about moral conflicts: the characters could be Evil because they want to be Evil, but as long as they have valid reasons for having that goal (even if the reason is, a Random Omnipotent Being made it that way), and use valid methods to achieve it, it's fine.

      * It's not about intelligence: the characters could be stupid and win through power instead of intelligence, but as long as they still *pursue* their goals in a reasonalbe manner, and win *without* reality warping to help them, it's fine.

      * That means Deus/Diabolus Ex Machinas are prohibited, unless their appearances could be predicted and exploited by the characters. (The hero doesn't get a convenient power-up because the villain is about to defeat him, but the hero *could* base his plan on getting a power-up at the most desperate moment if he has reasonable evidence that he would get it.)

      * Worldbuilding could be whatever, but the author must choose: either they model every background human in the history of the world as honestly pursuing their goals (and so having wizards take over the human world thousands of years ago), or they imagine an inconsistent world and have the characters notice the inconsistency (are the wizards idiots, or something powerful stops them?, they should be asking).

      **The main point is**, rational fiction is about *characters* and conflicts between characters, not about showing one virtue or another, inspiring one emotion or another. It's closer to a quest or a roleplaying campaign indeed, than normal fiction.

      The other way of looking at it is, it's a different approach to writing fiction: a normal author sits and writes a satisfying story; a rational fiction author figures out which characters in which situations would weave a satisfying story, *then* writes it, and can't use divine interventions or contrived coincidences to nudge the plot the desired way.

      Rationality won't necessarily make a story satisfying: 'a Random Omnipotent Being manipulated everything to be so' would turn *any* story into a rational one, but it won't be satisfying in the least. On the other hand, 'a Random Omnipotent Being made Voldemort smarter, then watched', could make quite an interesting story.

      The trick to writing rational fiction is striking a balance between how you want the world to look like, how much of the world and plot premise you want to rationalize, ensuring Suspension of Disbelief, and telling a satisfying story.

        That's certainly a very major point too.  I was never under the impression that what I was describing was the entirety of what makes rational fiction, and this is probably more central anyways.

        I *do* still think that rational fiction tends to put intelligence front-and-center, to a greater extent than willpower or other common virtues.  The zeitgeist, as I've heard it described, serves as a catch-all for works that this community likes, including things like Worm (which despite not being written as rational fiction is sometimes regarded as such) and other works as crazy as UNSONG.  To refine my idea further, I would say that /r/rational's zeitgeist involves works where intelligence and related virtues are the primary metric by which conflicts are won or lost.

        Whether this relates to rational fiction on a more fundamental level alongside the Level 1+ Intelligent Characters concept is something I'll have to do more thinking about.

          I agree, it *tends to*. I don't think it's its fundamental property, though: it's a direct consequence of using L1 intelligent characters. It makes interpersonal conflicts *realistic*, and in reality...

          In reality, intelligence is the most powerful weapon — and tool — around. A fiction that doesn't aim to inspire one thing or another and warps the plot to do so, which instead realistically describes a conflict between parties, it would naturally end up with the most intelligent — the most powerful — party winning.

          The rest is just authors choosing the particulars to tell a satisfying story, so that it expresses the virtue of intelligence, deconstructs non-rational works, or something else.

          That said, I've just remembered another interesting opinion, expressed in u/AmeteurOpinions' [They Should Have Sent A Poet](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2txg42/metad_they_should_have_sent_a_poet/). What do you think?

                The first draft stalled out because nuclear physics is complicated (who could have guessed? Not me, apparently) and in general I bit off more than I can chew. 

                However! I did find some better and more helpful sources to work with and started writing it again. My current plan is to pick up the Sunday slot after Unsong finishes. I was going to announce as much when I was ready to post, but I may as well do it now.

                Back on topic, my opinion hasn't really changed. I still see far to much *RATIONAL fiction* when what we need is *rational FICTION*.

                    I'm referring to the distinction between stories which are about rational characters optimizing their outcomes and rational authors optimizing their stories. Thus:

                    *rational* fiction is rationalist-lite fiction, where the author tries to present intelligence to the reader in an emotionally satisfying story. They probably try to use tenets of the rationalists ethic but don't go so far as to cite them in the story like HPMOR did.

                    rational *fiction* is the author finding the exact problem, theme, or concept of their story and exploiting its potential emotional/intellectual satisfaction.

                    This is how I would try to describe the distinction with a minimal word count. Hopefully it's not confusing.

    > I've heard two schools of thought in RPGs about what to do about munchkins since they stop anyone else from having fun how they want to. One says that the GM needs to be smart enough to keep the munchkin under control and ensure the rules can't be exploited. The other says the munchkin shouldn't be allowed to play the game in the first place since they violate the social contract between players.

    I'm of the third school of thought: if the players can do it, so can the NPCs. Or rather, from a literature standpoint, I think it's the right of the MC to exploit mechanics in however broken a manner as they can, but at the same time, the enemies can copy whatever the MC does. So while there still is an incentive for players to break the game's system and create overpowered exploits, they need to be wise about using those exploits unless they want every two-bit mook copying them. After all, there are only <6 players, and a potentially infinite amount of NPCs.

    It is easy to believe that something is ripe for munchkins when we have a simple view of it.

    Now, idealism can be extremely positive when it inspires us to learn more, to explore, to investigate. This is deconstruction: seeing old ideas afresh, without their traditional contexts. More often than not, however, we discover that we are not the first to have followed these paths. Either previous explorers have mapped our objects all the way to their dead ends, or else we find well-fortified opposing camps defended for political or cultural reasons rather than rational ones.

    Most rational fiction is deconstruction, either of someone else's fiction or an author's own fantasy idea, and most fictional worlds are simple enough that they can be completely understood with little effort. Better yet, they haven't been "lived in" long enough to have their rules optimized, or to have inspired deep political divisions.

    They can be "broken" precisely because their problems and flaws are not like the problems and flaws of our real world. They're smaller, simpler, and younger. The idealists win because the paths they're walking are new frontiers.

    Could we reconstruct rather than deconstruct? Could we endeavor to upgrade the realism and lived-in "maturity" of fantasy worlds? Absolutely, and some authors already have. In our world, thousands of generations of munchkins have optimized solutions for an overwhelming number of possibilities. We could absolutely write small-scale stories within similarly un-munchkinable worlds, where people struggle with problems at a more personal, less idealistic scale.

    Keep in mind, however: Changing the magic in the world of (for example) Harry Potter so that it can't easily and superficially solve most of his problems, while still maintaining the feel and hitting the beats of the original story is *very challenging*.

    Poking holes in a story so simple that it *cannot* be understood complexly is always easier... whether you're deliberately fencing with a strawman, breathlessly embracing unprovable futurism, or writing fanfiction.

    >I wonder if we need a better way to describe the mindset of a rationalist character than munchkinry.

    As far as I can tell, that isn’t the case. Rational, munchkinging, and deconstruction stories often overlap with each other but they are not one and the same. That being said, there are also certain types of scenarios in stories in which the characters *have* to start deeply exploring \ deconstructing the setting in order for the story to remain “rationality-validated”, so to speak. 

    Consider the setting of [SAO,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SwordArtOnline) for instance. If the character’s goal in it is just to survive and enjoy their daily life, then the story can be rational [even if all they do is catch fish](http://swordartonline.wikia.com/wiki/Nishida) and learn how to cook it for others. If the character has to return to the real world as soon as possible, however, they will have much more restrictions and requirements placed upon them for the story to maintain its rational! status.

    >Recently, the stories that I liked most were about people achieving limited personal success in a conflict that effected their life more than others. Not all of them were mundane, but even when magic or superpowers were involved I liked when they didn't effect the world around the protagonist very much.

    That’s a very good point though. Even though there *should* be many stories out there that are technically validly rational *without* also having that need-to-become-stronger motive to them, I haven’t seen that many such stories either discussed here or listed on any of the relevant rat!story lists.

    >It could be that I came down with depression over the past year and a half so I've made it my goal to simply survive rather than thrive [..] I've been feeling really good lately and still feel good now.

    I’m glad it’s worked out for you. Is it ok to ask how you managed to achieve this turnaround?

    > since they violate the social contract between players

    If the contract is an unspoken one, then it is likely that each player has their own expectations regarding what that social contract looks like.

    >since the entire point of the game is to have fun within the shared rule set

    What if deconstruction and deep exploration of the setting *are* what’s fun for those particular players?

    >since they stop anyone else from having fun

    If this is the case and they can not adapt, then that particular game is not for them, sure. But I think it may be possible to have a whole group of such players who’d enjoy their thing without spoiling anything for anybody. Or even to work with the DM and other players to make their interest contribute to the gameplay instead of spoiling it.

    >I can see how those that aren't [religious] would view the GM of reality as someone who forced them into a game they didn't want to play [..] but I'm kind of okay with the existence of death even if I don't see it as good.

    Death’s not the only negative aspect of this “game” that can be criticised, but that’s not significant here. 

    >I can see how those that aren't [religious] would view the GM of reality as someone who forced them into a game they didn't want to play and seek to knock the board over

    Those that aren't religious would likely have no “GM of reality” in their worldview at all. Or if they had, it would be something closer from the Cosmicism philosophy — not only something that doesn’t care whether or not we manage to “knock the board over”, but also one that [created a board so big that any changes we made to it would fall tens of orders of magnitude short from being noticed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Earth%27s_Location_in_the_Universe.jpg)

    > I've accepted death as an inherent part of life and see attempts to outright destroy death instead of merely fighting against it as hubristic.

    I know this wasn't the point of the post, but if you'd be okay with it, I'd like to explore this more. When a anti-deathist says something like "I want to destroy death," I'm fairly certain that they mean something like "I want to stop all the things that cause death" rather than "I want to destroy the fundamental concept of death," since that's not how reality works. So when you say you want to fight against it, I just hear a lack of induction, since if you keep on fighting the causes until none of the causes are left, you've done what the anti-deathist was calling for in the first place.

    I suppose the method of phrasing leaves a bit lacking in terms of publicity, but I don't see the real difference.

    I suppose that the simplistic "I want to destroy death" throws away the possibility of euthanasia, but I feel like that's a very small side case when you consider only the people who would want to kill themselves when they're not in any physical pain and they're not mentally ill.

      I haven't made the misinterpretation you suggest. I know that people are referring to sources of death rather than the concept. I'm fine with curing disease and increasing lifespans, I don't even have serious objections to transhumanist methods of immortality. I can't be considered a true deathist since I believe in an afterlife, but I don't consider death a goal to aspire to in any way. I think death is something that should be fought, but cannot be truly conquered and must be accepted as an eventuality.

        Well sure, an "eventuality." Meaning what, though? As far as we know the heat death of the universe is still going to be pretty much the end of any possibility of life as we know it. But I agree with /u/gbear605, this:

        > I don't like it that people die and want everyone to live longer and better, but I've accepted death as an inherent part of life and see attempts to outright destroy death instead of merely fighting against it as hubristic.

        Feels like a lack of induction. If we ban the words "destroy death" and talk about what is actually, realistically the goals and objectives of those who are anti-death, you seem to be in total agreement. End disease. End aging. Possibly upload the mind in the far future. In what ways, then, do you believe those trying to "conquer" death differ from you? Which line crossed makes it hubristic? Thousands of years of life? Millions? Billions?

  Has anyone here given much thought to the minimum viable mass you need to launch for an Orbital Ring to be functional? I know Paul Birch used 180,000 tons in his [example](http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-II.pdf), but something that bugs me is that this was never subsequently questioned. If it turns out that 180 tons would have worked, all this time, that translates to nightmarish amounts of lost utility that we could have had with cheap access to space (not to mention mundane utility like a hypersonic freight connection to every continent). Heck, 180 tons is little enough that SpaceX could probably pull it off with a small bank loan.
