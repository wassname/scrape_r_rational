  So how does that grain comparison work out in relation and also in context to the later one that he uses to teach Cat about the relationship between Callow and Praes?
  ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    This one is long before that point.  It shows the amount of production of grain *by* Praes, how it went up and surged through numerous years until it began to fall in advance of the place becoming the Wasteland (at which point it hit zero).  Kind of like the equivalent of magical stripmining, but crops instead of ore.  The creation of the wasteland wasn't due to stealing weather or any other sort of mad sorcery gone wrong, it was just people being stupid and abusing the environment magically because it was so profitable, up until the point where it wasn't... and then the Empire would *have* to attack other nations just to survive, because they had destroyed their own environment in their greed.

    The one he shows Cat is the amount of grain production in both Praes and Callow, in relation to the Empire's population.  Whenever the population reached a certain critical mass, Praes would declare war on Callow, with the goal of either eventually conquering them (which Black did) or reducing their own population to manageable levels through the attrition of war.  The more modern examples showed *just how much* the Empire imported from Callow in regards to how much they could produce and their population size.  It was to show her that one way or another, Praes would *need* Callow, either as a subjugated nation or a reliable trading partner. Thus "the grain must flow", but so long as the Empire got what it needed to survive, he didn't care which method was used.  (He was telling her that her goals for a free Callow were fine so long as they still traded the grain to Praes, else they *would* be invaded again as it was a matter of life and death for the Empire, not just them being greedy).

      Right, but do we have the kind of timeline to say make the causal claim that pre-wasteland Praes wasn't driven by that need to war with Callow for the victory or loss and the inherent population decrease?
      Also that it's kind of strange that he makes such a big point of the interconnectedness of Praes and Callow by the movement of grain that it feels strange that we don't see him say revolutionise Praes agriculture given that he has one of the greatest magical minds of his time loyal to himself personally. Because we later see Warlock experimenting on the inherent dragonness of a being by giving a pig fire breathing abilities and wings, so clearly there's an opportunity sometime between this chapter and current day in-story for some sort of non-overtly toxic magically engineered food plant(?) that if not bridges the gap, between Praes population growth and their actual agricultural capacity to feed them, then at least shortens it. 
      I mean we see Black do a lot institutional changes and arguably logistical minded ones, the orphanages marking out potential heroes or the standardization of training, gear for the legions. To me there is this big issue of what happens when Praes reaches the limit of what Callowan agriculture can sustain, like Black's whole shtick was his planning and methodical nature and it's jarring for his plan to be just like setup successor to keep grain flowing end plan.

        Outside of Warlock not giving a whit about these sorts of problems, you have to remember that the gnomes exist.  While their whims are at least somewhat inscrutable, it is perhaps not a coincidence that the offence under Nefarious that warranted a Red Letter was a *farming machine*.  Given they later send one for the goblins experimenting with powders, Black knows it's not purely just machine advancement they will send a letter for

        Pre-Wasteland wasn't *as* driven because there wasn't as much need.  They attacked them because they were nearby and Praes was an Evil Empire, so that was expected.  Post Wasteland, they attacked them from necessity.

        > we don't see him say revolutionise Praes agriculture given that he has one of the greatest magical minds of his time loyal to himself personally

        As the other commenter rightly pointed out, Warlock doesn't care enough to make new grain rituals when he has the universe to take apart, any technological advancements in that area will *quickly* be put down by the gnomes, who are actively stifling any possible Industrial Revolutions by the more primitive (ie: not gnomish) nations.

        > To me there is this big issue of what happens when Praes reaches the limit of what Callowan agriculture can sustain

        It doesn't, it hits carrying capacity and levels out.  They didn't have overpopulation problems back in the days when they magically stripmined their fields.  Anyone who believes a population (especially a human one) always runs into exponential growth until it hits apocalyptic proportions either has a really bad grasp of the mechanics involved or is Thanos.

        > it's jarring for his plan to be just like setup successor to keep grain flowing end plan.

        His plan was much more than that.  His plan was to permanently reform the Empire in such a way that A) No one alive for several generations had lived through the old system **and** B) The Empire would be stable and self-sufficient enough that it wouldn't have to go declaring war on other nations or making Bond Villain superweapons or the like just to survive.  IE: A peaceful Evil nation that breaks the mold.

        In this, he and Cat are very alike, as they are really only "using" Evil to accomplish their sane, reasonable goals.  This truly makes her his daughter, heir, and successor much more than any affectionate relationship or blood kinship ever could.

          Ok lot to unpack there, while it's true that there is an implication that post wasteland there was an inherent need to unload their population, the doing so, the warring the reaching as Ubua would say the Triumphants as much as any large scale failure, arguably the large scale failures were if anything more inherently Evil within the in-universe logic, was also training the aristocracy and the majority of the populace that they have the right to put their personal might to the task of conquering others. And this is if not the core to their cultures then it's at least a point that's close to it see the Dread Emperor/Empress position the perpetually looking for weakness Chancellor, or their phrase iron shapes iron. this also is more or less my response to your third point and most of your fourth.

          I think that it's really strange to have Warlock's not caring to make new grain rituals the rationale behind him not doing when he considers it mildly offensive that when Malicia had a need for a large scale doom weapon that she didn't simply ask him. I think that that trust and personal relationship is more than enough to make that argument that they either Black or Malicia could have easily made more efficient or larger scale grain rituals. He goes off to defend a town and one of his last thoughts is that while he doesn't care about the Dread Empire that he did care about both Black and Malicia personally.

          I'm not sure where exponential growth is implied, given that there is a set amount of people that any parcel of land up to and including our personal planet, while there may be ways to expand it, i.e. chemical fertilizers, in our world, or the grain rituals of Praes, there are limits to how many people can be fed. I was speaking about the implicit time say two or three generations after the cheap Callowan grain gluts the population of Praes leads to a population boom and then eventually outstrips Callowan capacity that they had never been able to do so before because they had never held Callow as far i can recall ever. Most human populations would not hit the kind of explosive population growth, but most populations would not be as dependent and as historically dependent on another country to feed them while being able to economically sustain their own agricultural inadequacy. Praes is like a person's stomach without the regulatory systems of normal hunger, Praes consumes all it's given indefinitely, their people have been arguably above their own fields carrying capacity since the formation of the Wasteland and that is what the problem is stemming from.

            > they have the right to put their personal might to the task of conquering others.

            This is a fundamental belief of Below.  Pretty much all Evil nations have this as a tenant, it's just *how* they go about it that is different, and the scale of their efforts.
              However, no matter any of that, if your starving populace rises up in revolt or all dies off, leaving you either headless or with no one to rule, then you've got an existential crisis on your hands and you need to deal with it.

            > this also is more or less my response to your third point and most of your fourth.

            It's not so much of a response as a statement of you view.  It doesn't explain their actions in regards to the grain, just their general stance on others.

            > he considers it mildly offensive that when Malicia had a need for a large scale doom weapon that she didn't simply ask him.

            Yes.  He would have enjoyed coming up with some crazy world-breaking weapon using his own particular knowledge, if given the chance.

            Creating mass produced rituals that establish a perfect pH balance in the soil, infusing it with the necessary chemicals and moisture, etc, etc, was not the sort of thing he was into.  Remember his incredible disdain for Legion-style magic?  Now do that with something that's just based around dirt.  He wouldn't have liked it at all.  Plus, it might not even be within his style.  He does his *Imbricate* thing and overlaps dimensions as a method of accomplishing most of his goals.  I doubt there's a "Farming Hell" he could use, and overlaying a slice of Arcadia over the land is probably a bad idea as well.

            > I'm not sure where exponential growth is implied

            Congratulations, you understand the underlying mechanics and are not Thanos.

            > I was speaking about the implicit time say two or three generations after the cheap Callowan grain gluts the population of Praes leads to a population boom and then eventually outstrips Callowan capacity 

            Looks like I was too quick in congratulating you.  What is the birthrate in Praes?  Is Praes a low-tier, underdeveloped nation where people have nothing to do in their spare time but breed?  In a nation where everyone watches their back and 'iron sharpens iron', how common is it to see big families with 4+ children, and for those children to survive long enough to have such families of their own?

            > hat they had never been able to do so before because they had never held Callow as far i can recall ever.

            No, but at one point they produced so much grain that they could *export* it as a form of payment.  They didn't have rapid exponential growth there that threatened them with self-destruction, so it's unlikely they would do the same if getting grain from Callow instead of the pre-Wasteland land.

            > Most human populations would not hit the kind of explosive population growth

            Because humans are not viruses, yes.

            > but most populations would not be as dependent and as historically dependent on another country to feed them while being able to economically sustain their own agricultural inadequacy.

            …
            You, uh, should probably read up on nations *in the real world* then, and notice how many **have** to import food to survive, whether because their land is crap, their tech is bad, or they simply have too high of a population that focuses on other tasks than farming.

            >  Praes consumes all it's given indefinitely, their people have been arguably above their own fields carrying capacity since the formation of the Wasteland and that is what the problem is stemming from.

            They were above their fields, but not their nation.  And *do note* that sizeable portions of the grain was used as *currency* with other nations.  They were a bit of an exporter in that regard, from the money they could make with it.  They didn't create the Wasteland trying to keep their population alive, they created the Wasteland *due to excessive greed and non-renewable farming practices*.
