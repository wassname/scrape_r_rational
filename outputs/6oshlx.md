  More character building! A little hammy, and I didn't care for the way the little ones jumped on Ray, but that's more my perception of kids. 

  These kids are much smarter than your standard fair.

  I have couple options: 

  Ray's the 'bad' one, Minerva's the 'bad' one, or someone else? A new character, perhaps?

  Also a theory on the demons vs humans:

  Demons become more humanoid the less human they eat.

  I'm glad the younger kids are reminding Emma and Ray to put on their own oxygen masks first. They're right to call Emma out for hiding her illness. I understand why she did it, but it was a dangerous move. She'll have to learn to strike a balance where she can project the confidence she needs to in order to keep morale up and maintain the kids' trust in her leadership, but still admit when she needs help.
