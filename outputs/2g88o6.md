  Well done chapter; it shows the real cost and had some nice character work. 

  When was the last time DMA updated?

    Mid May, so I guess it's bi-annual now.

      I don't think we can really generalise from this. They may have just had writer's block, or had RL issues taking up time

        I meant it in jest.  I'm a pretty big fan of Dungeon Keeper Ami and check on it monthly.

        Edit: Spelling that may have implied sarcasm.  I'm blaming ethanol.
