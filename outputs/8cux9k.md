## Anyone know if Lighting Up the Dark is up yet?

### Post:

Last update from the author is:

https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3344060/Velorien

Update 27/03/18: The rewrite is more or less done. A little more polish, and then it goes out to my beta readers.

  Gosh that fic is so good.

  He has an update on [his Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/velorien) that's more recent, but not much more than the one on his fanfiction page; just that it's around 160,000 words long. That was the end of March and it hadn't gone out to his beta readers yet, so it's a decent assumption his beta readers would take a couple weeks to read it, then he would want to work on it a bit more, before putting it out. He did post the re-written prologue on his Patreon as well, though.

  Mind if I ask a question on here about it? I dont want to spam the subreddit with questions when I just asked one about WtC the other day.

  I just hit Chapter 10 and who is Raijin? I cant remember him being mentioned other than to Haku.

  - u/None:
    ```
    Two possibilities:

    1. Original character that hasn't been introduced yet. I seem to recall Velorien stating as much at one point, but I could easily be imagining that.

    2. [Anime-original character Raijin.](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Raijin) Velorien does watch the anime rather than read the manga, so this is a possibility, but... not a very likely one.

    Either way, you aren't supposed to know who it is when Naruto mentions him.
