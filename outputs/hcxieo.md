  Ravelling Wrath is about a couple of teenagers who participate in a divine ritual transpiring in another world. The rules of the magic are interesting and consistent, but of particular note is that >!they know that their minds are going to be compromised -- each becoming wound up with a fraction of a deity -- and the best they have available to maintain their agency is mundane mental skills.!<
