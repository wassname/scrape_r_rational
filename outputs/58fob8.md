## Rational NaNoWriMo Preliminary Planning

### Post:

**PLANNING THREAD**

National November Writing Month is almost here with only ten days left!

While there was already a planning thread a [month](https://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/53ns0s) ago, this is for any new ideas now that we're closer to the start date.

* Figure out your characters!

* What is the goal or conflict you want to write?

* How will everyone interact with each other?

* When will event A happen versus B in your plot!

* What will you show to your readers?

It's strongly advised that you talk about what you're having trouble with and to only give brief details on your overall structure of the story rather than share everything. Otherwise you will be less motivated to write the story after spending your excitement and energy sharing every detail of your ideas. Brainstorming can make writing the story seem boring, since once you go over a scene multiple times in excruciating detail during the planning stage, you'll have to do it again when you actually write it.

Happy RaNoWriMo!

  I finished nano last year but the plot was kind of full of holes, so this year I'm doing actual planning. So far I have:

  * A world which is like our own with one difference, a very few people get reborn as their younger selves (mental time travel) - so you are five years old but with all the memories you had when you 'died'

  * A semi-plausible but untestable explanation of why that might be - so it's not just done by magic or gods, at least.

  * A handwavy 'invisible hand' that keeps history almost exactly the same - which is probably the least rational bit that I can't easily fix.

  * A protagonist who is born in 1955 and lives into the near future. No, I haven't fixed what the near future is going to be like yet, and yes, that makes the story easily outdated. That's kind of a problem, but I need to do it cos I DON'T want to write anyone older who lives through WWII (too many terrible tropes)

  * An antagonist mentor, sort of. I have been interrogating them in the bath (when I'm in the bath, I mean, I talk to my characters when I'm bathing for some reason) so I know their aims and why they think they are a good person trying to do the right thing. Some terrible tropes averted - I hope.

  * A character and family background for my protagonist (working on antagonist.)

  * Not enough other characters - how many is enough? I know my last book had too many, so maybe starting with too few is good?

  * Zero love interest (don't know if I want one, probably not.)

  * More subplots than I have room for, in terms of ways to munchkin your foreknowledge, ways to survive doing childhood AGAIN etc.

  * A couple of bits of actually worked out foreshadowing.

  * Not enough of an idea on what order I will show things to the reader

  * Unanswered questions: like how many reborn are there? What do they have in common? And any other unanswered questions I get from here

  * I’m still a bit fuzzy on the ending, but I do have a couple of ideas, either of which could lead into a sequel, but hopefully not in an obviously unfinished looking way…

  And I only have ten days before it starts - no idea if I can finish planning by then. *is scared*

  Arrggh, I only just started posting my giant Naruto fanfic and then you mentioned this, and now I have a great new idea for a totally different story that I can't get out of my head:

  It's a Worm-esque setting where young people across the world suddenly develop powers, only instead of the powers being super useful and convenient they're terrifying because A) the users get no feedback whatsoever and so they don't know what they're doing (teleportation without knowing where you will teleport to, let's say) and B) you only gets powers if you have a certain extreme personality type, and the crazier you are the more powerful you get. So the whole world quickly goes to hell as a result, and our (slightly less crazy) protagonists have to (maybe?) save the day.

  The powers I have in mind, depending on craziness:   
  1. Asperger/introverted: Telekinesis, mental type power  
  2. sociopathy/dissociative disorder: Bending space/time/reality  
  3. chaotic/manic/borderline types: Energy manipulation, i.e. nuke everything  
  4. Some sort of life/mind/body manipulation power?  

  What do you guys think? Sound interesting or not? I'll probably finish NTBS first before I write any of it regardless, just to be on the safe side...

    What do you want to describe the magic energy as? As a liquid roiling through the body? As a tank of energy/MP bar? As solid particles instead of liquids or more of a fluid-like description? Go for *how* you plan on describing the magic energy and how it will be used. Knowing the desired wording which will be associated with it can help to influence a name. You can decide on harsh /k/ syllables, smoother /m/ syllables, long and grandiose names, short and catchy name, and other qualities of the word you want before coming up with examples.

    >  I'm also trying to come up with a name for mages who are able to get into physical combat a la Naruto's ninjas.

    One name I've seen used once in a story (Savage Divinity) as a joke was muscle wizard.
