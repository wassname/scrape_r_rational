  You mention that Kurama presents the trolley problem inverted from its usual.  It seems that this is perhaps an approach to make Naruto consider the virtues of non-action as a choice.  Interestingly, it also had a dichotomy of Sound vs. Konoha, one vs many, likable vs unlikable.  

  Personally, Naruto needs to invest in a more thorough ethical framework rather than attempting to do everything - as you've pointed out, this simply defers conflict and responsibility.

  On a side note, I really have been enjoying your characterization of the the Snake Sannin as a rational 'villain', it makes him a fascinating character and adversary.

    Thank you.  I've said before, and I still feel, that he's the most fun character in the story to write and I suspect to read.  It's a bit problematic, because the heroes really should be the most fun, but he's just so engaging...I get to be unabashedly evil when I write him, and that's the sweet sugar of the soul.

  Firstly, I would like to thank you for writing this novel and your continued dedication to it.

  Secondly, the fox clearly had a lot more information than he should have been able to gather given the restraints that the seal supposedly placed on him.

  Thirdly, you seem to consider the implied release of an eldritch horror sealed away by the ancients to be a good note. I approve.

    Naruto lent him his senses to become friends.

      Yes, but I thought that was only in Sound, but the fox used images of several people from Narutu's life in Konoha?

  to a harmless stop.

  Well, seems Kurama manipulated Naruto so he would break the cage restraints. Perhaps it was his goal, perhaps a happy accident. Looking forward to finding out which.

  Would trolley even exist with the Naruto world's tech, though?

    I believe that Naruto's world has modern tech it can just be hard to get.

      Correct.

  Short chapter this time, as I'm a week behind on getting started with NaNoWriMo.

  Ok ok OK *OK*.

  I get it.

  I ask for a chapter, just a anything to get me by, and you give us this... mountain of a cliffhanger. It's like giving a thirsty man some sour sherbets, then when he asks for something to quench the thirst, you offer a dollop of Ghost Chili. 

  Of course, you're now only your merry way to disappear for the next month with that NanowriMo thing, and I have to sit here burning through my imagination as I try to work out all the possible consequences of having a Kurama on the loose.

    Ahhhhhh, the sweet tears of frustration and rage.  Mmmm.

    There'll be another chapter in two weeks, as promised.  In the meantime you've got a credit in chapter 12 of Induction, which gets released to the public tomorrow.  (It went out to $5+ Patreon backers today.)

      You run a copy of the Fox in your mind when you think of your readers, don't you?

      That is exactly what you should be doing. :)

  Is the Fox free?
