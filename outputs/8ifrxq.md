  Do you mind posting a summary of the story? Although, lewd magical girls in space sounds sufficiently titillating to entice me into reading this. :)

    ARR is set in a near-future alternate history where supernatural phenomena are real, but have been hidden from the public eye by a memetic masquerade/perception filter (known in-universe as the Veil); although most people don't know that magic is the cause, magic has had many effects on society, including prompting earlier development of fairly advanced (hard-science) technology for colonizing the solar system.

    The deuteragonists are Cameron and Eelesia, two different Magical Girls. Cameron is new to being a Magical Girl (new at the "Girl" thing, too*), and she juggles her new life as an extremely sex-positive porn star with her new life as a sex-positive warrior of lewd justice against erotic horrors; Eelesia is an experienced Magical Girl on the outs with her Lawful Stupid patron, the Beacon, both for breaking sexual taboos and for her long-term goal of tearing down the Veil.

    (*which only proves that this novel is rational, because as we all know, [rationalism and transness are highly comorbid](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2017/02/23/plasticbrains/) /s)

    Cameron and Eelesia's respective adventures and misadventures end up entangling them together, and, of course, taking them across the solar system, which includes some fairly diverse human (and non-human) cultures.

    All in all, I absolutely loved this story and recommend it; but it is very unflinching and straightforward in being what it is, so personal tastes may object.

      The article you linked wasnt about rationalists, it was about "plasticbrains" which from the sound of it seems like just another word for people who have high functioning autism/aspergers, unless I'm really missing something. IIRC, there is a higher rate of high functioning autism amongst rationalists than the general population, and a higher rate of transgender amongst people with high functioning autism than the general population.

        That's kind of the joke.

    In addition to /u/Subrosian_Smithy's susinct summary, the magical system is soul based, where spells are different combinations of facets of your soul. There is also empathic magic which uses 4 colors which each have 2 polarities giving 8 possible effects that can be combined to be strikingly versatile.

      > the magical system is soul based

      Eh, it'd be more accurate to say that the souls are magic-system based, but the *superpowers* used by the magical girls are in turn soul-based, to the extent that that phrasing conveys any information what-so-ever.

    Yeah, QQ requires an account because it's hosting explicit material.

  I read the whole thing and greatly enjoyed it, before I saw it linked here even. It was only afterwards looking through your QQ index post that I connected you to Forever After Earth and the Whatley fanfic version of Cameron. Your writing has greatly improved since those. In particular, this felt better on the story-structure level of having a good overall plot, ~~and I quite liked the original setting.~~ The Veil seems like a masquerade which could actually exist, and I fully give it my suspension of disbelief (which can be a problem sometimes for masquerade/urban fantasy settings).

  Edit: ok, after reading the CYOA it's based on, the setting is less original than I thought. Still, some parts -- soul mods, the crossroads, have been fleshed out a lot, and the humanity-throughout-the-solar-system thing is new and adds a lot.

  I've had more consecutive orgasms reading this, than from anything else in two years. Worth it just for that.

  I've read up until the six Cameron chapter and I just can't anymore. The incest was very much not my kink so I was trying to skim those sections and I've reached my breaking point when Cameron uses the words "involuntarily celibate" seriously. This is not my cup of tea.

    At first, I was very confused about how that could possibly be a complaint.

    But, of course.

    I suppose I miscalculated the extent to which those words have completely ceased to have anything like their literal meaning even to readers who are at least in theory supposed to *know politics is the mind-killer* and think for more than five seconds about context before going with their flavor-of-the-day knee-jerk reaction.

    But fine. Nothing is lost if I edit two words into a less topically-fraught descriptive phrase, I suppose.

      The entire point of reactions is that you don't stop and think about which one you're going to have. And politics is also spiders, in that it's hard to reason well about it well when you're reading a book and suddenly one jumps out of the page and AAARGH IT'S ON MY FACE. That phrase threw me out of the flow of the story, and I did have to stop and think about it. For someone who's already a bit put off by Cameron's actually-strange approach to sex, I can see how it'd be a breaking point. For me, a bit more context and Cameron's general approach to things sufficed to help me read the phrase differently. 

      > But fine. Nothing is lost if I edit two words into a less topically-fraught descriptive phrase, I suppose.

      Yep.
