## [D] A surprisingly moving entry on the SCP Foundation

### Post:

Doesn't qualify as rationalist, but I found this to be a moving piece of writing personally, and expect that people here might like it.

[SCP-1612](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1612)

I was wondering whether this is appropriate here, and if not, where else I could post and find writing like this.

  As someone who has been lurking the wiki since the days of the Fisher, I find it funny that I got a bit of frisson reading the _comments_.  I really like it when the community comes together to make a surprisingly good entry better without any clashing egos or ridiculousness.

  So who's Pangloss, then?

    ```
    Named for a character in Voltaire's Candide, na√Øvely and unrelentingly optimistic. But this character actually acts to justify that worldview and bring it to reality, unlike its namesake. Click on the tag to find more SCPs involving this being.

  I think it definitely belongs here under the [HSF] tag. Thanks for posting it!

  If you look up Mount Kazbek as well, you'll see it is associated with the Georgian version of Prometheus, who was chained there for having stolen fire from the Gods.
