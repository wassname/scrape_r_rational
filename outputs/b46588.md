## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I got into Harvard Law! I'm filled with an overwhelming sense of relief. It's so good to no longer have this hanging over my head. ðŸ˜­

    Hey! Congratulations! I've followed your troubles from your first post. Now remember Dracos lesson: "I'll make friends at school!" 

    Harvard title is great and all, but a big benefit of these elite schools are the connections to native elites.

      Thank you! I'm gonna make so many friends it's gonna make your head spin.

  Maybe it has already been mentioned (sorry!!): I just noticed that the top six works at [topwebficiton.com](https://topwebficiton.com) have female protagonists:

  1. a practical guide to evil by erraticerrata
  2. ward by wildbow
  3. metaworld chronicles by wutosama
  4. the wandering inn by pirateaba
  5. forge of destiny by yrsillar
  6. worm by wildbow

  Admittedly #5 is new, but remaining entries are solid, dominating the top-5 for the past year.

  Moreover, there's less stability in the lower 6-20 positions, and I haven't read all, but I'm almost certain they are \~90% male protagonist.

  Does it mean anything? Probably not. It is funny though. (for me.)

  - u/Abpraestigio:

    It is interesting, yes.

    Just as I find interesting that at least four of those six are/were written by male authors.
    ```

  - u/eternal-potato:
    ```
    Given two mostly identical works of fiction, differing only in protagonist's gender and all the effects and subplots arising from this, I'd likely choose one where MC is female. Probably for the same reason that "cute girls doing things" is a popular (mostly-)anime genre. I believe same principle applies when one is a writer.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    While he was still writing it, Wildbow's Twig regularily topped the charts. Its main character Sylvester is male.  

    Not sure if Pact ever topped the charts like his other works, but it's also a webserial with a male lead.

  REQUEST: fill out (and maybe share/spread!) a 5min survey?

  --------------------------------------------------------

  I'm collecting data on powerfully persuasive speech acts; it's part of a dangling thread of curiosity after GPT-2 (a new and fairly powerful text generation algorithm).

  I've made a form to collect personal examples of things-someone-said that caused you to seriously change some belief or behavior.  An easy example would be if someone declared that they love you, and this caused you to suddenly devote a lot more (or a lot less!) time and attention to them as a person.

  If you have five minutes, my goal for this form is 1000+ responses and your own response(s) will help with that.  All replies are anonymous, and there's a place for you to restrict how the information is used/state confidentiality desires.  You can also fill it out more than once if you want.

  https://goo.gl/forms/39x3vJqNomAome382 is the link to the form, if you want to share with anyone else; I'm happy to have this spread around wherever.

  Thanks!

    I don't know if you're going to get a lot of useful data.

    For my part, all the major shits I remember having from my beliefs came from sustained interaction with people of opposing beliefs, and I barely remember what their words were (or even the specific subjects of our conversations). I don't think I could summarize it in a few sentences.
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:

      Demonstrating that that's the case like 99+% of the time *is* useful data, if that's true.

        ```
        When I first saw your form, I assumed you were just looking to collect positive examples, and since I couldn't think of any in my own life, so I didn't fill it out.
        Even now, I still don't see a clear way to indicate anything like "I can't think of any instance of a dramatic shift in thinking as a result of someone's small number of words."

  Devil May Cry 5 is a really really good videogame. It isn't rational or rationalist in pretty much any way, but it's not trying to be - it's all about ridiculously over-the-top stylish action, larger-than-life characters, and an incoherent rule-of-cool setting. But it's a really good game for a series that was desperately in need of a new entry, and the game is just fun as hell. It has two returning characters from earlier entries in the series (Dante and Nero) and a new playable character in V, who is bizzare to control but still quite fun. V walks around being goth as fuck and reads William Blake's poetry constantly - there is an entire 'make V read poetry' *button* in his controls - while his pet Shadow and Griffin and Nightmare fight controlled by him, and he then teleports around finishing enemies off. Nero in this entry has a robot hand that hot-swaps with different attachments including a rocket arm that flies around punching people and that you can ride on. Dante uses a motorcycle as a weapon. I can't say enough good things about Devil May Cry 5, and overall if you like e.g. Platinum Games style action games (e.g. Bayonetta, Nier Automata, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance) or any of the earlier Devil May Cry games, then this title is worth checking out.

  LOVE DEATHS + ROBOTS is pretty good, though I definitely wouldn't call it rational (and it objectifies women a little too much for something coming out in 2019).

  It's a series of animated shorts, in different universes and graphic styles, going from ultra-stylized 2D to photorealistic 3D, exploring transhumanist concepts, in the most 18+ way possible (eg lots of gore and nudity). The story are fairly mature and some of them are memorable in a beautiful or haunting way.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I thought it was mostly ok, but kind of a waste. I don't tend to like anthologies, though. 

    Here's my ranking of the shorts:

    Pretty cool: Zima Blue, The Secret War, When the yogurt took over

    Pretty okay: Lucky 13, Three Robots, Ice Age

    Bad: Suits(awful dialogue), Sucker of Souls(just blergh), Alternate Histories(trite, unfunny), The Witness(bad despite the great visuals)
    ```

      > Bad: Suits(awful dialogue),

      You take that back *right now*.

    >(and it objectifies women a little too much for something coming out in 2019).

    Yeah. I definitely felt a bit of a disconnect in the series where I felt it had some feminist messages, like the rape victim who didn't let the rape define her in episode one, but then simultaneously had a lot of naked tits.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, the gender roles in this series feel like something that was written in early 2000s. Every woman is a prostitute, every man is a rapist; women are supposed to be desired, men are supposed to act on that desire, etc.

      I think it would have been more interesting and surprising if the honeypot had been a guy, and the rich aristocrat a lady, for instance.

      Some episodes felt like they would have worked a lot better as PG-13, but felt compelled to add some nudity/gore to fit in the series. (especially the yogurt one)
      ```

      - u/NewDarkAgesAhead:
        ```
        >  Every woman is a prostitute

        * the woman from "Sonnie's Edge" was a cage fighter, 
        * from "The Witness", a strip dancer
        * from "Suits", tower defenders / mecha operators / generic background  
        * from "Beyond the Aquila Rift", an eldritch alien in disguise (letâ€™s count as "n/a")
        * from "Good Hunting", a [Chinese mythological creature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huli_jing) that can entice men. 
        * from "Helping Hand", an astronaut
        * from "Lucky 13", a military pilot
        * from "Zima Blue", a journalist
        * from "Blind Spot", a truck pirate / hijacker
        * from "Ice Age", a girlfriend.

        Even if we count the assassin from "Sonnie's Edge", the main character from "The Witness", and the huli jing from "Good Hunting" as positive matches and make an excuse for hyperboles, thatâ€™s still far from making "every woman is a prostitute" a fair description of these series.

        >every man is a rapist

        And I feel this is even less accurate: from all the episodes I can remember rapists only in the mentioned background of "Sonnie's Edge", and in the "Good Hunting" â€” and that story was more a criticism against [colonial Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong) than men in general. I couldnâ€™t find any sources for judging how accurate this criticism was. I know ["comfort women"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women) were a thing during *Japanese* occupation, but nothing about abuse perpetrated while it was under British rule.

  Has anyone here researched the use of cannabinoids for pain relief? I suffer from a bit of chronic pain (old injuries from adventure sports, occasional headaches, muscle strains from lifting, etc.) and have found conventional approaches ineffective (otc NSAIDs, various treatments recommended by physical therapists, neurologists, etc., both prescribed medications and stretches, exercises, icing/POLICE, acupuncture, etc.). 

  I'm curious about exploring the medicinal applications of e.g. CBD oil, or THC, or both, etc. There's a dispensary a few blocks from where I live (in CA), but I haven't gone in yet, mostly out of concern as to the federal illegality -- I attend a public university, and part of my funding (e.g. an NSF-GRF) comes from federal sources, and I'm concerned if they find out they'll pull it or something. IDK. It might not even be effective -- I tried marijuana a handful of times in ugrad (some friends I'd go e.g. backpacking/climbing/snowboarding/kayaking/etc. with would share theirs) and it did almost nothing for me, psychoactively. But I figure several years later it might be worth trying again?

    Its not great for memory formation, so if you are a student, being constantly low-grade under its influence is going to be a negative. 

    Maybe not on net, if the pain is disrupting concentration, but it is not going to be without downsides. Also, *no driving or operating heavy machinery. Or you know, lab work.* 

    Mostly, medical weed is popular because its therapeutic window is bloody enormous, so you are not going to poison yourself, and it doubles as an appetite promoter, which is super helpful for a whole lot of patients who find it difficult to eat enough while ill. Its not super suited for people who need to manage pain while maintaining a clear head.

  This is a bit of munchkinning for real life.

  I work with dementia patients every day, and it's really striking home how *awful* of a set of diseases it is. If I were to dedicate my life to ending dementia/old age, how would I best go about it?

  I'm fairly intelligent (Usually in the top 5% of whatever I dedicate myself to, if the metrics are standardized and based around pattern recognition in some fashion) so I could at least contribute if I were to go the route of a scientist. I'm no prodigy or savant though, so I doubt I'd be able to make any historic breakthroughs. 

  However, I'm not sure that would be the best way to increase my utility. Would a politician whose goal is to end old age be more efficient via increasing funding of education and research? 

  Perhaps it'd be better to aim to create a utopia in other ways first (political revolution, ending world hunger etc.), and then have humanities goal of beating death simply be a knock on effect of that.

  Thoughts?

    At the end of the day, the quickest route to solving these "impossible" problems are almost always technology.
    ```

    - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
      ```
      Alright, so are you saying that becoming a software engineer is the best route? Or politics > funding for research etc.
      ```

      - u/GodSawMeAndLeftUs:
        ```
        Probably make money and invest in the right places. As one engineer you would only be able to do so much yourself. Other people want to achieve these goals too. Find them and give them the necessary resources. This is all much easier said than done but when we are comparing it to creating utopias and shaping governments I think making money and investing would be more efficient.

          Just a little bit of info according to our already wealthy-and-disease-ending-crusader Bill Gates our biggest problem with Alzheimers is the following:

          "The only problem where I donâ€™t yet see a clear path forward yet is how to develop more efficient ways to recruit patients for clinical trials. Without a simple and reliable diagnostic for Alzheimerâ€™s, itâ€™s hard to find eligible people early enough in the diseaseâ€™s progression who can participate in trials. It can take years to enroll enough patients. If we could find a way to pre-screen participants, we could start new trials more quickly.

          But there is so much momentum in other areasâ€”scientific tools, better diagnostics, improved access to dataâ€”that as long as we can solve the recruitment problem, I am confident that we will make substantial progress in the next decade or two."
