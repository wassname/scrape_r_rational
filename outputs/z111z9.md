## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Rest in peace, [Greg Bear.](https://news.yahoo.com/sci-fi-novelist-greg-bear-170000207.html) _Blood Music_ and _Petra_ had an enormous impact on my life. Reading science fiction short stories was an escape for me, but Greg Bear's works horrified and bothered me. I didn't sleep for two days after I read _Blood Music_ as a kid. Now I look back on it fondly as one of the best and most important things I ever read.

  Here's the novel-length version of Blood Music which is also very near to my heart, despite shaking out to be a very different story. https://archive.org/details/bloodmusic00bear

    I don't think i knew there was a short story version of blood music, thanks. And agreed, it's a sad loss. He wrote a lot of really great science fiction

  I highly recommend a fic that's not really mentioned on this sub: [Aioka, a Career Genin](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14266725/chapters/32905374).

  Remember the Naruto trope where teams who fail their Jounin sensei test aren't send back to the academy, but instead to the dead-end canon fodder "genin corps" with no prospects for advancement?

  "Aioka, a Career Genin" is a Naruto fic about an OC - Aioka, who fails her test and ends up exactly there. She then works to overhaul the whole genin corps from the inside out and make it a respectable unit.

  Dead, but it has enough material to be worth reading, and got to a point where the overhaul is more or less finished.

  [*Whirlpool Queen, Maelstrom King*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/22031137/chapters/52577893) is a Naruto x ASOIAF fic that takes a pretty dark but realistic look at the ninja world. 

  Basically, Sansa gets reincarnated as Naruto's twin sister, and because she is (mentally) older, manages to make contact with the nine tails as a child. She's also aware of what's going on around her, so it able to see what adults are really like when they let their guard down around children.

  It basically calls out ninja for being trained amoral mercenaries, and the villages as brainwashing/grooming kids who want to become ninja to be absolutely loyal, regardless of whether an order is moral or not. The Hokage is not a nice, grandfatherly old man, but a cunning and manipulative one, who rewrote history to represent himself in the best light.

  It's really good, updates have been sporadic lately, but there's 206k words written, so enough to take a few days to work through.
  ```

  - u/degenerate__weeb:
    ```
    I enjoyed that read. The only plot gripe I had was >!Sansa's unwillingness to learn at the Academy.!< It feels like the author wanted >!the root/Danzo arc and it was the most 'reasonable' Watsonian way for her to be kidnapped. Given how pragmatic this Sansa is portrayed, I figured she'd know that the Narutoverse has 'might makes right' as the default. Being able to defend herself/use chakra is almost a prerequisite for enacting the change she wants.!<

    I have a [rated list of Worm/Gamer crossovers](https://www.reddit.com/user/ahasuerus_isfdb/comments/ue51d7/worm_fan_fic_ratings_gamer_crossovers/).

    On the Naruto side, there is [Sleight Advantage](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sleight-advantage-naruto-si-old-version.37698/). It's at least rational-adjacent, but I wasn't a big fan of the execution. [Naruto: The Game of Life](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10973590/1/Naruto-The-Game-of-Life) has been popular lately, but it doesn't quite make my recommended list.

    Ryuugi's [RWBY/Gamer crossover "The Games We Play"](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play.306381/) is also popular, but I lost interest part way through "Disk Four". The MC's internal monologue was very wordy and often tedious; the plot felt decidedly YA. Nonetheless, I would recommend trying the first few "Disks" to see if you like it.

    Two of the most often recommended  pieces here are 

    [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) by prolific and prodigious Alexander Wales, starts as high fantasy isekai. 

    [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/) which is an ero/pornographic work. You'll need an account on the website to read; best endorsement is the depths of recursion on the authors signature: 

    >"This is more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest." --- everyone reading The Erogamer.

    >"This is way more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest, even taking that statement into account."

    >"It really needs a third layer, because even with those two warnings it was way more in-depth than I expected of an erotic piece of fiction, even ignoring that it was a quest" [from here](

      I have read WtC and erotica isn't really my thing but thanks for the recommendations.
      ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Are you okay with erotica? [The Gamer](https://chyoa.com/story/The-Gamer%2C-Chyoa-edition.12004) on chyoa.com is fanfiction of the manwha with different characters but similar setup of having the paranormal world and the Abyss and whatnot. The only route that I liked was by neo_kenka, although it's incomplete and on hiatus. It does some interesting things with the moral implications of sapient dungeon monsters. The powerset is explored very well and is very interesting. Not very rational, and in terms fetishes it does some pretty strong stuff, although I wouldn't call it extreme.

    [What's HP? Does it taste good?](https://fanfiction.net/s/13777231/1/What-s-HP-Does-it-taste-good) is a Gamer / OnePiece crossover that treats the Gamer half with exactly the amount of respect that it deserves.

    [This is the Run](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12372074/1/This-Is-the-Run) is a gamified RWBY crossover. Not actually The Gamer as in the webtoon, more like 'gamer' as in corner glitches and noclipping through the world. Might not be explicitly what you're looking for, but is still a lot of fun.
    ```

    - u/LaziIy:

      I will check them out , does the former require being familiar with one piece plot?

      - u/lo4952:

        Hmm, maybe kinda? A few of the jokes reference canon events, so they might not land without the context.

    My favorite is Paragamer, which is finished, but feels a little unfinished to me. It's really small scale and low power for a lot of the fic, which is kind of a seling point for me. Warm, but in a different city, and doesn't do stations of canon or any of that stuff. If you haven't read Worm, you just need to read some wiki entry on how people get powers and what the endbringers are, the basics, it's mostly not relevant.

      There are like nine tense changes in the first chapter, does the writing get better?
      ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        As I recall, it got somewhat better after a few chapters. However, I dropped the fic halfway through 1.7 for a number of reasons, including:

        * The MC starts out as a rather unpleasant person. There is some indication that he is getting a bit better at the whole "human" thing, but the progress is very slow and I didn't feel like spending a significant amount of time inside his head.
        * The MC as well as people around him act in hard to credit ways. For example, the MC knows computer games inside and out, yet he fails to notice that he has a limited number of “skill slots”. He keeps grabbing mediocre skills without considering the fact that at the rate he is going he will be running into a hard limit in a matter of days or weeks.
        ```

      - u/Revlar:
        ```
        It does. The main appeal of the fic is the teen grunge focus. If you're not into that urban fantasy low-life wavelength, it's not going to do anything for you.
        ```

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        As I recall, the first chapter is notably bad and not relevant. That's the part where he's at a gamer contest or something? Pretty annoying chapter. I'd say if you think the writing is bad a few chapters in you can drop it, though. Just skim the first chapter. I wouldn't say this story is great line by line writing, if that's a priority, but it's about median for stuff recommended here, which is to say, pretty bad.

  Something like Bobiverse from Dennis E Taylor. 

  Im writing a similar book to his because I’ve been wanting to scratch that itch for a while now. But curious to read what others think is similar.

  My take on the closest stories to it are “Children of Time”, “Rendezvous with Rama“, and maybe “Ringworld” but then I can’t think of anything else that’s mainly focused on exploring space.

    *[Chrysalis](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/55v9e1/chrysalis/)* by BeaverFur and *[Post Human](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human)* by J P Koenig both are in the genre of "mind upload/ai survives human apocalypse and then does von-neumann space colonization things" and decently well written. 

    Similar, but not quite in the genre is *[The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/)* which is also good

        *Last Angel* is more like a Space Hulk story in a *Mass Effect*/*Halo* space opera setting. Still really good, not macro exploration.

    You might find some of the Greg Egan books scratch your itch - Diaspora in particular is all about space exploration.

      >Diaspora

      It goes to show just how a cover can influence your decision. Audible recommended this to me a few times, but I overlooked it because I didn't think much of the colour. 

      Just *wishlisted* the audio version.
      ```

        Greg Egan is on my autobuy list these days, regardless of cover, subject or anything else :)

        (Others on the list: Adrian Tchaikovsky, Becky Chambers, Mary Robinette Kowal, Naomi Novik, Lois McMaster Bujold...)

    I was about to recommend your own work to you [A New Eden](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59458/a-new-eden-sci-fi-ai-aliens-space-mystery-thriller) but I guess that’s out. 


    It’s tough to find stuff that has both the scale of Bobiverse and Children of Time, but there’s a few things that might scratch that itch.

    First: [Vaccum Diagrams](https://www.amazon.com/Vacuum-Diagrams-Stephen-Baxter/dp/0061059048) by Stephen Baxter is one that I think fits the bill pretty well. I haven’t read the rest of the Xeelee sequence, but this book is full of short stories that span ~5 million years and multiple galaxies. I wouldn’t say its rational, but it is self aware about that, but I won’t spoil the ending. 


    I was also thinking of [House of Suns](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0819VSLF9/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1669052724&sr=8-1) by Allistair Reynolds but I’m not too sure if it fits the exploration aspect of your reqest. 


    Otherwise I’m not too sure, but I haven’t read a ton of sci-fi recently, but I’m sure theres a bunch of stuff I’ve missed, plus theres a few books that fit that exploration genre that I just can’t remember or find.
    ```

    - u/Menilik:
      ```
      Aww thank you - I feel honoured that you included it. 

      I LOVED House of Suns. It had so many awesome concepts and ideas. I still think about >!Star Dams!<all the time.

      I've not heard of Vaccume Diagrams before. But I'm a fan of your other recommendations. So I'm adding it to my reading list now.
      ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Since you mention Baxter downthread, Long Earth? The first book or two are earthbound, but I know at least some of the later stuff is space exploration, unless *Long Mars* is a lie. Plus, building specialty craft to explore parallel universes can’t be more than one step removed.

    If you haven’t read Vinge’s *A Fire Upon the Deep,* do it now. The overall plot is not technically space exploration so much as a quest; the actual circumstances with the various cultures, plus of course the Tines, fit really well. Best exploration of alternate intelligence that I’ve seen outside rational work.
    ```

    - u/Menilik:
      ```
      I was recommended the long earth at my local bookstore because of the books I told them I enjoy. I couldn’t get into it so didn’t read the rest in the series.

      Re A Fire Upon the Dee. Not heard of that one. Going to check it out now.
      ```

- u/ValuableBuffalo:
  ```
  Does anyone have any recommendations for books (fantasy, science-fiction, whichever) which prominently feature puzzles? something like Crescat, perhaps?

  Bonus points if the puzzles are actually solvable. I've been on the lookout for books like these, but I haven't found much, except, perhaps, 'the man who counted'.
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    I recommend [Meanwhile](https://zarfhome.com/meanwhile/) to the fullest extent I can. Thanks for reminding me it exists, it's a perfect holiday gift for someone I know.

    [Fleep](http://www.shigabooks.com/fleep.php) by the same author is also quite good and you can read it free online.
    ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    Maybe you need to leave the comfort zone of books and try mystery visual novels. Zero Escape, Somnium Files, Danganronpa, Umineko, even Phoenix Wright all feature puzzles and riddles in increasingly diegetic ways. Some games like Professor Layton are essentially puzzle games with some barebones justification tying them to the story, but I don't think that's what you're looking for.
    ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Neal Stephenson. *Cryptonomicon,* most literally. I don’t think the reader gets to solve the plot ahead of time, but it absolutely includes ciphers, riddles, information theory, etc. *Anathem* probably works, too. There are chapters where character just sit down and try to work out logic puzzles about dimensionality. He’s good at including visual puzzles in the text!
    ```
