## What would an early society's mythic story of the origin of the universe/nature/etc that happened to be 100% accurate look like?

### Post:

Myths present narrative etiologies that usually have physical and metaphysical assumptions.  Supposing all of those assumptions were commensurate with the best of contemporary science, what would the tale of creation as that people would communicate it look like?.  What language does a primitive priestess use to describe the primordial singularity, cosmic inflation, the creation of the fundamental forces, etc?  Likewise, could evolution and natural selection be mythified through anthropromorphized gods?  Heat death?  

somewhat relevant bit of classic Asimov:

  We are early society! ;) Remember to dig some weird shit into ground for future generations to find.

    I mean, not to get on your case, but we probably leave plenty of weird shit in the ground for people to find already. Just imagine someone digging up a landfill.

  I recommend a story by Scott Alexander called [The Goddess of Everything Else](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/).

  Perhaps take inspiration from that post and base it on how Christians and Muslims say that their scriptures are actually in line with scientific discoveries (at least that's what Muslims say, I'm not sure about Christians). The claim is that you just need to translate the stories correctly and read them from the perspective that the goal was to inspire the listener by showing them the majesty of God rather than give them a precise science or history lesson 

  Examples: 
  - The "seven days" is a mistranslation and it was actually seven eras. Also, seven (at least in Arabic) is a word that is also used to mean "many" instead of exactly seven. 
  - God created everything and all life on this planet, but it doesn't say *how* he created them. Evolution & big bang are perfectly valid means for Him to use

  More esoteric examples you may want to use:
  - Calling mountains "pegs" (like tent pegs) since a big slice goes deep into the Earth anchoring that area
  - Life created in water before it was created on land

  The table of contents of this book may offer further inspiration:

  You may find more examples if you look into other religions as well

  Something I wrote from a while back:

  From the beginning to the end is the arrow of time, its head all that will be, its shaft all that is, its tail all that was. 

  With the first span time created all the things that was, is, and will be.

  With the second span time created the void, and all the enormity thereof; and the void swallowed up all that was, is, and will be; and this we call space.

  With the third span time created the great lights; but the void swallowed that up too, so that all its light, all but one, is but a pittance against the darkness of the night sky; and these we call the stars; and the one light not swallowed by the void illuminates the day, and this we call the sun.

  With the fourth span time created the worlds, worlds of air, and water, and earth; and this world among them, made of air and water and earth, which we call the earth.

  With the fifth span time planted the tree of life, the world tree; and Might its guardian; and along the arrow of time the tree of life grew from seed to sprout to sapling; and it grew branches beyond counting, its branches cover the world; and at the ends of each living branch grows the fruit of the tree of life. They are the leaves, that strive against each other to suck up the light; and the vines, that strive against each other to suck up the life. And so, under the care of Might, the branches of the tree of life fight a war as old as life itself. And now the tree of life is old and vast, and filled with dead branches.

  With the sixth span time created man and woman as a branch of the tree of life, an offshoot from another branch. All of humanity is this branch, unique among all the branches as the branches are all unique. This is our branch, and so what happens with it matters to humanity.

  This is a story of the sixth span. It is not the story of the sixth span, for a span is long beyond memory, space vast beyond envisioning, things deep beyond conception. The story of history cannot be fully told, for it is of stories beyond counting; and so this is not the story. But it is a story.

    If we're proposing alternative locations, surely this question is a better fit for Wednesday Worldbuilding/Writing?

        I would say it's asking about how one part of the worldbuilding - the mythology of the inhabitants - could be done with regards to some part of the worldbuilding that has been done - the physics. Seeing how a lot of worldbuilding is about fleshing out or connecting established ideas, I would say this is a downright typical worldbuilding question.

  I can think of two ways of doing it.

  One explains all the stuff that the primitive tribes care about in a more or less correct manner while leaving space for science to fill out the rest. It never contradicts the correct order, but often leaves gaps with vague phrases about stuff happening over an indeterminate period of time.

  The other would be the spinning of a full creation myth. To keep people at all interested you may have to anthropomorphize things like Quarks and other particles, but you make a chapter for each major turning point that leads from the big bang to the birth of humanity and you phrase it in a way that makes it clear to future scientists that it all maps almost one to one to their own discoveries.

  Have you read https://qntm.org/structure ? It describes a signal that encodes the laws of physics and metaphysics within this universe. Perhaps the priestly classes don't have knowledge of the order of creation in human language. Instead, they have a Song, which has been passed down from one celebrant to the next in the finest of oral tradition, where the Song encodes something akin to Fine Structure's Eka script. Celebrants sufficiently in tune with the cosmos can discover new syllables to append to the Song, with error correction coming from the fact that any layperson can listen to the celebrant's singing and intuit whether the sung song is truly the Song. 

  Or in Tolkien terms: The Ainulindalë was a metaphor for creation, and priests can sound out the song sung by Eru Ilúvatar. Incorrect singing is blatantly obvious.

  I don't know if any such account can be 100% accurate. Our current divulgative scientific texts aren't 100% accurate; in order to describe the complexities of cosmology in a way that can be grasped by the human mind intuitively, without advanced understanding of the maths involved, they need to make a good deal of simplifications.

  As for less than 100% accurate, but still far more than the various accounts of Gods creating the world... I was always impressed by how close to home some Greek philosophers seemed to hit. Anaximander talked about *apéiron*, a shapelessness from which the cosmos emerged with things differentiating themselves. He also believed that many worlds existed, and many inhabited, and that they died and were born all the time. That sounds... pretty bang on, if you think about it, for one dude who just gazed at the sky and thought about it really hard some 2500 years ago. Then Empedocles, who said the universe was dominated by two forces he called Love and Strife, one trying to bring it together, the other to tear it apart, and that it cycled eternally between the victory of one and the other, with life possible only in the middle, where the balance was such that complex things could exist. And then of course there's Democritos, who outright didn't give a fuck and imagined and described atoms, to the point of coining the word, because he could. Though TBF the closest thing to what he called 'atoms' would really be electrons and quarks, aka fundamental particles. I imagine such a myth would probably sound something like this, using metaphors and analogies to what we can understand that try to evoke the general sense of what is being talked about.
