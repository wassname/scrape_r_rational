  ```
  Is it just me or is Dizzy about to save Nic's life out of spite?
  ```

  - u/yagsuomynona:
    ```
    or is she the host for the other demon (as Nic suspects exists at the very end) and being lured?
    ```

- u/sparkc:
  ```
  I guess the demon loving mage sent from the Royal College is a prime candidate for demon host number two.

  Not a big fan of the ‘actually I kept tabs on every single thing Nic did for five years’ reveal.
  ```

- u/Golden_Magician:
  ```
  Thanks for the chapter!

  Two thoughts:

  1) Dizzy strongly reminds me of Bakugo from My Hero Academia, for some reason. 

  2) Shit just got real!
