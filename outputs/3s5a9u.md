  How can naruto's every strategy revolve around a technique he learned within the past 6 months? 

  Canon ninja being one trick ponies as a whole makes sense narratively, but not rationally, imo. You'd just be setting yourself up for hard counters, every 1v1 would be a game of rock paper scissors, like Tenten vs Temari. 

  With regards to rational!naruto, he's had years to theorize and test tacticts, stealth, deception, etc. vs. ANBU through his pranking. So when he doesn't try to diversify his arsenal and continues to rely solely on shadow clones(even if he uses them really, really creatively), well, that just seems weird and out of character. 

  Though to be fair, I suppose he can feel like nothing so far warrants revealing whatever he has hidden up his sleeve.

    I suspect that's more a reflection of Genin limitations. IIRC, it was meant to be a big surprise that Sasuke could do non-Academy ninjutsu *at all* during the bell test. Expecting the Genin to not only know multiple techniques within their specialisation, but multiple *kinds* of technique, may be unreasonable given the limited time they've had to train. Of course, some Genin, like the older and supposedly elite Temari, have no excuse that I can see. Meanwhile, Jōnin appear to have much more diverse abilities - even Maito Gai has some upper-tier techniques that blur the line between taijutsu and ninjutsu.

    > With regards to rational!naruto, he's had years to theorize and test tacticts, stealth, deception, etc. vs. ANBU through his pranking. So when he doesn't try to diversify his arsenal and continues to rely solely on shadow clones(even if he uses them really, really creatively), well, that just seems weird and out of character. 

    I think there are two answers to that. First, *everything* he does with shadow clones is a product of his experience and training. Shadow clones in human form are just him in greater numbers. Shadow clones in non-human form are just summonable tools. The capabilities of the Shadow Clone Technique in his hands are thus nothing more or less than a direct manifestation of everything he's learned. To him, it's less of a ninjutsu and more of a force multiplier on *himself*.

    Second, I think you are overstating the case when it comes to him vs ANBU. He didn't make them, or other high-skill ninja, his primary targets by any means (there's only so much trouble the Hokage's intervention could get him out of), nor was he specifically trying to develop ability as a ninja through his pranking, or to accomplish his pranks in particularly ninja-like ways.

  Hah! Naruto and Saskuke are such scrubs. I was kind of surprised by how easily they were taken out. Perhaps I should reread and recalibrate my expectations.

  Stream-of-consciousness reaction to one confusing bit:

  >>And then the initial wave of silence from the Nova Thrust cancelled out the wave of sound from the Death Knell.

  >>Sasuke promptly shoved both ninja off-balance, and Naruto used the window of opportunity to summon more shadow clones. The rest was history.

  >Whaat? No way, that's-

  >>-o-

  >>A throwing needle zoomed out of the tree above Sakura's head and impacted in the ground between Naruto and Sasuke. There was the faint ring of a bell, and then both stopped what they were doing and stood still as if in a stupor.

  >Ohh, now I get it!

  >>She walked over to her unconscious teammates and pulled something out of her pocket.

  >>"Sound-brand smelling salts, the one-stop solution for all your idiot-awakening needs from the best chemist in the business. Now with bonus splitting headache for dumbasses who forget to combo-test their new techniques."

  >Wait, what?

  Suggested clarification: adding a short description to "impacted the ground between Naruto and Sasuke" along the lines of 'near the downed Sound ninja' or 'while they breathed a sigh of relief' to establish that the scenebreak doesn't flash back a few seconds.

  Does this
  >  It was also, since it burned pure chakra, completely silent.

  make sense with this
  > The vacuum only lasted for an instant before the air rushed back in, but by that time the fireball had been starved of oxygen just long enough to dissipate.

  ?

    Fire needs fuel, oxygen and a spark. Looks like the chakra is the fuel, and the oxygen is the oxygen.
    ```

    - u/4t0m:
      ```
      So in normal fire the burning of fuel makes sound but the consumption of oxygen does not?

    Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

    In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

    Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

    “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

    The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

    Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

    Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

    L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  Ah yes. Players and their levels. Maddening

  Of course if you were a second level player you knew I'd talk about this and came into the thread just to hear of it, but since I'm third level...
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    Actually, I'm at least fourth, and came into this thread in order to read your analysis of this situation.

  >Plus, if we weren't sure before, Miss Bubblegum Head there just confirmed it for us.

  >Sakura went pink, unfortunately making the nickname even more appropriate.

  >...

  >But the instant annihilation of Naruto's shadow clone army wasn't the worst part. The worst part was that the wave also popped Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura.

  So it was Naruto disguised clone who got embarrassed in Sakuras place?
  ```

  - u/Velorien:
    ```
    After Naruto's portrayal of her, Sakura's chances of forgiving him seem more remote than ever.
