  With how Secret worked (gaining power by saying/doing things with hidden meanings) I was thinking of him as the I-Know-Something-You-Don't-Know. Interesting to see that expanded on.

  Also and more importantly, OT3 confirmed.

      One true threesome

  Putting your sister in a room of a dead person, oh yes. I would have don the same.

  Did James mean that Anesh was madly in love with Alanna, or that he was madly in love with Anesh?
  ```

  - u/reaper7876:
    ```
    Yes.

    E: More seriously, he meant that he was madly in love with both Alanna and Anesh. Him fucking things up by telling Anesh that Anesh is in love with Alanna isn't really a coherent concern to have.

  ```
  Does the main character's calm and secretive initial reactions, i.e. explore without telling anyone or looking it up online, or really reacting to something completely crazy happening as if it was a minor job opening explained?
  ```
