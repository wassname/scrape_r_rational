## When the needs of the medium outweigh the needs of the rational

### Post:

**TL;DR:** The presentation format of fiction puts constraints on possible plots, especially in visual and serial media. For example, characters in movies take off their disguises inside the enemy base so you can see the actors' faces, not because the writers are stupid. Like cardboard stage props, the obvious unreality is meant to be tacitly ignored by the audience. Writing has fewer and subtler constraints, such as the serialization and well-definedness of a character's mental state, but I'm not sure how this affects plots in writing and I'm curious to see what people think.

\---

I was thinking lately about why most fiction, especially in visual media, has plot devices that are obviously stupid when thought about for more than thirty seconds. I have come to the conclusion that it's mostly not because the writers don't see the mistake. This is a case of competing optimization processes producing [inadequate equilibria](https://equilibriabook.com/), or at least different equilibria than what is expected here on /r/rational.

**My thesis is this:** many (perhaps most) stupid things that happen in \[otherwise good\] fiction are the inevitable result of the constraints imposed by the medium and genre.

This becomes very apparent in film. For example:

1. Why do characters who sneak into enemy bases in disguise remove their disguises as soon as they get inside? Why not leave on the disguise to avoid discovery? It's not because the writers are stupid. It's because film is a visual medium that requires you to *see* the faces of the main characters in order to empathize with them. Having them leave on their disguise hides their face and makes the drama less satisfying.
2. Why are most movie aliens just humans in masks who somehow speak English? It's because for aliens to be compelling characters, you need to empathize with them, which requires them to be as similar to the audience as possible while still being alien.
3. Why do important main characters personally go on every dangerous mission? Why not delegate to someone whose death wouldn't utterly cripple the cause of the good guys? It's because you need to see the main characters in action. You came to this film to see your favorite actors doing interesting things, not to watch random extras execute their orders. The medium demands that main characters get every second of screen time they can, which means they go on all the apparent suicide missions, no matter how unrealistic this is.
4. Why are most cop and military characters utterly unprofessional and insubordinate? Because you came to see character drama, so you're going to get character drama.
5. Why do heroes who successfully knock a villain unconscious inevitably ignore the villain's body, thus allowing the villain to simply wake up and continue causing problems? Probably because the writer wants certain action scenes to happen (that's why you bought the ticket, to see action scenes), and there really isn't a better way to get to the action than to allow unnecessary problems to build up.
6. Why is it a universal unspoken principle in fiction that hitting someone in the head is simply an off button with no long term consequences? Because otherwise 95% of action movies would end with the main character dying in a coma from brain hemorrhaging.
7. Why do slasher movie characters never carry any guns, and split up at the first chance they get? It's because you asked for a slasher movie and you're going to get a damn slasher movie. (This, like point 5, shows the constraining effects of genre in addition to medium)

Constraints are even more apparent in the medium of television. For example, let's look at House M.D. In every episode, House gets a strange medical case. Then, 1/3 of the way through the episode, the team makes a diagnosis and proceeds with treatment. The treatment seems to be working, but then the patient gets worse and worse, until House has a brilliant insight and solves the case. Now, you would *think* that after 50 times of this happening, House would realize that his track record for accuracy of initial diagnosis is literally 0%. His first instinct has \*almost literally never\* been right (this is even lampshaded in the show with the recurring line "It's never lupus"). But of course, within the confines of the show, House can never notice this pattern, because the only reason people watch is because they like the episode formula. That's the fundamental conceit. Needs of the medium strike again.

Take another show that I've been re-watching lately, Stargate: Atlantis. The show tries to strike a balance between a season long plot arc and individual episode arcs. So here's a common episode formula. 1) The main characters find a new interesting planet (it's always main characters and never less important subordinate characters, as per the third point above). 2) They find something unusual and go to investigate without calling a backup team first. 3) They get in trouble and have to be rescued. Now, you'd *think* that after the nth time of being captured by hostile inhabitants, they'd learn to always radio for a backup team to establish a presence of overwhelming force before investigating anything (it's not like they couldn't do that; they have lots of personnel and far better technology than most people they visit). But the fact is, it's difficult to have individual episode arcs if everyone is smart. In the medium of a serial television show, every episode must have conflict, danger, and a climax where the characters barely make it out. Eventually, the only way for this to happen is to just have a fundamental background rule that characters must always investigate things without backup. This sort of thing happens in most serial television I've seen. I'm not sure there is a way around it. Needs of the medium.

The general pattern here is Willing Suspension of Disbelief. It's analogous to ignoring how fake-looking the stage props are in a live play. Of course they look fake; that just comes with the medium. Of course you ignore idiot balls in serial television; the format requires characters who never learn. The difference between good writing and bad writing in this case is not so much the presence of idiot balls, but whether or not they are so blatant that they take away the audience's immersion.

What I'm less sure about is how this extends to writing. Written works have much more freedom of worldbuilding, and are not bound by the aforementioned visual constraints, nor by time limit constraints. Sure, the story must have arcs to be compelling, and certain genres like action and horror have their own fundamental tropes, but in general, writers are free to give much better justifications for things. (Characters are often irrational, but that is simply realistic, and orthogonal to the question at hand). In the medium of writing, are there any constraints analogous to the visual need to see the main character's face in a movie?

The only thing I can think of is character psychology and internal monologues. Writing requires you to serialize a person's complex thought process into a linear grammatical sentence. Although many people have internal monologues, these are not necessarily coherent sentences in people's heads, and sometimes do not involve words at all. I also suspect that many written characters know themselves better than real people. That is, they tend to know and act on their own goals and preferences at an unrealistic rate. It's not common to see characters who do the equivalent of staying at home and watching TV because they can't decide which movie they want to go to. Or at least, I don't know of fiction where things like this happen. When writing a character from the inside, there is a general pressure to make their mental state more sharply defined than is realistic, so that the reader isn't bored with descriptions of vagueness and indecision.

At least, I *think* this is the case. In good writing, the effect is very subtle, perhaps to the point of not mattering. What do you guys think? Are there ways that the medium of writing fundamentally affects plots, above and beyond genre constraints?

  If you include randos he treats at the clinic in 10 seconds with one glance at them, his accuracy is pretty damn high. If you also make a sensible assumption that not every patient House treats with his whole team is shown in an episode, you could figure that you are only shown the most "interesting" cases, while behavior of the characters is tailored towards an "average" case. People in-world have no way to guess if a case is going to be episode-worthy except in retrospect, so they can't change their behavior to reflect it. Overall, this hardly should impact your suspension of disbelief. Other issues in the show might, but not this one.

  That is _very_ generous.

  Medium constraints and willing suspension of disbelief are valuable concepts, but this reads like an attempt to shovel every shortcoming of fiction ever into the "medium constraint" pile. It is a true (and sometimes useful) observation that various incentives and constraints affect storytelling, and it's certainly a _better_ model than "plot holes are caused by evil typewriter goblins who hate consistency". It is not a blanket defense against criticism. Stretching the concept as far as is done here, it comes off as "Have you considered that writing good fiction might sometimes be difficult?"

  ----
  We might, to begin with, consider my favorite example of an acceptable concession to medium constraints, Aliens Speaking English. This has several important properties.

  * It has no bearing on the plot. Unless Earth-humans are involved, which they every so often aren't, (see Star Wars) it doesn't matter what language the aliens are speaking, so long as they're all speaking the same language, which is reasonable enough if there's shared history.

  * There's a clear in-universe/medium divide. We can easily imagine the exact same events transpiring, except with the characters speaking Klingon, and then having English dubbed over it. That is, what we're seeing is not what's happening, and the difference is obvious and specific.

  * Going against the constraint is hard. While some subset of sci-fi purists might prefer aliens speaking Klingon with subtitles, it's actively detrimental for much of the audience.

  * Going against the constraint does not add much. While some subset of sci-fi purists might prefer aliens speaking Klingon with subtitles, it adds little to nothing for the overwhelming majority of the audience.

  These are, I think, useful heuristics for when something gets a pass as a medium constraint. Less-than-exact stage props similarly tick off all criteria - they're not plot-relevant, the audience can picture how it's supposed to look, and most people accept that it's not that important.

  Most of the examples given here fail to have some or any of these properties. All of them (save part of 2, and 1 if they're not discovered) have significant bearing on the plot. None of them (except sometimes 2) let us picture the same story being told with the constraints removed - if you replaced the unprofessional, insubordinate characters with professional ones, you would have a different story.

  Going against the constraint is sometimes hard, but not always. To borrow your terminology, these limits _really_ aren't fundamental.

  * A competent villain will have failsafes and plans B that allow them to come back for round 2 without the main characters being incompetent.

  * If you have one or two episodes where the initial diagnosis is correct, and the conflict comes from some other source, and imply that this actually happens off-screen like 90% of the time, it's just rarely the focus of an episode - then your initial diagnosis accuracy is suddenly 90%.

  * Why are the main characters being sent on the dangerous mission? Presumably, because you wrote the story about someone who's _supposed_ to go on dangerous missions. Either this is someone in-universe unimportant (they'll still be important to the story, of course, since they're the viewpoint character) or the dangerous mission is important enough to warrant sending important people.

  * Why are the characters being unprofessional and insubordinate? Is it impossible to write character drama about competent people, or aren't you a good enough writer to do it believably?

  Finally, these are not meaningless changes, and stories are almost universally better for surpassing them. Nobody really cares that aliens speak English in Star Wars, or that sword prop #6 could have been better crafted. The fact that everybody is incompetent, nothing makes sense and the plot hinges on everyone making stupid decisions? Best as I can tell, people _notice_.

  People might feel more invested in a character drama if they feel conflicted themselves, as opposed to doing their best to ignore the obvious resolution or stupid "wait I can explain" gimmick used to make any of it happen. Browse through /r/AskReddit and you will find _pages and pages_ of complaints to this effect. They might actually be impressed if the villain pulls escapes as daring as the heroes'. "Lower decks" series are currently showing promise.

  Us at /r/rational notice it more than most, that's a given, and maybe that's why we're somehow in the position of defending the ideas of "disliking plot holes" or "being annoyed with incompetent characters" to the entire rest of the internet. We are not, however, a statistical aberration - we're simply at the far end of the bell curve. Lots and lots of people are annoyed with plot holes and incompetent characters, and wish writers would wisen up to the idea of working around them, or improving them.

  Evidently, enough people are satisfied with stories where all these issues are omnipresent and glaring to generate an endless torrent of it. It bears repeating, however - the fact that "90% of fiction is crap due to market forces" does not change the fact that 90% of fiction is crap. Pointing out these forces, while sometimes helpful, is not in itself something that should change our opinion of these works.

  (And since nobody has said it, I do have to point out that very rarely will you see us earnestly complaining about the plot holes in the latest summer blockbuster, except perhaps as a self-aware intellectual exercise. We are, largely, aware that most of the market is catering to people other than ourselves, and if we sound upset it, it's because it means there's less fiction we do enjoy.)

    Perhaps I tried to ask too much of my bracketed statement "\[otherwise good\]" in the thesis. I added that at the end when I realized that my post might be construed as explaining *all* bad fiction in terms of medium constraints. Anyway, I think there are three types of effects here: medium constraints, genre constraints, and plain bad writing. The interaction of all three things produces most fiction. The numbered points actually deal with a mix of medium and genre, and I should have been clearer about that. Some constraints are pure medium (like #1), some are pure genre (like #7), and some are a mix. 

    >the fact that "90% of fiction is crap due to market forces" does not change the fact that 90% of fiction is crap. Pointing out these forces, while sometimes helpful, is not in itself something that should change our opinion of these works

    Well, I think it should change your opinion of *some* works. Sometimes things that look like bad writing are there for other reasons, and with a shift in mindset, you can enjoy the work for what it is. Do I wish that more fiction tried to hold itself to higher standards and creatively work around its constraints? Absolutely, which is why I frequent this subreddit. But a lot of fiction is good for what it is in spite of not doing this.

    >To borrow your terminology, these limits *really* aren't fundamental

    After factoring in budget, time limits, premise, story arcs, actor contracts, etc., some of them pretty much are. Suppose, for a moment, that there really is no one besides your main characters to go on dangerous missions. Eventually your main characters will go on dozens of missions in which they barely make it out alive (premise and story arc constraints - the story needs excitement or it is boring). Probabilistically, they should be dead after twenty iterations of this, because no one can win a coin toss 20 times. Thus any kind of story where characters are exposed to lots of risks requires a suspension of disbelief by necessity, and essentially all rationalist fiction has to bend over backwards awkwardly trying to find a way around this problem (HPMOR had prophecies, r!Animorphs has gods tipping the balance, Mother of Learning resets every month, Worm shoehorned in like 5 different worldbuilding reasons why everyone hadn't already killed each other, etc.)
    ```

      ```
      > r!Animorphs has gods tipping the balance

      The biggest factor in protagonist survival in r!Animorphs is that the protagonists avoid fights a lot. The characters get caught in less than ~10 lethal fights over the entire series, half of them planned in advance with the odds stacked in their favor.

      But yeah, for the other half, the story kind of goes the extra mile to keep them alive, with (so far):

      - Friendly super-powerful pacifist robots.
      - Healing through the morphing power.
      - *Resurrection* through the morphing power.
      - Two literal *divine interventions*.

      And yet, r!Animorphs is on the realistic side. Like, if I read about their experience on a Wikipedia page, I wouldn't be *too* surprised most of them survived the war.

      Compared to Worm, Pact, HPMoR or PGtE, it's pretty conservative.
      ```

      - u/LieGroupE8:
        ```
        If I wrote r!Animorphs I'm not sure I would have included the gods or the Chee, but then again, I'm not sure how much of a choice there was, given the nature of Visser Three.

        Anyway, I didn't intend to bash any rationalist fiction with my comment... I like all the works I listed there, and it's fun to see the lengths authors go to in order to get around the probability problem. And I will never not love r!Animorphs with all my heart.

      Alternate story possibility: very large initial cast, winnowing down ruthlessly.  Something something "the story of Wedge Antilles or Mad-Eye Moody is everyone around them dying and them just being random survivors until eventually they actually got good."  c.f. Game of Thrones, maybe?

      >I think there are three types of effects here: medium constraints, genre constraints, and plain bad writing. The interaction of all three things produces most fiction.

      More importantly, they are relative, and I don't think you can consider them as separate categories. A skilled writer or director can work around greater constraints of either kind. Furthermore, I would argue it is _expected_ they do so to some extent.

      Writing _is_ difficult. Writing relatable characters is hard. Writing good prose is hard. Pacing is hard, and making events fit together logically is hard. The overall shape of the system is that writing good stuff requires you to overcome a bunch of difficulties. You rightly point out that some of these difficulties are tied to the medium or the genre, but I'm not sure that makes them special compared to the other things we normally expect writers to deal with.

      >Well, I think it should change your opinion of some works.

      Insofar as we hadn't considered the difficulties before, yes. Insofar as we _are_ aware of these factors - and frankly, I think most of us are - they're not in themselves different from other things that make fiction-writing hard. Make no mistake, the concept of enjoying a work in spite of its flaws (of any kind) is important, (and absolutely vital for fan fiction readers) I just don't think of this category of flaws as privileged.

      I suppose I should clarify, I am open to privileging what I would consider accommodations of genuine medium constraints, per the heuristics I've given - confined changes that arise in direct ways. In this post, the idea is expanded _way_ past that, which is why I'm hesitant to take it seriously. The limits you discuss don't seem that fundamental to me, and while you argue that

      >After factoring in budget, time limits, premise, story arcs, actor contracts, etc., some of them pretty much are.

      there's honestly a limit to how many layers of second-degree effects you're allowed to pile on before going from "fundamental limits on the genre/medium" to "qualities the industry is currently bad at" or, again, "stuff that simply not easy, much like any aspect of writing stuff".

      A point of order - this example was not in the original post, and none of what I've said thus far applies to it specifically.

      As it happens, I agree that this kind of long-term probability accumulation is a hard problem, even without any production considerations, and I am inclined to give significant slack for it. (Though, strictly speaking, not under a medium or genre constraint clause) That doesn't mean it can't be mitigated. Individual events can be written as natural-seeming progressions of competent actors, which means the coin-tosses only exist in the abstract. Not every subplot has to end as everyone is about to die - it's alright to reserve the really big stakes for special occasions. (As it happens, better writing allows for stories to be engaging without threatening death to all the characters all the time.) Or, you can do as Stargate did, and outright acknowledge that the universe the series takes place in is one of a handful where everything ended up mostly all right - the vast majority of the neighboring Earths at the other side of the quantum mirror were conquered by the Goa'uld, you'll recall.

        Full agreement there.

        > there's honestly a limit to how many layers of second-degree effects you're allowed to pile on

        These aren't second order to film, they are part of the medium of film by necessity. Every film has a time limit, limited budget, story arc that needs to be somewhat appealing to human psychology, etc. I think many common tropes arise as writers try to solve narrative problems within what they can do with their resources. These tropes then get abstracted away and wielded poorly by mediocre writers. But many times they are necessary and inextricable (unless you have infinite budget and time, or just avoid certain classes of stories that people like).

        > The limits you discuss don't seem that fundamental to me

        In the sense that they can be worked around in principle, they are not fundamental. In the sense that certain narrative difficulties arise specifically due to presentation format, I would call those difficulties fundamental. If we taboo the word "fundamental" I would say that certain stories are difficult (but not impossible) to tell in certain forms of media, *because* of the media format. (Or genre format, or story type, etc.) Under a limited budget, difficult often becomes impossible.

        > "qualities the industry is currently bad at"

        I agree that even with the effects I just mentioned, the film industry has very suboptimal writing, likely because the studios want to pander to wide audiences and so give the writers checklists of things to have in the film, whether or not those things are logical. And of course, some people are just bad writers.

        > this example was not in the original post

        I had it in mind when I wrote the Stargate example, though I framed it differently there.

        > In this post, the idea is expanded way past that, which is why I'm hesitant to take it seriously

        If I were to rewrite the post, I would ax most of my examples and talk specifically about the contrast between visual and written storytelling, and which things are difficult to do in each as a result of format. That's what I find most interesting here - things like a strong pressure to see actor's faces, or tropes writers use to get around limited budgets that aren't inherently bad when done well, or the difficulty of conveying realistic speech in writing.

        > Or, you can do as Stargate did, and outright acknowledge that the universe the series takes place in is one of a handful where everything ended up mostly all right

        I like to call that the "Anthropic principle of storytelling" - if the characters didn't make it, you wouldn't be telling the story. This is a pretty good solution to probabilistic problems in stories, though in rational fiction there is pressure to give a stronger justification (which is one of the things I really like about rational fiction - it's fun to see what kinds of worldbuilding need to be done to make events not implausibly unlikely in the setting.)

          I do understand if this wasn't the debate you came here to have. Still, _as your case was presented_, I think a lot commenters (myself included) are averse to the idea that the sort of problems you bring up are somehow _qualitatively_ different than other problems we expect writers to solve.

          It's true that some of these issues arise from the medium, but they're still just that - issues. Writing is, and always has been, an exercise in overcoming various issues.

          If you rephrase the original claim as 

          >Due to medium-related constraints, good films are harder to make than good books. Therefore, all else being equal, films are more likely to contain cheap tricks like idiot balls and unrealistic head injuries.

          then I'll gladly accept it, for some definitions of "good". It's the talk of (if you don't mind me paraphrasing)

          >So-called "cheap tricks" are in fact just the most easily available solution to the inextricable constraints placed upon movies

          which I don't like, because it implies the underlying equation is fundamentally changed.

          Even if movies or series are quantitatively harder than (say) books, and even if this hardness is asymmetric - such that rational tropes become disproportionally harder, compared to say action tropes or visual tropes - the overall shape of the system (and I admit I'm repeating myself here) is still that better writers make better movies using fewer "stupid" tropes, and worse writers make worse moving using more "stupid" tropes.

          While of course you should be aware of these issues, it's still just, best as I can tell, a relative rescaling of how hard things are, or which tropes are harder to do correctly than others, or many idiot balls you need.

          ---

          You're probably correct in tabooing "fundamental" at this point. If I may, the expansion on the word you do defend - roughly, "issues derived directly from the medium" - fails to defend a cornerstone of the thesis, which is that the proposed "solutions" - idiot balls, characters to fail to learn anything, characters who are _way_ unprofessional - are directly the result of the issues. I'll grant they're the most _obvious_ solutions, but they're not _necessary_, in the sense that we see better shows having much fewer of them, or shows that avoid them at the expense of screen time, or some other resource. They're just another couple of line items in the internal economy of a work, alongside {screen time | writer hours | viewer attention-seconds | etc} spent on {original world-building | relatable characters | good pacing | sensible plot logic | etc}, even if they're disproportionately expensive items. (Which are tempting to do away with in the quickest, dirtiest way possible)

I'll grant they're the most obvious solutions, but they're not necessary...

            I don't want to directly identify any of these shortcut "solutions" as inherently bad (and I don't think you're doing so either). Sometimes there is a theme which the writers want to get to, and so the audience is willing to accept the shortcuts as a means to the destination, like they accept cardboard props in a stage play. Insofar as "better shows [have] much fewer of them", I think the difference between good and bad writing here is what takes the audience out of immersion (as I mentioned in the original post). As many have pointed out, including myself in the past when we were rewriting the sidebar, rationalist fiction is a stylistic choice that puts maximal weight on *not* using shortcuts. That doesn't mean the alternatives are necessarily bad writing... and most people here already agree with that, I think, but some people still think that rationalist fiction is perfectly synonymous with good writing. I wanted to explore more explicitly why that wasn't the case.

  My **ANTITHESIS** is:  Writers tend to be lazy, and once a convention is settled on, it tends to be used by everyone out of convenience, rather than put forth effort to write something better.  It's easier to replicate than innovate, and carries less risk.

  Having said that, I will address the first six of the seven points using *Star Wars* as an easy example.  A previous poster used it for one example, but with a little thought, I realized it actually covered most of them.

  1.  Han and Luke used the same Stormtrooper disguises.  They only took them off when they were in a room without any enemies, and later to prove to Leia who they were.  In both cases, they had a distinctive walk and body language that seemed out of place--this was both to cue the audience in, and to demonstrate that they were really *BAD* at sneaking and had to use other methods to achieve their goal.

  2.  In most cases, the real answer here is due to limitations of money.  You COULD create some six-legged ant-thing, but it's easier to use rubber-forehead aliens.  In Star Wars, however, you have two 'aliens' (R2 and Chewbacca) who are both visually distinctive from humans and also happen to not speak any decipherable language at all.  And yet, due to their body language and the actions and words of characters around them, they convey individual personalities quite well.  Obviously, this can't be done for an entire movie (well...), but it can certainly be done with at least one or two characters in most, if the writers actually put forth the effort.

  3.  There are countless scenarios where the main characters get into trouble or risk their lives.  In most cases, that's because they are *the only characters who can do the job*.  Even so, when properly written, that doesn't stop the other characters from putting forth the effort.  A great example is at the end of Star Wars--at least two dozen Rebel pilots are seen volunteering for the Trench Run, even knowing its probably suicide.  Han flat out refuses to be there at all.  And we get to see many of them die, on-screen with faces visible no less, on this otherwise hopeless mission until the guy who can actually achieve it is able to do so.

  4.  All the high-ranking members of the Empire act like perfect professionals, at least in public.  They often have conflicts with each other due to differences in opinions (Vader VS Tarkin on the usefulness of the Death Star, for instance), but this almost never results in a shouting match or outright violence--at least until its execution time.  In the case of the Rebels, they disagree all the time.  They are as 'professional' as can be, but since the writers wanted them to be able to argue with superior officers, they put that where it would make the most sense--in a less-professional organization where such would actually be able to happen.  A cunning writer would have a cop story with this, but use it for the plot--perhaps that cop district is corrupt and 'on the take', or maybe its not very successful as its members are not following proper procedure.

  5.  We see a reversal of this, where the villain has a hero stunned and carried off.  We also have the garbage disposal scene as to why the heroes weren't followed and finished off directly.  The closest example that would apply in *Star Wars* with the heroes being the active choosers of this trope would likely be where Vader keeps ambushing them on the Trench Run.  They COULD attempt to dogfight him above the surface, but they would get torn apart by the turrets and his fighter squadron--and that assumes they know about him (the first group certainly didn't).  In all these cases, the people involved are acting as rationally as can be expected.  In most well-written movies, there is either a moral or time constraint built into the narrative that prevents the villain from being offed by the hero.  The 'good' hero is against killing a helpless foe, or they have very little time to accomplish their real goal and the villain is just a distraction.  This helps to distinguish them from the villain, especially when there is a 'We are the same' speech coming up later.

  6.  They used a stun setting.  No, seriously, this was addressed in the first couple of minutes.  Minus that, other another method used to render near unconsciousness was a telekinetic choke.  Rather than club the heroes like baby seals, the writers used a little bit of creativity here.  In most cases, the 'head thump' is used as it's easier to write, and less traumatic on the characters than what realistic methods would require (being choked out or made to bleed until they pass out is a much more gruesome method that nonetheless works in reality)… but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of other ways to knock a character unconscious or at least remove them from a conflict without it being lethal.  That being said, I'd like to see this happen in a movie, with all the consequences it entails.  That would be smart.

  Alright, I can't really address the last point with *Star Wars* simply because it *is not* a Slasher movie.  This one is different as it's so specialized, but the answers are still simple.  I will use a sci-fi Slasher movie as an example of how to do exactly what you asked, however, and further prove that most writers are simply lazy.

  7.  Most Slasher films involve school-aged teenagers.  Generally, they don't have much access to guns or military training, and their social interactions with each other aren't usually the most rational--for obvious reasons.  So what happens if you decide you want to genre-shift this into, say, Sci-Fi, but actually use military people with guns and put them in a scenario where they still get murdered as effectively as Slasher kids despite using reasonable tactics?  What would that look like?  Well...It would look like *Predator*.  Last time I checked, it was pretty popular.

  Most stupid things that happen in movies or stories are generally due to stupid mistakes or outright laziness by the writers.  While the medium does impose limitations, there are plenty of ways the creative can get around that.  Even if it's just in a single film.  In most cases, the goal isn't to write something 'great' and 'new', it's to write something 'good enough' for the movie makers to turn a profit.  As long as they get more money out than they put in, they will consider it a win, and the laziness will be rewarded.
  ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    I don't find this very convincing.

    While it's likely that lazyness contributes in the form of writers not bothering to consider if the tried and true methods still make sense, and producers being unwilling to put money on something that takes risks by assuming they can ignore convention, that has little bearing on why those conventions exist in the first place and just assumes they are no longer relevant. 

    Also, Several of your own examples are wrong, or misrepresent the issue.

    1. Han and Luke being bad at sneaking is distinct from most cases of the trope as usually the infiltrator is suppsoed to be good at it.  If writers followed your advice in general we'd instead be debating how ostensibly expert infiltrators can't shut up when sneaking and suck at acting.
    2. Limitations of money are part of the limitations of the media. And as your own point alludes to a story like say Babylon 5 with a dozen or so recurring aliens, half the core cast being aliens, and a TV budget, can't go that rout and be effective. 
    3. Actually the fact that the Rebels let Luke, a random farm boy with no training, fly in a combat mission is an example of this. It's highly irrational to not at least make him do a qualifying run in a simulator before trusting him to not get in the way in combat, but because he's a main charter the rebels issue him a ship and he gets to be in the climactic battle.
    4. Vader flat out chokes a dude at a briefing until Tarkin reigns him in. That's neither professional, nor an example of not escalating to violence. The execution in Empire is also highly unprofessional even by executed as an example standards.
    5. The trench run is itself complete nonsense. It's an out of context remake of a WWII attack on a dam. The rational attack pattern for the stated objective would have been to aproceh the exhaust port directly and fire a 0 defection shot at it not maneuver down a trench full of AA guns and try to bak your torpedoes 90 degrees into it.  Failing that, when Wedge disengaged and the TIEs didn't follow he should have re-engaged and attacked them from behind. 
    6. Inventing a stun setting is just the Sci-fi equivalent of "I knocked him out with a martial arts move, he'll be fine" This is not an example of avoiding the trope.
    7. Yeah, as irrational as slasher flics are, that random teens weren't packing heat when the went to makeout point isn't a strong example. Though splitting up probably is.

      > Also, Several of your own examples are wrong, or misrepresent the issue.

      The irony is that you accuse me of this while going on and doing it.

      1.  Them being bad at this doesn't negate my point.  They were goofy and such due to inexperience and for comedic relief in the film.  You can still do the *exact* same thing with someone skilled.  They merely need to use some of the body language and verbal catchphrases of the character doing the infiltrating.  Or just purposefully surprise everyone, like the face mask pull-off done in the original *Mission Impossible*.


      2.  This makes no sense.  Please elaborate how what you wrote here in any way contradicts what I said, because I'm not seeing it.  I gave you examples of non-human aliens giving a convincing performance while also having unique character and not speaking English.  You did not counter this.  Babylon 5 actually does a similar thing.  If you've watched it, you can easily tell me the behaviors and attitude of, say, Vosh, but in the case of shows like B5 or Star Trek, they *actively mention* the existence of translator technology.  

      3.  Actually, the writers already handled this.  Luke back on the farm talks about how he flies in his spare time, and plays with a model of the ship he flies.  At least twice later in the movie people refer to his flying skills.  One even says "Luke here is the best bush pilot on the Rim!"  They didn't *show* him flying before because they only had so much budget.  So they referenced his flying skill in dialog with other characters or even his own.  He mentions he has no problem hitting Womp Rats, which are the same size as the target they need him to hit.  Thus, when the end battle comes around, it makes perfect sense to have him take part in the battle, and we can have him fly decently well because it is part of his backstory (unlike, say, Rey in the new movies who can just magically fly good with no backstory reasons).  This was an example of *good* foreshadowing.

      4.  Yes.  Remind me where Vader's position in the Empire is?  What is his military rank?  He's not a General or Admiral or Captain or anything, he exists outside their system.  He acts professionally up until the point where he can't reign in his own anger, but he *listens* to those in authority (in this case, Tarkin).  Ignore the rest of the rank structure, though.

      5.  Sure.  How many blaster shots do you want to dodge simultaneously?  Because unless the answer is *all of them from every single turret out to the horizon*, it's probably a good idea not to try that trick.  *Everyone* thinks of the "attack it straight on" approach.  I did as a kid, too, until I actually sat down and thought about it.  The Imperials wouldn't really bother with overkill until they realized what the Rebels were doing, but by then they were too close for a proper response.  But if they went straight for the port?  Everyone would know.  The Wedge thing is a good idea, though.  Of course, if he tried that with Vader, it wouldn't work so well.

      6.  It is a perfect example of averting the trope.  You talked about receiving brain trauma from a knockout blow to the head.  Sci-fi addresses this with a 'stun' setting on their weapons.  What's the problem?

      7.  In most Slasher films they split up because the couples want to be alone together.  It's part of the original Slasher concept--the teens are doing immoral things they shouldn't be doing, and the 'monster' is their punishment.  It's been so long that most of that is forgotten, however, and writers simply follow the trope out of laziness instead of coming up with compelling reasons as to why they do this.
      ```

      - u/turtleswamp:
        ```
        1. If you do the exact same thing with somone skilled you will make your skilled character look like a goofy doofus who doesn't know how to infiltrate. If you have them take off the helmet but act competent then the audience knows who they are and picks up form their behavior that they know what they're doing. Additionally a lot of helmet removal scenes are probably motivated by how much the studio spent on the attractive actor/actress which is also a constraint of the medium.
        2. B5 is all rubber forehead aliens who speak english except Kosh who just sits in a corner being "mysterious" and also speaks english, and the Gaim ambassador who is the only one shown with a translator device but is a minor character at best (and several episodes state that they don't ave ubiquitous translator devices and that the ambassadors all learned english. No explanation of the random civilian aliens are fluent in english or why the aline's own secret government meetings are also in english is given). If they tried to do Spielberg/Henosn puppets and subtitles for even just Molari, G'Kar, and Delen they'd have massively inflated their effects budget and probably lost a lot of the relatability of the characters.  (Or they have been written out early on like that preying  mantis dude from the pilot). 
        3. Luke had piloting skills yes. However he does not have combat training or experience, he does not know rebel formations or radio jargon, has not qualified in an X-wing (or even any non atmospheric ship as far as we know), and has not trained with the squadron he joins. Additionally the rebels decide to trust him in a combat mission without verifying his skills, or even actually waiting for Biggs to vouch for him (that happens after he's been assigned a ship). 
        4. Vader is addressed as "Lord" implying a social rank in the nobility and Anakin held the rank of General during the clone wars it's unlikely Vader holds anything less. Vader is also later revealed to report directly to the Emperor. Even if we assume he's the equivalent of a CIA agent on a military base and not part of the military chain of command he would still be expected to act professionally at a staff meeting. Especially as the representative of the Emperor, and even more so if he doesn't actually have authority over Tarkin's staff.
        5. The Falcon does the straight in attack just fine when Han comes back to save Luke.
        6. Stun settings invoke the trope they don't avert it. Wether it's a stun setting, a Vulcan nerve pinch, a 'ninja-chop' a vase to the head, or a hypodermic needle to the arm it's still all just "we need them to be disabled here". Sci-fi gets away with it more because they make up so much stuff one more thing isn't noticeable and you can't really falsify fake technology, but it's the exact same concession to plot over realism.
        7. This is the one where I do mostly agree with you, and don't have any nit-picks worth defending.

  The next more-general subject I like to consider is the economic consequences of art distribution systems upon the kinds of art that get produced.

  The most salient recent example is the effect of widespread streaming on the structure of TV shows. If, after the first airing, the subsequent viewers of a show are going to see reruns in arbitrary order in syndication, you're going to get a lot of shows that follow the episodic format you describe -- a format in which it is indeed very difficult to storytell rationally, although a time-loop story might be able to do it. When you know that most viewers are going to stream every episode in order, you start to see a lot more long-form storytelling, a transition that I'm sure you've noticed in the fifteen years since House and SGA started.

  In this view I think you have the causation backwards. It's not that stories are irrational because of medium/genre constraints -- it's more that we have the conventions of medium and genre we do because we have a society that demands irrational stories. This is particularly apparent in film because, being expensive to produce, the medium is subject to a strong pressure to dumb things down for the widest possible audience.

    ```

- u/Kuiper:
  ```
  I'm not sure who said it, but one of the basic ideas that improved my ability to enjoy film and television (particularly works that my younger self might have dismissed as "irrational") is this: when the script and the shot are communicating different things to the audience, the shot wins, because film is a visual medium.  My young take on film was that the most powerful person on any production was the screenwriter, because they have the ability to control the plot, and what the characters say.  Now, my take is is that the director has the most power, because they control how those things are delivered to the audience. The Social Network isn't an Aaron Sorkin movie as much as it is a David Fincher movie.  (An even bigger-brain take might be that the editor has the most power, because they decide how everything is cut together.  For a humorous example of this in action, see /r/recut trailers, like [this one for The Notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvfI8vUuJ04) where editing turns it from a romance into a thriller.)

  There are a lot of movies that I enjoy even though they don't necessarily work 100% on a plot level, but I let myself be sad when the score tells me to be sad, and I let myself be scared when the shot tells me I'm supposed to be scared, and I grin during the action scenes and laugh during the funny moments, and I end up having a good time as a result, even if the details of the fiction may not always add up.  (As you note, this is called "the willing suspension of disbelief.") Annihilation is a perfect example of a film that I enjoyed tremendously on the strength of its visuals and pacing and tension, but whose plot immediately begins to unravel if you start to tug at it. If I'm not willing to believe what the director's shot and the composer's score are telling me, then why did I walk into a movie theater in the first place?

  >In the medium of writing, are there any constraints analogous to the visual need to see the main character's face in a movie?

  Cross-talk is very common in real life and very hard to represent on the page.  Whenever a character on the page gets interrupted, they will often immediately stop talking and cede space to the interrupter, instead of continuing to speak over them for a few sentences before maybe trailing off.  (If you want a good case study in why most written stories don't have any cross-talk, trying reading a transcript for an interview/podcast/panel discussion that has even small amounts of cross-talk and you'll quickly understand why -- a lot of podcast transcripts I've seen will actually sequence things slightly achronologically as a concession to the idea that complete sentences are a lot easier to parse when you're reading them one at a time.)

  On a similar note, written characters tend to talk in well-formed, grammatically correct sentences.  Even among well-educated and articulate people that I know, people often start talking without having the complete sentence in their mind, and sometimes they'll trail off or stop in mid-sentence to re-phrase what they're saying.  Or sometimes they'll end the sentence in a way that technically isn't a full sentence, but still contains all of the information that they intended to convey.  In written fiction, it feels rare for a character to do this.

  Even in cases where a character speaks grammatically incorrectly for stylistic effect (such as to communicate to the reader that they are feeling awkward and uncomfortable, or that they are not a native speaker), they will still be consistent in the way that they misspeak, following their own laws of grammar.  (See, for example, Yoda from Star Wars: he's not "speaking English wrong" so much as he's speaking his own dialect that has its own rules.)

  >It's not common to see characters who do the equivalent of staying at home and watching TV because they can't decide which movie they want to go to. Or at least, I don't know of fiction where things like this happen.

  These things usually don't advance the plot, unless the plot is specifically focusing on something like a character's struggle to overcome an executive function disorder.  There's also a lot more focus in stories on external conflicts than internal ones, because it's a lot more interesting to read about someone having an argument with their boss, or having a fist fight in an alley, even though the biggest struggle of their day might be finding it in themselves to crawl out of bed in the morning.

  In a story, we expect every scene in the story to somehow advance us toward a goal of some sort.  The author, simply by putting a piece of information on the page, has decided that that piece of information matters to the story they are trying to tell, even if in the service of some goal like "building atmosphere" or "pacing."  In most stories, every conversation or decision achieves something that matters to these things that we call "characters" or "plot" or "setting."  Every time we see something on the page, there is an implicit question of "what is this bit of description telling us about the world, or the characters, or the plot?"  In fact, one of the characteristics of good writing is that it conveys a lot of information in each sentence: a small bit of description of a simple action might inform us about the character performing the action, the world that they live in, and also somehow be relevant to the plot.  But everyday life is full of "useless" actions that don't advance or signify anything meaningful or significant.  (Even if there is a scene where "nothing happens" because the author wanted a scene where "nothing happens" to be there, *that* is significant, because the author wanted to set expectations for something happening and then crush those expectations by having nothing happen, maybe to build dramatic tension, or to communicate something about the character's state of boredom, or pacing, or whatever.)

  When a character in a book notices that their shoe is untied and kneels down to knot their laces, it's because the author wanted that scene to do something, like maybe draw our attention to something a character notices on the ground when they kneel down, or maybe that they're the kind of fastidious person who always wants to make sure their shoes are properly laced.  Whenever I stoop down to tie my shoe, it means that my shoe was untied, nothing more.  Notably, this is probably why most stories don't have scenes where characters go to the bathroom, and most meals are skipped over: these things happen all the time, but those scenes probably wouldn't advance the story the author is trying to tell.

  >When writing a character from the inside, there is a general pressure to make their mental state more sharply defined than is realistic, so that the reader isn't bored with descriptions of vagueness and indecision.

  This story is coming from my memory of one of Brandon Sanderson's fan panels at a convention, so I might be getting some details wrong, but: When Brandon Sanderson was writing an early draft for The Way of Kings, one of the things he struggled with was the fact that Dalinar seemed indecisive, constantly battling with himself internally over the question of whether the visions he was seeing were real, or whether he was going insane.  He eventually decided that this conflict of questioning Dalinar's sanity worked better as an external conflict, so he created the character of Adolin so that instead of Dalinar having internal monologues where he battled with himself, he had a son who he could argue with.  His beta readers agreed that the story worked much better when certain questions were litigated between two different characters instead of having the argument take place entirely within Dalinar's mind.  It's more dramatic and entertaining to read, but I'm not sure it's really truer to life.

      > I hadn't thought of cross-talk, though I'm not sure any particular "rational" plot hinges on it.

      If we're assuming that the alternative to cross-talk is having characters who always "take turns talking" and let each other finish their sentences when they're saying something that's plot-important (or immediately stop talking any time another person interrupts them based on the presumption that whatever the interrupter is saying must be much more relevant to the audience), you could certainly make the case that there are situations where this would be at odds with rational behavior.

      If you're trying to get a point across, and then someone with a dissenting point of view interrupts to contradict the point you are trying to make, does it make sense to let your own sentence end abruptly so that the person who opposes your viewpoint can have the stage?  Especially in an adversarial context, it could be more "rational" to simply continue talking and elevate your volume: perhaps you'll overpower the interrupter (making them realize their interruption isn't working and forcing them to be the one who cedes the stage), and at a minimum, your loud mouth noises will hinder the interrupter from effectively communicating whatever they were trying to say.

      There are a lot of real-world "arguments" that are won not on the strength of reasoning or rhetoric, but based on who is better able to "dominate" the social interaction and overpower other people who are trying to speak, especially when the premise of the argument is "we are two adversaries trying to figure out who is more socially dominant and figure out which party should cede to whom" (for example, a verbal fight at a bar where both parties think they would be the one at an advantage if the situation were to escalate).  You might argue that the *real* rational move in this situation would be for the weaker party to de-escalate the situation (thus removing the battle for the stage and the potential for cross-talk), but there are plenty of situations where an asymmetry in information could lead both parties to think, "*I* am clearly the one who has more power in this situation, and screaming into your face is actually a pretty effective way for me to demonstrate that, while also preventing you from using your voice to persuade the people in this room away from the status quo where I have the advantage."

  I agree? It's always seemed obvious to me. Ordinary media puts the needs of *narrative* first. It's best exemplified by [Bellisario's Maxim](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BellisariosMaxim), which states that one shouldn't analyse elements of a story too deeply if they're not *important* to it.

  Story elements must be sensible enough that an average person who doesn't actively try to second-guess them recognizes them as sensible, but as long as *this* (very low) standard is met, the authors don't care about sensibility and instead optimize for emotional engagement, compelling character arcs, pacing, themes, entertainment value ([rules of cool/funny/scary](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfIndex)), et cetera. You rightly recognize them as orthogonal to sensibility: the heroes *could* call the backup team first, but that would trivialize whatever danger awaits them, which is boring. (Naturally, it also applies to written fiction.)

  Whereas rational fiction puts the need of simulationism/intellectual agency first, to the detriment of the narrative if needs be.^(1)

  I *think* this sums up your point?

  ^(1. Well, not exactly. Rational stories still need to be entertaining and emotionally engaging, it's just that they need to this *and* sensible at the same time, which makes them harder to write.)
  ```

  - u/LieGroupE8:
    ```
    Well, this is part of my point. What I'm trying to get at is that the medium of presentation itself can present *fundamental* limits to how rationalist a story can be. You *must* see the actor's faces in a film so that the actors can act (if you want it to not be boring; yes, there are exceptions, yadda yadda). What you're describing is what I would call a *genre constraint* as opposed to a medium constraint. Fiction not in the rationalist genre certainly goes more for emotion than other things. But I'm wondering if the medium of writing itself poses subtle limits to what sorts of "rational" plots can be conveyed well. Possibly there are no limits. My talk of "serialized thought" is me conjecturing on this.
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      Ah. I see.

      > the medium of presentation itself can present fundamental limits to how rationalist a story can be

      I disagree. You can always:

      1. Avoid situations where medium and sensibility come into conflict. (Don't have scenes where the character's face will be disguised. Skip them, write around them.)

      2. Let sensibility win, and regain narrative points in some other way. (Characters stay disguised, but the actors put extra effort into tone of voice or body language.)

      3. Modify the medium. (Characters stay disguised, but you're using some bleeding-edge camera tricks or 4D video technology to show actors' faces anyway. Or we're watching from the PoV of one of the characters, who *infers* the others' expressions even though they're hidden.)

      4. Justify medium constraints. (Characters don't *need* to stay disguised because of <insert sensible justification>. (It's probably a corollary of 1, though.))

      It's harder to do any of these things elegantly, though, compared to just having the characters take off their disguises, and most of the audience doesn't care in any case, so it's usually not done.

      And sure, some of the constraints are harder to go around than others (e. g., u/Kuiper's point about characters speaking in grammatically correct sentences), but it's by no means *impossible* in any case.
      ```

      - u/LieGroupE8:
        ```
        >Avoid situations where medium and sensibility come into conflict.

        I would call that fundamental, because some plots just don't work. But of course, as you point out in 2-4, almost anything can be made to work, with some effort.

        >It's harder to do any of these things elegantly

        Indeed, and I guess I'm really looking for examples of "rationalist" plots that writing can't do *elegantly,* but other media could. One might say that nearly any medium of fiction like film or writing is... ah, "Turing complete" ? … with respect to the stories it can tell, but no medium can handle everything well.
        ```

- u/doremitard:
  ```
  I think you're overestimating how fundamental medium constraints are. Both Law & Order and The Wire are serialised TV shows about crime and law enforcement, but they differ drastically in to what extent they're willing to use dumb unrealistic tropes. The Wire is amazing but requires way more effort and engagement from the viewer (and the writers: a lot of The Wire is based on the showrunner's experience of being a crime reporter for years), whereas the Law & Order franchise is the TV equivalent of a Happy Meal: you get the same predictable experience every week, but you don't need to be a sophisticated consumer to get something out of it, and the writers just churn out episodes based on whatever's in the news without needing to do much research.

  Of course, it also helps that The Wire was on HBO, so there was less pressure to keep individual episode ratings up and more time to build an audience, so I guess you could say that the medium of prestige subscription TV is less constrained than the networks.

  But look at written fiction: almost none of the medium constraints you identify apply, yet a lot of pop fiction still uses idiot plotting and dumb tropes. Look at the most popular fiction hits: Twilight, James Patterson's output, Dan Brown, etc etc.

  To be a big hit, a novel has to sell to a lot of people who don't usually read fiction, so it helps a lot to pander to the less sophisticated reader. A lot of readers want comforting familiarity in fiction, so writers can be rewarded for regurgitating the same tropes over and over. I'm sure someone could write a groundbreaking, rational romance novel, but that's probably not what will sell in the romance novel market.

For instance, House's accuracy problem is largely due to an outside-context problem: the parts of his work life we see are subject to selection effects where the main content is the complicated cases; the (simple) problems he gets right at first are pulled out only in sufficient quantity to give commentary on his work ethic. It's not realistic to expect the character to consider as evidence the chronology of the problems with regard to the commercial breaks.

  And from the list: #2 is probably something else, because the aliens are hominoid even when they are not likeable; #3 is usually at least lampshaded by some sort of contingency; #5 could just have easily been an extraction by the mooks or an emergent environmental hazard (and sometimes is!); #6 is probably closer to 30-50%. (Full points on 1, 4, and 7)

  > This is a case of competing optimization processes producing inadequate equilibria, or at least different equilibria than what is expected here on /r/rational.

  I'm all for working inadequate equilibria into everything, but this one's a stretch. There's such a thing as overfitting.

  Otherwise... yeah, what you're describing is essentially non-rational fiction. Rational fic is all about trying to make an interesting story *without* the shortcuts.

  (whether or not that's possible seems to be addressed by the other comments)

  Sort of tangential, but I have a rule of thumb about willing suspension of disbelief:

  You get to ask your readers to do it *once.*  Like, if you take The Matrix, once you "swallow" the whole humans-are-used-as-power-and-plugged-in, pretty much *everything* else makes sense and emerges naturally.

  Bad fiction asks people to suspend their disbelief more than once (or more precisely, it asks people to suspend their disbelief at some point *well after* the initial setting has been accepted).

  Here's another one: it seems like most members of the public, etc, think that interstellar travel requires a method to travel faster than the speed of light.

  &#x200B;

  Why? Because of the needs of the medium for science fiction books and TV shows.  The audience can't really emphasize with a post-gender, superintelligent, immortal being that lives in a computer, even though *rationally* in a few centuries creatures like this will probably comprise the majority of all sentient beings in our solar system.

  One might also note how the rule of cool is termed the rule of *cool* and not, say, the rule of rationalist eyerolling.

  I more or less agree with this. But I think what seperates great works from okay works is their ability to work around this constraints, to find in character explanations to irrational decisions, or to never enter a scenario with irrational decisions are necessary in the first place.

  For a positive example of TV writing:

  I think StarGate SG1 occasionally has very sensible writing. I think, it's because SG1 is more military sci-fi and Atlantis feels more like a sci-fi adventure sometimes. I think SG1 shines, when they emphasize strategy, tactics and occasionally diplomacy. They often avoid the idiot ball, because they're falling back on discipline, teamwork and established hierarchy. This scene (SG1 just stumbling over Apophis and deciding to kidnap him) for example I remember very fondly as an example of excellent SG1 writing.

  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQTc8xreo4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQTc8xreo4)

  I also think SG1 shines because the characters fit their role very well. O'Neal is the pragmatic Seargeant type, Daniel is the linguist, Carter does the physics, Teal'C is the native guide. But they all know how to shoot, all have military training and they all work out.

  They Goa'uld are technologically superior, but they're kinda soft, having only each other to fight and being parasites, who mostly stole their tech to lord it over peasants. And they're full of themselves, really like to hear themselves talk and often reveal/brag about their plans. They're like a bunch of trust fund kinds larping as evil war lords. But they feel realistic enough. And realistically the most over the top-ones get offed first. SG1 has like a dozen seasons and suffers from humanity power creep and at times terrible writing, but especially the Goa'Uld arc feels solid.

  SG1 doesn't enter each new planet with artillery, tanks, nuclear weapons and an infantry regiment, because they're very much aware, that they don't want to start a fight, that they might not be able to win and that they would rather try to win hearts and minds first. But when they do have to go all-out, they don't hold back, which is very satisfying.

  I think, it's easier to write plausible stories when the protagonists are under intense dtime pressure and with limited resources in novel situations with no obvious right answers.  
  I think Atlantis doesn't have as good a team. Shepherd is neither as charismatic or funny as O'Neal, McKay talks too much,too fast and is terribly immature and it kinda feels like the alien girl and the alien guy have not much reason to be there. I think McKay talks more than all the other three combined. I find that SG1 had a grittier more realistic feel, but in Atlantis everything is shiny and full of technobabble. Not that either show doesn't have it's shining moments or absolutely terrible episodes (especially when the writers decided to turn O'Neal into Homer Simpson for some reason).

  There's something to be said for more complex and lengthy stories tending to be more in depth and realistic because of it. But there are also cons to overly long stories, that's why books have editors, and why choosing what to cut is as important as choosing what to add..

  &#x200B;

  It still bothers me seeing military commanders not using helmets in battles just so we can see their faces.. Give them a special accessory, or focus the camera on other more interesting things than a guy barking orders, or just give them helmets and see if people complain..

  &#x200B;

  Also seeing kings and important people leading troops in the front (without helmets). Yeah it looks good, look at that the good guy fights with his men while the villain stays behind and gives orders. Well the villain is being rational in this case, he's not risking ultimate loss for a slight boost in morale.

  Yep, you pretty much have it.

  Also, the specific shapes that the medium necessities takes are a combination of human psychology and cultural psychology - [tropes](http://tvtropes.org) differ between cultures, but some things are nearly universal.

  I agree, a lot of these are just constraints of the medium and I try not to be pedantic about them. I'd rather watch an entertaining movie that wasn't perfectly realistic than a perfectly realistic one that wasn't entertaining. 

  The one example on your list that really ticks me off when I see it is the "head trauma is an off button" thing. I think that trope is irresponsible and dangerous. When I was a kid, I thought that was actually how it worked, and kids are idiots who will try to knock themselves out on purpose to see what it's like. There might be adults who *still* think that's how it works, because they absorbed their understanding of "what head injuries do" from TV and movies and never happened to come across information that contradicts that understanding, and those adults might think they or a loved one doesn't need to go to the hospital when they very much do.

  Good writers would come up with ways to deal but the fact of the matter is that people watch TV to allow their minds to shut down and recover from daily stress, or scratch a social itch that modern society doesn't leave time for, or another one of a handful of reasons that have nothing actually consuming a story. In that vein, tv station managers don't want to pay for good writing when cheap writing leads to the same number of ad impressions and ad managers don't want to work with tv managers who have different opinions or priorities than that.

- u/GaBeRockKing:
  ```
  If it weren't for medium constraints, rational fiction as a category wouldn't need to exist, because then "good art" would be usually indistinguishable from "rational art," and it would be exceptional to find a work of art that was good *and* irrational, except perhaps in comedies.

  Rational art sets itself apart by saying, "I will either justify or avoid the usual constraints placed by the medium," even at the expense of narrative, and therefore attracts people that get bugged by the usual baked in irrationallity of most works.

- u/tjhance:

  I think you have a good point with "constraints of the medium" (the medium of visual movies) for point (1). For point (2), I would add that we want humans to play important alien characters, which is again a constraint of the medium.

  Not feeling so good about your other points, though. (4) and (7) sound like constraints of the *genre* rather than the medium. By definition, in a slasher film, you have your slasher slashing rather than using a gun. By definition, in a drama, you have your characters being dramatic. And this is why those genres probably aren't that popular with this sub.

  For (3) and (5), I'm not really sure what this is a constraint of, but I don't think it's a hard constraint of either medium or genre. These are just examples of why writing is hard. Nobody ever said writing was easy, and definitely nobody ever said writing rationally was easy.

  And (6) doesn't seem like a good reason at all; you could just have people not get hit in the head.

  90% of the time, unrealistic things in fiction happen because the work isn't trying to be 100% realistic. There are times when writers make genuine mistakes, but mostly it's just writers having other goals in mind besides trying to adhere perfectly to reality.
