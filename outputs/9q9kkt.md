  Next chapter begins with *Zorian* jumping on *Kirielle's* bed to wake her up!  That is the only possible way Zorian can react to this opportunity.

  PS. Holy shit my heart was fucking pounding.
  ```

  - u/Laser68:
    ```
    This idea I like. I like it a lot. That sweet sweet karma. Best part, chronologically, Kirielle has never jumped on Zorian before, cause this takes place before he woke up.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      Sure she has.

      When he got soul damage, Zorian "figured out" that he hadn't woken up when Kiri jumped on him, because "she always does that."

      Kiri's response was "Not always."

      But no, she hasn't committed the exact instance of that he'd be retaliating for.

        This kind of wonderful detail oriented detective work over something so trivial is why I love you guys so much.

    I want him to leave a simulacrum to do just that. Payback for the countless times she stomped him in the stomach.
    ```

  - u/SnowGN:
    ```
    Thing is, Zorian's house will almost certainly come under immediate attack from Red Robe or Silverlake, and Zach should turn up within seconds as an ally. Zorian's first few hours will be hectic.
    ```

    - u/nipplelightpride:
      ```
      There may be a few reasons Zach won't appear. Zach is the only one that can leave the loop for sure, so he might get targeted first. Zach might not even suspect that Zorian escaped, his body was left behind and looks pretty dead. Zach might not even be on Zorian's side anymore, his mind wipe and lack of examination might allow for some contingency to trigger when he escapes from the loop.
      ```

      - u/SnowGN:
        ```
        All good points.
        ```

      ```
      He jumps on Kirielle’s bed *but it’s not Kirielle in the bed*

      ```
      why would zach turn up... wait, does zach... oh, zach still gets out in the end as he's the real controller RIGHT.

      &#x200B;

      i hope we find out if he's been mindfucked or not.

      &#x200B;

      fuck that ending is exciting!
      ```

    - u/The_Magus_199:
      ```
      Honestly, I'm really hoping that this \*doesn't\* happen, and the final loop mirrors the earliest loops by being a tense affair with every party unsure which other parties might be there and having to nudge things while laying low instead of just being an all-out brawl. It'd be really neat to revisit things like Taiven's mission and the Aranea, and have the final sequence rely on knowledge of the month ahead instead of just being about raw power.
      ```

    - u/kamashamasay:
      ```
      Well thats because Zach is probably red robe, or more likely red robe is Zach. That has been telegraphed for a long time now. 

      Or at least its been my main theory since about ch 50
      ```

- u/I-want-pulao:
  ```
  The route out... Fast forwarded as it was (still took 13k words though!) was worth it. It made sense they got QI to help (and the manner they convinced him rang true!) And it ... It was poetic that Daimen was the first to knowingly sacrifice himself.
  ```

  - u/JuicyLem0nz:
    ```
    Loved the character stuff with Damien. Him being an actually decent guy was a great way of showing Zorians character growth.

    The old Zorian was convinced, making us convinced, that Damien was this really shitty dude (don't get my wrong he had his asshole moments). Seeing Damien be useful and even making the ultimate sacrifice shows how far Zorian has come as a character since pre-loop.

    All up some fantastic character development for both of them
    ```

    - u/shinghand:
      ```
      Did anyone find that both Daimen and Xvim sacrificing themselves to get Zorian out was too much of a coincidence? They were both mentioned as being in on Zorian’s plan to get past Zach’s mind blank.

      My theory is that they got past Zach’s defences and found out something really important to stopping Panaxeth. That’s why they were both so determined to get Zorian out of the loop, even at the cost of their own lives. That information is probably something related to the angels which has been so heavily foreshadowed in recent chapters.
      ```

        - u/shinghand:
          ```
          True, Xvim and Daimen were not the only ones. Still, I find it hard to believe that everyone would unselfishly give up their own chances at freedom for Zorian... unless there’s something only Zorian can do.

          This line from Daimen particularly intrigued me:

          “It's fine if I die, but you have to live. Don't let it all be in vain. It can’t!”

          Suggests to me that Zorian is somehow significantly more important than the other time travellers, and not just because he’s spent a longer time in the loop.
          ```

          - u/myyx:
            ```
            i disagree.  i believe all the people who were willing to sacrifice themselves know that because zorian has spent the most time in the loop other than zach, zorian is the best shot of preventing the invasion and release of the primordial outside of the loop.  if any of the 6 month loopers managed to escape without zorian, how much could they do in comparison?  maybe xvim could come close the impact that zorian would have but even that is dubious.
            ```

            - u/spanj:
              ```
              I think the bigger impact is the information he retains, not the amount of time he spent in the loop (though those are tied together but not mutually exclusive in a hypothetical situation). That is the real reason he is the most important besides Zach. Even if he only retained his improvements in mind magic, he would still be the most important. The information he has is vital for convincing key allies, and has strategic information on how to counter the invaders.

              Even if you had briefed any of the 6+ month loopers (time dilation chambers) it would be simply impossible for any of them to retain and retrieve the amount of information Zorian can hold.
              ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            >not just because he’s spent a longer time in the loop

            Isn't that enough, though? The others are "original self + six months", while he's "teenage archmage who goes toe-to-toe with Quatach-Ichl and steals his most prized possession right off his head."

            Getting Zorian out achieves a lot more than anyone else, except perhaps Zach who has his own exit anyway.

            Plus, it turns out that Zorian was probably the only one who could actually use the tunnel, since no-one else was in a position to make the trip as a disembodied soul.
            ```

            - u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN:
              ```
              > Plus, it turns out that Zorian was probably the only one who could actually use the tunnel, since no-one else was in a position to make the trip as a disembodied soul.

              Dorian made the trip as a soul because his body just got turned into a corpse. If his body wasn't a corpse, he would've left with it, alongside all the stuff he was carrying.
              ```

              - u/thrawnca:
                ```
                Sure, the tunnel could transport living bodies, but if Zorian got killed on his way out, it's almost certain that Taiven would have likewise been taken down, or Alanic.

                *Maybe* Xvim, the archmage specialising in defence, could have made it. Maybe. But he wouldn't have been able to use soul magic to escape if he failed.
                ```

          - u/zonules_of_zinn:
            ```
            he's certainly got more of the invasion plan and counter attack stashed in his mind than anyone else.
            ```

          - u/I-want-pulao:
            ```
            Well, Zorian mentions that the other temp loopers could see the exit right in front of them - and all of them (the remaining ones after Taiven Nora and others died) didn't just rush for the exit. So it does seem rather unselfish.
            ```

          - u/Brokndremes:
            ```
            I feel like them sacrificing themselves to save Zorian can be framed in less altruistic motives as well. Many of the core group of loopers are people Zorian's been ferrying information to within the time loop. If they can get him to survive, then, given Zorian's previous behavior and well demonstrated strong morals, their out-of-loop selves will also benefit, whereas if they attempt to escape and fail, they get no benefit at all.
            ```

          - u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN:
            ```
            > Still, I find it hard to believe that everyone would unselfishly give up their own chances at freedom for Zorian... 

            It wasn't everyone - Silverlake wasn't willing to do so.
            ```

        - u/CaptainMcSmash:
          ```
          The fact that literally not a single one of the people tried to make a dash for the exit and all stood and fought feels a bit too narrative-y to me. Like I swear there should've been at least a couple that broke and ran.
          ```

          - u/I-want-pulao:
            ```
            Well tbf Ilsa (the one person mentioned who was lying about not having considered Pan's deal) died early. Also, they just spent 5 months in the orb together... so it's not outside the realm of possibility that the ones who'd have broke and run died in the fight before Zorian escaped.
            ```

- u/Laser68:
  ```
  Now that I have calmed down a bit. Some really interesting new bits of information in this chapter. Ichl's faith that the angels will take down the primordial is pretty interesting. Depending on the success of his research, Zorian might be able to outright beat mind blank (without dispell? was that possible before?). 

  If he immediately seeks out Zach, will he be out? cause not only is zorian out, at least 10 seconds has passed since then, so Zach should have ran out his last few loops, I wonder if he got out?
  ```

  - u/Husr:
    ```
    Zach is still the controller, so presumably he'll still wake up after the cluster fuck that was that escape and be able to grab the keys again and leave normally, though if Panaxath can somehow now block him for some reason despite claiming to be unable to, Zach as we know him is just dead.
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      Pan can't block him, as the Controller he's too well protected.
      ```

      - u/trobertson:
        ```
        Only according to Pan.
        ```

        - u/I-want-pulao:
          ```
          True! But if Pan had control over blocking Zach why would Pan want to tempt Zorian to disable Zach before allowing Zorian to leave freely? If it can fuck over Zach whenever, then it doesn't matter to have Zorian fuck Zach up before Zorian can leave.
          ```

          - u/Nepene:
            ```
            It doesn't necessarily have a reliable fuck you, it might be a fuck you with a 10% chance of success, or a 50% chance of success.
            ```

            - u/I-want-pulao:
              ```
              Fair. Well, I for one hope that it's a fuck you that doesn't work on the day of. I want Zach AND Zorian fucking shit up! Together. (And also saving the world. But they work so well together! Also want to know what was up with compulsed!Zach)
              ```

              - u/Nepene:
                ```
                Zach is pretty competent. But I wouldn't expect him to arrive in the real world unharried and safe.

                It is more dramatic if he has an exciting exit.
                ```

                - u/I-want-pulao:
                  ```
                  Well, true. But we haven't followed Zach ever so I don't think we'll start now. I imagine some complications might be present but meh. There's a lot of drama in the pipeline (Silverlake, Red Robe, actual life and death dangers, demons, Tesen Zveri, and then just a million plot points). This particular exit situation seems to be rather straightforward.
                  ```

    - u/Laser68:
      ```
      Is the gate still open, or was panaxeth able to close it, cause otherwise zach has to solo Ichl to get the crown, assuming panaxeth cant block him
      ```

      - u/I-want-pulao:
        ```
        I'd imagine the Gate is still open, since Zorian didn't leave by the Gate, but by a dimensional cross they made themselves. Ofc, nobody103 can still say Gate is closed but they made sure to open it before they gave the crown back.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          They gave the crown back subjective months ago, before QI started helping them. And since the orb was destroyed to make the bridge, Zach doesn't have the full Key any more until he resets the loop.

          It's still possible that Zorian's exit did not re-bar the Gate, in which case Zach can just walk out, or it's possible that he'd have to retrieve the whole Key again, which would be quite difficult for him to do (no mind magic and no temporary loopers).
          ```

          - u/I-want-pulao:
            ```
            Nah, they gave the crown back in the same restart, the 6th one from the temp markers! They got 5 extra months via Blackroom dilation thanks to the kidnappings and QI's help. So they unlocked the Gate in the same restart Zorian escaped. The last 3 chapters have been in the same restart - Silverlakes betrayal 89, Pan's 2nd offer 90, and this one 91.
            ```

        - u/Laser68:
          ```
          Silverlake left though, so that might have closed the gate (she didnt have a real marker to be fair, but it still happened)
          ```

          - u/I-want-pulao:
            ```
            Yeah, it did close the gate (we found that out in the last chapter) and they didn't unbar it then. So they made extra sure to unbar the gate this chapter before handing the crown over.
            >Zach had already used the Key to unbar the gate. Now the only value of the imperial items was in their basic abilities, and while the crown was extremely useful… they needed Quatach-Ichl's help far more at the moment.
            ```

            - u/Laser68:
              ```
              Ah thanks for spotting that. So ya Zach should be out then
              ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              *Unless* it was closed again by Zorian's exit. That one's a bit uncertain.
              ```

              - u/I-want-pulao:
                ```
                Yeah, that is a bit uncertain. But nobody103 can take it either way and it wouldn't be awkward so.. I'm guessing it's not closed.
                ```

        - u/Ozryela:
          ```
          Even if the gate got barred again Zach would exit the loop when it ends naturally.
          ```

          - u/I-want-pulao:
            ```
            Nope, they need to use the exit to leave. Staying in the loop reality would mean permanent destruction. We learnt this from Spear of Resolves message around Ch 53/54.
            ```

            - u/YHallo:
              ```
              And it it reiterated by the guardian who states that the controller must exit the time loop in order to survive.
              ```

            - u/Bowbreaker:
              ```
              I'm so curious how Spear of Resolve learned all the stuff she learned in the first place.
              ```

              - u/I-want-pulao:
                ```
                She credited lots of mind reading (the cultists) and the Ghost Spirit for her knowledge.
                ```

      - u/Husr:
        ```
        He could still presumably get people like Xvim to help him, and he's known that it might come down to just him for six months/the entire story, so I'd be very surprised if he doesn't have a plan for getting all the keys as the only looper.
        ```

        - u/Laser68:
          ```
          One does not simply solo Quatach Ichl
          ```

          - u/Husr:
            ```
            Sure, but if he gathered allies like Xvim and Alanic like they'd been doing for years before the temporary markers, he wouldn't have to. He's the only remaining looper, but that doesn't mean he has to do everything alone while still in the loop.
            ```

          - u/Nimelennar:
            ```
            It sounds like they've gotten it to the point where they can take the crown and disappear without actually engaging QI.

            Zach should be able to pull that off alone.

            I'm more worried about the knife.
            ```

            - u/zonules_of_zinn:
              ```
              ah, but iirc the "trick" they used to swipe the crown was a direct mind attack by zorian which caused QI to quickly abandon his body to save his mind/soul.

              is the knife what controls princess? i believe the wasp people mention that the angels (or someone) commanded them to simply hand the knife over to the right-looking person who asks nicely. so all their drama about recruiting other wasp tribes ended up unnecessary.
              ```

              - u/Nimelennar:
                ```
                The knife is in the Royal Treasury.  It's what soulkills people.

                The wasp-people (solruthem?) have the ring.

                The knives which control the hydra and sand worm aren't part of the Key (although one is in the Orb).
                ```

                - u/zonules_of_zinn:
                  ```
                  ah, thanks!!
                  ```

            - u/nipplelightpride:
              ```
              I'd be worried about both the Orb and the Staff, both are very far away and only really accessible by either Zorian spending simulacrums to travel to both places and open a portal, or them convincing the spiders to open a gate, and I'm not sure Zach even bothered to learn that information or can convince them as well as Zorian did.
              ```

          - u/turtleswamp:
            ```
            He might not have to.

            Z&Z have gotten QI to join them on a caper by offering divine artifacts before (how they got the knife). Zach could probably get QI to take Zorian's place in the collection quest on the basis that Zach knows the locations but will also need the crown, and some "muscle" and expertise he "doesn't have" to secure the set.

            QI seeing an opportunity to snag all the artifacts (as well as possibly learn something about the crown) agrees, but not knowing that the one use will be exiting the time-loop he has no idea he's in, he gets beaten to the betrayal by Zach.
            ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        Z can just find Q and say he has all the others and needs the crown for like five minutes and Q can have them all then.
        ```

    - u/Ozimandius:
      ```
      Naw, Zach has plot armor.  Clearly Zorian is planning to get past his mind blank to fix his brain from whatever red robe did to him.
      ```

  - u/CaptainMcSmash:
    ```
    It's pretty crazy to me that the most powerful character in the series calls the angels awe inspiring, they must truly be phenomenally powerful. Really makes me want to see them in action.
    ```

    - u/zonules_of_zinn:
      ```
      i think it's pretty reasonable that the extra-dimensional supernatural perhaps immortal beings are a level beyond the merely-centuries-old lich. 

      it'd be crazy to me if QI were significantly more powerful than the group of angels, though one-on-one might be an interesting battle.
      ```

  - u/hyphenomicon:
    ```
    Prediction: angels are the Big Bad. 30% confidence.

    They can't just no-show, at this point, and plausibly might want to destroy the country or world to get rid of the primordial or punish its releasing.
    ```

  - u/noneo:
    ```
    Didn't Zach just unlock the gate before they went about making the bridge? He should be able to simply walk through at the start of the next loop.

  Also, yet another question from the past answered!

  Ch 40

  `Bizarrely, every single temple in the city was the target of at least one flare – Zorian had no idea what the invaders were trying to accomplish there, and it definitely wasn't something they did in their previous invasion plan.`

  Ch 91

  `I(QI) ordered all the temples razed to the ground at the very beginning of the invasion, but I fear it may not be enough`
  ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      Lol no I don't! But I've reread this story a few times too many :D I just remembered it right away as soon as QI mentioned it, and I knew this plot point was mentioned before - at some point after Zorian comes back to Cyoria and looks at the invasion plan after Red Robe stopped helping them out. So it was easy to track down (ctrl f, temple, in chapter 38,39,40 and boom).
      ```

          At least 3-4 times I'd say. I discovered it around Ch 38, so did a reread after Ch 54 (end of second arc). Then I did another reread around Ch 75 or so. Then I did a reread just because! I think I have a problem haha. 

          Well, you're not that far off now I hope! It's a really enjoyable reread cuz you see so many things that make sense later. The temple here, the first sight of the bicycle girl, the first understanding of Zach's guardian, the moaning about Daimen etc etc.

      He 100% looked into Zach's head.  The way the scenes are setup too implies he found something interesting.

      Damien and Xvim got pulled aside to work on circumventing Zach's shields, and presumably learned Zach's secret from Zorian.  Then during the mission Zach is hesitant while Damien and Xvim are willing to burn everything just so Zorian gets out of there.  

      They likely learned that Zach is compromised by mind magic and can't be relied upon in the real world.
      ```

      - u/JuicyLem0nz:
        ```
        I reckon Zorian hasn't checked his memories yet. From what we've seen Zorian is a better mind mage than QI and Red Robe and has already been capable of getting rid of mind compulsions put on other people, if he saw Zach was compromised he'd probably be able to fix it.

        Were definitely gonna see him check soon though.

        - u/Luck732:

    ```

    - u/spanj:
      ```
      Speaking of souls, there seems to be a minor plothole. IIRC "coming back to life" is a painful crippling experience.

      >After going through Alanic's new soul awareness training a couple of times, Zorian could finally say with certainty that coming back to life was worse than dying. Having Alanic rip his soul out of his body hurt like hell, but only for a moment.

      His ability to remain calm and think about whether or not to snuff out real world Zorian for 5 minutes seems to suggest he is not suffering the pain of "coming back to life". The pain supposedly lasts for a few hours so it is in general not overly detrimental, but it should have definitely affected his demeanor upon his successful contest over the ownership of "his" body.
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        I think Alanic explained that the body degenerates rapidly when not occupied by a soul, which is what was causing the pain.

        Zorian-Prime's body was never without a soul.
        ```

      - u/notagiantdolphin:
        ```
        Perhaps it's because of his greater training and ability now, even if it's just his soul awareness. It might make the degeneration lesser, or slotting in easier, or maybe just because his body didn't have its soul torn out. He just slipped in and displaced the old one at once.
        ```

    - u/AKAAkira:
      ```
      This world does have heaven, so it wasn't so much snuffing it out as it was letting it go, I think. (Provided no soul mutilation took place.)

      Maybe it was possible for two souls to cohabit a body? But without a known precedent it would probably have taken Zorian at least a month to work it out, during which Zorian prime would be kept a disembodied soul. And that's not considering the church's stance on such a thing, or Zorian prime's resentment on sharing what was originally is own body. I'm guessing that's what was going through Zorian's head before he decided it was too cruel.
      ```

      - u/Argenteus_CG:
        ```
        He could have made a simulacrum-type-thing for it. How much do we know about this afterlife? I'm assuming it's not THAT great, or QI wouldn't have done so much to avoid dying.
        ```

        - u/AKAAkira:
          ```
          That's a bit of a comparison between apples and oranges, I think. I was pointing out that Zorian-prime's soul wasn't knowingly cast into nothing, but rather knowingly into the afterlife, two actions which make wildly different interpretations of Zorian's current character. Whether being relegated to a makeshift life is better than heaven is debatable either way but doesn't affect the original distinction I was making.

          (Lore has it that the soul records a person's life so they can be judged once passed, though it doesn't say what happens after that. Quatach-Ichl and other characters' desire to live forever isn't necessarily a comment on the afterlife being worse than life, just that they fear the unknown, maybe. That, and the fact they probably would fall on the Hell side of things when their souls are being judged.)
          ```

      - u/domoincarn8:
        ```
        It IS possible for two souls to cohabit a body. We know this. Zorian ALSO knows that. What he doesn't know is how to exactly do that without primordial blood (or essence).

        See, shifters (Rania, cat shifters, et al) ARE two souls one body. And Zorian spent time figuring this out. And it is stated out openly: Even if the ritual is known, it is insanely hard to start a new shifter clan. One, because you NEED primordial blood for that; secondly, even if you got that somehow (killing shifter kids is one way), maintaining the balance in the second generation is a massive problem. That is why only Pigeon shifters have been the only new group.

    I am beyond relieved that the time loop is finally, finally over. But the *price* that they had to pay... losing all of their artifacts, all of the data stored within the orb, all of Zach and Zorian's allies... was it worth it? Couldn't they have just tried again in one of the half dozen or so restarts they had left?

    What resources does Zorian even have now, now that he's out of the loop? Does he still have the ability to 'reawaken' fellow loopers like Daimen and Xvim?

    What's for sure is, Qatach needs to die now, in the 'real' world. He's too evil and too powerful to let live.
    ```

    - u/lobabob:
      ```
      They couldn't try again next restart. This was the last restart before all the temporary markers expired. Zorian was also marked for a refresh after this restart as well.
      ```

      - u/SnowGN:
        ```
        I guess I have to re-read, because I don't quite understand. Zorian was keyed into Zach's permanent marker, so why *wouldn't* he be able to stick it out through every single restart if he wanted to?
        ```

        - u/BirdMustFeed0:
          ```
          The gate should have been unbarred at all times as soon as Zach entered the Sovereign Gate simulation. The fact that the gate got barred and had to be unbarred let the Simulation know there was a problem. Unbarring the gate automatically caused the whole Simulation to do a full analysis of itself to determine where the mistakes in its programming occured. During this analysis it identified Zorian as one of its many anomalies, so marked him, and all other anomalies, for removal during the next reset.

          - u/es_carva:
            ```
            Zorian's marker didn't change immediately, the guardian simply marked him for deletion at the end of the loop. Which never arrived, so he still has it.
            ```

    - u/spanj:
      ```
      Hopefully and rationally, it would make sense to cram the most important details of the data stored within the orb inside Zorian's mind. Ikosian magic seems to follow some structure and is governed by rules (and it seems spell formulae to the extent that it resembles electrical engineering in my eyes). If he stores the key findings of the research, not all is lost as presumably this will allow one to derive the rest of the research with time in a world where magic is less "magical" and more like a physical property of the world, e.g. electromagnetism.

      Of course there is a massive data loss but with enough people he recruits, some is still salvageable with time. Frankly, I'm not convinced all of the research would have even been necessary for his immediate and pressing goal.

      Edit: Just thought of another scenario that *could have* potentially circumvented the orb's precious contents being destroyed if they had managed to exit physically. Zorian could have simply stored packets of information in enough small animals which he could have brought out with him had the physical exit plan worked. Similar to how the Cyorian aranea stored memory packets in their male counterparts.

          ```
          That's totally right... even though they couldn't bring the Orb, Zorian and others definitely could have brought along smaller pocket dimensions, right? 

          One possibility is that they didn't want to put pocket dimensions inside other pocket dimensions, for fear that there would be some resonance in the spells. But even that seems sketchy, as I thought they had smaller pockets in the Orb during that 5 month period.

    - u/CaptainMcSmash:
      ```
      There's a lot here, bear with me.

      OK so they were never going to be allowed to keep the things they physically obtained in the time loop. Their souls leave, but not physical goods so it's not really a loss. Plus, whatever they obtained in the loop can almost-just-as-easily be reobtained. 

      The iterated blueprints and data Zorian gained... Doesn't he already have a memory bank ability that he uses to store that stuff anyway? Like I remember a section where he even dismissed some of the orbs usefulness since he could already store memories. He's probably also well familiar by now with the iterated plans so again not much of a loss. 

      The entire team making it out was always going to be a hail Mary and this really does hurt him a little. But he was always able to convince Xvim and Alanic of the time loop with trivial ease later on, he'd be able to recruit the inner circle pretty fast. Plus like Ilsa said, these are grown mages at the end of their careers, they've mostly plateaued so the loss of the gains inside the loop aren't a big deal. 

      And like others said, this was the last chance for everyone except Zach to get out, it was all or nothing.

      Also, I really disagree that Qatach is evil. It's mostly a moral disconnect from the from more brutal time he comes from. His belief system is that no true peace can exist between powerful states, he does what he does to guarantee the continued existence of the state he cares for. It's like all geopolitics to him.
      ```

      - u/SnowGN:
        ```
        I'm under the impression that Qatach is evil because he's launching this invasion on Cyoria... Why exactly? What's his rationale? Just seems like unprovoked greed for conquest to me. And even by geopolitical standards, backstabbing Zach and Zorian seemed especially cold-blooded. It's not like their apparent ambitions would have interfered with his. 

        As for physical items.... I'm under the impression that Zorian's plan A was to bring his physical body through? So why not bring divine artifacts through? Yeah, he can retrieve the real world ones... But it would be nice to have two of them. Duplicates.
        ```

        - u/CaptainMcSmash:
          ```
          Have you just recently read the story?

          Anyway, in the chapter where ZZ convince him to tutor them, chapter 81, he explains that his plans on releasing the Primordial is simply to cause enough damage to Eldemar and Sulamnon so that Falkrinea wins the next round of splinter wars and leaves his country alone. Eldemar and Sulamnon are the biggest threats to his country and he just wants to weaken them enough so they can't threaten Ulquua Ibasa.

          I'd imagine from his point of view, it wasn't backstabbing (Plus ZZ literally planned on straight up murdering him if he so much as stepped into the orb). He honored the deal they worked out entirely. There was no ongoing commitment to remain allies or even friendly, they had contract and it was fulfilled. What more can be asked of this honorable skelly? 

          As for why he wanted to disrupt their ritual? The cultists and Quatach want a loose, rampaging primordial. ZZ were just using the primordial to escape the loop, they never intended to truly release it, they just said that's what they were doing to get them on board. But the cultists and Quatach were probably too clever and figured out what they were really doing and trying to stop them so Panaxeth could truly be freed. 

          Oooh right I just reread the relevant bit. That is a pretty big blow actually but it happened 2 chapters ago really.

  top priorities:

  1. stash his family somewhere safe so Zach and/or Silverlake can't do anything to them

  3. stop Silverlake before she does something nasty (hold Kirielle hostage, start teleporting around assassinating people, etc)
  4. kill the brain rats

    Thinking about it, Zorian can afford putting the death of cranium rats lower on the priority list. The only people with sensitive information at the moment are the four loopers who got out (including Zach), and all of them are either capable of mental shields or is about to contact the invaders anyway (Red Robe), so it'd just tip Zorian's hand for dubious gains.

    And maybe it's not so much a priority list Zorian needs than to split out simulcrums and just do all of them at once (though admittedly three is his max without golem bodies). Any one of the objectives on the list failing lowers the chance of a counterattack succeeding (except for number 8, maybe).

          Zorian was in soul form when he rejoined the normal timeline.  He had to find his way home and then take control of his original body.  Even Zorian doesn't know how long this took other than that it is still early morning.  On the other hand, Looper Silverlake would have been in her body immediately and able to act immediately.

          Granted, Zorian did have a little over five months to plan for what he would do to deal with her.  He has vastly less resources and allies that made it through the gate than would have been ideal though.  Silverlake had just made her deal with Pan just a few minutes before (relative to her) so will have to adjust her plans on the fly.

        Yeah, I was never too sure Silverlake would do this. But I could totally see Quatach-Ichl doing it though. We already know that he will sacrifice himself for the original.

        I'm not too sure on OG already being dead. On one hand, she's paranoid enough that I bet she would defend from a bad copy of herself. On the other, she knows all her secrets, and she may have ruled out the possibility of an evil clone. I also don't think the looper learned enough in five/six months to beat her original.

        It's hard to say. I bet that the original is alive though, even if there's a good chance she's dead.

          It was over a year if you include the time in the time dilation chambers. 6 months in the outside loop and six months in the time dilation chambers. A year practicing and refreshing on highly advanced magic would definitely make her more dangerous than the original. Plus even if they were equal she knows the original's routines and defenses perfectly, so an ambush would almost certainly succeed unless the angels or random bad luck interfere with it.  

          As a side note, even though Zorian probably spent about 8.5 years in the outside time loop, if you add the time he spent in the time dilation chambers he's probably spent somewhere closer to 13 years total, maybe as high as 15 years, inside the Sovereign Gate.

      > He may also be able to pit looper Silverlake against the original.

      That was my first thought, as looper Silverlake would have all of the original's secrets and want her stuff, so there is room for working together there.

      The primordial did specify (several times) that he was "Incarnating" those that took his offer, so theoretically that should mean a brand new body, so there would indeed be two Silverlakes. I suppose, however, that it's still possible that the primordial just put the looper soul in the original body. That seems less likely, however.
      ```

      - u/distrofijus:
        ```
        Since Pan is fleshwarper, the SG copy silverlake most likely will have some young, busty, whatever body Silverlake asked her to make ( to be not that easily identified by others is reason important enough alone).
        ```

    - u/nipplelightpride:
      ```
      >then killed herself, leaving her original not being enslaved to the Primordial

      That's not how the deal works, it's basically just a timer that kills the looper in a month if the Primordial doesn't remove it. There's no compulsion or real reason to kill self before that timer finishes.

      ```
      There isn’t much to suggest anything could have prevented Zach from getting out. He still has a number of restarts to attempt it, and the gate is unbarred. He should have no trouble.

      From a meta perspective, it would rob us from a resolution to the questions we have about his motivations/mind wipe, or even if Zorian got those answers in the last restart, it lessen the impact because of Zach didn’t get out, who really *cares* if he was actually not an ally,
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        The question is whether Zorian's exit caused the gate to close. Normally it would, but his departure wasn't normal. If it did, then Zach will need to restart and collect the Key again, which will be difficult.
        ```

        - u/Luck732:

  Anyone else think that Zorian should have taken some time to grieve his dead allies? He spent a year and a half with them, and they all sacrificed themselves for him at the end. He probably won't be able to cultivate the same relationships with them in the real world, since he obviously can't prove that they're in a looping world any more. Xvim has been his mentor for the better part of a decade, and he won't be able to have that relationship with him again. Kael and Taiven lost a substantial part of their lives by not making it out, and they can't recreate the life changing events that happened to them in the loop.

  Well, at least Spear of Resolve and Enthusiastic Seeker of Novelty are alive again. We haven't seen them in the story in ages.

    ```
    Super excited to see where the Cyorian aranea come into play! He can't prove that he's from the looping world perfectly but for some people he has key memories of their most guarded secrets to help at least convince some of them. See Xvim and his passcode. For some people, he has also obtained enough of their skills where it is eerily impossible for something to not have happened and he can actually just show them what's going on in the Dungeon in order to at least convince them partially.

    I'm not sure how contingent belief in the loop for various characters are in specifically the fact that the spiritual realm was cut off in the looping world, because presumably the spiritual realm is now accessible again.

    Which begs the question... should Zorian attempt to call for the angels' help? Getting help from them could end up being a double edged sword. I can see a scenario where he could potentially leave a tip to operators of certain temples (and disguise himself to remain anonymous/untraceable), and the priests/priestesses at these institution could then relay this information to the angels.
    ```

    - u/borkula:
      ```
      There's no reason now not to let Spear of Resolve take a quick peak into his mind. He already knows that she's trustworthy (now that there's no timeloop she can exploit) and he is essentially a ready-made vassal that the Arenea have been wanting for some time now, they aren't going to just scramble his brains without any reason.
      ```

      Why would he not just tell the angels in person?
      ```

      - u/spanj:
        ```
        The same reason why people are worried about what Panaxeth said to Zorian: "be wary of Zach". The angels might not be so happy about a stowaway that exited the Sovereign Gate. People fear that Zach has a compulsion to remove mistakes caused by the Sovereign Gate. Contacting the angels will only make more people aware of this mistake.

        They could potentially recruit him for his help and then stab him in the back after the ordeal is finished. The gods were never portrayed as solely benevolent beings.
        ```

  - u/GWJYonder:
    ```
    I don't think that there will be too much of a concern with proving the loop, he's only really lost a couple items of proof:

    1. They won't be cut off from the spiritual world, which was a pretty big factor for at least Xvim.
    2. The Primordial cage won't be changed, although that only mattered to Silverlake, so it basically doesn't matter.
    3. The loss of the orb will lose Zorian a lot of research materials and other resources they may have stashed away.

    However, they knew they were going to lose the orb anyways, and they always have a couple contingencies. At the very least Zorian will still have all the notes (that he altered on to empty notebooks) that Zack and Zorian used to convince Alanic, Xvim, Kael, etc before they were given temporary marks. It seems likely that Zorian will have specifically updated those notebooks, as well as expanded them to most, if not all, of the people they gave temporary markers.

    This won't be as useful (for example someone like Taiven isn't going to have some sort of cryptokey generation prepared for such an event like Xvim and one of the spider colonies did), but it should be doable.

    I feel like the big question is "how soon can Silverlake convince Red Mage, and then perhaps Xuat Lichl." It could turn in to a race between the baddies assassinating the team members versus the good guys warning and helping them.

    The good news with that is that I doubt Silverlake will go and try to do murdering by herself, certainly she'd be leery of fighting Alanic and Xvim, even with surprise--that's why I think she'll go to Red Robe first. From there, however, Silverlake and Red Robe may team up to start killing people while a RR simulacrum convinces the Lich to support against the stronger members.

      I was surprised too, but - Zorian knows how his own mind works.

      Some people would conceptualize it as causing one copy to exist instead of two copies rather than murder.

          I think it is only because zorian is okay with dying to help himself. The simulacrums know what they are.

          He basically made a contract with himself before creating a simulacrum and intends to uphold it. If I wake up as a duplicate I will die to serve the real me.

              Yeah, I dont disagree.

        Simulacrums:  a very good point.  The one-choice-only nature in particular gathered my attention again, but indeed, that ship has sailed.

        (To put in in Omega box terms:  if you're the sort of person who would be willing to live by copy-killing, then there's no particular room for dissatisfaction if you die by copy-killing.)

        ((Edit:  Now reviewing my own original thought-pattern formation, in that when thinking of stories in which people go back in time and take action against their past selves, thinking of this as a failure state and much preferring precommitting to always cooperate with all other selves (any nature of copy), any copy breaking this being disowned as a copy, hopefully prompting cognitive dissonance in the mind of any copy contemplating that.))

        That's an interesting question.

        no.  he's the controller.  His soul is the only real one brought from the real world into the loop. So there is only one of him.

      Loopers first, prioritizing Silverlake. Red Robe is dangerous, sure, but he believes that he trapped Zach in the loop.

Silverlake is priority number one by a large margin.

      True, loopers first, if it's possible. But I think it's only possible to cripple their resources as the other loopers were probably only ejected only seconds away from when Zorian was ejected. They also are presumably on the move and 5 minutes has already elapsed along with however much time it took Zorian to conjure ghostly hands, divine for his body, and teleport to it.

      So... 

      1. Cripple loopers.
      2. Cripple low hanging Cultists/Ibasans
      3. Convince potential allies

      Are you sure those weren't just divine artifacts that they amassed? I recall Z&Z tinkering/dismantling with divine artifacts but not the Imperial Artifacts specifically. I could also be wholly wrong. 

      If they are replicas, there's still a chance that the memories are salvageable. If they are replicas, that means the Sovereign Gate itself stores the memories and not the orb. What could potentially happen is that the gate is programmed to eject all the memories into the real life orb upon completion of the final iteration. This would be helpful for the Gate's main use which is to prepare the Controller for whatever aims the gods have for him/her.

  A huge change in the stakes of the story too. One hand, Zorian doesn't have to worry about the impending collapse of the time loop and his soul with, and on the other he's now out of the time loop - no more second chances.

  And now he's got to decide who he tells about the time loop he just went through. There are the usual suspects, obviously, but I can't see him being particulalry open about it unless he needs to reel in some assistance and explain his knowledge.

  I also want to see how much, if at all, the next month differs from the inside of the time loop, what with the spiritual planes back in working order.

            Oh, right, that. More likely it would be a vanilla copy of Zorian though.

      Why would he be soul-killed? He didn't leave through the gate. Zach was most likely interacting with a fresh copy of Zorian in the next loop, to the extent that he interacted with him at all.
      ```

      - u/Luminous_Lead:
        ```
        Soul kill is the state of someone's soul being removed from the loop, right?  I imagine that since Zorian's soul has left the loop it can no longer be wiped clean and recycled, so there will be no Zorian to wake up in the remaining loops.  Effectively soul-kill.
        ```

        - u/ketura:
          ```
          It's the state of being marked for removal by the imperial dagger. Else I'm sure that people QI or other necromancers soul-destroy would start to pile up after years of looping.

          - u/Luck732:

          - u/zonules_of_zinn:
            ```
            so you think that the schoolmate that zach forgot about (and was found dead at the start) was got by the dagger, and not red robe who escaped?

            i think those bodies are actually piling up.
            ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Souls aren't getting wiped clean. They're being obliterated, because they're cut off from the spiritual realms and then their entire universe collapses (confirmed by author).

          Also, the Guardian made reference to a template being used to recreate the world.

          So, it appears that the Gate is keeping a full unaltered copy of all souls in storage, and then creating \*another\* copy  of each soul each time to actually go out and live in the world for a month.

          So there's no obstacle to recreating Zorian from the template; he'd just go back to how he was when the loop started.
          ```

        - u/Luck732:
          ```
          We actually don’t know, but Z&Zs prevailing theory was that a noncontroller leaving the loop would result in them being recreated as they were before they ever gained a temp marker.

          AKA Zorian would be his surly antisocial self for whatever restarts Zach still spends in the loop.

          Their 2nd theory is the soul killed one though, so it is possible that is the case.
          ```

          - u/YHallo:
            ```
            Yeah. They think that Veyers was soul killed by Red Robe as a red herring and that the *real* red robe was recreated normally when he left. So red robe is simply a normal person constantly being recreated at the beginning of each time loop now.
            ```

        - u/lmbfan:
          ```
          I don't think so. All souls are destroyed and recreated every loop unless marked for 6 loops or marked for removal by the knife, iirc.
          ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:

      He probably won't even stick around till next loop to see. The gate's unbarred right now and he'll have a hard time getting everything again by himself.
      ```

  - u/Gr_Cheese:
    ```
    I don't think it was explicitly stated that Zach gained soul sight independent from the Ring's ability. So it could be that Zach has no idea that Zorian made it out, the Guardian could stonewall Zach as it is apt to do.

    Just think of how amazing it would have been if we switched to Zach's PoV in the final fight, and seen Zorian take a bone bolt through the spine right before reaching the exit... Then having no idea whether or not Zorian succeeded. God damn that would have been powerful.

  ```
  So Fucking hyped for the next chapter, this one was absolutely incredible.

  I don't think we've seen the last of Zach, he almost certainly made it out as well. (From a Literary standpoint, Zach has had far to much screen time and mystery surrounding his forgotten past to die an implied off-screen death.)  However, I'm curious as to whether Zach will be an ally once Zorian tries to meet up with him in the real world. The last 13 or so loops would have gone by in a fraction of a real world second, so Zach should have arrived back to reality at nearly the same instant as Zorian. Will the probable mental compulsions placed upon Zach make him Zorian's enemy?  Can't wait to see.

  I'm also curious on how Zorian plans to handle the situation if that occurs, because most of combat magic was done by Zach. Even though Zorian has combat skills comparable to a skilled Combat Mage, and could probably win against most combat mages (Even Irrespective of his Mind Magic), he is nowhere near the level of master combat mages like Zach or Quatach-Ichl. He just doesn't have the mana. However, If Zorian could somehow replicate the divine energy frame around Quatach-Ichl's soul and double his base mana, that would go a long way to evening the playing field for Zorian. He may not have the time now that he's out of the time loop, but after all that analysis and destruction of the Divine artifacts, Zorian is the only mage even possible of pulling something like that off on his own.

  Seeing as how Zach's mana reserves allows him to cast about 250 force bolts, and Quatach-Ichl's mana reserves, with the crown, allows for around 3000 force bolts ( 300 \* 10 = 3000), doubling Zorian's mana from around 80 Bolts to 160 would definitely help him bridge his mana gap, while still allowing him to remain an underpowered character compared to his adversaries, having to rely on strategy and preparation to win. I really hope Zorian manages to get a mana power up like this, which I feel he desperately needs to take on Zach, but we will see. The wait is gonna kill me.
  ```

  - u/JuicyLem0nz:
    ```
    Yeah I really wanna see Zorian get a mana upgrade but there's probably not enough time even if he did know how to do it.

    His best bet against Zach is gonna be mind magic (hence working a way around mind blank). Hopefully he'll be able to fix whatever compulsions are in there, he'll definitely need his help against QI and Red Robe.
    ```

    - u/AuthorBrianBlose:
      ```
      There is the potential for him to get a divine blessing if an angel takes note of his talents.
      ```

      - u/BirdMustFeed0:
        ```
        Possible, but the angels may very  well try to kill him once they discover his presence, since he is an uncontrolled entity. One can not just assume the angels are benevolent, since it has been made clear that the gods were not. 

        It is implied that Zach has been mentally compromised by both the angels and Red Robe. Ignoring Red Robe, when one considers how weak zach was when the time loop started, its very easy to believe the Angels put layers upon layers of compulsions on Zach before sending him in. The sovereign gate's keys were scattered by the angels, and it hadn't been activated for millennia, because if used to its fullest extent it can turn humans mages into practical demigods. The angels wanted a demigod on their side to fight the Primordial, but due to Red Robe, Zach wasted most of his time and became simply a master mage. Regardless, I don't believe for a second that the angels would ever risk a rogue demigod coming out of the Sovereign gate. Zach had to be controlled. Since Zorian maintains his free will,  I don't think the Angels will be too happy when they realize there is a time looper not under there control roaming around.
        ```

        - u/YHallo:
          ```
          > The sovereign gate's keys were scattered by the angels

          As far as I know, this is never stated. Where are you getting that? As far as I know, the keys were lost due to the normal passage of time combined with the collapse of the Ikosian empire. 

          > The angels wanted a demigod on their side to fight the Primordial

          We don't know that. For all we know the angels actually just want Zach to stop the primordial from ever being released. 

          > Zach had to be controlled.

          There's no evidence that Zach "had to be controlled". In fact, the only evidence of compulsions so far point to someone trying to stop Zach from achieving his goals.
          ```

          - u/BirdMustFeed0:
            ```
            Of course there's no direct evidence stating Zach had to be controlled by the angels. However, just logically, it'd be in the angels very good interest to mind control Zach, because as I stated, the time loop allows for absurd power ups in mages if properly utilized. We know it's very likely he's under a mind control spell in some way, and its implied in chapter 90 that both the Angels and Red Robe put compulsions on his mind. If the angels did in fact put a compulsion on Zach's mind, it wouldn't take a rocket scientist to figure out their reasoning for it.

            The compulsion that Red Robe placed on Zach made him not achieve his goals, and this is what we have direct evidence for, but since it is implied the angels could have done stuff as well, it is probable that there are still mind compulsions placed on Zach by the Angels.

            As for the keyes, I may have misremembered that fact, so I will concede to your counterpoint as I'm not gonna search 40 chapters to try to find the text. I still think my original hypothesis stands, that Zach is under the Angel's control, but this is after all just theorizing at the end of the day.
            ```

        - u/AuthorBrianBlose:
          ```
          I don't think a human can ever rise to the level of the angels.  My understanding (based on memory) is that the angels are limited by divine commands on how much they are allowed to interfere in mortal affairs, and that is the only reason they employ mortal agents.

          The angels may oppose Zorian when they learn of him, but they would have the option to co-opt him.  Either by reasoning with him, or by mind/soul magic.
          ```

          - u/BirdMustFeed0:
            ```
            Maybe. We don't know the exact power level of the angels but if Zorian had been given the 20 extra years of time loops that that zach wasted fighting the Dragon, his power level would be far far higher. He likely would have figured out divine energies, which would vastly increase his base mana pool (Not just double it, since its possible he may have worked out a more powerful or efficient stabilization frame, and or just make himself ten rings that store the same mana as the crown.). Add to the that the extra experience from 20 years of study and combat, and Zorian is already approaching astronomical power levels.

             Yet the 60 or so years zach was supposed to get out of the loop is nothing compared to the 1,000 or so years that a fully charged Sovereign gate is supposed to give the controller. A normal mage, let alone a mage like Zorian who has perfect memory, would have an absurd amount of power after a thousand years of learning, practice and growth. Is it enough to Rival the Angels? I think so, but who knows. At the very least, describing them as demigods is a not unreasonable.
            ```

- u/GodKiller999:
  ```
  Him having to function as a pure soul entity is what happened after all, not quite the way I thought it would, but yeah. I wonder how much his mind magic improved while in the time dilated orb and wish there'd been more about what happened within it in general. Still amazing chapter overall, very exciting, we're finally at the last stretch.

  The fact that we never learned what was within Zach mind means that he'll make it, also that he won't be on Zorian side.

  \- Zach has no reason to use the Gate on the next loop, right? In theory, there's no harm in using up the rest of the available loops (30ish?) now that he doesn't have to worry about Zorian.

  \- ...Does Zach know Zorian survived? He has soul-sight, but if he wasn't using it at that moment, he just watched Zorian get pulped right before the bridge.

  \- I really hope Kael's research notes survive somehow (Zorian kept a backup copy in his brain?) I don't think we ever saw that final results of all his work.

    12-ish.

    They had [19 after recovering](https://m.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/84/) from QI's soul detonation, and they started placing temporary markers almost immediately after that.

    Those markers were due to expire after six restarts, at the end of the restart Zorian just left.

  - u/rtsynk:

    better question: does he have any reason to wait?

    ```

    - u/spanj:
      ```
      I mean he could potentially hone some low hanging fruit in terms of skills he thinks he needs to acquire to help him in the real world. Every little bit might count in the real world where life is much more precious.

      There's also no evidence that he will be soul killed in the next loop. The Gate will probably just use its template of Zorian to pop a new soul back into his recreated body.
      ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:

    Anything Zach does in the remaining loops was completed before Zorian reclaimed his body: remember the loops are massive time compression.

- u/burnerpower:

  What an amazing chapter. I can't wait to see what happens next and who exactly Zorian is targeting with the ability to pierce Mind Blank. The most obvious target is Zach but this could be potentially very useful against both Red Robe and Silverlake too. Not to even mention the general combat benefits. For a long time Zorian's biggest weakness has been that his specialty and most overpowered ability is countered by Mind Blank. If he can bypass it his opponent's only real option is to kill him before he gets into their mind. There will probably be some limitations though, I would be surprised if the author put in something as game changing as this without any limitations. 

  Random thought but if Silverlake had not accepted the offer they probably would have broke out much more safely. She accepted the death pact and all it will likely mean is she is killed by either Zach or Zorian. Pretty ironic.

  ```
  Now Zorian has a timeloop marker outside the (innermost) timeloop.

  Remember how the gods have disappeared long ago? I think there are two timeloops; an inner one of a month and an outer one of centuries. Zorian will loop in the outer one now by the authority of his marker.

  Next he will mindwipe himself and become QI. I am sure of it. Somebody write a fanfic about this.
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    Nah, that's Zach: he has the Magnitude 25 reserves, the divine blessing, the ability to be bested by Zorian's mind magic (which a future Zorian probably couldn't be), and a reason to be pissed off at Eldemar.

    He'd make a much better QI than Zorian.
    ```

  - u/Kachajal:
    ```
    That's such a cool theory. I don't think it'll work simply because it'd be one *hell* of a coincidence if the inner loop used the exact same mechanisms as the outer one, but it's a really neat connection you've made between the Gods going silent and the Angels doing the same.

      I don't think the marker was changed. Instead, whatever AI is managing it is now able to identify it as different (even when looping his wasn't as complete as Zach).Though at this point, it doesn't really matter.

- u/CaptainMcSmash:
  ```
  Damn. I suppose it wouldn't have fit the tone of the chapter but I was really hoping for a little section on the various reactions of governments around the world. Dunno why but my absolute favorite parts of this story are the descriptions of authority outrage whenever ZZ do some crazy shit. Consecutive raids on every black room facility on the continent. Christ, can you imagine the shitstorm that must be going on everywhere in the aftermath of that? 

  Also, it was a nice little moment when the eagle riders were mentioned again. Serves as a nice comparison between where they were before and where they are now. Whereas before they were impossible to fight, now the two are so OP the eagle riders have to back the fuck up.

                Fair enough. On that note, I have one final suggestion, for you to put into your no-doubt voluminous list of notes.

                There are many aspects to the world that you chose not to explore during the time loop, but one particular aspect was sorely missed. The Dungeon's true depths. I'd love to see an exploration into the serious, deep-deep-deep reaches of whatever is in the underworld. That particular aspect of your worldbuilding - a worldspanning, ever-more-alien, and inconceivably deep and dangerous and populated dungeon - is basically entirely original, as far as I know. I wish one of the Imperial Artifacts had been down there, so we could have seen Zach and Zorian explore the dark depths that even archmages fear to tred.

          Epilogue? Fuck that I'd pay 15 dollars for a fucking sequel where Zorian has more adventures as a master mage in the real world. It may not be possible for Nobody (Stories require conflict, and creating a good conflict for a sequel story can be very hard), but dammit if he manages to come up with a good sequel idea for Zorian I'd buy the hell out of that shit.

              Simmer down there friend. I know this is a fantasy story but at some point you gotta draw a line in the sand. I would never accept such an unreasonable, fantastical premise for a sequel. Even if I was overdosing on psychedelics, I'd still recognize this plot idea for the impossibility that it is. Zorian? Getting a girlfriend? Beyond Absurd. 

              I'm sorry to tell you this my guy, but your entire premise just makes no sense.

                      Which would lead to the single best line of the whole story:  "I know you didn't invite me back here just to show me your phylactery."

        ```

        - u/Watchful1:
          ```
          I mean, they all came out at exactly the same time right? The entire time loop happens within seconds at most. So Red Robe coming out years ago, Silverlake weeks, Zorian when he did, Zach potentially months from now at the end of the loops, all happened within seconds of each other. By the time Zorian was casting divination spells everyone was out.

          But only Zorian knows that the other two got out.  As far as Silverlake and Red Robe are concerned, no one else has escaped. (though silverlake knows about red robe)

          - u/hoja_nasredin:

          - u/CaptainMcSmash:

            Just because they *think* they were the only ones to escape, it would be extremely remiss of them to not do the due diligence and ensure their enemies can't stop them. Besides, it's not like either of the two would balk at killing two teenagers.

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      I kind of see what he means, even if we do get a few more chapters after this. The final conclusion isn't in much doubt, although the details of it are, there aren't too many mysteries left to solve, Zorian can't meaningfully get any more powerful in the one month before the story has to end compared to the years he spent in the loop, and there just isn't much that the antagonists could surprise him with in the final confrontation.  It's not over yet, but we can see the finish line pretty clearly.

            I definitely agree. Or even anything along these lines.

            My preferred fantasy method is always to merge with myself.

            That said, who knows if merging would actually cause him to regress some as a 50/50 merge, instead of throwing out the bad and keeping the good.

            I also wonder how "real" his soul is. Is there anything explicitly bad about killing the original, or are they actually (formerly) identical.

            Going along the idea that his start may have been an Angel's intervention, they may have intended what happened.

            I'm also sad that his mind/soul didn't have more storage space. Or better compression algorithms. I can't remember if he made a spell that stored an image of what was written, instead of a high detail copy. That would probably have been a worthwhile investment.
            ```

            - u/notagiantdolphin:
              ```
              I expect they're identical barring experience. The gatekeeper seemed convinced that everyone was a perfect copy, barring the controller who was brought in.
              ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    Zach might, if he doesn't exit the loop the normal way and have to wait to wake up.

    We don't know what he was able to keep, though.  The Orb was cracking and might have been destroyed, along with all the memories it contained.  Zach can't remember nearly as much as Zorian.  All of the temporary loopers are dead, and can't start looping again for another six restarts.

    Zach should be able to get back out, being the Controller, but it may be impossible to do the same for anyone else.  The knowledge of how to do so may be gone for good.
    ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      I don't think the Orb being destroyed would destroy the memories. Remember it's recreated from the template each time as well. I bet the memories are actually stored in the gate and just recreated with the Orb each time.

      They were frustrated about not having the Orb because they would have to leave it behind while serving as a door, not because it would be destroyed.
      ```

    - u/Johnsanders667:
      ```
      That means Zach's going to have to start over by himself. Hopefully he still makes out.
      ```

  - u/JuicyLem0nz:
    ```
    I think Zach's definitely going to get out, they unbarred the gate before the big showdown so as the controller he can make it back home. 

    Also from a story perspective Zach's missing memories is pretty much the biggest mystery right now and has been teased to much to not get a payoff.
    ```

  - u/CaptainMcSmash:
    ```
    Yeah, like even though it's been years since RR left, in the real world only seconds have passed. I hope Zorian remains cognizant of this because he really needs to get a fucking move on like right now. First priority is grab all his friends and family and deliver them to the Taramantula estate ASAP. Daimen's wife's family seem powerful enough to protect them.

- u/ConnorF42:

  Does anyone know the final loop count that Zorian experienced? And that Zach did if we have that info.
  ```

  - u/BirdMustFeed0:
    ```
    Total is 8.5 years in the outside time loops, but if you include the time spent in time dilation chambers it is at least 12 years total, maybe as high as 15 years. So in total Zorian spent somewhere between 12-15 years in the time loop and is around 30 years old.
    ```

    - u/D0nkeyHS:
      ```
      That makes him extremely talented.
      ```

      - u/Luck732:
        ```
        True, but he had some pretty crazy advantages besides the time.
        ```

        - u/BirdMustFeed0:
          ```
          Time in a time loop is different from regular time. You can avoid social responsibilities and suffer no consequences.  You can not show up for work or class and spend money like its going out of style and suffer no consequences. You can ignore social interactions or taboo's at no social costs. Did you miss your friends birthday and now he no longer wants to help you on your personal work? Who cares. In a month he'll no longer be angry with you, and you can ask him to help you then. You have much more free time to do what you want, and alot less stress in your life, when interactions like these are no longer a requirement for you. A large part of our lives are just spent treading water, so to speak, so once you stop top trying to maintain your reputation, social circle, lifestyle, or finances, a substantial amount of time opens up to you. 

          A time loop is particularly helpful for teaching a person combat, illegal activities, and dangerous hobbies.

          Doing an important experiment that might kill you? Who cares. Safety precautions would just slow down your work. Poisons or cancerogic compounds matter not to to you. Without the fear of an arrest, you can learn to rob and swindle people to your heart's content. Combat can be learned at your pace and stress free. In the real world, if you screw up any of these dangerous pursuits, you'd be dead, kidnapped, in prison, etc. You don't get a second chance to learn from major mistakes in a real life or death situation. Since people learn how to do things by repetition and correcting their past mistakes, learning in these dangerous situations is limited. At best, you can only correct minor mistakes, since major mistakes will just get you killed. Training for dangerous activities in safe, hypothetical scenarios can help get around this issue, but it will never be the same as the real thing. A practice scenario on how to defend against a guy trying to kill you in a defense class, where safety precautions are enforced, will always be different than learning how to defend yourself against an actual guy who is trying to kill you. 

          In short, you can't just look at the number of years Zorian has been inside the loop and determine his original potential. He's had far more opportunities and time to practice his talents than any equivalent time frame in the real world could allow.

  We're really in the endgame now people. Pretty sure Zach made it out as well with the gate unbarred, also his muddled memory has been teased too much for it not to be payed off. 

  Silverlake is going to be top priority to deal with first (unless Zach has been mind magicked to attack Zorian). Hopefully Zorian can get the original Silverlake to join them seeing as the looper version is most definitely going to try and kill her og self.

  ```
  Okay I definitely wasn't expecting the exit to happen this chapter but I am so happy it did - I was on the edge of my seat for much of the chapter. Very curious what Zorian found in Zach's mind, and what he'll be doing to fiddle with the loop. Also, how will things be different now that he's in the real world?

  ...will we see a return of the Cyorian Aranea? I totally haven't been hoping for that ever since they started messing with markers...

  I think it'll be a while, but one thing I look forward to is more character interaction time. We haven't really had much of any for the past arc as the crunch to escape the loop has gotten more and more intense, and I doubt we'll see much for a while as Zorian will have to work against Silverlake (maybe) and with the time loop (probably). I just remember that some of the reasons I fell in love with this story were Zorian exploring the world, learning magic, getting to know and interact with his classmates and friends, etc. The last arc had been really devoid of that type of character development, and that may have been unavoidable just because of the plot structure, but I still miss it.

  How legitimate do people think QI's faith in the angels is? And if he is right to regard them as he does, how does that change things with Silverlake? Might she be of the same opinion, and part of why she was so willing to take Panaxeth's deal was she doubted it mattered? I forget the exact terms of the deal, so it might be that Panaxeth forces her to work against the angels... If she isn't forced to, and QI is right about their capabilities (assuming such capabilities go beyond Z&Z), and Silverlake is unaware of that, did she just become a much smaller problem to deal with?

  Is Zorian a lich now? He can go from body to body and make bodies.

    - u/LLJKCicero:
      ```
      So just having the capacity to swap bodies and having a phylactery bound as your reset point makes you a lich? Even if you're still actually in your original (more or less) body?
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        I think being dead is also a requirement, as a lich is generally considered to be undead.

        Whether Zorian would be considered "dead" is a good question.  After all, his original body doesn't exist anymore.  But then, his *original* body has been dead for years, ever since QI first cast that spell on him and Zach.

        My *guess* would be, even if he had a phylactery, that people wouldn't think of him as a lich for the same reason people don't think of a platypus as a mammal: he might meet all the criteria, but *that's just not what those look like*. But for that kind of technical hair splitting, I think you have to ask the author.

          >But then, his original body has been dead for years, ever since QI first cast that spell on him and Zach.

          That's not his original body. It was just the latest in a very long line of copies.

          Although I guess you could say that it was the original body for the predatory soul-copy that has just burst out of the loop and stolen Zorian Kazinski's body.

            Yes it is. His soul and that body were created at the same time within the time loop.

          - u/Nimelennar:

            Yes, that's what I meant.  Loop-Zorian is the entity that might be considered a lich, not Zorian-Prime.

  How do you deal with a QI who knows everything about you?

  You have to assume that one of Silverlake's top priorities (after killing the OG Silverlake, because you can't trust that backstabbing bitch and this house isn't big enough for the two of us) is going to QI as he's the one most directly responsible for springing Pan
  ```

- u/RockLeethal:
  ```
  99% sure Zorian will get bitten in the ass by his self-sacrificing habits - that is, his willingness to maim or kill himself to achieve goals because the reset will fix everything. Obviously he knows now that he cant do that, but he's been in that kind of mindset for over a decade now, I'm sure it's habit to an extent now.
  ```

  - u/ThePotatoeGamer:

    I think you mean Zach, because Zorian has spoken on how he's not going to act suicidal in the loop to avoid killing himself outside the loop.

      has he? I just remember a couple times recently zorian sacrificing body parts and such to ensure success because theres no real permanency to it, so hes apt to do the same by accident in the real world, IMO

      - u/ThePotatoeGamer:
        ```
        It happened once or twice like with him losing the arm but it was always a do or die moment of great importance, but Zorian would always try his hardest to avoid these.

        Zach's the one who would optimize thing by throwing himself at a wall, dying, and then using his his experience to make slightly more progress.

    He all but certainly did. Even disregarding any Doylist reasoning for him making it out, Zach was never dependent on any special method to get out once the Gate was unbarred. Panaxeth couldn't stop him leaving, so the Guardian could simply place him into his own body. He may have died in that final fight, but all that would mean is that the loop would restart, and he would get reset to his home. After that, he just needs to go to the Gate and request to leave, which is trivial for him at this point.

      Unless the Gate was barred again by Zorian's exit. In which case, he'd have to retrieve the Key again, including beating QI without Zorian's help. And all the temporary loopers have expired, so he's on his own with convincing all their other allies.

            The Guardian's a computer program just following its directive. It's directive is to prevent anyone besides the controller from leaving. However, Zach is the controller, so it should not be able to stop him from leaving.

            - u/ivory12:

              In theory. Irregularities in its behaviour have been noted before, both here and by Zorian. That said, narrative would say Zach gets out; his tampered memories still need to be resolved.

  We think Zach is the original one because the Guardian recognize his mark as that of original one.

  We know of at least two individuals who have left the simulation previously, Red Robe and Silverlake.  Red Robe got out a lot of restarts ago; Silverlake just got out.  Red Robe could have had a lot of time to prepare, outside, depending.  

  If it's even one day outside for every restart... how many total restarts have there been?  How many were there before Zorian got pulled in?  Certainly more than 30... 

  We won't know for sure until the next update.  I await with bated breath.

    If what the protagonists have been told is true, all the loops were compressed into a matter of seconds in the real world. So Red Robe (and Silverlake) have had only moments to prepare longer that Zorian will.

    Oh course, both probably have more resources in the real world that Zorian does. Silverlake can (probably) overpower her double fairly quickly. We don't know know for sure who Red Robe is, but he's adept at making friends with the invaders without outside help. Zorian, meanwhile, lost all his gear, first sacrificing it to hold the portal and then losing his body with whatever he had left. He'll have to rebuild.
    ```

    - u/Arno_Nymus:
      ```
      I actually doubt that Silverlake could overpower her double easily. Zorian became an expert at soul magic inside the loop. That means to him it was easy to possess his own body. Silverlake was not long enough in the loop and she was also already an expert at soul magic. If we assume that the soul that owns a body has a slight advantage both souls power level should be nearly identiacal.
      ```

      - u/YHallo:
        ```
        Silverlake has a physical body make by Panaxeth... she doesn't need soul magic. Silverlake also knows how all of Silverlake Prime's defenses work and can probably easily subvert or co-opt them. And lastly she has the element of surprise.
        ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    It's been *decades* since the loop started, and not only is Zorian at home, asleep in his bed (he'd be in Cyoria if it were even a single day later), it's still dark out.

    By that math, (>20 years : <8 hours), the acceleration factor is at least 22,000:1 (and probably *much* higher, I'm probably low balling it by at least five orders of magnitude).

    At that rate, with a one-month head start, Silverlake has had, at most, two minutes out of the loop.  Red Robe might have an hour or two, but, as I said, I'm giving an absolute worst-case scenario; my guess is that he's been out for seconds, if that.
    ```

  ```
  Did we ever find out who Red Robe is?

  Do Red Robe and Silverlake know enough about Zorian to attack him in his home?  Do they know enough about artifacts, treasure, and allies Zorian needs to get there first?  Will they ally with each other?  Will either of them bring Quatach-Ichl up to date?

  What has Zach been up to in his remaining loops?  How much preparation can he do without Zorian?  Does he know Zorian made it?  

  Do our heros have a good plan for after the loops, considering (1) what they learned in the last loop when they met Panaxeth and (2) only Zorian got out?

    > Did we ever find out who Red Robe is?

    no

    > Do Red Robe and Silverlake know enough about Zorian to attack him in his home?

    Red Robe, no

    Silverlake, she may or may not know his home address immediately, but she can find it fairly quickly

    >  Do they know enough about artifacts, treasure, and allies Zorian needs to get there first?

    Zorian doesn't need any artifacts or treasure simply to stop the invasion per se

    Silverlake certainly knows the allies Zorian has used in the past

    > Will they ally with each other?

    not immediately as Red Robe doesn't even know Silverlake exists and Silverlake doesn't know who Red Robe is

    > Will either of them bring Quatach-Ichl up to date?

    most certainly, which is their best chance for meeting each other

    > What has Zach been up to in his remaining loops? 

    most likely he left asap in the next loop

    > How much preparation can he do without Zorian?

    none, they've already done all the prep they can

    > Does he know Zorian made it?

    he will once Zorian is found soul-killed at the beginning of the next loop

    > Do our heros have a good plan for after the loops

    well, they have A plan, but how good it is remains to be seen

    > (2) only Zorian got out?

    Zach can easily get out the next loop. The gate is unbarred and he's the main controller
    ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    It's been so long that I don't remember what Red Robe knew, but Silverlake absolutely does. She had plenty of time and opportunities to get nosy, and given that she probably considered (or even planned on) backstabbing the lot of them, she certainly would have made contingencies.

  Can someone remind me please - why was Zach, a random high school kid, made the Controller in the first place?
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    Noveda bloodline is the best guess. The rest of the family died in the plague, so if there's any connection between them and the previous Sovereign, Zach's the only inheritor.
    ```

  - u/JuicyLem0nz:
    ```
    I think they theorised a while ago it had something to do with him being from an noble house. Also he's got crazy amounts of mana which he can still shape well (which is supposed to be super hard).
    ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      IIRC didn't he acquire the mana reserve inside the simulation/time loop?
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        They definitely grew in the normal way, and he had that divine blessing to double his reserves put on him before entering the loop, but he had really big reserves from the start. He mentioned early on that he's a magnitude 50 in terms of Mana reserves, but can shape like a magnitude 25. Given the blessing doesn't affect shaping skill, we can assume he started out at a magnitude 25, which is far above the average of 8-12.
        ```

        - u/bludvein:
          ```
          Was it ever confirmed whether Zach even had a divine blessing? I thought that was a theory.
          ```

          - u/sicutumbo:
            ```
            Umm, not conclusively, but it would be really odd if it wasn't the case. He mentioned he had shaping skills like someone with half his mana, he got the marker from a mysterious divine source (so we know he had contact with a divine entity), his mana situation matches exactly with the way QI describes how he got lots of mana, etc. It's pretty implausible that his huge mana reserves are cause by anything else.
            ```

          - u/burnerpower:
            ```
            Not sure if it was confirmed in a previous chapter, but they mention it in passing here. Zach definitely has a divine blessing. "Well, except for Zach. His fellow time traveler was sitting cross-legged on the floor with his eyes clothes, trying to sense the divine energies of his divine blessing and Controller marker. Zorian was not sure why he was doing that, to be honest. Both he and Zach had already succeeded at perceiving these divine energies,"
            ```

      - u/Luck732:
        ```
        Zorian thinks back to how he though Zach was just a bad student, but that maybe this was unfair since Zach had to deal with manashaping with effectively level 25 reserves.

        This implies he had these reserves before the loop.

  ```
  Anyone else think that the whole thing with Zach potentially turning on Zorian once he's outside is just a massive red-herring and the Mind Blank circumvention method is just a countermeasure against Silverlake, who is fully aware of his capabilities by now?
  ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    mind combat is the least of her worries. it'd be easier to take her out via normal combat

    &#x200B;

    also Zorian wouldn't bother with that route either for same reason
