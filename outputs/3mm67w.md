    Hell is subject to market forces-- evidently there's some sort of demand for goat blood (perhaps it's a delicacy?) that they can't meet themselves.

    As a self-contained work, it's fairly rational-- Hell has use for goat blood, and uses their ability to generate "stuff" to get it (munchining their ability to generate "Stuff".) Heaven has some use for worship, and uses their own abilities to get them. Humans want stuff, and employ their ability to generate goat blood and worship. It sounds like everyone is benefiting.

    The setting and all characters dont necessarily need to be rational, but the primary character does. Satan can be irrational, but the humans gaming him can make it a rational work.

    Bribe the poor to negotiate for you, with a promise of compensation.

        Yes.  After all, you're giving a *promise* of compensation, it wouldn't work with an actual binding contract.  Temptation galore.

  SMBC has a predictable flavour to this kind of thing by now. The grooves are well worn.

  First, postulate something interesting.

  Second, ignore all ways that it wouldn't work like you think.

  Third, Reductio ad absurdum.

  "Taco" "Flavor."

  That is all.
