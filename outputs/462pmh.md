## Are there any good movies/fanfics/books/comics/etc with a power/magic system that's rigidly defined and munchkinned by the protagonist.

  The powers in Mistborn are all highly specific abilities in their applications and uses. I'd definitely recommend it.

    Seconded.  Fights are often-times won through a clever realization pertaining to the magic system.  The characters do tend to be more intuitive in their realizations, as opposed to sitting down and thinking hard, but it's possible for the reader to predict what's going to happen before the characters do it.

    Everything by Brandon Sanderson is like this.  I'd actually say that Warbreaker is a better fit for this exact question, but Mistborn, Elantris, Stormlight Archives, and maybe Steelheart all work.

      While not in line with the original question, I'd also recommend the Codex Alera for the same sort of clever protagonist feeling. Magical abilities exist (basically magical summonable pokemon) and the main character has to work around that he is the only person who has no ability to use it.

  Mother of Learning is a very enjoyable online piece that's still ongoing, it's essentially a 'Harry Potter and the Day of Groundhog' with it's own nuances.

  The Two Year Emperor will probably match your criteria exactly, it involves a D&D player from our world being transported to a AD&D based world, and munchkinninning his way to victory.

  Magic in the Inheritance Cycle is very rigidly defined. There isn't much munchkining done by Eragon, though, mostly because most of the low-hanging fruit was already taken after thousands of years of study by immortal elves. Zero energy expenditure methods of killing? At least twelve discovered. External power sources? Loads. Time travel? Many have tried. They all died. Not recommended. Resurrection? Not possible, you'll die. Healing? Just need to know the right words.

  Edit: Teleportation? Really expensive, too expensive to do with humans, but doable. Long-distance communication? Impractical for non-mages, highly useful for mages. Radiation sheilding? Obscure, but extant. Detonating your own atoms as a last-ditch effort? Done. Twice. Spells specifically for dulling swords so you can practice with them? Yup. Magic goldmine? Impractical for most purposes, but still used. Immortality ritual? It works on whole species and takes many centuries or perhaps milennia to actually result in immortality. Mind magic? Primary method for mages to fight each other.

  Say what you will about Paolini's characters or plot, he has taking advantage of every aspect of magic down to an art.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Seconding. The plot is meh (though for purposes of disclosure, I loved it at 15, which IIRC was the age that Paolini published Eragon), but the magic system is well-defined, well explored, and well munchkined. 

    For example, as horrific as it was, the Army-level warfare in book 3 was realistic and very well done. Magicians would ward large groups of soldiers, and if the magician died, you could 1HKO large swathes of enemy mooks by bursting a blood vessel in their brain or something with minimal MP expenditure.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      I try to tell people in r/books that, despite its other flaws, Eragon has an excellently explored magic system, but they claim it rips of Earthsea or WoT and then ignore what it did right, when they're really not that similar in practice.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Honest question: how are they fundamentally different? In both cases it's "words of power change reality just by speaking them". Eragon focuses on the magic much more -- Wizard of Earthsea is about characters -- but the magic systems are identical as far as I recall.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Earthsea, you are a poet. Eragon, you are a lawyer.
          ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          I'm going to preface this by saying that I haven't read Earthsea, so what I know about it's magic system is gleaned off of wikis and previous arguments, so if I misrepresent something, please tell me.

          Now, I can see why you think the magic systems are similar-- there's a language where things have true names, and also people have true names, and knowing that true name gives you control over something.

          The first difference is that Earthsea's true names are more like giving directions, while Eragon's Ancient Language is more like writing laws. In earthsea, if you say a string of true words, the universe will conform to the meaning of those true words. In Eragon, if you say a string of words in the ancient language, some effect that could be interpreted as having the same meaning as the words said will happen, but what exactly happens is largely up to the interpretation of the magician. If you say "a fireball materializes in front of me" in earthsea, you get a fireball. If you say that in the ancient language, you might interpret that increasing the heat of the air so that it combusts, raising nearby flammable materials into the air and setting them on fire, materializing a fireball (the candy) in front of you, setting a ball on fire, or even something more esoteric like granting yourself laser eyes because your particular interpretation of those words was that you'd convert your own body fat into energy using a combustion reaction, and then your eyeballs would have a material effect on the world in front of you.

          The second difference is that the ancient language is actually completely unnecessary to cast magic in IC. Not using it is the usually height of stupidity because of the third difference (energy is derived from biological processes, so if you use too much energy you're dead as a doornail), but it's possible to cast magic nonverbally. Indeed, there isn't even specifically magical about the Ancient Language. In earthsea, there's some mysticism involved in having the dragons, paragons of balance, speaking in a fundamentally magical tounge. In eragon, it's an engineering decision. Magic was too unpredictable because it was hard to concentrate, so the precursors decided to cast a spell that let magicians limit the possible effects of their magic.

          And speaking about that third difference, it's actually what plays the largest role in making the magic systems different. From limiting the potential scale of IC magic (creating a thunderstorm, like in Earthsea, would literally kill more or less every single human in Alagaesia) to forcing IC magicians to abide by MAD (to make sure your spell will penetrate their wards, you're likely going to have to kill yourself too) to incentivizing more minimalist use of magic (a magical flashbang is showed off as one of the more effective uses of magic in the series.)

          I'm not going to say that the magic systems aren't *similar* but saying they're identical because they both use words to cast spells doesn't really make sense.
          ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          Haven't read Earthsea, but is the energy for magic drawn directly from your own biological chemical energy? If you try to do too much, or cast a spell you can't sustain or complete, do you drop dead in that system? Because that was the coolest mechanic of Inheritance magic, that it didn't violate conservation of energy.
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            The mechanics are never really discussed -- the story is about characters, not physics.  People do very large things -- cause storms, calm earthquakes -- that would suggest that no, it comes from somewhere else.
            ```

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    And for the 12 methods of zero energy killing, they didn't just munchkin MP savings, they even munchkined ease of casting- every one of those spells only take *one word* in such a way that they're obvious application of that word.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      And, Eragon later develops a word which encompasses all twelve, so he can rapidly check if someone's defenses have dropped, and kill them instantly if they have.
      ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Though, to be fair, the Ancient Language functions like a natural language rather than a programming language. Your interpretation does matter, as long as your words are vague enough.
      ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    How about bringing livestock into battle for magic reserves?
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Gems can be used to store magic.  The elves are vegetarians... so they might avoid doing this, but iirc, Eragon basically waits around where animals and being butchered and takes their energy as they die and stores it in gems he has prepped.

      [Spoiler for stuff about Galbatorix:](#s " Galbatorix has no need for this because he has a stockpile of dragon souls he has broken to his will to use for raw power.")
      ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Yup, that falls under external energy sources. Downside is that you have to invade their minds to do it, so you feel it when they die.
      ```

      - u/DCarrier:
        ```
        Upside is you when the battle, so you don't feel yourself dying.

        I only read the first two books, but I distinctly remember a lack of livestock in the battles.
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          Eragon does it before several battles in later books. The two main problems with the technique are are that you can only use energy able to be metabolized right now, so you can't dry your target into a withered husk, and using it requires concentration, concentration you need to keep off enemy mages. It's far more efficient to drain motive energy from yourself on resting days and store it for later use.

          Also, unless you want to ward cattle, and cows you brought to the field could also be used by the enemy, and at that point why not just drain your own dying soldiers?
          ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          [Don't read this unless you have already read book #3-4.](#s " The lack of livestock is because it's a secret that one can steal energy from any creature you are in contact with, including humans. The reason for this being such an important secret is because if Galbatorix found out, he wouldn't think twice about killing off all life on at least half of the continent and become all-powerful. Hence most Riders never learned this and Eragon only found out due to being the hero who needed to beat the mad King. I can't remember if this happened, but I think he was told to commit suicide if he was ever in danger of revealing this secret to Galbatorix.")
          ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Inconvenient. You'd need to assign some of your limited magi to ward the livestock, else they'd get words of death'd. Also, how are you going to keep them near enough to drain in the middle of army warfare? Also also, how are you going to design wards where they cannot be word of death'd nor drained by enemy magi, but are drainable by your or your allied magi? 

          No, using high class gems with lots of stored was most efficient.

  Rick Cook's "Wiz Biz" series is about munchkining magic by applying programming techniques. And how that can go wrong.
  ```

  - u/Geminii27:
    ```
    Not to mention the downsides - given that he's not able to toss around high-level spells, if he wants a high-level effect he has to sit down and work out the 'code' for it, then test it - he can't just fire off a new type of spell whenever he likes. Then there's the problems with *dd* and Alfie.

  I like to see munchkinning in stories which have been serialized over a long time (comics and some low-budget TV shows), and have a lot of Evil Invention / Alien Device -of-the-week episodes. No-one ever comes along and says "Well, hang on, if we combine technologies X, Y, and Z, wouldn't we get something really cool? Or even if we just used a bunch of them in parallel instead of each one only being around for one episode?"

  It's one reason I like parts of *With This Ring* - the protagonist doesn't just rely on the xenotech power ring to do everything (even if power rings are awesome), he actively seeks out, hoards, and remixes all kinds of technologies and weird-ass devices and weapons from the DC universe. *And* he treats magic and alien abilities and psionics and demons and who-knows-what as just additional fields that can have the scientific principle applied (or at least have a bunch of cool gadgets he can swipe).

    Is *With this Ring* any good?

    I picked it up, read some really hackney SI-fic stuff (suddenly muscles, ermagerd ladies, etc) in the first few minutes, and dropped it like a hot stone.
    ```

    - u/Geminii27:
      ```
      Some of it is (to an extent) parody and gently self-aware humor, and the SI character does get taken down several pegs and beaten to hell by a lot of people later on. Stuff like the muscles are presented as side-effects of not knowing what the ring can do initially, later used as humor, and are even referred to as an example of the character's limitations later on, as while he can theoretically change his body shape, he is psychologically limited to 'the muscles' (in one timeline, at least) due to not being able to *want* to tone it down enough.

      The story is generally considered to be a good example of Showed Their Work, as a lot of more obscure DC characters from various comic runs show up in one form or another, and are for the most part either true to their origins or plausibly altered by the timeline changes.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      It's really active if you're into stories that never stop updating, but plotwise it was pretty disappointing. The SI element quickly becomes pointless since power rings are extremely broken. A bit too dry and unambitious for me.

  Some self-promotion since you've already read some of my other recommendations. I write "hard magic", rules oriented fantasy with pretty clear reasoning for my characters. The first book is [Forging Divinity](http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/), and the second book, [Stealing Sorcery](http://www.amazon.com/Stealing-Sorcery-Broken-Mirrors-Book-ebook/dp/B016IPJ1R8/), has even more of it.

  Some characters do more munckinry than others, and in different circumstances; Taelien is very good at combat optimization, but he doesn't utilize his skill set as much outside of combat. Jonan is pretty much the opposite, and Lydia falls somewhere in between.

  Fair warning that my writing can come across as "video gamey" - I'm a game designer for a RPG company (Obsidian), and it comes across to some extent in my work. 

  I recommend looking at the preview chapter to see if you like the style of it.

    ```
    So, you recommended your book and I picked it up on kindle, but after getting 30% into the book or so, I'm finding difficult to keep moving forward. Do you pick up pace or are the characters endlessly deliberating?
    ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      It speeds up somewhat mid-way into Chapter 8 (which is just after the 50% mark), and there are definitely more action scenes in that chapter and beyond it. Most people tend to think one of the parts of Chapter 8 is the best part of the book, so since you're close, you might want to consider reading that scene and seeing if you like it. You could even skip ahead if you're into that kind of thing, and if you like the scene enough, go back and catch up.

      Discussing options is definitely a part of the style of the book, so that's still going to happen later on (albeit less and less as things get crazier). The second book has less of that because a lot more of the second book is "solo" content, but I still prefer to have characters actually think and plan their actions. That's an element of what makes this books (mostly) rational, but it's definitely not a style of writing that suits everyone. Even I have to be in the right mood for it.
      ```

      - u/Dwood15:
        ```
        Yes, I love deliberations, but where I'm at, it's become difficult to continue reading, but since you mention chapter 8, I'll keep going to at least that ch 9-10. 

        You have a good premise, and I can sense there's a definite magic system, and I am excited to keep reading it, if only to learn the system.

    I wouldn't say FiO is rigidly defined, from our perspective anyway. 

    I assume you're thinking of the limitations on CelestAI. But as readers, we don't get access to whatever binary code rigidly defines them. So we can't predict how they'll work in practice, or admire CelestAI's cleverness when it routes around them. The author could've made CelestAI do *anything* by claiming the existence of a hidden loophole in its hidden code, and we'd just have to accept it.
