## What rational novels could I find in a bookstore?

### Post:

Many of my favorite novels are rational fics, but a lot of those are fanfiction or web novels, rather than real life ones. Which rational novels might I be able to find at a bookstore like half-price books or Barnes & Noble? I'm in a book club and I wanted to share my favorite novel, "Three Worlds Collide" by Eliezer Yudkowsky, but there is no physical book version, and the pdf has at least a couple of really annoying typos, and I'm not sure if I can afford to print copies of the novel for everyone in the book club, and they're pretty firm on using physical books and not audiobooks or online novels. That seems to rule out MOST if not ALL of my favorite novels. Any recommendations? The first thing that comes to mind is "the Two-Year Emperor" but I don't know if that's only in ebook format or whether it also comes in a physical book format.

Some recommendations would be much appreciated.

Thanks!

  Some ideas are:

  [Ted Chiang's Short Stories](http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1931520720)

  The [Jumper Series](http://www.amazon.com/Jumper-Steven-Gould-ebook/dp/B003Y5HCXG/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1433192941&sr=1-3&keywords=jumper+series) for a good treatment of teleportation.

  [Blindsight](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003K15EKM/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=CEAXUAH4BUHV&coliid=IF945GHFXN2P8) and [Echopraxia](http://www.amazon.com/dp/076532802X/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=CEAXUAH4BUHV&coliid=I23BYBUF8SBA29) by Peter Watts, although Blindsight is [free](http://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm) as a pdf on his website.

  [The Martian](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EMXBDMA/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=CEAXUAH4BUHV&coliid=I2ZSRRMKIOZZK3) for how to survive on Mars.

  Finally, there's the first 17 chapters of HPMOR provided as a [free physical book](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mM-jgiy9teaINEED0WvXCCEZD12FP1m7Qn6vnYLZ4kM/viewform). But they prefer that you order multiple copies to spread knowledge about HPMOR rather than just one for yourself. So ordering a bunch to give to your reading group is perfect.

  Blindsight (Peter Watts) comes to mind.

  Most things by Charles Stross - in particular, I recommend Glasshouse.  It's in the same universe as Accelerando, but personally I found it much easier to read (it has a much more conventional narrative structure, a less confusing cast of characters, etc.).  Despite being an off-shoot of sorts, it's very self-contained and still makes perfect sense without reading Accelerando, though obviously the context will bring something to the table.

  ```
  *The Steerswoman's Road* is pretty good. The target demographic is probably young adults (sort of like Jumper, maybe a little more adult-friendly), although the 2nd/3rd book in the series, *The Lost Steersman*, "has people who like good hard-SF adventures" as the target demographic.

  Terry Pratchett (most relevant to your interests might be Moist von Lipwig's books, starting with *Going Postal*, which can indeed be read without prior exposure to Discworld).

  Have you read Iain Banks' *The Algebraist* yet? You should! Though it does get a bit long in places, so if you haven't read any Iain Banks, you should start with the very tightly-paced *Player of Games* or *Look to Windward*.
