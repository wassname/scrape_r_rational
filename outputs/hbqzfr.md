## RTS power fantasy

### Post:

Does RTS power fantasy exist? Usually we have isekai that are classic RPG power fantasy. You upgrade your stats, maybe a couple of companions and then the author is unable to maintain proper power levels and it degenerates.  


I mean stuff where we have distinct enemy factions and the protagonist upgrading and building fortifications and armies.  Stuff like world of Prime or Daniel Black ( besides his strange sexual themes). Lines can be blurred with a normal isekai and yet a RTS approach allows us to see the end game much better without getting lost with an overpowered protagonist and nothing to do.   


What do you think? Do yo know other instances? Do you believe it is worth calling it a separate genre?

  Would the large amount of fanfics involving planetary annihilation/total annihilation/supreme commander count, in your opinion?

    If you are talking about cross-fics I have issue with commanders holding massive idiot balls. Any instance of supcom in a world of Worm, for example, will completely trivialize anything if they just spend a little time on scaling up. Infinitely replicating army of self-sufficient drones doesn't really offer itself for a challenge.

      Worm is one of the few universes where that approach runs into definite problems, actually. Scion is a powerful precog and can casually kill a Commander. So is and can the Simurgh, and a few parahumans.

    I have not read even one. Any link?

      There are a bunch of these on Sufficient Velocity. Search SupCom or planetary annihilation in the creative forums age you'll find them. There are a few with the Zerg as well where someone isekais as the overmind.

        This brings my issue with SV SB and AH. I have no idea how to navigate the sites. Too much stuff is there. On FF you can sort stuff by number of views and have a fast read through reviews. How the hell you find good stuff on the  SV SB and AH?
        ```

        - u/JackStargazer:
          ```
          You can sort by word count and thread replies. That's usually the best way to find the long running ones. Most of the shit ones peter out.
          ```

        - u/BoxSparrow:
          ```
          The easiest way is to sort by "First message reaction score", which is just the number of likes/reacts the first post of each thread receives.

  Seems like a subset of military fantasy/sci-fi? Like Practical Guide To Evil has a lot of bits upgrading military units and army compositions. I'm not actually sure what would be different to make it more RTS-like. Focusing on upgrading units even more? Putting a gamey layer of upgrade trees and numbers on top of it?

  They aren't super rational but like [The Swarm of War](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7080862/1/The-Swarm-of-War) and [Factory Isolation](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/factory-isolation-si-multicross.30535/reader/) Have bits and pieces of what you sound like you want. Also [Thousand](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/thousand-40k-multicross.30012/reader/) and [Saruman of the many devices](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7568728/1/Saruman-of-many-Devices) again have elements but like well RTS in general are kind of dead. WilyCoyotee is right in asking if the grey goo supreme commandery type fics are what you want then there are a bunch of them. But like in terms of the purely rts type fic conversions its like on the hand hard to make a whole cloth system and like theres kind of an issue of character interactions beyond like oh this is an interesting tech or usage of units.

  [Fallout: Nuclear Metal](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fallout-nuclear-metal-au-self.651417/reader/) also has elements but it's mostly as a side part and not the main focus of fic

    thousand sounds interesting.  
    Which version would you recommend the old one [https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/thousand-40k-multicross.30012/reader/](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/thousand-40k-multicross.30012/reader/) or the newer one [https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/by-any-other-name-thousand-reboot.50330/reader/](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/by-any-other-name-thousand-reboot.50330/reader/)

      The older one gets farther but goes a little mad in terms of ecalating the scope while the second doesn't do as much and is much more calculated i guess but it doesn't fit the rts esque vibe.
      ```

  I think its hard to write a relatable MC.  Like in MC your really distinct form the stuff happening on screen.  Like sometimes you have a commander that's "you" but its just a better unit in reality.  And battles are really separate.  Like even in campaigns you have to re-build every game.
  ```

  I don't think RTS is the wording I'd use, it's not real time, strategy is a good enough descriptor though I get it, but I do prefer tactics games like XCOM over rts.

  &#x200B;

  I've frequently requested and praised on the use of power caps and the fact that it allows for unit vs unit and large scale conflicts rather than no power cap scenarios. Examples of these are more generally found in published books rather than webfiction though.

  &#x200B;

  An example that comes to mind if Prince of Thorns. There are no super powerful people in that world. But the MC is Evil, read the first chapter if you can handle him the story and writing are top tier. You can find it for free if you look hard enough.

  &#x200B;

  Historical fiction in general, including alternative histories also tend to have these elements present in them. If you find some in fantasy settings that are readable, no need to be good, tell me I'd love to see some of them.

    Is Prince of Thrones fantasy? Fantasy creatures and magic are present?  
    Yeah RTS is probably not a good name as turn based game can be better. Any other fiction you would recommend?
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      One of the most interesting parts of the first book is discovering that world, but if you want the spoiler I can tell you if you ask me. But yes there's magic and strange creatures.

      Biographies of certain historical figures fill that niche somewhat. Alexander the great, Julius Caesar, the hardcore history series on Genghis Khan, maybe Napoleon but that's a less interesting period for me so I've never bothered..

      The manga Kingdom is mostly this, the pacing got very slow and I dropped it last year, but up till then it was good. His troops get stronger, he raises through military ranks, the side character who's the king does diplomacy, the enemies counter and defend his strategies.. 

      Though there's hardly any intelligent or interesting use of tactics or strategy going on other than the author making it seem that way by making the characters say so.

  I would say some "use modern technology to take over a low-tech world" - stories are a lot like what you talk about. [Enlightened Empire](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire) is a good example, albeit it is almost annoyingly realistic about the time and effort it would take to actually do this, even with a protagonist who happens to be an expert on the matter. (Don't take me wrong, there is plot and such to keep you entertained while the long-term plans are slowly bearing fruit.)

  Try world of warcraft foreign realm domination, isnt my cup of tea but you might enjoy it. It is a webnovel, so it may or may not disappoint you, webnovel tend to be a hit or miss on how good they are
  ```

  ```
  That is exactly what *We are Legion, we are Bob* tries to be but IMO it's not very good.
