  I have to wonder what the hell Veyers is doing here. I think this pretty much confirms that he is not Red Robe. I just can't see RR taking a risk like this at this point in time. I bet RR taught Veyers how to control his power a little bit then went off to do more important things. Veyers not understanding the situation entirely then thought it'd be hilarious to go flex on the school he got expelled from, not realizing what he was getting himself into. That's my best guess at least. RR has up to this point been the quiet efficient type when not fishing for information. I can't imagine him thinking this debacle is a good plan.
  ```

  - u/abnotwhmoanny:
    ```
    We saw that loopers who leave the loop, leave copies in the loop that return to their old selves. That would imply that Veyers was NOT a looper, or at least not one that left the loop, but WAS someone who was soul-killed in the loop by a looper. Probably red robe, but potential Zach.

    Veyers is almost certainly not RR, but was in some way connected to the loopers. It's known that Zach and Veyers hated each other, so young Zach may have soul-killed him simply out of spite, but the fact that Veyers was removed from Zach's memory would imply that it's more complicated than that.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      Yes I agree. I've been pretty sure Veyers is not Red Robe since that reveal but it's still a possibility until we know for sure who RR is and that there weren't any shenanigans. Honestly even with this I think he is still far more likely to be RR than the more absurd theories like it actually being Zach, his simulacrums or Zorian's simulacrum.
      ```

    - u/LeifRoberts:
      ```
      I don't feel that Veyers is RR, but if he was it would definitely be possible for him to arrange the 'soulkill' to happen after leaving the loop.

      We know that QI is able to quickly accept the existence of the loop and even go so far as to self-destruct his own soul to try to help his original self. RR would just have to explain the situation to QI, tell him how to get and use the dagger, place a temporary marker on him, and then leave the loop. QI would then 'soulkill' the new Veyers once the next restart happens. By the time Zorian and Zach go back to Cyoria, QI's temporary marker would have expired.

      It's a messy situation, but RR-Veyers might do it to keep the new Veyers from ever wandering into a Zach that had no memory of him. QI would be inclined to help because he wants his original self to succeed and keeping Zach from suspecting RR's identity would be in QI's best interest.
      ```

      - u/abnotwhmoanny:
        ```
        We've seen how QI reacts to people he thinks are time loopers. QI has a code of honor and a sense of logic that don't necessarily apply or make sense to the people around him and definitely isn't always what would pragmatically give him the best final results, but we've SEEN what he thinks the correct action is when faced with a looper. He was working together with ZZ when he catches on to them, so being allies is no protection. The moment he realized he wasn't the real QI and RR was a looper, RR would be at ground zero to a soul explosion.
        ```

        - u/LeifRoberts:
          ```
          QI found out they were loopers in the middle of a fight between QI, Zach, Zorian, Xvim, Alanic, and Silverlake. He first suspected it was an illusion and that's why he began the fight with ZZ. They then pulled the others out of the orb where they had been waiting for this fight. The battle ground was even prepared beforehand for the ambush, which became obvious during the fight.

          Partway through the fight QI hit Xvim with a dispell to break down his mental barriers and did a memory probe. The memory probe is what made him realize that it wasn't an illusion, it was a time loop.

          Earlier on in the restart ZZ were raiding QI's forces, then they talked with him and told him to his face that they were "irreconcilable enemies", then they brought him to an ambush after working with him to steal the dagger.

          QI's response was definitely not *just* because he found out they were loopers. At that point they were clearly enemies working to stop the invasion. And the time loop provided them an insane advantage that the original QI would have no way to account for. That's why he blew up his soul. It was a last ditch attempt to completely disable them.

          He would have no reason to do that for a person who is helping the invasion, especially if that person properly describes the situation. QI would see that RR is his only option for countering Zach's timeloop advantage. And a millennia old lich is bound to have methods to make sure that RR is being truthful.
          ```

          - u/abnotwhmoanny:
            ```
            Touche, my memory on that portion was clearly not up to snuff. I concede the point. It takes Veyers being RR from the realm of "next to impossible" to "technically possible", which is all that really matters in a work of fiction. It still doesn't seem to be the case to me, but then the story itself concerns itself very little with my particular expectations of it.

            I will say that I don't think RR COULD convince QI that he's an ally while also convincing him that he's a looper. QI knows full well that actions in the loop are like actions in a dream, and not at all evidence of someone's real predisposition. For him a looper is someone of extraordinary and growing power, whose true goals are impossible to know as any action they take in the loop is guaranteed to revert itself. I still feel like it would be suicide bomb central, population QI, but I'll concede that that isn't certain.
            ```

        - u/turtleswamp:
          ```
          That's not right.

          QI had already been betrayed when he detonated his soul. And the reason he was willing to do it was because he learned he was a temporary instance of himself and he saw a chance to sacrifice that instance to potentially wound people who could threaten his 'real' self in teh future. 

          &#x200B;

          If RR was an ally and QI belived he'd continue to be an asset outside the loop he wouln't go nova juts because he's ina time loop. 

          &#x200B;

          IMO the reason this idea doesn't work is instead because if QI spent a reset with the ability to soul kill and his only loopng ally had exited the loop, he'd probably have soul killed Zack (RR having pointed Zack out to him in the encounter at the dance). Worst case scenario Zack wakes up outside the loop, but not knowing he's out, and with no additional opportunity to exploit the loop. Best case scenario Zack's soul gets deleted on the next restart and the loop runs on automatic until the power runs out.
          ```

      - u/archaeonaga:
        ```
        I don’t think this checks out. 

        First off, if Veyers is RR, why erase his memory of Veyers in the first place? It’s very lame if he just assumed that leaving the loop would leave you soulkilled; the RR we know might even have had Panaxeth test that in some way. Just barely erasing yourself from Zach’s memory and then soulkilling your old self seems like it couldn’t be better designed to get found out the first time Zach actually tries to solve his memory issues, something that was bound to happen. 

        Why would RR tell QI anything about the time loop? Why would QI do all the complicated soul stuff to keep RR in the loop if he could just do it to himself and avoid having to rely on some random person whose goals are only tangentially related to his? 

        And we have good reason to believe that QI doesn’t typically even get told about Zach, given that he usually doesn’t attack him until after he’s already caused a lot of damage. Even in the reset where RR specifically has QI and his vampire friend seek out Zach with him, it’s not remotely clear that QI understands anything about what’s going on; he certainly doesn’t act like he’s dealing with a time traveler. 

        And because you can’t really tell QI, you also can’t get QI’s crown to get somebody else to do it unless you take it by force. Good luck doing something that eventually required Z&Z to gather several archmages and a teleporting hydra to accomplish!
        ```

        - u/LeifRoberts:
          ```
          > First off, if Veyers is RR, why erase his memory of Veyers in the first place?

          If RR was Veyers he would remove Zach's memory of him early on to keep Zach from seeking him out. We know that Zach would often attack his appointed guardian during the loops because of how much he hated him. We also know that Zach hated Veyers, so we can assume that Zach might have occasionally gone looking to attack Veyers. If RR was Veyers he wouldn't want Zach to come looking and find that Veyers wasn't acting the way a non-looping person should.

          > It’s very lame if he just assumed that leaving the loop would leave you soulkilled

          In this hypothetical scenario, RR-Veyers isn't assuming that he leaves a 'soulkilled' body behind. He's setting it up so someone else 'soulkills' his replacement. RR-Veyers wouldn't want Old-Veyers walking around getting discovered by Zach/the other loopers, so he opted to arrange for him to be 'soulkilled' instead.

          > ...the first time Zach actually tries to solve his memory issues, something that was bound to happen.

          Zach actively avoided trying to look into the missing memories. Zorian had to argue with Zach fairly hard just to get him to admit that the missing memory was out of the ordinary. Zorian then mentioned that Zach was probably under some sort of mental compulsion to keep him from looking into the missing memories. So it definitely wasn't bound to happen. It required not only an additional looper, but a looper who knew Zach well enough to notice that that missing memory was weird.

          > Why would RR tell QI anything about the time loop?

          Because in this scenario RR needs someone to get rid of the Old-Veyers that would be walking around after he left the loop. Getting QI to cooperate is a simpler narrative solution than stealing the crown and getting someone else to do the cleanup.

          I don't particularly want to argue about QI's motivations for helping, because it doesn't really matter. I don't even actually believe that this is what happened. I just wanted to point out that RR-Veyers theory is still possible (although quite unlikely) under the time loop mechanics we are already aware of.

          I think it's more likely that Veyers was 'soulkilled' as part of the shenanigans that the primordial used to make it so RR could loop in the first place. Something along the lines of providing a convenient body for the primordial to shove an expired temporary looper into. But that is all speculation outside of our current knowledge of the time loop's mechanics.
          ```

    - u/BigBeautifulEyes:
      ```
      Is it possible that Veyers is red robe, before exiting the time loop he gives a temporary time loop tag to someone he trusts and teachs them how to do that soul kill he used on the aranea.

      Then when Veyers resets he immediately gets soul killed.

      I'm a bit fuzzy on why would Veyers bother, maybe it would eliminate him as a suspect?
      ```

      - u/abnotwhmoanny:
        ```
        The soul kill used on the aranea was likely the ability granted by the imperial dagger and not some technique that can be taught. Outside the loopers, the people being born each cycle aren't rewinds of the same soul, they are entirely new souls. No amount of damage done to a soul will make it "soul killed" (which is a misnomer really because the soul isn't killed it's just removed from the loop by the system using the administrative authority granted by an imperial relic).

         It's still possible that it was a technique used and not an imperial relic, something that marked the soul for removal from the system, which you might learn how to do if you studied people being removed from the system by the dagger, but that would require soul killing quite a few people for study, and that would be something that would be noticable. After the soul killing of a relatively small number of people, Zorian sees the news show up in the papers. 

        Also considering that having a temporary looper to help is also an imperial relic ability, this plan relies on RR having access to imperial relics either way. And he can't pass on the dagger.

        Nothing here is strictly impossible. Just much less likely than other available options. But it's a work of fiction so odds don't necessarily have to matter.
        ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      Wait, when did we see that? I was pretty sure the entire point of the veyers plot thread was that it was impossible for ZZ to figure out whether veyers had been soulkilled or simply left the loop.
      ```

      - u/abnotwhmoanny:
        ```
        We saw that, oh god what was her name, angry old silver lady didn't leave a soul killed corpse behind when she left. She left a normal copy of herself that was unaware of the loop. We saw a soul killed copy of Veyers.

         That means that the only possible way Veyers could be red robe is if he left the loop (which happened a significant portion of the way through the story) and THEN Zach soul killed him after that off screen, That would require Zach to get the dagger off screen (something he couldn't do even WITH Zorian's help later in the story) and specifically soul kill Veyers and apparently no one else.

        It's not technically impossible, especially with the checkov's gun of Zorian learning to mind fuck people who are mind blanked, but it's exceptionally unlikely.

        Edit: Technically we only have Zach's word that silverlake didn't leave behind a soul-killed corpse. So there's another technical possibility that Zach is working together with red robe, but I think you'll agree that that's even more unlikely.
        ```

        - u/domoincarn8:
          ```
          Actually, that IS technically impossible. You see, RR was there by the time Zorian started looping. So, given by your theory that Zach soul kills Veyers with the dagger is impossible because Zach remembers time from there on. And certainly didn't remove anyone from the loop.

          Zorian also knows that  Zach was not capable of removing people from the loop at that time, and had no idea of soul kill. (When they talk later). Nor does the Zach in that time loop know who the third time traveller is (because he is desperately searching for one and tells Zorian that; and that Zach was surprised by the third looper).

          tl;dr: Zach can't soul kill RR Veyers, for Zach remembers stuff from soul kill restart; and Red Robe left afterwards.
          ```

          - u/abnotwhmoanny:
            ```
            Yes, the theory would require Zach to be both more compatent than he appears to be and lying to Zorian for reasons that are not apparent. That being said, the fact that Zach's memory hasn't returned is something we're just accepting on faith. Remember that Zach is not the protagonist. We don't have the luxury of reading his thoughts. There's a lot of mystery and a lot of intrigue surrounding Zach and the events up to the start of the loop and including him being the new chosen one and his early years in the loop, which apparently RR came from.

            The by far more likely option is that Veyers isn't RR, so much so that I'm not entertaining the idea at all that he is, but remember that this is a work of fiction so probability isn't nearly as important as the real world. Even what should be possible isn't a hard and fast rule in fiction.
            ```

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        when Zach told Zorian he stayed to check. Zorian was back and thus implied Silverlake as well
        ```

  - u/ththth12:
    ```
    Veyers can still be RR. If he is a mind mage and left some mental trap into Zack's mind, then it would make sense for him to enter with confidence. He just needs to find real Zack to win, or at least that's what he believes. He doesn't know about Zorian.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      That doesn't really make sense with RR already trying and failing to kill Zach. If he had some mental trap why not trigger it then when he was close to killing him or when he was trying to get information about the other loopers in the time loop? There is also the problem that he should know about Zorian at this point. Even if Silverlake didn't tell him anything he saw Zach get saved by Zorian so he knows he has an ally at this point.

      A former classmate, noble house hit hard by the weeping and wars, had a bloodline that needed a main family member (who were all dead save Veyers) to not drive him crazy from the power.  Didn't work so well when the rest of his family tried to improvise when it manifested in Veyers.  Thinks everyone is against him because he's so crazy they don't want him as a main bloodline member and are all but kicking him out of the family and takes solace in his lawyer friend who had a similar background.  Got expelled from school after attacking a school official at a hearing, possibly unintentionally.

      Zach had a gap in his memory about his existence even though he remembered tons of other people and Veyers punched him in the face.  Had a compulsion to drop the subject/think he just forgot normally if it was ever brought up.  Was found soulkilled in the lawyers basement at the start of the loop.

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    I'm seeing a few possibilities for why Veyers just showed up:

    1. RR isn't expecting Zach to show up in class and just wants to dump Veyers somewhere innocuous. RR thinks that even if Zach is there, Zach shouldn't be able to remember him after the mind edit. 
    2. RR wants Veyers there because he has watchers and knows Zach is attending this first day. He wants to gauge Zach's reaction or behaviors for any hints, since Veyers should still be safe from Zach's suspicion (as above).
    3. RR has suspicions that the competent time traveler (Zorian) working with Zach is someone close to Zach or at least won't be far away. RR might not know that they've figured out the Veyers' shaped hole in Zach's mind. 
    4. RR is in contact with Silverlake already and Silverlake revealed Zorian's identity. RR knows that they know who Veyers is through SL. Veyers is basically bait.
    5. Veyers isn't RR, but this Veyers that just showed up is RR using some advanced illusion magic, either to ambush Zach or sniff out the other time traveler(s).

    The major hole in most of these is that Veyers was already expelled IIRC. It's probably trivial for RR to buy Veyers back into the academy, but that explosive door-kicking entry seems to suggest Veyers actually is bait and a fight is starting shortly.
    ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Or he is. Could be that he did his thing and now came angrily fight ZZ.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      I doubt it. If Red Robe wanted to fight ZZ he could have just fought them while Zach was half dead and bleeding out. Waiting days for them to recover then attacking them in the middle of a school full of powerful mages doesn't sound like something the guy whose simulacrum ran from a fight would do. Maybe if he convinced QI but I highly doubt they could convince QI to do something that would immediatly attract the government's attention so obviously like this. We are missing something here or this is Veyers doing something stupid on his own.
      ```

      - u/abnotwhmoanny:
        ```
        It's entirely possible that this is exactly what Veyers would normal do with no prodding at all. We know he's got a hot temper and all we've seen him do is slam a door. We never saw how he behaved in the loop because he was soul killed the entire time. This might just be Veyers making a dramatic entrance (something that totally fits with his characterization so far). That would be a less interesting answer on the face of things, but it's less convoluted and thus far we don't have much solid evidence to believe it's more than that.

        Caution advised, but I wouldn't jump out of my seat and start fighting.
        ```

        - u/archaeonaga:
          ```
          This is my current thought as well; we’re just seeing what Veyers typically does at the beginning of the month. But that doesn’t explain why he and his lawyer fled the lawyer’s home in the middle of the night.
          ```

          - u/Gr_Cheese:
            ```
            No, but it might explain why Veyers was soul-killed; the kid was near RR or an asset (which is why they were evacuated) and proved himself to be unmanageable by doing crazy shit like barging into his old class on a power trip. RR may not have planned for controlling Veyers actions long term because he expected Zach to fall to his ambush and resolve any future issues... So now we have Veyers doing crazy shit again.
            ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        Oh lord, what if Veyers has his robe (pocked dimensionally expanded by QI) filled with the wraith bombs they just made.  Kill Zach at least and hopefully the other looper while they're busy thinking what the hell the game is.
        ```

        - u/burnerpower:
          ```
          Wow. That's actually really plausible, did not occur to me at all but it makes sense now that you say it. It's possible Zorian is mistaken about Veyers and RR's relationship so he might be willing to do such a thing and not really care about Veyers. I'm sure it'd be easy to trick Veyers into doing as well. There are a couple issues. The first one I see is that they still need to release Panaxeth and even if the wraiths completely conquer the town they'd then have to deal with them. The other issue is that this is like kicking an anthill and the government will respond asap to such provocation. It's possible QI can handle the first issue and they might be assuming ZZ already informed the government so I can see it.
          ```

          - u/The_Last_Mammoth:
            ```
            QI would never go along with that because then Eldemar would be a victim of the first wraith bomb attack and wouldn't get blamed for it by Sulamnon. QI's entire plan is to get Falkrina to win the next round of Splinter Wars by provoking a war between Eldemar and Sulamnon and weakening both. This plan would mess all that up.
            ```

        - u/notagiantdolphin:
          ```
          I can't see QI signing off on it - he wanted it to be evidence of Eldemar to bring others into the new splinter wars against them. Releasing one in Cyoria, arguably their most important city, seems a bit unlikely. Unless they've got a major attack going on elsewhere right now, but that seems unlikely. Sudomir was more interested in it for the Necromantic Legalisation aspect.

      There are plotholes, and it could still be a rogue simulacra or someone from Korsa or a rogue royal or something. But there are plotholes for every candidate so far.

      Fortov's main strengths are how regular it is that he pushes Ibery into the creepers, and how under the radar he manages to fly. If it is him, who knows: Maybe his shitty mind reading skills were him realising that he didn't get the innate aspect of the bloodline and trying to rectify it with classic Fortov skill. Ibery seems to shift a bit too with when she's on the train, which is a very early change and could also be Fortov.

          Could be, but Fortov tends to keep his distance. I'd guess next chapter we're going to have another hint. Or another faux-hint, like "I am forgetting something" from Zorian, that will eventually fall into place and it will turn out that nobody103 has been giving us a middle finger this entire time when it's finally deciphered.

  The central government is notoriously corrupt and power hungry?   That.. that actually explains a lot about why Zorian wasn't working with them more closely both in and out of the time loop.  Honestly I should have expected it from an industrial-revolution era country.

  It's also a major bummer.  Cyoria was really cool from an outside perspective and now it's like Thailand.

  ```

  - u/SnowGN:
    ```
    Lol, Cyoria has been corrupt from the start. The head of the Cyorian Mage Guild and multiple other figures high in the city government were ranking members in the Cult of the Dragon Below. Zorian got *assassinated* the first time he tried reporting things to the authorities. The story has already heavily implied that the Eldemar royals are major dicks who could be compared to IRL Vladimir Putin - they're just *waiting* for a chance to gobble up and conquer/annex the neighboring Splinter States, whose sovereignty they don't even remotely recognize.

    The MoL-verse is cool as hell, but the central governments and royals are well known to be both powerful and untrustworthy. 

    *However,* to play devil's advocate to myself here, corruption isn't always a bad thing. House Noveda has a long historical record of loyalty and good service to the Eldemar Throne. Would it *really* be such a bad thing if Zach and Zorian informed the crown of the time loop? I could easily see it being played off as the Crown handling the situation by giving the two of them a golden leash, because they aren't just upjumped peasants. House Noveda is a big deal and Zorian is the Noveda heir's best friend. The Crown might restore House Noveda's fortunes and bind Zach closely to them with a favorable marraige, giving him power and authority but on the restricted terms of serving the crown for the rest of his life, which isn't all that bad a deal in this universe. He could be a general or something.

      There's a difference between actual treason as part of a plan to burn the country to the ground to become immortal or whatever and just being greedy bastards.

      And yeah, the royals are heavily implied to be dicks, but that doesn't mean the entire government is.  I mean, just because the absolute monarchs of a country of millions want to conquer other countries doesn't mean everyone is war-hungry.

Zach is powerful but politically isolated, it wouldn't be impossible to make him and Zorian disappear into a black-ops site to learn everything they learned in the time loop with some lead-pipe legimency or just straight-up drugging them and using government mind mages.

        I don't think the royal/interior authorities would immediately resort to violence in interrogating Zach and Zorian. Yeah, the royals would want to know *everything*, but what information do Zach and Zorian really have, that the royals would want, that if shared would have major negative consequences for the two of them?

        All I can think of is the location of various divine artifacts that Zach and Zorian want for themselves. But... why would the royals not let Zach and Zorian keep those artifacts, as long as they swore loyalty? Given the connections of those artifacts to the legacy of the Novedas, the Sovereign Gate? If the Crown was informed of the workings of the Sovereign Gate (a time loop once every few centuries for a Noveda Scion), then there is absolutely no way it would be in the crown's interest to alienate that Noble House. They'd probably want to marry Zach to a lesser princess and bring his bloodline into their own. Let him handle the repercussions of the time loop and rebuild his House's fortunes, all the while acting in service to the throne.

          Or would they just make sure Zach had some kids under their thumb so that in the next few centuries they'll have a major strategic advantage over all those upstarts?  Not like Zach has to live after the pregnancy or whatever, or know/raise them.  They just need his bloodline.  Then you could have the time loop *and* all those precious, valuable, divine objects sitting in the treasury you bankrupted half your nation to secure.

            They should honestly stick with telling the church and try to inform the angels. I know they are against letting out the primordial and seems to be the only force that is uncorrupt in the story. Not to mention they respond immediately to events. 

            Though I would place Zach to brave that front since Zorian doesn't know where he stands where angels are concerned. I'm afraid the primordial might be telling the truth in how the angels are a danger to Zorian(might see him as an abomination if they find out about his true orgins).

            Honestly there's so many options, though staying the pair needs to start being proactive because in war you need to have the enemy play by your rules.


             So far they seem to only be reacting to whatever the enemy is doing instead or forcing the enemy to respond to moves of theirs (moving against dragon cult members/Lich). It might be dangerous but it does put them in the best spot to keep the enemy on their toes and not give them  a chance to actually build up their forces.

            This is technically plausible, and has been explored in various Naruto fanfictions that treat powerful bloodlines and the possession of them as matters of national security. But even in those stories, massive escalations like what you're speaking of here are basically a matter of last resort, reserved for powerful bloodlines in the hands of hostile powers. And Zach isn't exactly hostile to the crown, and he doesn't have any real reason to be so. His family has a record of centuries of service, and he himself is basically a general-class archmage with vast potential for growth in power and leadership potential. He would be a good marriage candidate to a lesser princess, a second or third daughter or something.

            So, yes, Vladimir Putin would do that. He marries his own daughters to well-connected oligarchs and other useful, powerful families with something to offer. The Russian upper circle of plutocrats is practicing all kinds of marriage alliances nowadays.

The Novedas had outstanding debts that needed to be cleared, so some stuff needed to be sold. The royals didn't know just how wildly out of control he was, as far as I know

Plus Tesen bribed them with all sorts of Noveda treasures like the Sovereign Gate.  I can't quite remember Zach going on an angry rant about them, but they knowingly screwed him over and he's not happy about.

    ```
    Wraith bombs release wraiths that are moderate level monsters that can multiply with each kill. It would cause a lot of casualties in a population center, but nothing that couldn't be contained. They were initially intended to be used to frame other nations and start a new splinter war. Now they are apparently being readied earlier in order to, presumably, be used to aid in the attack on Cyoria.

    Getting QI to give up on what are essentially future allies would be a hard sell for red robe, me thinks. The advantage he gets out of a new splinter war starting is immeasurable after all. His enemy suddenly fighting a war on countless fronts. I'm not sure he'd even give that up for the primordial, since he believes the angels will defeat it soon after it's released.

    That being said, he might do so if RR clued him into the time loop happening. We saw earlier that he seems to be aware that such a thing exists, since last time he realized what was going on he literally blew up his own soul to try to kill them. He clearly takes that threat very seriously.
    ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      I have no doubt that QI has been told about the loopers. But hes not exactly fighting countless fronts. The plan was always for Sudomir to attack Eldemar's western neighbour with wraith bombs to display Sudomir's might. QI has no problem hurting that country, since the one he'd support in a war would be Falkrinea. Nothing of major import has changed as of yet.
      ```

      - u/abnotwhmoanny:
        ```
        I'm not talking about QI fighting countless fronts, I'm saying that the original plan would cause Eldemar to fight a multi-front war. The plan was to use the wraith bombs to attack Sulamnon specifically and make the attack appear to be from Eldemar inciting a war between neighbors and the moment Eldemar gets attacked by any of it's neighbors, the other surrounding nations are going to want to jump in and get a piece.

        Technically that's still possible, but only if they don't use the wraiths now against Cyoria. At that point it becomes less likely that another nation will buy into the idea that Eldemar are the ones attacking people with wraiths. We've already seen that news travels quickly in a world of teleporters. Instead it will look like the Ibasans are the ones attacking which is the absolute last thing they would want. We also don't know that the well of souls is reusable at all.

        Now it's still possible that they are going to use them now on their originally intended targets, but the original plan called for the hundreds of thousands of souls in the massive city of Cyoria, and likely won't be nearly as effective with only a few thousand that you can get from small towns.

        It's also possible that they intend to save them and use them later for the same plan as before, but that wouldn't explain the change in actions, nor would it be any more threatening than every situation they've already faced in the loop.

        RR doesn't need the war to win. He doesn't need Sudomir to get his wish. He NEEDS to free the primordial. He HAS to. If he's taking action to gather souls now, it's part of a play on the attack on Cyoria.
        ```

        - u/AnimaLepton:
          ```
          It could also be the misdirection ploy- we know that other primordials exist, more than one person in these threads has brought up the idea that Panaxeth was anyway planning on freeing his brethren, and the story already mentioned info about the other primordials and showcased ZZ's search for other prisons. From the early ending loop where Zorian and the army attacked Sudomir head-on, we also know that the primordial can be successfully freed before the planetary alignment. RR and the Cult could prioritize releasing one or two primordials outside of Cyoria first, throwing the world into chaos while still be working towards Panaxeth's longer-term goals.
          ```

          - u/abnotwhmoanny:
            ```
            For RR and Silverlake, it doesn't matter if freeing other primordials is something Panaxeth would like or not. They are soul bound to free him by the planetary alignment or die. That's the terms of the deal Panaxeth and gave Silverlake and, according to Panaxeth, RR as well. Even if Panaxeth didn't want them dead due to a change in circumstance, and quite frankly dead servants are unhelpful, that's their time limit. It's hardcoded on their soul now.

  But this chapter says that one village they went to had 300 deaths, and combined the deaths reached "into the thousands".

  But that seems like it's two and a half orders of magnitude off from what we previously knew about wraith bomb cost?
  ```

  - u/burnerpower:
    ```
    Sudomir wanted to make a whole heck of a lot of of wraith bombs. I imagine they are now just trying to make a small amount of them for some purpose. If we assume that every wraith bomb takes 1000-5000 souls to make then they could feasibly make one to five off of this where he could make 100-500 from the invasion.
    ```

    - u/The_Last_Mammoth:
      ```
      Exactly. He needed a half million souls for wraith bombs. Bombs, plural. Sudomir even explicitly states how many wraiths will be in a bomb. Somewhere between hundreds and thousands.

  - u/abnotwhmoanny:
    ```
    We know that he INTENDED to have a shit ton of wraith bombs (from the dead in the attack on Cyoria) to attack multiple cities at once and blame surrounding nations, hopefully starting a new splinter war. That doesn't mean a wraith bomb takes that many souls, just that he intended to have a lot of them to mount attacks on multiple locations. Now they've decided to play that card early, making it much weaker, in order to help in the attack on Cyoria.

    Having only one concentrated target means less are necessary, but who can say? Presumably wraiths can be created from souls at a 1:1 rate, since we know that wraiths can create other wraiths from the souls of those they kill. That would mean a few thousand extra troops for the invasion that can can multiply with every kill they make. Presumably that would mean doubling in number at least, depending on how effective they can be. 

    A significantly higher number if they can convert the souls of people killed near them instead of just by them. That could potentially be hundreds of thousands of extra troops.

Taiven interaction is natural, but I can't find its higher purpose. It gives reader example that Zorian might not be able to keep all his secret, but why Taiven get the spotlight?

    Basically you need soul magic to fight them and they multiply exponentially. Considering most mages don't know soul magic if you toss them in the middle of a population center they can do horrific damage before enough force can be mobilized to stop them.

Some talismans blessed by angels to stop transformations could count as holy magic. Priesty thing against evil spirit or something. Transformation magic is pretty pagan after all, I doubt the prior gods or the angels like them

            The golden flame is probably is a mixte between soul magic and fire magic, an expert on both could manage to do so and that would explain why zorian and Zach don’t seems to have learned it. I assumed the effect would burn the soul pretty hard (no permanent damage to the core of the soul but probably serious damage to the rest) and be a pest to recover from. Something crippling to a lich, potentially for decades. If my supposition is correct that would be enough to make quatach-ichl completely panic.

      Not true at all. In fact, it's even explicitly stated that intercontinental teleportation *doesn't* exist. That's why Quatach Ichl states he's operating in "impossible mode" with his gate devices. What you're thinking of are teleportation platforms. The range of these platforms is limited and they operate on an strict (and slow) schedule meaning that Zach and Zorian couldn't use them to get to Blantyrre. They could barely use them to get to Koth but managed to do so with a few days left in the restart, enough time to find a Bakora gate key. Doing so required multiple teleport "hops" all chained together.

We will learn remaining secrets of red-haired classmate beauty, cause her little brother will end up being kidnapped as well. 

  2. Briam's familiar sensitivity. Since drakes and Briams link is emphatic, drake could work as mind magic talent/skill detector. Investigate anyone the drake hisses at.

Either he had a fight with his sponsor/whatever and decided to take actions into his own hands (after he learned that Zach is supposed to be very powerful - he decided to confront him to defeat him). There should be some sort of mind trap on Veyers as well to see if RR can flush out Zorian (if RR and Silverlake didn't share the information yet). This may get interesting. I'm hoping we will learn who was pre-loop RR after Zorian performs mind reading and learns who assisted him with blood-line ignition. 
  Also this could be the ploy to reveal that Z&Z are able to cast simulacra and they are not registered as spell users in magic guild - and ordering their arrest/lock down in secure location for interrogation.

  The subtext of the last few chapters has sort of underpinned the risk one takes when creating simulacra. Your emotional state can influence the aims of the created simulacrum. It would not surprise me if Veyers was simultaneously both Red-Robe, and not. Veyers seems to have little emotional discipline, he could have easily created a simulacrum driven by pure malice instead of any sense of self-benefit.

  There are some issues with the specifics on the timetable from when this copy could have been created (and betrayed his original), but it's still possible, I think.

    \*breaks out the tinfoil\*

    Zach learned how to make simulacra, but did it poorly and recklessly, creating an evil!zach simulacra, who, uh, continued to exist as a soul-construct when the time-loop restarted, looping through their shared soul? Who eventually learns to do soul possession (possibly due to *being* a soul-construct giving it soul-sight, maybe?)  and used the dagger to soul-kill Veyers and possess his empty body at the start of every restart, and then altering the memories of the original to conceal his presence, unknowingly removing his knowledge of how to create simulacra. 

    Maybe this means that in order to get rid of Red Robe, Zorian has to destroy Zach's soul? May also explain why Red Robe expects a whole army of loopers?

  Honestly these last two chapters have been disappointments. I was expecting constant skirmishing, gathering of troops, resources and intel while racing against the clock. Instead the fighting is all off screen and they waste their time in classes and gossiping when there should be a war going on. What on earth is everyone doing?
  ```

  - u/SnowGN:
    ```
    Nah.

    Both sides - ZZ and RR+Silverlake+Q - know too little about one another to engage in immediate battle. They don't know the other side's identities, resources, tools, etc. And there are no more restarts, and death is permanent. So both sides are playing it safe and conservatively, acting through simulacrums while accumulating resources and securing advantages.

    Given the knowledge and powers the two sides have, either side could have already set fire to a significant part of Eldemar and other neighboring nations. But they aren't doing so precisely because they're both fearful of the other side, and acting so openly would invite deadly reprisals.

    So it's going to be a war in the shadows until, well, the shadows aren't big enough any more. I'd suggest that you have faith; I'm sure Nobody is going to give us a significantly action-packed conclusion in good and due time.

    I'm not disappointed by ch 93, it's necessary tension building chapter. But I agree with you about this (94) being a bit of a disappointment. Zach and Zorian has superior knowledge about what their enemy capability, yet they failed to take initiative. Indeed they're wounded, but padding their allies strength while doing nothing else is lame. Zach or Zorian should harass somebody and lay the blame to invasion force. That will at least spread their enemy thinner.

    There are <10 chapters left of the story, and all of them can't be nonstop fighting. Also, a lot of the fighting going on is immaterial to the larger goals- the specifics of how their simulacrums are clashing are largely unimportant, the intrigue is actually figuring out what RR's current goals are and what can be done to stop them. IMO one or even two more "ramp-up" chapters would still be good.

  Ok, ok, I got this. (Wild Speculation Warning)

  Veyers is another looper. He probably figured out how to get the marker to enter the loop and told Zach and they fiddled with things and got the marker for both. He probably needed Zachs resources.

  Zach and Veyers then leveled up in the loop. Veyers got captured and mindraped and his loop thing stolen for RR/QI. Zach didn't get his memory messed up more than just what we know, his early loops with Veyers and existence of Veyers. Plotwise that's why we didn't get a glimpse of his mind, there is nothing that important there and it's a red herring.

  Now Veyers is maaaaad because he knows they were going into a loop with Zach, but he knows the loop is not going on and he thinks Zach backstabbed him.

      I think I have a similar problem to a different commentor- only now, in the post-loop, there seems to be more rapid communication. Attack on Zach's mansion now? Gossip on the trains. Zach beats Tesen Zveri to a pulp at the same time, same place, during the loop? Vague rumors the next day.

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:

        I mean, Tesen would want to cover up being beaten by a 15-year-old.  Plus, all the loopers are dimensionalism experts with lots of experience teleporting around Eldemar and frequently checking in with their sources, so maybe there's just some overflow in the gossip departments.
        ```

      - u/AnimaLepton:
        ```
        Zach doesn't beat Tesen Zveri at the same time, same place during a loop. The fight with RR happens earlier than Zach normally "wakes up" during the loop, when it starts, in the middle of the night. It can feasibly be in the newspapers later that day- Zorian wakes up late, and it's a few hours before he boards the train, which in turn takes some time to get to Cyoria. Zach singlehandedly beating up Tesen during the loop *has* to take place later in the day, and may even be less disruptive/eyecatching compared to explosions in the middle of the night. The other poster already mentioned the "cover-up" aspects as well.

  All this discussion of RR being a Zach Simulacrum, or Fortov, or Sudomir.... it seems really obvious to me that RR is Jornak, the lawyer who Veyers was living with. I agree with all the speculation that RR cannot be Veyers, both because Veyers was soulkilled (if he was RR, he would've reverted to normal after leaving the loop) and because a RR Veyers would never walk into class the way he did in the last chapter.

  &#x200B;

  But in Chapter 92, Zorian discovers that Jornak and Veyers have abandoned Jornak's house in the middle of the night, something that never happened in the time loop. If neither of them is RR, this change doesn't make the slightest sense: whether RR is Fortov, or Sudomir, or whoever, he'd have no reason to warn two effective nobodies like Jornak and Veyers. Therefore RR is either Jornak or Veyers; he's not Veyers, therefore he's Jornak.

  &#x200B;

  The story would go something like this: Zach decides to plan a legal attack on Tesen, asks Veyers for help finding a good lawyer. Veyers refers Zach to Jornak. Zach, being an idiot, tells Tesen all about the time loop. Unbeknownst to Zach, Jornak is a pseudo member of the cult. So Jornak immediately goes to the higher cult authorities, and eventually to QI. Only someone with a marker can access hidden features of the key, so at this point only Zach can place a temporary marker. There's no way Zach will be tricked into putting a temporary marker on QI, so QI has no hope of entering the loop. But, as Jornak argues, Zach can be convinced to put a temporary marker on Jornak, which QI can then modify. QI sighs, agrees this is really his only option, and helps Jornak enter the loop permanently. Then, Jornak plans to ditch Zach permanently, and deletes Zach's memory of Jornak.

  &#x200B;

  But there's a problem: Veyers is still around. Zach has forgotten Jornak, but Veyers refers Zach to Jornak every restart, and both Veyers and Zach notice that Jornak is acting weird (because he's now a permanent looper). Zach gets suspicious, and Jornak realizes that he'll have to come up with a more permanent solution to the problem. So he gets rid of Zach's memory of himself again, soulkills Veyers, and then gets rid of Zach's memory of Veyers. Problem solved; Zach will never approach Jornak again, and Jornak is free to go about on the road to becoming Red Robe. Then, when Z&Z meet Jornak, he's already left the loop, and the normal Jornak is ignorant of everything.  


  I'm struggling to think of any facts that don't fit with this theory, while I know this subreddit has come up with plenty of arguments against RR = Veyers, RR = Fortov, RR = Simulacrum. As for RR = Sudomir, that hypothesis fails to explain why Veyers and Jornak evacuated at 2am on the first day of the real world.

  Currently, having a giant soul well is a big liability that can't be hidden since any soul mage can easily find it. Also, the soul well can only be utilized during the invasion, which means this is a liability with no useful near-term function.

  Red Robe's first priority should be to collect enough souls and get rid of the mana wall. Second priority is to turn the wife into a lich so that they can abandon the mansion. 

  Veyers is obviously not Red Robe. He is there today to find the 2nd looper (Zorian). Easiest way to do that would be to start launching fireballs everywhere, which will force Zorian to protect people. Chances are, Red Robe stabilized Veyers and Veyers now knows how to use his powers.

    Wrong wrong and wrong.  The soul well can only be detected if it's affecting you (I mean theoretically you could use divination but it's behind very powerful wards so basically you have to feel it).  The invaders can extend it's reach to literally anywhere they bring one of QI's gates and feed it enough mana to stay open.  Assuming that they have a mobile one they can just pop into a village, kill everyone and steal their souls, and pop to the next one with no one the wiser.

    > Red Robe's first priority should be to collect enough souls and get rid of the mana wall. Second priority is to turn the wife into a lich so that they can abandon the mansion. 

    I mean I guess you could get rid of it.  If Z and Z find it they can call in the military but it might already be too late at this point and the wraith bombs are ready to sail.  Also, QI promised him that if Sudomir helped in the invasion QI would turn Sudomirs wife into a lich.   We're not sure if he was lying or not so even if QI can Sudomir can't force him or do it himself so no real priority 2.

  Veyers isn't Red Robe.

  I honestly don't believe he would be capable of pretending to be angry to that degree, while also being the mastermind behind all the different stuff he supposedly did.

  Zach is Red Robe.

  He got in a fight with Veyers sometime early on in the loop and got pissed off so badly, he figured out how to get the dagger and soul killed him. But Zach was the one acting as Red Robe all along. He worked with Quatach-Ichl to make the invasion stronger because he found it interesting and wanted to practice fighting it. He pretended to have memory problems to avoid explaining what he did in the earlier loops, and didn't want Zorian to look into his mind for the same reason. He pretended to not know who Veyers was since he had soul killed him and didn't know how he would explain that to Zorian. He created the simulacrum that he fought after getting out of the loop and had it injure him enough to clear him from blame. He kidnapped Veyers after getting out of the loop, but now he's either gotten loose or Zach let him go intentionally to distract Zorian while he makes a move.

  This was all because Zach liked Zorian for some reason, realized he was smart enough to have a somewhat decent chance of figuring a way out of the loop, and didn't want to look bad by helping the invasion murders thousands of people each loop just for fun.

  I know there are some holes in the theory, but it makes a lot more sense than Red Robe being some other person who has barely been a part of the story this entire time. Or worse, being some person who isn't a classmate of Zorian and just comes completely out of left field. I'm predicting that Zorian realizes Veyers isn't Red Robe pretty early in the next chapter and things blow up big time during the assault on Sudomir's mansion.

  What I don't know is Zach's intentions at this point. Now that we're in the real world, I don't think he actually wants the invasion to succeed. But he obviously wants to keep up the charade for some reason, so he still wants something that Zorian doesn't know about. Which is saying something, since Zorian would probably help him get just about anything he wants.

    Then once he got out **he committed mass murder, slaughtering thousands to make bombs to restart the splinter wars that *killed his entire family*** for shits and giggles?

        > I'm fairly sure it's Silverlake who clued Quatach-Ichl in to the time loop and is why he changed plans.

        What?  QI never knew about the time loop as far as we know, and if he did then Silverlake literally could not do so unless Zach told her since Z and Z spent months with her and she didn't figure it out before the primordial test which was at the behest of Z and Z.  Even if she did, what, did she decide to tattle to the most powerful mage on the continent with a vendetta against her country **when no one was supposed to know QI was in the country**?  And for what?  To what possible end?  We saw what happened when QI figures out he's in the time loop and it's blow himself up to screw over the loopers.  

        If you're talking about afterwards then Z and Z already talked to the guardian meaning they were trapped and... what "he" :are you talking about in regards to changing plans?

        > I'm sure I got some stuff wrong, but I'm confident that Zach is Red Robe.

        And I'm confident if that's true then Zach is both the best actor on the planet to fool the **empath** that is Zorian and the most retarded planner as he locked himself in a collapsing time loop **just** to be friends with Zorian, not even touching the "restart the atrocity that killed his family and doomed him to life with his shitty caretaker for no reason"

  - u/LeifRoberts:
    ```
    When Zach and Zorian first went into the Sovereign Gate room the Guardian told them the gate was barred because *someone had already left*.  
    There was an entire arc of collecting the keys to unbar the gate because someone else's exit had caused it to lock.

    When they finally got all the keys, the primordial told them that it had already sent someone through and Silverlake was its *second* agent. The Guardian even said the gate was barred again when they checked after Silverlake was gone, which shows that when the primordial sends someone to the real world, the gate locks itself.

    For Zach to be RR he would have to find a way to trick the Guardian into thinking he had already left the loop. And the primordial, which wants Zach to be mind scrambled, would have had to lie for him. There's no way.

    Also, someone went out of the time loop via the sovereign gate, because the gate was barred. And Panaxeth could intercept him meant he wasn't the controller. Panaxeth couldn't even touch Zach.

    And no, its not a rouge simulacrum because Simulacrums have no soul, they share it with their creator.

    Mostly, a lack of actual danger would make an unexciting finale, so if this is the case, then Zach has no particular reason to fight Zorian only now, and the ending kinda would fall apart.
