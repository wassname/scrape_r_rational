    In the literal case, a hunter is someone who has ways of avoiding death by Grimm (incredible violence) despite unhappiness. They are also powered by the expression of their soul (through incredible violence). Also, the less happy they are, the more Grimm focus on them rather than civilians. Thus, a hunter isn't only allowed to be unhappy - they're probably required to, in order to bait out Grimm. As we just saw Ruby do. And given that that unhappiness is tied to the expression of their soul, the metaphorical message seems relate to accepting and expressing who you are, even the unhappy bits. That's how hunters grow in power, and also get killed.

      This was my interpretation, plus the possibility that using the word "allowed" was somehow hinting at huntsmen being in a higher class in the social hierarchy than civilians. 

      In that they're maybe given permissions that civilians aren't, which could be foreshadowing how the author's setting up this world's society to be a bit darker than in canon.

      It's really fun to see people thinking about what this could mean.  I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the plot is going to come back to it, or to say that there are multiple possible interpretations.

    > Hmm.

    I'm made very curious by this Hmm!  What did this line make you ponder, if you don't mind me asking?

        > Could be as simple as Ruby being slightly unhinged and as complicated as a hint that Hunters in this setting get euphoria from killing Grimm and it's like a drug to them.

        I took it as early foreshadowing for how the silver eyed warrior thing is going to work in this universe.

  Another really enjoyable chapter. I am quite interested in seeing where this goes. Please continue writing it.
  I am curious how you are going to handle fight scenes going forward, will they be as "abstracted" as in this chapter or more descriptive? Though as long as they are better than the ones in the last season of RWBY, I'll be pretty happy.
  ```

    Thanks!

    I definitely intend to write some real fight scenes, partly as a personal challenge since I'm sort of bad at them.

    I'll probably gloss over most of the day-to-day Grimm killing, unless it's serving as background action while the something more interesting happens.  (Because, honestly, who wants to read about Ruby stabbing beowulf #3245 in the throat shortly before stabbing beowulf #3246 in the throat.)

    One of the things I disliked about the show was that there was almost never a real sense of danger in the fights, so I'll probably try to bump the threat level of older Grimm up a bit too.

  Should I take a look at this if I know nothing about RWBY?

    I'm honestly unsure.  I occasionally read fanfiction from works I haven't read and I actually find that it's usually pretty interpretable.  Some of the hints will go over your head, and a lot of the dramatic irony won't work.  If you try, I'd be curious to know what your experience is.

      I only know RWBY from fanfics and I did fine.
      ```

  - u/PathologicalFire:
    ```
    It's probably pretty incomprehensible without basic background knowledge, yeah. Maybe skim a wikipedia article?

  ```
  This is great! Keep it up!

  Curious: Is it feasible for you to use metric units instead of US units? e.g., 20 miles per hour would be about 30 km/h. Or about as fast as a bicyclist can go without going into excess energy mode. You had many of these last chapter too.

  Some possible reasons why you might think it's a good idea to do so:

  * A large part (the majority?) of your audience wouldn't need to convert all the time.
  * Most countries use metric anyway.
  * Metric is used in the US in the scientific and military fields.
  * I guess some combination of that might make metric *sound* more rational to a US audience?

  Apart from that, I think it's a generally good fic. I appreciated you breaking down the social rules (even if there are no answers yet).
  ```

  - u/arenavanera:
    ```
    I actually have some data on this since fanfiction.net gives a per-country breakdown.  About 55% of readers are from the US.  In light of that, I plan to basically use the units that I'm used to hearing US folks think in, which is inches/feet/miles, pounds for eyeballed weights, grams for small or scientific weights, Fahrenheit for outdoor weather, and Celsius for scientific temperature (like the heat of a furnace).  Probably also metric lengths for certain scientific or military measurements, like e.g. a 9mm barrel.

    I realize that mixing imperial and metric units is in some sense the worst of both worlds, but I also want to write in the units that are actually familiar to a majority of the audience.  (And, honestly, part of it is just the selfish fact that those units are easy for me to interpret while writing.)
