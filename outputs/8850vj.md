## [OT] What do Rational Readers Think of House MD (TV Series)

### Post:

Hi
I've been re-watching this recently and, Though the medicine is mostly fabricated, and the show succumbs to Soap opera frequently, I'm  enjoying some of the more intelligent dialogue.
I just wondered if others here enjoyed it, and if any good fan fiction of it exists.

  I generally enjoyed House but I never really examined it in terms of rationality. I think of it more like Sherlock Holmes, where his power of deduction is more or less just a super power that the audience has to accept for the basic premise of the story to work, more than a guide that you can follow and get similar results.

  As such, it's just a good character drama. I like how it explores the theme of someone always needing to be right, even at the expense of social relationships. House as a character is often needlessly a jerk. And in real life, sure there are times where you need to go outside social norms to get results, but more often than not treating people with respect is going to be more beneficial in the long run than constantly stepping on people's toes just because you're smarter than them and can probably get away with it.

  And the good thing about the series is that it does at times show that House is getting in his own way with his attitude. And being the smartest man in the room at all costs very rarely makes him the happiest. Which is not to say intelligence makes you miserable, but rather that intelligence alone is not going to make your life better if you only apply it to a very narrow field and ignore the consequences of your actions outside of that narrow field.

  I don't know how to end my long rambling comment... so yeah, I like it. Also I don't know of any fanfiction that's good (though I do know fanfiction of it exists).

  A friend of mine is a doctor and can't stand it because everything (in terms of both medicine and policy) he does is stupid, wrong, and would get him thrown in prison for at least a few decades.

    Not everything. FTR, there's a blog by a doctor that describes the correct parts of the show.

    Blog's halfway broken now but it's on the [wayback machine.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170607004844/http://www.politedissent.com/archives/388)

    Out of curiosity, what does he think of Scrubs? My mom works in a hospital and says it's pretty close, but I'd like to see other opinions

      I can't speak for that person's friend but I know that Scrubs was voted as the most relatable and accurate medical show on TV by actual doctors. More than once, I believe.

  Has anyone ever noticed that the character of House and Wilson is meant to be based on Sherlock Holmes and John Watson? They are very similar in terms of character archetypes and also their names.

  Holmes -> Home -> House

  Watson -> Wilson

  EDIT: There's an entire [article](http://house.wikia.com/wiki/Gregory_House_and_Sherlock_Holmes_connections) on the connections between the two.

    Well... not to be an ass, but yes, it was kind of obvious.

  It's a guilty pleasure for me. Seeing an intelligent guy be an asshole to all the idiots around him, and being repeatedly proven right... it's what I so *so* want to do. Being an asshole isn't rational though, so I don't do it.

    can you please tell my rationalist stereotype partner this? we started showing him House to explain why jerky things he did were jerky, but instead he just gleefully shouted out whenever house did something clever and is like "House is AWESOME!". I don't think he understands House is meant to be a "bad guy".

      House not having any real lasting relationships in the show is a pretty big clue that his rationality doesn't extend much to his social relations.
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        ugh, my partner says it's because everyone else is "dumb" because House is awesome. And of course I, being less the prototypical rationalist than he is but definitely part of the community/movement/whatever, am just weird enough to love him, but just normal enough to have arguments with him where he insists that "you taking my tone of voice in that way is your problem, because i didn't mean it like that" / "it doesn't matter how you meant it, it matters how i felt". I fucking give up sometimes. Ugh. [/way too much personal stuff probably]

          Einstein would've done exactly fuck all if he couldn't keep up discussions and relationships with people. Regardless of how disparate their intelligence levels are, pushing everyone away is not a smart decision in and of itself unless one has superhuman powers.

  I loved it, wish there was a show that also didn't shy away from actual medical terms and at least tried to be accurate while being dramatic.

  I didn't like the ending though, way too clichÃ© and boring.

  I rather enjoyed it; as others have mentioned, his deductive skill was definitely on par with super powers; half the time, someone would say something or he would say something completely innocuous but it would link things together in House's mind to save the day.

  That being said, patients still died under him, which reflects how things actually work in the real world, so I was a lot more easily able to let his super power slide, so to speak. 

  In addition, the side plots and conversations were really fascinating a lot of the time; the talks on religion, morality, etc. were very interesting. I found myself agreeing with House's views on certain things a lot, though of course he had his own massive problems that he was aware and unaware of. And the other characters in the show were very well developed; even some of the shorter lived interns from that season where he had like 20 new fellows were well developed characters. No one was even close to perfect, everyone had their own flaws, and it made the show all the more compelling. 

  Overall, I don't think I would call House MD a rational show per se but I would call House himself a rather rational character and the show a smart show overall.
