  Last week I asked for Star Wars fics, and have had a chance to read through some of the recs.

  [*Instruments of Destruction*](https://www.fanfiction.net//s/11685932/1/Instruments-of-Destruction) by alexanderwales **(Completed)** was recommended, and it's great. It's a one-shot from the POV of Admiral Tian Jerjerrod, the commander of the 2nd Death Star. It follows his thoughts as he goes from thinking "this is ambitious but possible, I can do this" to "this is absolutely insane, who thought this was a good idea, I'm going to die aren't I?"

  Extremely well-written and interesting (as alexanderwales fics tends to be), it really delves into the practicality of building a new Death Star that is twice as big as the previous once in four years (less time than the first Death Star took to build), and why it's so ridiculous.

  [*Remedial Jedi Theology*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15118700/chapters/35054840) by MarbleGlove **(Completed)** was good. It's a "Fix-It" fic that follows the POV of a Ob-Wan as he struggles to adapt to raising both a padawan and a child to be a Jedi.

  Well-written. I really like the back-and-forth in this fic. It was nice seeing how, in helping Anakin grow, Ob-Wan did as well.


  [*Using The Force Made Easy*](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/using-the-force-made-easy.62952/) by Fencer **(Ongoing)** follows a former Jedi Padawan who decides to run away from the Jedi Order rather than be consigned to a life in the Service Corps. He also decides to release a series of tutorials on how anyone with the potential can train themselves to use the Force.

  It's fairly well-written, but I felt like the MC got really preachy at times, and at other times the Jedi were set up to be kind of dishonest in the way they dealt with him. Otherwise it was a pretty fun read. I enjoyed the back and forth between different characters as they debated what using the Force and being a Jedi meant.

  I've finished or caught up on some series recently that get reviewed a lot here, including Pale Lights by ErraticErrata (good, ongoing, I like it), Raise by Coeur Al'Aran (middle of the road, good if you like the author and RWBY fanfic), and Super Supportive by Sleyca (really good, ongoing, want more!).

  One that I tried and didn't wow me was the Paranoid Mage series by InadvisablyCompelled (on Royal road). It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't good. Got to the point that I kept reading because I hoped a lot of loose ends would be tied up... but they weren't. 

  The premise is about a regular guy who finds out he's a mage, that supernatural stuff exists, and the supernatural government press-gangs every magic user into service. The protagonist dislikes the strong-armed approach and goes on the run, while developing his magic and killing supernatural creatures (and other mages) who harm mundane humans or attack him. 

  The good part is the exploration of what a secret supernatural society would look like and interact with modern technology, and how a one-man wrecking ball can destabilize an entire world-wide society. And some of the action sequences are pretty awesome, at least at first.

  Aaaaand that's about all I felt was above average. The protagonist is OP almost from the start, and while he sometimes gets taken by surprise, his OP-ness means he never gets in over his head and is almost always the deadliest person across several worlds. A whole bunch of dangling plot points never get elaborated upon. I don't know if the author has more books planned and will wrap up some of them, but the last book ended with a time skip chapter about the protagonist's kids, so I doubt it. There are a ton of Chekhov's guns that simply never fire. Off the top of my head:

  1. Callum's mysterious parents are never revealed, nor does it get explained why he has a special kind of magic sense, or how he got magic in the first place, or why he's a space mage and why they are so rare.

  2. It seems heavily implied his wife's death was somehow related to him seeing the supernatural (and ignoring it) throughout his life. But nope, apparently she just croaked from mundane medical issues. Callum could have had no wife and it would have made zero difference to his character or the plot.

  3. Who created the portals is never revealed. Duvall may have been involved in some of them, but it's unclear.

  4. Duvall herself is a weird red herring. She seems primed to become an antagonist, and the lack of other space mages after she "collects" them seems super nefarious... but about halfway through the series she gets cold feet, becomes a hermit, and only makes random cameos now and then after.

  5. The Shifter family/town in the first book quickly disappears from relevance, as Chester takes over as the main Shifter contact for the rest of the series. We were introduced to an entire family and town just for them to be sidelined for the rest of the books.

  6. Taisen's entire purpose is to defend Earth from monsters on the other side of the portals, but every large threat ends up being from "people," not monsters (granted, the fae and vampires can get pretty monstrous). I expected a Lovecraftian threat to show up because of all the mentions of world-ending threats, but... nope.

  7. The Fae storyline never really takes off - not Felicia/Felicity's, that gets explained pretty well - but the reason the Ways are expanding and what it's leading to. Never get a good glimpse, and it seems like the handwaved answer is "some Fae decided to make a move, but Felicity stops them." But it's never confirmed.

  8. Anti-mana is cautioned several times as being incredibly unsafe and a disaster waiting to happen, but Callum never has a problem with it and it literally becomes his I-Win Button as it can destroy any supernatural creature in seconds, if not instantly. Just another OP ability.

  I'm sure there's a bunch more too, but overall, I honestly wondered at times if I was missing chapters or somehow skipped entire paragraphs because of how much got mentioned and then never revisited. By the ending it felt like the author ran out of steam and just wanted to be done, and didn't have a plan to tie up all the plot beats he had set up. It's not bad for a Royal road story, but it was just noteworthy for being fairly well edited and for being finished. Wouldn't recommend unless you're bored.

    Paranoid Mage had a great Book 1. Unfortunately it all went downhill from there.
    ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      Yeah, that's pretty much my feeling on it. I wouldn't call book 1 great, but it was good, and had a lot of plot hooks for future exploration, but ended up abandoning most of them. Instead it focused on throwaway government mooks trying to find Callum and being spanked for it, while Callum himself focuses only on developing his own power while ignoring all the mysteries teased in the first book. It was frustrating.

    ```
    Very apt description of Paranoid mage, I didn't last 3 books.
    ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    I think part of it is that the author started getting more and more blatant with the whole QAnon conspiracy theory thing that underlies his personal worldviews and was the foundation of the story's narrative and worldbuilding, and people didn't like it. But also, like, the fact that he did that uncritically resulted in a mishmash of absolute garbage when it came to the motivations and backgrounds of all of the villains.

    Your point 6 in particular is IMO deeply rooted in this, because ultimately "the bureaucratic organizations that purport to serve the public interest are actually purely predators" is an axiom that leaves you nowhere to go other than "it is people who are the monsters, and specifically the people running / influencing those organizations". Ditto Duvall, ditto... every other antagonist with any complexity.

  Are there any stories (or session recaps) about the sort of Bag of Holding munchkin approach described in [this tweet](https://x.com/ObserverSuns/status/1700792492398952631)?:

  >fantasy game where in the tutorial your grandfather gives you a Bag of Holding, after an hour of fighting monsters you meet an artisan who realizes the bag can be used to generate infinite energy, and the rest of the game is a city building sim where you grow your post-scarcity sci-fi empire together

  I'm tempted to begin writing a story loosely based on this premise myself, but I'm curious as to whether this premise has already been tackled elsewhere.

    The Worm fic [An Absolutely Broken Inventory System](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/an-absolutely-broken-inventory-system-si-worm-gamer-inspired.968150/) is a pretty good match.

  - u/andor3333:
    ```
    There is [The Tale of An Industrious Rogue](https://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/2012/21445029/) where a campaign is derailed by the players dropping all the plot leads to exploit and sell salt from a portal they found to the paraelemental plane of salt. Things escalate rapidly from there. 

    Harry Potter and the natural 20 has a D&D wizard in the world of Harry Potter who munchkins D&D mechanics mercilessly. Sadly the fic is dead, but what is there is lots of fun. 

    The Two Year Emperor has a lot of munchkinry of D&D concepts.
    ```

  - u/i6i:
    ```
    It sounds fun but from what I understand D&D's main factions tend to run on star trek replicator level tech already and their main conflict is other post-scarcity societies with inverted utility functions. Still I would read it.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      I mean, depends on the setting. D&D is just a game/ruleset, and while there are official settings that stories can take place in, it's not mandatory. 

      The bigger problem is that D&D, specifically 5e, is fundamentally a system designed for a DM and 3-6 "Adventurers" (levels 3 - 14ish) to play in. As soon as one of these factors isn't true, like if your characters decide they don't want to be adventurers, or there is no DM who actively continuously bends the world around the players, the system breaks down quite a bit. 

      This is partly due to 5e specifically, because it's far less "crunchy" than older versions like 3.5e that had rules for everything and lean towards "game engine" rather than "narrative playground", and it's why something like *Harry Potter and the Natural 20* works so well (I'm not sure it would work as well with 5e).

  Hey y’all, I was wondering if anyone knew of anything written in a style like World War Z? 

  Something along the lines of an after action report, either like World War Z’s reporter who interviews survivors, or like Waking Gods where it’s more of post event documentation. The only other examples I can think of are the SCP foundation, or audio dramas like The Magnus Archives, or Modes of Thought in Anterran Literature (though the second is more of a college lecture). 

  I’m not really sure if there’s a term for this style of writing, but I’ve always enjoyed it.
  ```

  - u/kraryal:
    ```
    This is called "epistolary novels", and there's actually tons. It goes back at least as far as Bram Stoker's Dracula (which I enjoyed, you might too).

    It tends to vary based on what technology is available when the novel is written, Dracula being letters, but more recent ones are sometimes blog posts and emails and so on.

    Unfortunately I haven't read too many, but Wikipedia has a big list:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Epistolary_novels

    I enjoyed Perks of Being a Wallflower and Screwtape Letters.

    - u/Krakenarrior:

      Sweet! I knew there was a name for it, but I wasn’t sure how to find it. I’m definitely going to read your recommendations and peruse the Wikipedia article, thanks so much!

    WWZ's framing device and tone was explicitly based on [The Good War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/306399.The_Good_War) I believe, an oral history of WW2. It's excellent, though non-fiction. 

    [Robopocalypse](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9634967-robopocalypse) is about... well, you can guess. Very much inspired by WWZ. I read it because it was so hyped before release it had even been optioned by spielberg or dreamworks or something. Verdict: meh. 

    [The Truth Machine](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345899.The_Truth_Machine) is SF, about the social/political consequences of the development of such a device. I haven't read it since I was a teen, but even then I noticed it was pretty biased and naive, and it mostly fails as a story. Still, if you think you can manage to suspend disbelief you can treat it as a thought experiment rather than a rightoid screed. 

    I haven't read it, but supposedly[The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_2020_Commission_Report_on_the_North_Korean_Nuclear_Attacks_Against_the_United_States) scratches the same itch.

  I finally caught up on the *Oshi no Ko* manga. Very impressed, it's hovering around 9/10 for me, and I had a lot of trouble restricting myself to reading only 1 volume per day. Strongly recommend watching the 90 minute first episode without learning anything else about it, but if you must, here is my relatively spoiler free pitch:

  >!Countryside gynecologist Gorou Amemiya sticks out among the town's hospital staff as an outspoken fan of idols, and no one captures his attention like the legendary 16 year old idol Ai, the perfect shining image of a pure maiden. So it comes as a shock when said idol comes in for a discreet checkup of her pregnancy, but he is a professional. This man is about to live the ultimate fan experience (note, this sentence is true but misleading, you'll see). This manga explores the entertainment industry in all of its glory and lack thereof, backed by solid irl research, shining a spotlight at the real people stuck playing by the rules of celebrity culture whilst trying to grow up and find their own happiness.!<
  ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    I don't really agree with this description. Yes, the manga pulls you in. Yes, the 90 minute movie first episode of the anime is impressive. At the same time, no: It's not shining a spotlight on anything. It's a love letter, on both sides of things. There are some sordid scenarios, but they all resolve too neatly. It's intended as a flattering portrayal of the industry, so you get absurdly light 'sexual coercion scenarios' where the real danger is the paparazzi catching a whiff and there's no actual coercion at all for example. It's also a by the book soap opera, almost. It's fun and worth a read, but don't sell it as high art because it really isn't. its audience just has no built-up tolerance to this particular drug.

    It'll be pretty famous as a kind of animanga classic in a few years, in my opinion, because the execution is pretty good, especially on the hooks. Might be worth waiting till its finished. The people who get to bingewatch hundreds of episodes of soaps have a better time than the people who watch them week to week. My opinion.
    ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    Are you recommending the manga or the anime?
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      Both, the anime is high quality but unfinished, and it isn't worth waiting the years it'll take for that to finish.
      ```

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    The pitch you have described is squicky to me on face value because many attributes of the main character are also red flags for him possibly being a pedophile. Especially because you say "this man is about to live the ultimate fan experience" about him presumably getting to examine up close >!the genitalia of a 16 year old girl he idolizes.!<

    That said, I'll accept your word for it that it's a good manga. It certainly seems like it could be an interesting, character driven story. The culture of "idols" in East Asian entertainment is a complex, problematic topic which deserves to be understood in depth, so I hope this manga treats the subject matter with the appropriate gravitas.
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      Alright I will peel back the curtain a bit, that line is true in a sense, but crafted to be misleading to others and amusing to me personally. The intended first reading was more >!deliver your oshi's children!< than that in particular. I make no apologies, but I guess I will add a note since I do want people to watch/read it. 

      And yeah from what I've read in articles, Aka did a fair bit of research and interviews while writing this, several arcs are based on real events, and it for sure doesn't shy away from the really grim stuff.
