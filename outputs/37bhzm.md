## What are some useful precommitments?

### Post:

Precommitments are a popular idea among rationalists and in rationalism, I've noticed. Do you have any that have helped you in your life?

  I tend to use "micro-commitments" - 

  I email people saying when I will send the next update, so that I need to make progress by then.

  I make public commitments to do specific actions, so that I feel compelled to follow through.

  I tell friends I'm working for the next X hours, and won't be on chat / reddit / etc. and so I don't violate it since it's easy for them to notice if I failed to follow through. 

  Like now - I'm going to publicly mention that I will get off of Reddit until this afternoon (PST) - and anyone should be able to see if I didn't do so.

  If I spend over a hundred pounds without first googling the feasibility of it I have to eat a spider.

  I have to donate 10 pounds to an appropriate charity for domestic violence if a partner hits me.

    I am very sorry that you've had to make that second one. I hope you never need to pay out.

      I have. It was a fairly strong incentive to leave her.
      ```

        That sucks.  I hope it never happens again.

          Thank you.

    Why not "I have to leave my partner immediately if they hit me"?

      Love and such tends to bind you to them and is hard to break. I find it's easier to aim for a small intermediate goal and then take more small steps than aim for a large goal.

  Never deliberately take the weaker position in an argument.
  ```

  - u/IomKg:
    ```
    why?
    ```

    - u/lsparrish:
      ```
      Taking the weak side of an argument is generally just a really bad idea -- basically the definition of rationalization.

      If it had more evidence than the opposing view, it would be stronger as a result. So if you notice yourself doing this a lot, getting worked up in defense of the objectively weaker side of the debate, it's a warning sign that you aren't being rational.

      "Weaker position" for the sake of this rule can sometimes refer to the entire framework assumed by the argument (the manner in which certain political debates involve two horribly naive viewpoints in collision, debates on the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin, etc.). So it can apply as "never deliberately take either side in a horribly naive argument" in that case.

      Steelman arguments (intending to clarify how someone's flawed argument can be viewed positively without actually agreeing with it) are not an example of actually taking the weak side, but more a case of attempting to understand more fully the flaws thereof (including its appeal). If you didn't see flaws, you'd be agreeing/advocating, not steelmanning.

      Similarly, "taking" a seemingly weak position for the sake of making sure all options are explored -- playing the devil's advocate -- is not properly described as taking a weak position for the sake of this rule either; it's essentially the same as steelmanning, attempting to uncover flaws in a position you don't actually hold in order to add a level of sophistication / force opponents to clarify theirs to escape the hole you have dug for them. (If you are *actually* the devil, i.e. the argument does not appear weak to you, you aren't playing the devil's advocate at that point, but merely advocating.)

      This precommitment/rule basically just boils down to a (for me) more intuitive version of "be rational, don't believe stuff that isn't so, update when you have evidence, don't depend on cached reasoning" and so on. But it's also a useful heuristic, as my physiological and emotional reactions can clue me in when I don't have the amount of evidence the position requires to be considered reasonable.

        Hmm I guess this was a misunderstanding then, when you said "deliberately" I understood this as taking an opinion for an argument while knowing that it is probably wrong.

        Thanks for the detailed explanation anyhow..

  I endorse Updateless Decision Theory, which just outputs on-the-fly the decision that someone else might have needed to precommit to.  Think of it as being like a precommitment to do whatever you wish you'd precommited to, only more elegant.
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    That sounds like it would have the problem of having the set of precommitments you will pretend to have made in the past depend on your future thoughts - your enemies being able to influence your past precommitments (by influencing your thoughts (by influencing your situation or talking to you)) seems like a vulnerability.
    ```

  - u/Calamitizer:
    ```
    I don't understand why this is practically different than saying something like "I try to make the smartest possible decision." That sounds pretty nice, but is of course mostly contentless. I don't think this what you mean - I think I'm missing something in the disconnect between the facts that A) precommitments (the vanilla flavor, that actually happen in advance) are often (in practice) efficacious because you have set in place external pressure to incentivize something, like, say, the scheduled checkup with a colleague as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, and B) you simply don't have these consequences set up in advance with your strategy. What's missing in my understanding? How do you implement this strategy in a way that it actually does work; what does this UDTist approach look like from the inside?

  I don't think I have any big ones, but I have a couple of minor ones:

  * Stop reading any article about AI as soon as it has a picture of movie robot/AI (like the Terminator or Ultron).
  * Share[ this song](http://rileyredgate.com/post/90497064702/batmansymbol-welp-here-it-is-the-final) whenever I have the chance.
  * Never play Monopoly to win.
  * Don't share anything that starts with "Share if, " or something similar. The same goes sharing things that try to make you feel bad for not sharing it.
  * Don't drink more than 2 portions of alcohol.
  ```

- u/Cruithne:
  ```
  One of mine is to precommit to never answering 'What are you thinking about', because it saves me trouble.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Heh. That's a good precommittment. 

    Alternatively, you could have some lines stored up:

    * "The disturbing socioeconomic implications of the new boy band craze as it interacts with the SEC's newest regulations."
    * "[Attractive celebrity's name]'s [body part]."   (Bonus points for parts like "left elbow", or "pancreas"!
    * "The last step in a plan to ascend to godhood--and now I've lost the whole thing, damnit!"
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Oh for God's sakes.  Just make something up like the rest of us.  I'm sure you have a speakably polite thought lying around.
    ```

    "the answer to your question"
    ```

  - u/ancientcampus:
    ```
    I dunno, if I asked a friend what they were thinking, and they answered "I never answer that question" I might come off miffed. I suppose it depends on the context and delivery. :)
    I'd say "generally dodging said question, and preparing ways to tactfully do so" would generally be more useful - all a precommitment grants you is the ability to shut it down completely - if you resort to employing it, it'd hard to avoid being rude.
    (Sorry to nitpick. I don't really have any right to do so.)
    ```

    - u/Cruithne:
      ```
      I put it more delicately than that, so people tend not to be annoyed.
      ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    Or answering "how are you doing" honestly?
    ```

    - u/callmebrotherg:
      ```
      My go-to for that is "Well enough, still alive" or some variant thereof. It's actually as automatic for me as locking the door behind me as I leave the house. 

      Granted, there are some circumstances to which death might be preferable, but I don't think that there will be any problem with answering in more detail at that point.
      ```

      - u/Iconochasm:
        ```
        "Well enough, still alive.  Actually, on second thought, I'd rather be dead."
        ```
