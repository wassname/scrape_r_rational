  Having read the first couple chapters, it seems that Harry is too perfect and that everything goes too well.

    Chapter 7 or 8 things start to level out a bit but he is a little overpowered.

  ```
  Oh wow, so you actually took that idea about "What if Harry chose the phoenix instead of clever planning?" and ran with it.

  Reading from the start *now*.

  Such blatant shipping...

  I do like the idea of the What If (even though I disagree with your interpretation of the characters and consequences) and you're a (surprisingly) much smoother writer than Elezier, so I'll keep following.

    I'm not the author, I just thought I'd post the link.
