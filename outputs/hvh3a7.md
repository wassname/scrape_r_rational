  >“I’ll make sure to let you fuck up next time, Reimer. Felicia, technically it was an asteroid, and it happened because the party ignored five prophecies, eight NPCs and about four hundred hints,” I said. “It was supposed to be a cautionary tale about avoiding the main quest for too long, not a sign to start rushing every event without preparation.”

  God, I still remember when I ran my first World of Darkness campaign... I tried to ease everyone into it, very simple story about vampire arriving at a small town and slowly taking over. When the party finally wised up and went to prepare to fight vampires, someone rolled a dramatic success when talking to a local gun dealer and got access to a backroom full of high powered weaponry.

  Very useful against the human servants, not so much against the vampires, who not a single person decided to use wooden stakes or crossbows against despite me making them clearly available and present.

  Cue everyone complaining about how hard the combat was. After storming the head vampire's manor. During the second session.

  At night.

    Why do players attack vampires at night? Is it some sort of pattern matching?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I still don't know what they were thinking, other than maybe just misunderstanding what type of game they were playing :P Maybe you can get away with that shit in most D&D games, but in World of Darkness the world is meant to be more realistic and gritty.
      ```

      - u/scruiser:
        ```
        Maybe they were more engaged with the story-telling aspect and less with the gaming or role-playing aspect?  Stories with vampires have vampire hunters do suboptimal stuff all the time in order to heighten the stakes of make things more even.  A story where a team commits arson in daylight and watches as all the vampires die helplessly is a lot less interesting than a pointlessly dangerous nighttime fight.
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          They'd already fought a lone vampire altogether though, and it didn't go particularly well for them. I get what you're saying, but if someone *engages* in a pointlessly dangerous nighttime fight with vampires, they should expect *actual danger* at the very least.

  ```
  I miss Fenn :(
  ```

  - u/iSuggestViolence:
    ```
    Me too, and getting her back from the hells has been talked about extensively but I'm still not sure how I'd feel if it happened. I think emotionally Fenn's death might be one of the strongest parts of WTC and it'd make me a little sad if it felt cheapened or rolled back
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Hold up, she's in the Hells? I thought they had her soul.
      ```

      - u/burnerpower:
        ```
        She's not in the hells. They have however talked about sending her there in a bid to get her back, but have for now decided against it.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          IIRC there wasn't mention of that other than all the times Joon was like "when I'm a god I'll bring her back". Once they mentioned considering letting her go to the Hells and just killing all the Devils and Demons near her, but only to buy time if her bottled soul is nearing expiration, and that she would still have to deal with the flora, fauna, architecture, and laws of physics tormenting her
          ```

      - u/iSuggestViolence:
        ```
        Oh sorry your right. She's bottled, but I remember one or two conversations saying that their best option was to let her go to the hells and then get her back after? Anyone else or am I just misremembering.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  oh...it's fanfiction.
  ```

  - u/MyLife-is-a-diceRoll:
    ```
    Still good.

      Fine.

    ... holy shit, I would never have noticed. I thought it was just an extra chapter.

  I'm so happy that Worth the Candle fanfiction exists now! The writing is spot-on too; it feels like a real chapter of WtC, tabletop misadventures and all. Some of my favorite parts:

  >“Before this goes any further, I need to tell you something. The Fel Seed incident—”  
  >  
  >“Do you think I’m pretty?” Fenn interrupted.

  No, Fenn, don't interrupt him! The readers are dying to know!

  >Fenn looked like she had opened her birthday present, and it was bees.

  This is a hilarious turn of phrase.

  >You deserve to be real, and not just like me because I’m the main character. I want you to be Fenn Greenglass, a thinking person who kind of likes me as much as I kind of like her, not a character in this world I made.”

  D'awww.

  >I silently vowed to remove this event from any eventual memoirs.

  Well, now we know why this isn't in canon! Besides the fact that Juniper didn't remember any of it, of course.

  >"… and if this is *at all* based on Dungeons & Dragons, a candle of invocation will show up at some point. It makes sense narratively, I even said something candle-related once, dramatically too!"  
  >  
  >...  
  >  
  >"Grak! He won't shut up!"

  The entire candle of invocation rant is excellent. It's everything I hoped it would be and more.
  ```

- u/quetschla:
  ```
  Well, that helped with the thirst for more WTC.  
  Had to chuckle at the candle of invocation part.   
  Also Joon tricking his future self is something fitting but unexpected. I like it.
  ```

- u/LordSwedish:
  ```
  So did we ever find out what's different about elves sexually? Other than the pointed teeth and scarring, I can't remember any differences being mentioned but that doesn't really fit with Fenn's insistence that Joon shouldn't read the Elf chapter in the Book of Blood.
  ```

  - u/ZeCatox:
    ```
    I didn't read this fic yet, so I'm not sure what you're asking about but one notable difference I remember is when Juniper mentioned Fenn's vagina having 3 pairs of labia instead of 2, or something like that.
    ```

    - u/TacticalTable:
      ```
      I'm not sure how much of this is guessing and how much of this is fuzzy remembering, but I seem to remember elves having teeth, implying that half elves have some semi/non-functional teeth?
      ```

- u/Zephyr101198:
  ```
  That was *exceptional*. Thanks a lot for writing it! Hilarious and felt very true to the underlying style
  ```

- u/mossconfig:
  ```
  I didn't get an email????
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's fanfic (in case you hadn't realized already).
    ```
