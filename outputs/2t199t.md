## [BST][MK] Munchkining an Invisibility Cloak

### Post:

(While my computer's in the shop, and since this seems to be the current fad here...)

Given the existence of a technological invisibility cloak, what entertainment and/or Munchkinry can you come up with based on it?

For the sake of argument, let's say that the technobabble involves arrays of miniaturized light-field cameras and colour-changing quantum dots; that it's effective with visible light and infrared (the latter by incorporating a substance that acts as a heat sink) but not ultraviolet; and that its existence is not yet public knowledge.

  Use it for violence. I'm pretty sure one of the Greek philosophers posited that if you had a ring of invisibility (okay, checked it, it's [Plato](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Gyges) and the Ring of Gyges), you would become totally immoral. That said, if I had an invisibility cloak I would presumably also be rich, either because I was able to finance an invisibility cloak or because I have technology that can be used to create an invisibility cloak.

  So aside from money, I would use it to get away with things, and if I could get away with things then right now I would be assassinating people. I'm not sure who (haven't researched who needs to die because I don't have the One Ring) but I'm sure they exist.

  Use it to enact the world's greatest coup and install all of my trusted friends as powerful politicians. Obtain blackmail material. Cripple certain corporations. Change the world.

  And look at naked people. I would be lying if I said that wasn't on the agenda. What about you, /u/DataPacRat?

    Yeah, I love Plato but I wish he was still around so I could yell at him. He argued that what you should do if you had a ring like that was to not use it, but I wonder what he'd say if someone came up to him and said "So, found the ring. Killed off the rightful heir who's been killing people 'for teh lulz', seized power, and now I want your help in setting up a school where we actually educate people instead of teaching them sophistry."

  Everyone else has some rather practical ideas, buts lets Weaponize it.

  Hack the damn firmware and change it so I can directly affect the output of the quantum dots.

  You never gave an maximum amount of light it could output, but suppose for a moment that it can at least hide you if you're between the observer and the sun.

  The [solar output at the equator](http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/climate/sun_radiation_at_earth.html) is 1368 Watts per square meter. The earth's average albedo is about .31, so we have an output of 834 watts per square meter. Supposing a two square meter cloak, we've got 1668 Joules per second coming off of this thing.

  Turn the cloak inside out. Bind a human inside it. Turn it to maximum.

  A human being weighing in at 70 kg will increase by about...

  .005 degrees centigrade a second, which rather dampens my "Cook them alive as torture" idea. In hindsight, this thing is putting out about what you'd get if you sunbathed in equatorial Brazil, and there's a lack of people melting to death ala Ark of the Covenant.

  But you never did give a maximum, and regular old spotlights can put out a lot of heat and light...

  Up the maximum output by about 2 orders of magnitude and you've got quick cooker. Assuming the heat sink can keep the cloak itself from overheating, in two minutes your prisoner is long dead and beginning to boil. Useful for the next guy's decision on whether to tell where the rebel base is.

  Up it a two more orders of magnitude, and you have a viable weapon. Forget not being seen, you're too bright to even *look* at. Run up and tackle someone, they'll get burns just from a fraction of a second of contact.

  Wrap it around your fist and time it to active when you hit something. Become the superhero THE MIGHTY SOLAR FIST. (Would be pretty cool, actually- Invisibility, Brightness, Energy attacks, all centered around the same BS weapon)

  The heat sink itself is pretty valuable, too (Assuming similar power levels I did above)

  Given that the cloak is able to *absorb* a lot of light, and some fraction of that as IR, if the heat sink is controllable, you could flash freeze something wrapped in the cloak by rapid cooling. Emergency cryonics?

  Wrap the cloak inside-out around a supercomputer and overclock like hell, or use as an improved cooling system for a reactor-

  Hell, just turn it to maximum, toss it in a well-insulated reactor as a heat source and generate electricity. (I am, at this point, assuming xenotech energy sources giving us all this power- and that method seems safer than trying to directly temper with the power source.)

  In descending order of reasonableness:

  Mass-produce it, make a brazilian dollars, buy things I actually want.

  Rent it, make tons of money, get super famous, write a book.

  Set up a corporate espionage network, make reasonable amounts of money off insider trading.

  Steal stuff all the time.

  Graffiti the White House with demands for better funding for education and a reorganization of the school year.

  Stalk people, while humming that creepy song about how if I was invisible I'd just watch you in your room. Or maybe Every Breath You Take. Really, the soundtrack is the important thing here.

  Attempt to solve North Korea's complicated problems through untraceable violence.

    Mass producing would work only if you actually know how to make one.

    Renting... I wouldn't probably even tell anyone I had one. That's a good way of not having one in future. I could _sell_ it though, for a few metric shittons of money.

  Bet on basketball games, then hide in the middle of the court and help my team win.  For amusement and money.  Watching the reruns and listening to the commentary as the announcers react to the ball stopping in midair would be worth it.

  For serious things?  I don't really know.  There are so many possibilities.

    ```
    And three players run through you and you can't evade. You fall down and the cloak flew off. Someone screams when they think this player's hand dropped off somewhere but they calm down when they notice there is no blood. You try to grab the cloak, but the guards are there already and you see the audience is starting to come closer...

    You wake up on quantanamo bay.

  There's a real-life device that can make [nearly anything invisible](http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/new-invisibility-cloak-device-can-hide-almost-anything/). Also its design is clever enough for people to be able to make their own version at home. Check it out! ;)

    You can create the same effect with four mirrors (think of two periscopes looking at each other, you can't see what's between the eye pieces) or a bunch of fibre optics. I personally would not call a fixed device (that you can see) that only effects views from a small range of angles an invisibility cloak.
    ```

- u/Sira-:
  ```
  Put one solar panel inside the cloak and one on the other side of the cloak.
  Shine a flashlight at both panels for unlimited free energy.
  (The flashlight would emit whatever wavelength of light needed for the best absorption rate.)

  Ugh. Honestly, I'd probably give it to the scientists right away. There's just no way to justify not acquiring the tech as fast as possible, before anything goes wrong for any reason.

  But yeah - as others have said, you can get fairly large amounts of money betting on events that you ordinarily couldn't influence. 

  You can fake supernatural events and you need not necessarily tie those events to your personal self unless you want to. Anything going on that you don't like? God / ghost of Mother Theresa/ etc doesn't like it either now, and can publicly say so. Have fun massively influencing public opinion on anything. 

  Better yet, just restrict yourself to individuals to reduce chances of being caught. You can also convince all but the staunchest atheists that they are getting supernatural messages to do things, and this includes most important figures. This allows you to accomplish a great deal without getting your hands dirty.

  If you have a partner in crime and no life otherwise, you can keep the cloak on indefinitely and be very bold and straightforward about pretending to be a supernatural phenomenon for a fairly long time. I don't think they'd actually try and rip off your "skin" or anything, and it's not weird of x rays show you are humanoid.

  You can non-violently influence any public election via shenanigans, or otherwise hilariously thwart anyone's efforts to do anything and make them lose all influence through embarrassment or make them lose all their money without actually harming them.

  The first stage is information gathering: infiltrate high level meetings in government and private industry and get a feel for who's doing what and how.  Then, corporate espionage first, steal as many important plans and prototypes as possible and trade them to a smaller companies of my choosing.  I would invest heavily into said companies and short the stocks of the other companies.  Release videos of any backroom deals or illegal goings-on that I observed companies doing after investing in options and shorts for those companies.  Make a bundle that way.  Use other videos as blackmail to gain power and access with some of my more successful small business companies that I helped with prototypes etc.

  Mostly gain access to powerful people and learn their secrets, and use those secrets to gain money and power.

  First off, Technology like this could be subverted to record information. 

  The device that can capture not just the amount and frequency of light hitting any point of it, but also the incidence, from as many points of view as the object is large. The information to digitize an environment from a particular cloud of viewpoints is there to process. The information to see around obstacles via scattered ambient light is also there. Given that the surface is also an ideal light source, the ability to chemically analyze anything within line of sight is there, as is the ability to light up a room for analysis without giving away exact location to a known observer.

  Note that the display elements are capable of sending different light in all directions at once, from all angles, on all surfaces. The detectors compliment the ability. A pair of things like this could transmit a lot of information, full duplex, multi-frequency, without aiming, in a free space optical system, with as many data streams as can fit in in line of sight, and as broadband as the resolution of the device permits.

  Additionally, the device is a virtual lens with capability of emulating any virtual light source in the visible range. The device could be used as a sort of telescope that is pre focused on all points and at all distances within line of sight, with capability to go further via analysis of scattered light. Stepping outside at night would generate enough information to keep a lot of astronomers very happy for a long time, and getting a few good vantage points during the day could be as good as mapping out to the horizon and providing a complete environmental and partial toxicological census using ambient light. The virtual lens capability also makes the previous ultimate Free space optic application that much more useful, as any device, no matter how small, is just as good as a telescope of a particular lens size pointing at any node you can spot, with automatic tracking, and as much illuminating ability as the surface can provide.

  The ability to emit light at all angles to any specificity can be used to direct energy onto a single point, or multiple points. Anything in line of sight can face the full wrath of whatever the maximum light output is for a point multiplied by cross-section of the device. The abilities of this sort of not-quite-laser fall into the same industrial and weapon use cases of an actual laser, albeit one that can point in all directions at once and be multiple frequencies at the same time. Manufacturing via laser sintering, photon driven chemistry, and propulsion via chasing an object with superheated atmospheric plasma come to mind. If SHTF, you could set up in a high tower and try dazzling everyone in a ten mile radius, popping their tires, downing their aircraft, destroying their ranged sensors, branding them with the mark of your order, burning their hair, etching your demands on every tree bordering your domain, and just cooking anything that doesn't get the idea to back off. It would only take kilowatts to pull off, unless you wanted to do everything at the same time, but then I suggest some good heatsinking and a mind for just how hot you can get the air surrounding the device.

  On the less extreme but definitely creepy side, If you could manufacture these things and sneak a visor or contacts or a wall made of the stuff in front of someone, it'd have the same applications as really good AR gear. Like, potentially, people could go around not seeing real things, seeing fake things, and seeing things that are in a different place entirely. Combine with an audio solution (plasmic heating of air might work in a pinch) and you've got mind control that works as long as you maintain enough control over the physical environment that they don't reach out and touch a discrepancy.

  On the subject of AR. A dim room with a small amount of the stuff at a good viewpoint or two could project on any surfaces, while simultaneously capturing a lot of information about a user. Pocket holodeck.

  To save energy and provide a more immersive scenario for users in a portable, non-worn, holodeck scenario the material could track users eyes with a bundle of tight little cones of light for retinal projection. A small amount of the stuff worn, if the observers were known, could mask a person in a crowd at very low power, though they might still appear as a distortion in peripheral vision if the person to be hidden only has a few small patches of the stuff.

  Things would be more interesting if a crowd of people were hiding from known veiwers using worn or thrown devices, since the scene could be reconstructed for the viewers from a wide range of vantage points, and free space optical communication could transmit the information to other nodes. Potentially, given enough nodes nearby, malicious individuals could be tricked to fall down stairs, crash military vehicles, mistarget air strikes, shoot dirt, or chase targets over open wells.

  An invisibility cloak is basically like saying "I don't just have complete optical power regarding any light that touches this thing, I also have formidable optical power over anything that can be touched by light that touches this thing."
