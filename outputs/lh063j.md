## HPMOR (SPOILERS) Was Harry's skepticism about the nature of reality misplaced?

### Post:

Harry often criticizes Dumbledore for acting as if the world ran on "stories." 

In Chapter 39, they have a lengthy discussion about Morality, Death, and the nature of reality. 

This is one of my favorite chapters, as it lays out Transhumanist ideals and progressive optimism very concisely and eloquently.   


As Harry puts it:  


>The young boy stood very straight, his chin raised high and proud, and said: "There is no justice in the laws of Nature, Headmaster, no term for fairness in the equations of motion. The universe is neither evil, nor good, it simply does not care. The stars don't care, or the Sun, or the sky. But they don't have to! *We* care! There *is* light in the world, and it is *us!* "  


This is a beautiful rejoinder against both spirituality and cynical nihilism, and is my go-to answer to Camus' Absurdist Paradox.  In our world, I think it is the best answer. 

However, in the world of HPMOR, is Harry's disbelief in Dumbledore's worldview well founded?

>And *that* was when Harry realized that there was exactly one person who'd *originally* told Professor McGonagall that the Dark Lord was still alive in the first place; and it was the crazy Headmaster of their madhouse of a school, who thought the world ran on cliches.   


HPMOR is a world where Prophecies and Time Travel exist.  The stars quite explicitly DO care.  There are literal prophetic "stories" that speak of the stars destruction, and the stars themselves apparently communicate future facts to Centaurs. 

In such a world, is a belief in an uncaring universe founded?  Given that his core beliefs were wrong about all of physics and the base nature of reality, shouldn't Harry be putting a little more credence in the opinion of the widely proclaimed most powerful wizard in the world?

Or are these really just mental hold-overs from Harry's scientific training and home culture, layered on top of Riddle's cynicism and dislike of Dumbledore? 

Harry seems to come to this realization at the very end of the story: 

> "You're acting like you think Dumbledore was unaware of those facts, or just ignoring them, when he made his decision. It's true that sometimes stupid people, like me, make decisions that crazy. But not Dumbledore. He was *not* mad." Harry swallowed, forcing a sudden moisture away from his eyes. "I think... I'm beginning to realize... Dumbledore was the only sane person, in all of this, all along. The *only* one who was doing the right things for anything like the right reasons..."   


At the conclusion, upon learning how true the prophecies were, he is finally able to reject his prior bias as to the meaningless nature of reality.  But I find it interesting that his very "rationality" and reliance on things like Occam's Razor prevented him from accepting Dumbledore's perspective sooner, and failing to update his assumptions and overcome bias.

### Comments:

  ```
  In the beginning he’s probably right to be skeptical of Dumbledore’s claims, since when a muggle makes similar statements they’re usually deluding themselves. But you’re right. He should have figured out he was wrong sooner. His pattern-matching on what felt rational rather than what actually was rational caused him to make many mistakes.

  There is no real evidence that 'the stars care', just that there is transmission of information from the future to the past. Dumbledore abused prophecies to get to the point where there can be a chance for a good outcome but that's because he used them as a tool. There's a lot of suffering in that world which is already evidence against the stars caring.

  Anyway, Harry was correct to question it but for the wrong reasons (as misanalyzing is the theme of his interactions with Dumbledore) - Dumbledore was neither crazy nor believed the world really runs on stories - he was using those masks as a pretence to abuse the prophecies and maybe have a bit of fun on top. The closest related thing he believed in was that the world is ultimately just which you touch on but we don't see evidence for that.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Is it really that, or is it more that Dumbledore *did* believe in stories, and thus that informed his way of acting on the Prophecy, and thus that necessarily led the world to work as a story, because it had to accommodate for a self-consistent loop which included Dumbledore acting by believing the world works as stories do?
    ```

  - u/RidesThe7:
    ```
    I take your point, and certainly agree that there isn't evidence showing that it is the "stars" that care, but from our limited exposure to prophecies it sure seems like what information is transmitted from the future to the past isn't random.  It seems like only things of sufficient "weight" cause the metaphorical pressure forcing prophecies out into the world, and that what is or isn't "weighty" seems to be judged by something like human values.  To our uncaring universe there should be no difference in "weight" between two asteroids colliding in a distant galaxy and the destruction of Earth and its sun, and neither event more or less likely to result in a prophecy, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  I suppose an answer could be that people able to read omens or produce prophecies are themselves in some way making their own judgments as to what kinds of information is worth finding, and somehow pull out the potential prophecies most relevant to themselves from an almost limitlessly larger set---but I can't say that's the impression I get reading.  But who knows, it's all made up anyway!
    ```

- u/Evirua:
  ```
  That the stars show the future was not a definite fact; Harry had theorized that the centaurs had that power within them and merely projected it on the stars to channel it. In which case, the stars themselves indeed do not care.
  ```

  - u/archpawn:
    ```
    And if the stars did care, they'd be trying to stop Harry. He was prophesied to extinguish them.

    Then again, maybe they don't like being on fire. I can understand why that might be a problem.
    ```

    - u/serge_cell:
      ```
      >And if the stars did care, they'd be trying to stop Harry. He was prophesied to extinguish them.

      For that stars should have self-preservation motivation. But "stars care" is not the same as star  being anthropomorphic or animalmorphic  enough to have self-preservation motive.  They may only care about minimizing some loss function, utterly incomprehensible to humans.
      ```

- u/IICVX:
  ```
  the problem with HPMOR is that Harry believes himself to be a being of pure rationality and the story doesn't do enough to prove him wrong - so people tend to not even realize he has a character arc.
  ```

  - u/wren42:
    ```
    yeah I think that's apt - it's actually meant as an object lesson in ways rationality can fail, but it takes a second reading to start really seeing his flaws clearly.
    ```

  - u/Tenoke:
    ```
    Eliezer explicitly says in multiple notes throughout the story that Harry is sometimes wrong just generally on the right path. That's further emphasised by him making the wrong conclusions throughout the story. It was very clear he wasn't meant to be 'a being of pure rationality' but someone who aspires to be more rational but is limited. The story goes out of its way to stress that.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      The story doesn't do *nearly enough* to stress that HJPEV is limited. His failures are either irrelevant, minimized or handwaved.

      I understand that Eliezer *intended* to write a story with a rational yet flawed protagonist, but quite a few readers - including the person who initially posted this topic - **read** the story as having a protagonist who was infallibly rational.
      ```

      - u/Revlar:
        ```
        We must have read different stories. I read HJPEV dance on the palm of Quirrelmort the entire book, the obviously evil, obviously Voldemort-in-disguise mentor/antagonist of the book. If there is a more obvious way to show his methods of rationality weren't sufficient, I'd like to know it.
        ```

        - u/cae_jones:
          ```
          >Obviously evil, obviously Voldemort

          You know that. I know that. TvTropes knew that. It sure seemed like a huge chunk of the audience refused to notice that because, like Harry, they were swept up in Quirrel's badassism and charisma. I also feel like people's opinions of the story and Harry wind up pretty thoroughly established in the first 10 chapters, in which it's easy to miss that Harry's flaws are intended as flaws because they keep succeeding. Like, he just walked all over MacGonogall and Hermione and it seemed like he might get away with terrifying Neville at 9.75. It takes the Sorting Hat laying out how messed up it all has been to make it abundantly clear that the author intended Harry's darkness to be bad, rather than badass.

          After that, if you like Harry, it's hard to hate Quirrel because he shows up to mentor Harry like a stone-cold sensei whenever our lovable protagonist makes a mistake. It feels like he's making Harry stronger and serving as a role-model. By the time he does the really, really obvious "wtf?" thing with Azkaban, a lot of people have already decided how they feel about the character, and aren't going to go updating based on mere evidence.

          I guess the tldr would be that it takes too long to get to the point, and things which feel right to the protagonist, by virtue of being convincing enough to convince someone as smart as Harry, also has a tendency to convince readers who are sufficiently similar to Harry. And since it's fanfiction, a lot of detractors assume the author must be sufficiently similar to Harry to also make the same mistakes and fail to notice.
          ```

          - u/Revlar:
            ```
            Ok? So your beef is with the audience, then, not with the story. You're trying to construct this narrative where HPMOR is bad at telegraphing Harry's flaws and the mistakes he makes, but clearly a bunch of people noticed if even TVTropes was keeping up with it. HPMOR is plenty transparent and doesn't owe its audience an accounting for anything.

            All aspiring rationalists make mistakes, the whole point is to learn to notice them even when it's difficult. If the story simply told you when to stop and think it wouldn't be as effective, neither as a narrative or as a didactic tool.

          - u/Radix2309:
            ```
            I think the fact that some readers missed Quirrelmort is a sign of goof writing. If he is too obvious then Harry is just a moron for not noticing.
            ```

            - u/cae_jones:
              ```
              I'm tempted to agree. The reluctants comes from Eliezer stating outright while writing that he intended for people to know that Quirrel == Voldemort very early, and was surprised by the responses preferring more subtlety when he tried making an edit that clerified this (circa Chapter 20-22, iirc?).
              ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Maybe there's a nicer way to say this, but I can't think of one right now...

        In my experience there's two main groups of readers we're talking about here: the first thinks Harry is super rational and right all the time because they see him as *more rational than they are* and so fixate on all the ways he's brilliant while not being able to distinguish actual brilliance from his mistakes in the story. They see people being upset with him but take his side implicitly rather than recognizing when he's wrong on a case by case basis. The second thinks he's *presented as* rational and right all the time because they *disagree with his choices/beliefs,* and so when he succeeds anyway sometimes they fixate on those and ignore all the times he gets burned or admits his mistakes. 

        Neither group of people are particularly good at reading comprehension, in my honest opinion.  

        I get that at some level responsibility can rest in part with the author too, but this story really does bash you over the head with how mistaken Harry is when he messes up, and I think readers who don't pick up on it are failing to understand that Harry can both be right in his epistemics but flawed in his values, judgement, and execution.

        To say the story doesn't do "enough" to show his mistakes is a judgement call; it may not have done enough *for some people,* but, speaking for myself, I found it very obvious that the story was showcasing failure modes of an aspiring rationalist alongside his successes even the first time I read it... and I had no idea what a "rationalist" was then.

        It's honestly kind of hard for me to understand how people can read the same story I did and not pick up on it when Harry is *surrounded by people who disagree with him* and the only person who does mostly agree with him is *the main antagonist* who *utterly fools Harry.*

        It's like... sure there are stories where "the only sane person in a world of idiots" is a thing, but in those stories the "sane person" doesn't fuck up nearly as much as Harry does, if at all.
        ```

          That's very nearly a description of Fight Club (just change a few names), and people actually started literal fight clubs IRL - completely ignoring the actual text of the movie. 

          If you make a character engaging enough and don't sufficiently exaggerate their failures, people are more than willing to ignore what you intended to say with that character.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Sure, but stories shouldn't be judged by "some people who read/watch them aren't as smart as others and might get the wrong message." A writer can definitely make good choices over bad ones to get their message across better (for example, in my view Wolf of Wallstreet ended up glamorizing the lifestyle it was attempting to condemn because it cared more about having fun/entertaining scenes than telling a good story, as compared to say Lord of War), but I think HPMOR did a fine job with it, and am glad it didn't sacrifice more nuance for the sake of readers who ignore things like Harry *admitting* that he's been a massive idiot *multiple times.*

            He's literally responsible for Dumbledore's death/banishment. He gets stuck in an Unbreakable Vow against his will. He ends up being forced to kill people, including Draco's dad, which costs him their friendship... I don't know what people who want more consequences would be satisfied with. Hermione staying dead, probably, or Harry himself dying.

              I don't know, I think there is another character involved who could be _even more_ responsible than the _twelve year old child._

              I agree with your comment in general, I'm just saying.

                We're using "responsible" differently here ;P But even under the responsibility standards of, say, Criminal Law it would be hard to argue that Voldemort killed Dumbledore... I would actually be interested in knowing if outsmarting someone who tries to kill you so that they fall into their own trap would make someone able to be tried for murder, even if the person involved was in the middle of a theft.
                ```

                - u/JackStargazer:
                  ```
                  No, that's basically a Disney death situation. There's no intent to kill, so it wouldn't be murder (except perhaps felony murder, but that ignores most of the rules).

                  On a civil standard, I don't think you could even prove liability for wrongful death. There's a legal concept called "contributory negligence", where even if another party did wrong, the victim can be found in whole or in part responsible for their own misfortune. This might be when someone whose land gets flooded sees it happening and does nothing to mitigate us, or when someone struck by a teenager drag racing was themselves drunk driving.

                  Getting caught in a trap you set up yourself would likely be on that level.

                  That said, Riddle had clearly committed robbery, forced kidnapping, terrorist threats, and several instances of mind control, so there's lots of felony equivalent crimes to go along with here that he would likely be convicted for felony murder. All felony murder requires is that a death which was reasonably foreseeable occurs during the commission of a felony. 

                  Harry has a pretty rock solid defence of duress, as "a gun to my head" is one of the most textbook examples of that.

              It's because a lot of that stuff came too late. Not everybody has the patience to power through a story they are beginning to dislike just to check if it gets better in the end. Everything you are saying here happened in the final chunk of the story - but this is fanfiction, not a book you spend money on and feel compelled to read. People who don't like a given piece of fanfiction, just stop reading it. And, honestly, that's fair - that's what people mean when they say this stuff came 'too little, too late'.

              Take the great Hermione debacle. A bunch of people didn't like how Hermione was treated in the early/middle part of the story. This came to a head when Hermione was killed by the troll - if I remember correctly people even wrote blog posts about how much they hated her death and how the story handled her character in general. Now, of course, at the very end of the story Harry finally admits that Hermione would actually make a much better hero than he is, and gives her his invisibility cloak just to make certain the reader's know he's serious. But that's too little, too late; the kind of people who cared the most about Hermione's treatment in the story stopped reading ages ago. If a more downtuned version of that scene/realization had happened earlier in the story, maybe they would have stuck with it to the end. But it didn't. So they stopped reading. And we can't fault them for that.

              Similarly, the kinds of people most annoyed by Harry's behavior and how often it gets rewarded simply stopped reading before he started facing truly serious consequences for it. The kind of people most annoyed by the 'Dumbledore bashing' stopped reading long before the story revealed Dumbledore was right all along. 

              And that is a legitimate flaw in a story as long as HPMOR - a flaw perfectly encapsulated by 'too little, too late'.

              People like us don't see what HPMOR was trying to do more clearly because we're 'smarter' or anything like that. We see it because the flaws people complain about, for one reason or another, didn't matter to us enough to make us stop reading before we got to the end of what is a decently long piece of fanfiction nobody was ever under any obligation to finish.

                I'm fine with people deciding not to keep reading if they dislike a story. People are allowed to have different tastes and preferences. I totally get why some people might not want to read HP fanfic that bashes on Ron or Dumbledore until it "gets good" and shows Harry as wrong.

                But to say that the story is *flawed* because Harry doesn't face consequences until the end is just *objectively wrong.*  Reading comprehension matters: he got his time turner locked within days of getting it, he lost his first battle because he didn't take anyone but Draco seriously, he saved Neville but did it in a show-offy way that hurt him, etc, and the story *called him on it* each time. 

                And even if it didn't, it is not at fault for having a character be arrogant in the first half and pay for it in the second. That's called having a character flaw and arc.

                    Sure, but we're whittling down the target population quite a bit now from my original point. In my experience most people who complain about the story or about the lack of consequences to Harry are not confining themselves to just pointing out that their preferences weren't catered to.

                      ```
                      Eh. In my experience most of the critiques of HPMOR are pretty valid. While I did enjoy it when I first read it back in the day, going back over it now I can recognize that the story does have some serious flaws and the 'lack of consequences' thing is one of them, but they ultimately all boil down to main problem people have with HPMOR - HPJEV.

                      His character arc is too slow, and his behavior never really changes. The story relies on him getting into shenanigans in order to solve the entire plot of Harry Potter within one school year, so by necessity he can't change, and he often can't face serious consequences that would force him to change. Mcgonnagal can lock his Time Turner and yell at him about being reckless all she wants - he is still accompanying Quirrel to Azkaban a few arcs later, and he is still going to get away with it almost flawlessly, and he is still going to face almost no consequences for it (because the story ends before Bellatrix being free can really have any effect). 

                      His 'dark side' is portrayed as a flaw, something he has to overcome in order to not become a Dark Lord. But it never really makes him lose - instead it makes him win. He never 'fails' an Encounter because of it - instead he gets lambasted for being too dedicated to 'winning' after the fact, which doesn't have nearly the same impact. It's one thing to call a character an idiot because of a flaw - its another to have a character actually fail like an idiot because of that flaw. The only time it really becomes a serious, potentially Encounter Ending impediment is in Azkaban, and even then its pathological fear of death can't make him lose the encounter because there's simply no time in the story for Harry to get caught - instead he just shoves it aside and wins. 

                      Harry doesn't win the final battle because of anything he did to combat his Dark Side. He doesn't defeat the Dark Lord because he learned to lose, or because he learned to trust and value people who aren't academic geniuses like Ron or Neville, or anything like that - he wins because he thinks of a really clever plan under time pressure and executes it flawlessly. Large chunks of the story (and the character development they contain) could be removed and the Final Battle would barely change. For example, Harry did not need to lose that first battle to Hermione and learn a lesson about too easily discounting other people as NPCs because at the end of the day, when he faces off against the Dark Lord, the Death Eaters basically are just NPCs.

                      We can go back and forth on the specifics all day, but that's what most of the flaws in HPMOR boil down to in the end - things in the basic construction of the story that rub people the wrong way (like the pacing and characterization). On the micro level it can be really fun to read; but on the macro level you start running into problems. And if you never liked HPJEV in the first place, then even the micro level stuff is ruined as well.

                        Your criticisms of the final battle are valid, but trying to pair them with what HPMOR's most common critics think doesn't work.

                        HPMOR has flaws, but its critics are on the whole absolutely blind to what those really are, and focus almost exclusively on HPJEV's characterisation, the author's "pretentiousness" and the character bashing they'd forgive in any fic they personally enjoyed.

                          ```
                          I feel like I went out of my way to point out how a person's enjoyment of the fic (and how well they 'tolerated' its flaws) depended on their personal response to the character of HPJEV. It is literally the very first point I make in the comment you are replying to. 

                          Everything about HPMOR hinges on HPJEV - the people who like the fic can, at the very least, tolerate him and so enjoy the stuff the fic does well. But if a person doesn't like HPJEV, then they are not going to enjoy the things HPMOR does well, and the flaws of HPMOR are going to stand out to them a lot more clearly. If someone finds HPJEV pretentious and annoying, then they are going to find the entirety of HPMOR pretentious and annoying.

                          That's why I made my point about the final battle - HPJEV doesn't change that much throughout the story, didn't need to change in order to win the Final Battle, and many of the critiques of HPMOR boil down to, in the end, a desire for HPJEV to change. Critics are right to focus on HPJEV's characterization. HPJEV's characterization is the biggest flaw in the story because of how omnipresent his character is - he is the main driving force of the entire story. His point of view colors almost every scene  (even if the author has said HPJEV's opinion isn't always meant to be 'correct'). The other characters orbit him. The only other characters with similar agency are Quirrel (and I shouldn't have to explain why HPJEV haters also hate Quirrel) and Dumbledore (who unfortunately spends a decent amount of the story being 'bashed' - and I've already gone over how people don't stick around to finish fanfics they don't like). 

                          HPJEV is a very polarizing character. Maybe that was intentional. Maybe not. Maybe the main character being annoying shouldn't really count as a 'flaw'. But it is a valid critique (and in my opinion the criticism that underlies most others) and it is what drives many people away from HPMOR.

                            "Annoying" is subjective. "Arrogant" is not. He is arrogant, and that is a legitimate flaw. That some people find him annoying is no more meaningful as a criticism of the writing than me saying the same of Hamlet would be.

                        To be clear you seem to be dismissing this as not being sufficient *to you* for x, y, z reasons. I want to make sure it's acknowledged that, objectively, it was a consequence, that Harry brought on himself by being imperfect, acknowledged by the text and characters. 

                        >he is still accompanying Quirrel to Azkaban a few arcs later, and he is still going to get away with it almost flawlessly

                        "Getting away with it" is not the only metric of failure. Regretting it is a much more powerful one, to me, and the further alienation from those he might otherwise turn to for help and support is another. In stories with heists, "getting away with it" is often taken for granted, but there are often consequences that go beyond it that matter more to the story than them just being locked up or failing in the heist.

                        >His 'dark side' is portrayed as a flaw, something he has to overcome in order to not become a Dark Lord. But it never really makes him lose - instead it makes him win. He never 'fails' an Encounter because of it 

                        ...obviously? If it led to failure he would stop using it. The reason it's hard to stop using is *because* it makes him so much more effective. But that's not even true, there are times it leads him to "win" but not in an optimal way, such as...

                        >The only time it really becomes a serious, potentially Encounter Ending impediment is in Azkaban, and even then its pathological fear of death can't make him lose the encounter because there's simply no time in the story for Harry to get caught - instead he just shoves it aside and wins.

                        It also causes him to fuck up with Snape in their first encounter. "Inability to lose properly" is the first lesson Voldemort tries to (literally) beat out of him, with only middling success, and part of the problem is that he HAS a dark side he can just keep using to win. The actual success condition in Azkaban once he was there was giving up and turning himself in.

                        >Harry doesn't win the final battle because of anything he did to combat his Dark Side. He doesn't defeat the Dark Lord because he learned to lose, or because he learned to trust and value people who aren't academic geniuses like Ron or Neville, or anything like that - he wins because he thinks of a really clever plan under time pressure and executes it flawlessly. 

                        This is the only point you've made that actually lands; a lot of people had issues with the final battle for reasons like this, myself included. But the vast, vast majority of critics of HPMOR do not get this far, and of those that do most still get many other things wrong about the story leading up to it.

                        See, here's the thing; I don't think we *can* go back and forth on specifics all day :P I think if we did we would very quickly reach a conclusion that [I already spent a lot of time documenting](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/7do4y7/hjpev_successfailure_reread_chapters_100end/) because I was tired of hearing people say stuff like this.

                        Yes, HPMOR has flaws. Yes HPJEV is a divisive character. These are *not the same claim* as the "Harry's character arc is too slow and he doesn't change enough," and those are not objective claims, they are subjective preferences from people who consistently fail to remember specifics about ways Harry failed and changed, and then say things like "well it's not about specifics" when this is pointed out to them.

                        Harry is a flawed character. He is flawed in a way that rubs many readers the wrong way, and the way he was written in the early chapters particularly was rough around the edges, but that does not make his flaws *poor writing* any more than Hamlet's flaws make his character poor writing  no matter how annoying some people (myself included) find him.

              Devil's advocate (I don't have much of an opinion either way because I haven't read it in too many years to be precise about all the characterization): all the consequences you mentioned are essentially at the end of the story, when he nonetheless gets to start ending death, having still outsmarted the much older (smarter?) main antagonist. Even if the final message *is* sufficiently "Harry fucked up," maybe those you're arguing with mean they wanted failures hundreds of chapters sooner.

              (I *do* remember that, for me, the *end* sufficiently communicated "Harry was being an idiot". That Dumbledore moment.)

                  I'm a lot like that guy - haven't read the story in a long time, and only properly went through it once, so I don't have all the details. Forgive me if I get things wrong.

                  For me, I was a little annoyed with the story because it seemed like Harry's successes consistently and significantly outshone his failures. I don't mean the number or, like, the magnitude of them - it was more like his successes were just *flashier* than his ultimately pretty mundane failures.

                  When he screwed up, it was like, "Harry let his temper get away from him and lost his Time Turner," or "Harry underestimated Hermione," or "Harry forgot to update his priors and so failed to call attention to Quirrell." Reasonable mistakes that a normal person could make.

                  But his accomplishments? "Harry is the only person alive with a patronus shaped like a human, and he can kill Dementors and control them with his mind." Or, "Harry invented partial transfiguration, which everybody on the planet insists is impossible, and it honestly didn't even take him very long." Or, "Harry subdued the villainous Snape and instituted effective rules that forever disallowed him from bullying students." Or, "Harry transfigured a rocket engine and used it to blast out of Azkaban and into the sunset." Or, "Harry is so special that the Sorting Hat came to life for the first time ever, sorted him into two houses, and started cracking jokes."

                  His successes were these big, bombastic, chapter-ending moments, and so many of them felt like they were pointing out how *special* Harry was, how his unique extreme brilliance enabled him to do all these fancy special little Harry things.

                  I'm perfectly ready to accept that he ended up almost destroying the world because his mistakes were so significant, but to me, it really felt like the story was going out of its way to highlight how *awesome* he was, every couple steps on the road there.

                    Yeah, Harry definitely is presented as pretty awesome in a unique way. Personally I'm okay with that, and I think most people are in most circumstances, but are just unused to these. Most people don't bat an eye when James Bond kills a hundred dudes while dodging every bullet, or an anime protagonist turns out to be a better fighter at 12 than grown adults who spent their whole life fighting, or a single high schooler outsmarts the entire world's police force (other than a secret world detective who happens to also be around his age).

                    At least in HPMOR we have reasons for Harry's stupendous successes, for the most part: 1) he's got the mental patterns of Voldemort kicking around in his head, 2) he's the only wizard who learned lots about the material world and scientific thinking, 3) there's multiple prophecies about him (personally I hate prophecies as a justification for specialness, but this is a carry over from the canon in any case), 4) he's got a fairly unique value system, etc etc etc.

                    So sure, I understand why someone might feel like Harry comes off as too awesome even with all the mistakes he makes, but I don't find it particularly out of the norm for the genre, and much better justified than most stories.

            > people actually started literal fight clubs IRL - completely ignoring the actual text of the movie

            IMO this is a matter of personal values, not of intelligence or understanding. The movie illustrates a story which features a conflict and tension between two "characters" who really are two worldviews. Tyler Durden is fascinating for a reason. He makes the world a starkly contrasted, easily understood, somewhat more interesting place. He suggests an almost spiritual philosophy of abandonment of your body, of safety, of comfort, not unlike a bunch of religions - except instead of proposing frugality and self-flagellation he proposes to flagellate each other, because that's more fun.
             That's the driver of the first part. The second part of the movie shows the many ways in which that mindset can go wrong. But whether you think those sort of consequences are *bad* is in itself a value choice. Maybe you're okay with widespread death and mayhem, maybe you really think our society is so rotten it has it coming. Maybe you're genuinely ready to face your own death if you think it has meaning, and don't care for other people's. Evil? From our viewpoint, sure. Inconsistent or irrational? Not really. 

            Imagine making the same movie, but about the dangers of democracy. It starts with a small group of people gathering together to live in a democratic commune. It looks fun and pleasant and they all get to decide and do their part. Their movement expands, and in the second half, they take the country by storm. There's a revolution, the king is beheaded, the aristocracy flees. Democracy becomes the law of the land. At the beginning it seems like it goes well, but then populists start emerging. Democracy eats itself and is paralyzed by indecision when it matters. The country collapses, and the protagonist, finally seeing the madness of it all, starts plotting to try and get back the rightful heir of the King.

            That wouldn't be such a weird movie. In fact it could be an almost perfect historical movie about the French Revolution, save a few details. We would all consider its morals repugnant - for all of democracy's flaws, *no way* monarchy would be a better option! - but for someone with a 17th century mindset, that would reflect their thoughts perfectly.

          I generally agree that this is not the author's intent, but I think an author's success when writing can be well approximated by "what percentage of the audience they had in mind for their work actually *gets* what they were trying to convey?". If that percentage is significantly lower than you'd expect, that's a failure on the author's part. You don't get to claim "but, but, but people are actually too dumb to get what I meant!", because that's something you should have accounted for too, then.

  This might be me getting hung up on wording, but its not necessarily true that the universe has any compassion or something. There's enough knowledge from study of celestial bodies (from muggles) to understand their movements and see patterns, so they're not randomly flitting about through space. And given foreknowledge is shown to be possible through the existence of prophecies, anything gleamed from the current shape of reality could easily have been set in motion eons ago by an incredibly intelligent precursor/s, rather than an innate characteristic of the universe or what have you. There's a broad spectrum of why things could appear as they are, especially with magic involved, so chalking the meaning or intention behind reality up to a single ideal/emotion/objective/deity/etc. seems unjustifiably confident.

  I always got the impression that Harry was taking a lot of his muggle baggage into the magical world, and not updating enough of his greater worldview to accommodate the new data that is the existence of magic.

  It struck me the most, personally, when Harry staunchly argued that souls couldn't possibly exist, using well-reasoned arguments against a specific definition of 'soul' and using that to claim the whole concept disproven, in concurrence with what he had reasonably believed before he learned of magic.  I was left thinking "Of all the magics of the world, you don't think it's even *possible* that something that one might describe as a soul exists?"  I can imagine someone like Merlin or those before him crafting a viral magical construct that copies brain-states until a person dies, or other formulations that make for a similar effect, and the possibility of something like that is something that should greatly intrigue Harry if he hadn't stayed stuck to the surety that souls can't possibly exist.

When he finds out that ghosts are just magic afterimages, he's incredibly upset. If the evidence was there, his desire to see an afterlife defiantly outweighed any bias towards old beliefs.

    After that, the arguments seemed sensible: 

    * Wizards didn't have any more solid proof of an immortal soul than paintings or ghosts, both of which couldn't learn, grow, or change, and were thus not real in any important sense. 

    * If the soul existed and could think, brain damage wouldn't change a person

    * If there was an afterlife, you'd expect to see more from the other side than a single veil that has sounds like the voices of the dead, or a single lost artifact that people say could bring back the dead

  This reminds me of this quote from Einstein:

  > “The fanatical atheists are like slaves who are still feeling the weight of their chains which they have thrown off after hard struggle. They are creatures who—in their grudge against traditional religion as the "opium of the masses"—cannot hear the music of the spheres.”

  Harry basically trades one set of chains for another. He sticks with what he knows and feels comfortable with. Magic is real? Sure thing. A person with the body mass of a human adult turns into a cat in front of his eyes? No way, Jose. The story shows us right from the start that while operating under some kind of logic (or lack there of), it doesn't operate under the kind of logic which Harry is fluent in.

  He basically keeps falling into what I personally call the smart idiot's trap. His whole life he's always had an edge over people with his ridiculous education level. He was never truly shocked to his core and thus believed himself immune to logical fallacies.

  I think the whole exchange between Harry and Dumbledore makes more sense if you view it as a language fluency issue. Treat different logics as different languages. Harry can't understand a whole sentence in Weird Logic, because he isn't a native speaker, like Dumbledore is.

  Harry might be able to grasp a rough idea for a concept but wouldn't know what it's called without Dumbledore telling him. Dumbledore might be able to explain certain concepts like cliches to give him a basic vocabulary. But if he strung a complete sentence together, Harry would be completely lost. (I believe this is also how oracles work.)

  Like take a modern physicist and put him in the Middle Ages, everybody would call him insane. Few would be willing to listen and learn his vocabulary. Of course us modern people would call them morons and laugh at them, but that's because we are already native to modern physics.

  In conclusion: Harry's skepticism is misplaced (in hindsight), but you can't expect him to have a magical sense for truth either. Harry's logic 100% makes sense in context, it just so happens to be that his logic system itself is wrong. You can't blame Harry for not figuring this out himself. It's like learning a language without knowing any of the words.

That did more to advance our understanding of QM than most of the work done by those who sheepishly bought into Bohr's "you're not allowed to ask that question!" nonsense. I actually studied this a bit as in, I read some of the transcripts of the Solvay Conference at which QM really got some traction, and in it already Einstein tried to bring up how QM implied nonlocality. That's the insight that eventually led to Bell's theorem. Those transcripts are frustrating because Einstein was *clearly* saying very sensible things and everyone else didn't even understand him and went "haha you just didn't get how this works, let's move to the next topic". The EPR paradox paper was just him formalizing in a much more rigorous manner the same intuition he demonstrated already back there.

  It makes sense from Harry's perspective to be some sort of materialist reductionist in the beginning of the story. But as soon as he discovered that magic existed, he should have started questioning his fundamental notions on how the world worked.

  Which he never really did.  Instead of updating his model to fit the new evidence he basically handwaived anything that messed with his worldview.

  And the narrative sort of supported him.  Harry's random guesses based on his outdated model of reality turned out be true many times.

  For example, in HP Canon souls exist.  The existence of animagi, ghosts, the resurrection stone heavily implies this.  You could argue the technicalities but the intention of JK Rowling was for those to exist.

  Wouldn't it be interesting if Harry had to grapple with that fact?  He would have to reevaluate his entire transhumabist worldview, as well as the fundamental tenets of the universe.  It would be interesting seeing a rational secular character deal with that.

  But the author basically handwaived it away as them being some sort of simulated mind state backup.  

  Allowing Harry to not have any real challenge to his worldview.  Basically his preconceived biases were proven right.
  Plus it allowed him to be more knowledgeable then Dumbledore.

  To answer your question, in a canon like world his skepticism would be misplaced.  And he would be the equivalent of a flat earth atheist.

  In HPMOR, Harry is right.  He never really has to update his worldview significantly.  The world is arranged conveniently to line up with Harry's biases.
  ```

  - u/wren42:
    ```
    animagi at least should have given him pause.  the "brain = mind" assumption should go out the window from the start, but he never really updated this.

    However I'm not at all sure HPMOR Harry is right about souls or an "uncaring" universe.  what evidence do we have for this?  it seems quite possible dumbledore was correct given the observations so far.
    ```

  - u/GrizzlyTrees:
    ```
    I think you're ignoring his first experiments with Hermione. The whole point of that chapter was that he had a hard time updating his beliefs according to evidence when the suggested belief was too "weird". He was wrong there, and lost a lot of face over that. His flat earth atheism was wrong but expected, and he updated somewhat using that failure. Rationality doesn't mean you're always right, especially if you don't have the evidence needed to reach accurate beliefs.

    So should've Harry simply thrown away everything he believed in originally because he was obviously wrong? His outdated model of reality is still useful in many ways, given that it was developed over centuries of active research. Throwing it away because MAGIC means losing predictive power. Whenever magic doesn't clearly say something different will happen, it seems clear that the outdated model of reality is accurate. That outdated model of reality found no use in the concept of souls. The new evidence for SOULS could be more concisely explained without a concept of souls that means death is not bad. Therefore the current model after updating says there are soul-like constructs that can be supported/created with magic, which either takes a single flash of magic to generate a limited copy (ghosts, paintings), or a continuous supply to generate a flawless copy (transfigurations of various kinds). However, there is a lack of evidence that there is a universal law that governs sentient minds and supplies an afterlife.

    Basically, I think there's a semantic issue at fault here. Other people (mostly Dumbledore) are jumping from evidence of soul-like constructs to universal afterlife. Harry refuses to make that jump. To make his refusal clear he says he doesn't believe in souls, because that word carries expectations of an afterlife for him. A different story could have had different evidence, and Harry would've had to grapple with that worldview changing. I believe there is a metafic called Harry Potter and the philosopher's zombie that deals with these ideas.
    ```

    - u/okaycat:
      ```
      I'm more critiquing the theme and narrative of the story rather then Harry's specific thoughts process within HPMOR.  

      Basically regarding updating his model of reality, I don't think he was a good rationalist.  And I feel instead of the narrative addressing this it basically rewards Harry with being right. 

      The way HPMOR handled souls is a good example.  Why are afterlife souls less improbable then non  afterlife magical constructs?

      We know animagi exist.  As well as ghosts, human to animal transfiguration etc.  

      This implies there is a part of the mind that exists outside the physical brain.  Otherwise how could yhese things exist.  

      Additionally we know magic responds to the emotions, thoughts, and beliefs of human minds.  So there is something special about human consciousness that the universe treats differently.   So really, the likelihood of souls existing is greater then magical constructs.

      But ultimately that situation doesn't matter, it's just an example.  I would like there to be souls.  

      It would force Harry as a rationalist to  fundamentally alter his worldview and confront his deeply held transhumanist beliefs.  That would make a more interesting story.

      Btw, that's why I liked Harry Potter and the Philosophical Zombie.

      Bottom line, Harry gets rewarded for being a poor rationalist by the narrative.  When he makes leaps in logic about important stuff, he is rarely wrong.
      ```

      - u/GrizzlyTrees:
        ```
        You have a point in general, but I think your wishes here color your perception regarding souls. You need to more accurately note what evidence we've seen that is relevant and what simple models could support that evidence.

        Ghosts, animagi, human transformations etc. tell us that it is possible to think without a physical brain, but only so long as there is a clear source of magic supporting it. We never see a muggle thinking without a brain. Draco will tell you that it's because muggles don't have souls. That may be true. It is also possible that the magic of the transformation includes a part about thinking without a brain, creating a brain construct using magic. There is no reason to jump from that to an afterlife, except for wishful thinking. 

        We don't know that the universe cares about human emotions, we know that something apparently "listens" for specific combinations of thoughts and actions from specific kinds of people, and also that something gives magical animals and plants their characteristics. That only points to the existence of an afterlife if you want it to point there, if you're working from the bottom line. You could also say that all of this points to "souls" being a universal fuel for magic, being burned after death to power regular spellwork and magical plants/animals' abilities in the world. This sounds horrible, so you wouldn't want it to be true, but it doesn't make (qualitatively) less sense than the afterlife. Your bottom line says what you use as evidence, and what you ignore as it doesn't fit.

        I think JK wanted a story where souls and the afterlife are real, and yet there is no clear evidence for them, only hints. I think this is by design. She knows concrete evidence would've changed society drastically, and she doesn't want to write a story occurring in a society that different. I also think a rational person living in a world where god decided to mislead them is going to get misled. Rationality doesn't lead you anywhere the evidence doesn't exist for.

        In general, Harry is wrong often (mostly about Quirrell), but we don't see the results of all of his mistakes untill the last ~20 chapters, so it doesn't feel like he's wrong often enough. It is also true that after his first serious mistake in the experiments (thinking spells are a crutch that can be ignored), his conclusions regarding magic are often true  (patronus and dementors, the cloak, partial transfiguration) , though at least the cloak is given as a riddle that he is in a unique position to solve. I think a lot of us would like more of a story of Hermione and him making mistakes together and learning the secrets of magic, but that isn't the story we got. If you'd write something like that, I promise to read it.

  I mean, being super angry about things one thinks they know, but don't, is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from someone taking their first steps into reality, after having lived in the artificial pod known as "school" for most of their life.

  Well "the world runs on stories" is pretty vague and not really an explanation.And not actually how the world in hpmor seems to work by what it was seen on the story even in pretty vague terms.Plus whatever model of the world is actually correct has to actually explain the muggle world and physics.So you can't just throw that out.  
  And throwing out your priors whenever you encounter surprising evidence is not how to correctly reason.  
  You certainly shouldn't throw out occams razor.  
  Harry does fail at sufficiently changing his mind in lots of things.  
  He certainly doesn't have the right attitude to the evidence sometimes.

  But I feel like what you are thinking is really not what he should have done, and in fact, the conclusion he arrives to in the end is not what you are implying.He should definitely have investigated certain stuff like the veil or ghosts in more detail just in case(though the ghost thing is a bit dangerous, shouldn't ask a ghost if it's self aware in the sense of being aware of their own awareness just in case, no need to repeat the hat incident if that was actually a thing and not the hat messing with harry).But the concussion is not "the world runs on stories", or even "the universe cares".I can imagine some worlds that worked in ways that could be described like that but that's not really how the world we see in hpmor seems to work.At least not to the point Dumbledore seemed to believe , and likely also not at the level  Dumbledore  actually believes.Which are different, Dumbledore doesn't actually believe the world runs on cliches, he just has lots of prophecies and has a sense of how those usually work, and also believes the world is fundamentally just.

  For example, he doesn't tell Harry his mentor is doomed cause it's a cliche , he says that cause there's a specific prophecy.
