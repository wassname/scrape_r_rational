  My computer is crashing every 10-15 minutes, so I'm posting this a day early before handing my baby over to people I've never met before who claim they can make it better.  Enjoy.

  On a related topic, today's chapter is half the normal length.  See aforementioned related topic for why.

  I was worried that Anko would be an even worse teacher than Jiraiya in canon for Naruto but after this chapter she likely is much better. Also her backstory was very interesting.

  It always bugged me that Naruto didn't know about the seal. I'm glad you changed that.

  (Unless I'm misremembering canon.)

  Right now it feels slow to me. You carefully and comprehensively explained a lot of backstory so far. However, the main characters are not committed to a big story yet.

  Is the story about the route to the Republic? Anko's team could  drop out of the action after their mapping job as well. Is it about Hinata's abuse and the related clan politics? Then this mapping mission seems to drag on too much.

  In the sense of wise reading, these are my current thoughts. However, this is the first time I am reading a fanfic "live". I usually read them when they are finished, so I do not have to wait for the next chapter.

    This is actually a romance story, but I see where you're coming from. My plan had been: clearly establish the desire for a relationship, clearly establish the character problems that make it non-trivial, and establish the shared experiences that will pull the protagonists together  (Specifically, being thrown together for a long period of time on an important and dangerous mission out in the wilderness away from parental chaperones.)

    Do you have suggestions on a better way to have handled it?

      You could try to increase the tension by hinting at future problems building up.

      The most bland hinting is a prophecy, but afaik no prophecies in Naruto.

      You could do short cut somewhere else. This implies the reader knows more than the characters, but you can keep it vague. Ideas: Some HyÅ«ga notices and follows them; Land of Lightning/Sound/Waterfall sending some ninjas into the buffer zone; Fire Daimyo/Hokage gets info about additional dangers for their mission; Orochimaru starts a search for Anko; Someone in the casino noticed their cheating and is sending Samurai after them; Their disguise during equipment-buying was not as successful as they thought.

      A whole second story line is probably not fitting for your story. I noticed this in other stories. Whenever some main character has a long and boring talk, somewhere else some exciting things are happening or at least a cliffhanger to keep the tension.
