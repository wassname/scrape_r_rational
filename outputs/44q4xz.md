## [Meta] Do we have anyone here who works in publishing?

### Post:

Just curious. It occurs to me that we have several thousand people here, all told.

If so, do you have any advice for our aspiring authors here on getting published?

  Not yet, but hopefully I'll be able to get a job in publishing when I graduate next year.

  I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

  It depends what you want. Is being published through a publishing house important to you, or is having your book available for purchase / making money off your book the important thing?

  If the latter, there's a fair bit that I can say, but I have no experience with traditional publishing.
