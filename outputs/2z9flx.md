  This is a really good start and I'm looking forward to the next update.

  EDIT: But why does Ginny have a crucifix? Wizards *don't have* religion.

    Yeah, that felt *weird*.

    It's just a Muggle artifact Arthur acquired in a fit of fancy.  Apparently, it turns wine into blood and causes faces to appear in toast!
    ```

  ```
  Ginny was a conspirator in the "Boy-Who-Lived secretly betrothed to Harry Potter" plot. Why isn't that mentioned?

  Why is Ginny so... stalkerish? She met him *once*, for chrissakes.

    Canon Ginny was too, except JK never ventured an explanation for why.

  I like it. I think almost all HP fics I've read had Harry or an OC/next-gen as a protagonist. *The Very Secret Diary* being a notable exception.

  I liked the nod towards the beginning of the Philosopher's Stone and MOR.

  I don't think Arthur, at least in canon, would argue with his wive. He would be more likely to stonewall. I don't think Arthur ever shouts unless it's about something really important, such as the safety of his family.

  I'm not sure what reasons---besides her hero worship, of cource---Giny has for thinking that Harry outsmarted You-Know-Who or that he set up his fall.

  "They never cared to find the optimal solution to anything, only the nearby one." That complaint seems like something a straw-rationalist would say. Almost optimal is really good enough in most cases.

  It'd be funny if she were sorted into Slytherin. I'd like that. Her family would go crazy. And the reformation of Slytherin is something that would definitely happen in Harry's second year, I think.

  I've to confess, I never saw the word 'storge' before.

  It doesn't really show in canon, but in my opinion Ginny and Ron should be quite close. They are almost the same age and they spend a few years alone together with their parents (well and Bill, I suppose), their siblings all in Hogwarts or having moved out already.
  ```

  - u/Darth_Hobbes:
    ```
    I think it's reasonable to change Arthur to be a bit more of an outspoken thinker/skeptic, so that rational!Ginny can take after him in contrast to her brothers taking after their very gryffindor mother.
    ```

    I liked that line in the story. While I agree that the almost optimal solution is usually good enough unlike you, I don't think the "nearby one" is "almost optional".
    ```

    - u/Bobertus:
      ```
      Oh, I understood it as nearby to the optimal solution. It probably means nearby to yourself.
      ```

      - u/MoralRelativity:
        ```
        Yeah, I think so... I read it as nearby, close, handy, easy to reach.
        ```

        - u/Kishoto:
          ```
          I read it the same way as MR.
          ```

- u/None:
  ```
  You use "said X" waaaay too much, and it feels like you wanted to cram exposition in both sides of the argument, so the dialogue feels a bit weird as a result. 

  But seriously, this is an amazing start. I can totally see Harry publishing that kind of thing, and you managed to make Ginny likable.
  ```

  - u/Timewinders:
    ```
    Probably because people usually use "X said", which is more common and less noticeable than "said X." I know EY often uses "said X" in HPMOR, but that's actually one of the things I don't like about his style.
    ```

- u/rumblestiltsken:
  ```
  I like the set up so far, but some of the characterisation is really off. I don't mind the totally-not-canon Molly and Arthur, because maybe something prophecies something, and Ginny is fine because that is the point of the fic (presumably), but Ron saying "stupid little sister" like a stuck up Slytherin? It sounds like he is about to call her vexing and push his glasses up his nose.

  Ron *was* present in HPMOR, and he didn't sound like that.

  The last line is very crackish, too. Is it meant to be? Ginny cannot possibly know what a velociraptor is.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I took that "stupid little sister" part as being a shout-out to A Very Potter Musical, where he uses that phrase pretty often.

    As for the last line: It's not Ginny, but the narrator, that knows what a velociraptor is.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      While I DO agree, I will say the line there is quite murky. While HPMOR and this fic are both third person, they're still clearly from the protagonist's perspective. Very rarely are we omnisciently narrated to. So I think a line like that can come off as being something Ginny would think/say, as opposed to the omniscient narrator. Hence the confusion.
      ```

- u/Cdmbr:
  ```
  First of all, you really got the feeling of "The Philosopher's Stone" in the beginning.
  And I didn't even realize that Ginny would be going into Hogwarts after the bedlam of Quirrelmort.
  ```

- u/blazinghand:
  ```
  I'm intrigued and like the writing. I will stay tuned. I have no comments other than encouragement and a hope that this continues.
  ```

- u/DanielFGray:
  ```
  You have my attention.
