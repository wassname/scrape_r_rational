## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  What determines pitchability of an idea?

  I've been looking at /r/WritingPrompts/top. There are a lot of cool ideas that don't naturally make for good stories; that subreddit tends to upvote those, because people get pleasure from the *pitch* rather than the *execution*.

  At the other end are works which are difficult to pitch but are nonetheless very good. I think you hear this expressed most often as, "I'm not sure that I can describe this in a way that would make you want to read it."

  Now, obviously some of this comes down to the skill of the person writing the work and the skill of the person giving the pitch; poor execution can ruin *any* idea, while a poor pitch can make *any* work look bad. But with that said, I think the concept of "pitchability" is a meaningful one, and I'm curious about what's at the core of it, if it has a core.

  (This is one of those places where it feels like information theory should be able to help, but probably can't.)

    To take a stab: "pitchability" is about packing the payoff into the small pitch, which can run *against* the long, involved effort of *growing* an increasingly interesting story over a substantial space (eg: the standard 5000-10000 words for a short story) and then paying it off at the end.

      The real sweet spot for quality is to have a story with two powerful pitchable ideas - one of which is quickly revealed, and the other one of which is slowly developed over the course of the entire work.

      - u/Chronophilia:

        /r/writingprompts naturally tends towards that pattern, because you have one pitchable idea in the prompt but the author still needs to hold the reader's interest after reading the title.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          I think that might be one of the reasons that /r/WritingPrompts tends to do a lot of twist endings.

        That sounds like a sufficiently good idea that I'm going to remember it for future use.
        ```

          It *sounds* like a good idea, but it may be hard to pull off in execution. ^^^^^^^/s

    I feel that pitchability as your describing it has a lot to do with how interesting the world the author is creating is. Even if you can't explain your character and their motivations very well most people will agree that Frodo would be badass with a lightsaber. Therefore I think something with a high pitchability but hard to make a complex story of have the authors describe interesting worlds but with subpar characters. Often I find when reading(or writing) a BST the general world is described far more than the characters which can leave you wanting to see this world but when you do actually see it you dislike it because of the boring characters in the world.

      Characterization is one of those really difficult things to pitch, because it tends to come off sounding cliched and flat. What can you really say about a person in a single sentence, or even a pair of sentences, that will get people interested?

      I'm in the process of developing a new web serial and trying to go character-first, but even though I've got lots of description written for them (their personality, worldview, emotions, connections, etc.) I don't know that I could pitch them properly in a way that would make people care.

  We have names for logical fallacies and these names are very helpful; they allow us to say something like "That argument is an ad hominem" without having to explain what an ad hominem is and why it isn't a good thing. 

  I think there should be a name for the following rhetorical move.

  Persons A & B are arguing about something, either in real life or online. At some point, person A makes some kind of error in language use. If it is an argument online, it may be a misspelling,  or its vs it's, or something else; if it is an argument in person, it may be a mispronounced word or maybe something said in the wrong tense, etc etc.

  Rather than ignore it and proceed with the argument, person B launches into a long lecture about the mistake, usually discussing not only why person A was wrong but also multitude of related technical issues (e.g., how to pronounce words coming from Latin, technical details of tenses in the English language). 

  I've seen this sort of thing happen many times, not just on reddit but throughout the internet. It seems like a common enough way to derail a conversation that it deserves a name.

    This is a subset of the [tone argument](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Tone_argument).

    > Objection to, or dismissal of, grammar or dialect as response to a substantive point.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's called "being a pedantic git to dodge the main point."

    I call it "Workman's Law" after "Godwin's Law" and a friend who first expressed the problem to me. 

    Same basic idea. First person to correct grammar/spelling rather than address the argument loses automatically.

    That exists. It's called Red Herring

  Tyler Cowen's thoughts on China's downturn as of [September 2015](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/09/a-simple-primer-for-understanding-chinas-downturn.html) and [last week](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/01/china-video.html).

  >You can’t invest 45-50 percent of your gdp very well forever.  It’s amazing how long China’s run has been, but it is over.  The quality of their marginal investments is now low and that means their growth rate will be much lower too.  The low hanging fruit is gone, at least for the time being.

  >...

  >I would not so quickly infer that the Chinese government is stupid when it comes to economics.  It is true their actions do not correspond to what professional economists would recommend.  But they are painted into a very unpleasant corner and have lots of interest groups to feed.

  And...

  >What we’ve seen is the central government spending down reserves at a much higher pace than virtually anyone had expected…except perhaps the central government.
