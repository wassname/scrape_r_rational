  > Every world has its rules. Outsiders say the wasteland exists in a state of anarchy, but they are mistaken. Here, the rules are coarser and more fundamental than those of the wider world, but no less strict. Survival means learning to play a game that is unfair and unwinnable.

  And just like that, I am hooked.

  I don't know how long you've spent on this first paragraph / chapter, but it's really great. The writing flows well, the stakes are clear, and I find myself empathizing with the protagonist. Subscribed.

  Anyway, the "false life" thing is interesting. Is it a DNA chirality thing, like in Mass Effect? Like, real life is Levo DNA, false life is Dextro DNA?

  If the Pitchfork can't eat him why is it chasing him?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Probably because its ancestral environment didn't include true life, and it doesn't have the reasoning capabilities to understand that eating humans will kill it. Predators gonna predate.
    ```

  ```
  *More than a century has passed since the world ended, and now it teeters on the brink once again.*

  *The emergency administration established in the aftermath is slipping and rebellion spreads as virulently as the hostile new ecology.*

  *Jan will watch the world burn if it means vengeance against those that abducted his daughter.*

  *Vash will pay any price to prevent that from happening.*

  *Thrown together by circumstance, these two men will become trapped in a conspiracy that could bring this dark chapter of history to a close, or finally bring about an apocalypse postponed for 165 years.*

  A hard sci-fi serial. New chapters released every week. Feedback and comments would be extremely helpful.
