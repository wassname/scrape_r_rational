  I just found this story from an older post of yours in /r/hpfanfiction. I'm quite enjoying the story and I hope you persevere in continuing it.

    Thanks!  I pretty much have to, it nags at me now.  :)

  She should have gone straight to mcgonagall after she found out dumbledore was available, she was proven to be rational enough to actually listen to what Hermione would say
  ```

  - u/AugSphere:
    ```
    She couldn't do what she thought she ought to, that's the point. She had only a small window of opportunity before she talked herself out of it, and Dumbles just happened to be unavailable during this crucial turning point, as is his custom.

  ```
  I wonder if motivated cognition is going to actually work out in her favour in this instance. She seems capable enough of capturing him, barring a diabolus ex machina similar to the ending of third canon book.
  ```

  - u/turbinicarpus:
    ```
    Is it motivated reasoning, or is it [](#s "Future!Hermione keeping her from getting the grown-ups involved")? After what happened the first time, she might have tried for a more subtle approach...
    ```

    - u/AugSphere:
      ```
      It would be pretty awesome if she actually went ahead and mislead our heroine in the previous chapter and is now influencing her thoughts in a more subtle fashion, I admit.
      ```

- u/reasonablefideist:
  ```
  Keep up the good work!
  ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  Ah, and we come to a common crossroads in rational fiction involving young protagonists. While the sensible thing to do would be to go and find another Professor that has proven themselves trustworthy (McGonogall, Flitwick, etc.), that doesn't make for as good a story as our plucky, eleven year old heroine deciding to try her hand at apprehending a murderer. Of course, this could be the influence of Old Hermione, considering how much of this shit she did in canon.
