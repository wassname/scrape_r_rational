  I've got a casual rec this week:

  ## [I'm on TV! \(Showbiz SI\)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/43498798/chapters/109357135)
  *~110k words, weekly updates, CW: Explicit content*

  ----------------------

  Basically a "modern world" insert or reincarnation fic, where the protagonist's mind is yeeted into a a random 1998 8 y/o orphan with a 2024 internet snapshot and he decides to leverage his future knowledge along with the whole "adult mind"-shtick of the genre into becoming a wildly successful child actor, taking over the role of Radcliffe in the Harry Potter franchise and taking it from there (Tokyo Drift, Psych, Tropic Thunder, etc). 

  The author is clearly into movies and TV because I feel they manage to capture the acting scene quite well (at least from my ignorant outsider perspective) and there's a lot of "how the sausage is made" in terms of film industry. They also really nail the vibe of the early 2000's. 

  The biggest strength here is the comedy aspect, a lot of it is just downright hilarious, but there's also the back-in-time chess moves stuff like investing big in the right companies and playing the Big Short IRL with his HP franchise earnings to become fantaboulously wealthy at a young age.

  In terms of explicit content, there are like a handful of lewd scenes but I'd probably rate it more "R" rather than "X" since it's not really the focus. Also, of note, is that besides the protagonist, this is fanfiction where the genre is "real life" and all the people he interacts with in the story are real life people. I feel that so far the author has managed to do this with reasonable respect to the actual people depicted, but something to be aware of. 

  Again, not particularly deep, but a lot of fun. 

  --------------------------

  Anyone have other recommendations for real-life fanfiction with people going back in time to near or more distant human history?

    I like the story, but come on, be fair, it's an indefensible aspect of the story. Not really any respectful way to write your self-insert banging a Hollywood actress you've never met.

    I otherwise second the recommendation, very fun and original.

    Reading this now, I was surprised by how put off I was by a non-negative portrayal of JK Rowling, given her modern political views. Of course, this is set 20 years ago, before she apparently went off the deep end, so it's not like it's unreasonable.

    This isn't really a complaint, so much as an observation about how I reacted to it. I'm not all that far in, yet.

    The complaint is about the bashing of a stereotypical hippy minor character because they - gasp - do *weed.* The *horror.* But that's like, a paragraph at most.

      I say Rowling's views never changed, but the leftist identity as a whole shifted, so Rowling ended up being reshuffled from leftist to rightish


      Like, Rowling is all for race diversity and racewashing , which made you far left on the 2010s, but is anti trans which makes you far right ob the 2020s, even if those two are not mutually exclusive

        JKR was never a leftist. She was--and is still--a conservative with neoliberalist leanings. This is clear in her writing: in HP, systems or institutions are *never* wrong or bad--its always individual people who are bad. The MoM and wizard politics aren't the problem with wizarding society; it's that some bumbling fool is in charge etc. If JKR were a liberal, she would've written about reform or revolution in the wizarding societal system, but instead the books end with Harry literally becoming a cop (It's unbelievably on-the-nose) and the whole point of the entire series is returning to the status-quo.
        ```

        - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
          ```
          She criticises the institutions through criticism of people in charge and actions of these institutions in general. Examples:

          * Sirius's sham-trial;
          * the amount of power teachers hold over students (Snape, Umbridge); the lack of oversight they enjoy;
          * same with purebloods over everyone else;
          * Hagrid getting falsely accused (twice) because the Ministry / public need a scapegoat;
          * discussing award / medal for Buckbeak's killing (book 3);
          * failing to contain Sirius;
          * dementors doing more harm to the children than good with catching Sirius because the Ministry felt like it needed to be seen doing something;
          * refusing to even consider VD's return, feeling threatened by Dumbledore, clinging to power;
          * the educational decrees, the gradually worsening totalitarian state that Magical Britain is living in;
           * Scrimgeour kinda messing up his meeting with the trio in the post-Cornelius timeline;
          * the degree of control the ministry has over the press; how quickly the artificially-enforced narrative of said press can change and leave you with a whiplash; how naive and susceptible to propaganda the general population is; etc;
          * the casual racism of Magical Brits — e.g. towards magical creatures, towards muggles (even ministry workers hand out *Obliviates* like cookies — see the muggle guard in the Quidditch World Cup scene).

          What many people fail or refuse to notice is that her characters often act in a verisim manner. When Harry joins the Aurors, it's Harry joining the Aurors — not JKR doing it for him. She steers characters' actions when it's required for the plot to stay on rails (VD / DEs often acting as idiots, etc), but other than that she lets them do their own thing — like Hermione obliviating her parents because she feels threatened by the DEs and has to deal with the constantly looming possibility that her relatives will be used as leverage (akin to Neville's parents).

          >If JKR were a liberal, she would've written about reform or revolution in the wizarding societal system

          She could've written a revolution, but then it would've made the story less realistic. VD didn't rise out of nowhere. The elites / "purebloods" of MB, the inert / passive nature of the general populace, etc is what allowed for him to happen. 

          Even after decades of influence under Dumbledore — one of the strongest wizards on the scene, defeater of Grindelwald, holder of the deatchstick and multiple important positions, etc — the purebloods still had a significant amount of power and influence on Hogwarts and MB both. If Harry and Co tried orchestrating a direct revolution, they wouldn't have achieved much except for their reputations and positions suffering.

          I think No_Dragonfruit has the right of it. The "left's" demands have greatly changed in the last 5–10 years, and they refuse to compromise on those demands or to reconsider them. Either you comply with them, or you get branded as part of the "right" / "far-right", etc — even if you would've been identified as a "leftist" before. Which is especially why in most cases I don't like when JKR criticism gets shoehorned into HP discussion on an autopilot mode: 1) the discussion wasn't about her, so no need to bring her up; 2) what she says / does is not automatically wrong just because the commentor or a group of online people claim she's wrong.

            >She criticises the institutions through criticism of people in charge and actions of these institutions in general. Examples:

            But are there really any *institutional* criticisms here? The examples you list are all *specifically* about "bad apples" or "incompetents" in charge. Sirius's trial was a sham because Fudge wanted to rapidly secure a political victory (cause he's an incompetent) just like the examples of abusive teachers are again, examples of specific bad apples. 

            For example, how is Umbridge dealt with in the book? The students or *even the other professors* don't decide to appeal to some higher body. They don't campaign for forming some oversight group. Nobody questions why the role of a "high inquisitor" who can dismiss teachers at a whim exists. The professors, including the stalwart and "good" McGonagall, don't do anything about the situation besides practice malicious compliance and turn a blind eye to the actions of the students. The solution ends up being a prolonged psychological warfare campaign ending with Umbridge being violently removed and tossed into the gentle care of the forest centaurs. When this is over, and the supreme moral authority, Dumbledore returns, all is good in the world again, and nobody takes any steps to prevent something like this from happening again. 

            The rest of your examples follow a similar logic: they are all about individuals, and the solution that characters in the story use to approach the problem are always specifically focused on removing the bad apple. Even the entire overarching plot of Harry Potter isn't about defeating magical racism and blood-puritanism, but rather directly defeating Voldemort. He's just a product of the environment: it's not like defeating Voldemort suddenly makes the blood purity faction pack up their bags and say, "whelp, you showed us by defeating ol' VD in a duel, looks like we'll have to change our ways now!"

            The biggest example of JKR's belief in the holyness of the status quo is the whole Hermione house-elf subplot. JKR goes out of her way to portray Hermione's actions in her campaign to free them as silly and stupid. Like, she literally names the campaign S.P.E.W and, at every turn, Hermione is ridiculed for trying to implement change. Even characters who are ostensibly not seeped in wizarding culture, like muggleborns or the big Harry Potter himself, span the spectrum from "dismissive" to "apathetic" to "mocking". 

            > What many people fail or refuse to notice is that her characters often act in a verisim manner.

            Bold of you, in the /r/rational subreddit, to paint JKR as a paragon of having her characters act in a "verisim" manner. Like, wow. 

            > I think No_Dragonfruit has the right of it. The "left's" demands have greatly changed in the last 5–10 years, and they refuse to compromise on those demands or to reconsider them.

            I mean, obviously? This isn't a "gotcha". Continuous development, reflection, and refinement of morals and ethical code is literally *the* core of liberal thought. 

            > the discussion wasn't about her, so no need to bring her up;

            Yes it is. JKR is literally an actual character in the story that started this thread and discussion. 

            > what she says / does is not automatically wrong just because the commentor or a group of online people claim she's wrong.

            ??? This doesn't make sense. You seem to be implying that there's some sort of definitive moral authority which holds sway over reality and that this is influenced by a group of online people? When a group of online people claim that she's wrong, that's just that: It's just like, their opinion, man. Same here. I think JKR is in the wrong, and/or that there is stuff within her artistic work that I don't like. I also think that other people shouldn't like it either, but, again, that's just like, my opinion--not some empirical truth that can be measured with a slide-rule.

              >are there any institutional criticisms?

              What should've happened in the story on screen (but within its 3rd person limited / subjective PoV) to be deemed by you as an "institutional criticism"? Without "breaking" the characters / making them act OoC?

              >The students / professors don't decide to appeal to some higher body. They don't campaign for forming some oversight group. Nobody questions why the role of a "high inquisitor" who can dismiss teachers at a whim exists.

              They don't do that because MB is dictatorial enough for it to be pointless. I'd like to give a more detailed RL example here, but I'm not sure how it'd go with the sub's rules. 

              To keep it abstract: appealing to a "higher body" is pointless because the fish rots from the head. Appeals like that will get ignored, or get you punished or disappeared.^1 Simply take the setting as a whole, and analyse it comparing it to real-life dictatorial / totalitarian regimes, ignoring the fact that it has magic in it and is being told from the PoV of a hopeful child. I'd argue that there is a noticeable influence of 1984, George Orwell, real-life GB on the setting.

              I'd argue that the reactions of the setting's denizens are congruent with citizens of a totalitarian regime that's "successfully" *past* the stage of demonstrative persecutions and purges to instil fear and compliance in its own population.

              >the supreme moral authority, Dumbledore returns, all is good in the world again

              This is only your interpretation. To keep things abstract again, if you somehow managed to remove the corrupt secret police chief but the corrupt / incompetent supreme leader (and the entire regime) stayed in place, then "all" would not suddenly become "good" again.

              >and nobody takes any steps to prevent something like this from happening again.

              Because they can't. Due to the power dynamics, to their human foibles, lack of information they've been / are being subjected to, etc.

              >The biggest example of JKR's belief in the holyness of the status quo is the whole Hermione house-elf subplot. 

              1) In that sub-story Hermione is just one teenager that, no matter how principled, has to eventually yield to the peer pressure or be ostracised if not worse. It's not reasonable to expect more than she tried to do in an environment like that. 2) Applying real-life slavery interpretation to house-elves is not automatically accurate in my opinion, for several reasons. So I don't think this would've been a good example even otherwise.

              >she literally names the campaign S.P.E.W

              This reveals to us a character trait of Hermione, not some qualities of the narrator / author. The characters and their decisions generally should not be treated as being indicative of author's own traits or views.

              >at every turn, Hermione is ridiculed

              This reveals to us character traits of these other characters that ridicule her, of MB, etc.

              >Bold of you, in the /r/rational subreddit, to paint JKR as a paragon of having her characters act in a "verisim" manner.

              Notice that I didn't say that JKR or HP should be treated as an exemplar case of verisim. My point was specifically about — 1) characters; 2) *often* — acting in such a manner.

              >Yes it is. JKR is literally an actual character in the story that started this thread and discussion.

              There is a miscommunications here again: "Which is especially why **in most cases** I don't like when JKR criticism gets shoehorned **into HP discussion** on an autopilot mode ...". As in, I wasn't talking about this particular discussion specifically; I'm just tired of her being brought up in HP-related discussions more often than not. On reddit, no less, which is an echo chamber where only one side of the arguments can be presented without getting yourself banned, so the "discussion" is biased from the get-go.

              >You seem to be implying that there's some sort of definitive moral authority

              I am telling the exact opposite of that: that there's no "definitive moral authority", and thus that it should *not* be automatically assumed that her or someone else's position / opinions are wrong just because a commentor *implies* wrongness by portraying that wrongness as something automatically obvious without bothering to properly substantiate / back up such a portrayal first.

              ~~>but that's just  my opinion~~

              ~~If it's just a particular person's opinion, then it doesn't merit being brought up in most HP-related discussions, don't you agree? If it was my personal, subjective opinion (that I don't even bother to substantiate / prove) then wouldn't it be egoistical of me to keep bringing it up in unrelated discussions and exposing people to it just because I feel like they ought to know what *I* think or feel about that matter?~~

              This may be off-topic for this thread (sorry if so), so probably ignore this part.

              ^1 consider, for context, that: 1) the Minister for Magic a) tried, b) almost succeeded at murdering a wrongly-imprisoned subject, and c) got away with it; 2) Minister's undersecretary a) tried, b) almost succeeded at murdering an innocent citizen / teenager, and c) got away with it. In both cases the subject of the political assassination attempt was in the limelight of public attention and an influential figure — so cases like that would likely be much more common when less protected people were being targeted.

          - u/Revlar:
            ```
            I think you're missing the point about her views on institutions. It's true that Harry Potter shows clear examples of both institutions causing undue harm and of institutions being co-opted by bad actors, but this is portrayed as a hiring policy error: The institution causing harm is always being led by a person to do so, and the institutional power they hold isn't questioned as a problem with the institution but with leadership. See the case of Umbridge, who co-opts institutions to cause Harry harm at multiple different times, but always with the blessing of the minister, who is corrupt. It's not that the ministry is by the very nature of its systems harming anyone, it's always some bad actor holding the reins/leash. The systemic side of these problems, like the teachers having so much power over students, isn't really questioned. The books just give examples of teachers using this for good instead. This is different from the systemic problems leftism is generally looking to combat, where the problem isn't solved by just hiring better professors.

            There is the law set against magical creatures, but I don't think the story does much with this. It's seen as something that will be fixed as soon as someone like Hermione gets to the ministry, where the magical creatures are where they want to be already. There's no displacement or reparations owed or anything that would make it complex and difficult.

            I also disagree with the cliche of "I stayed in place, it's the left who moved". I think what happened is simpler: JKR was a powerful woman and young people online wanted to make an example of powerful people. They chose JKR because she's a tone-deaf person with bad opinions about an important topic. There's no pressure valve for this kind of fight, where it's an individual vs the internet. JKR doesn't know how to back down or how to learn she's wrong to think trans people are raping women in bathrooms. The internet left doesn't know how to bury a hatchet because even if one person buries it, a new one will dig it up the next day.

            The result is an entire corpus focused on unearthing more of JKR's sins, at the same time JKR makes friends with genuinely bigoted politicians and uses her platform to push legislation that will harm people she's never met. The left is trying to take away her platform because at this point she's proven she's dangerous. JKR simply has too much money and fame to have her platform taken away. It's a mob against a person with more power, money and stubbornness than the mob can reliably gather and wield.

              >this is portrayed as a hiring policy error

              I'm not sure I agree with this. Granted, it has been quite some time since I've read the original series, but AFAIK there wasn't anything said by the narrator to come to such a conclusion definitely. And without such narration this feels like [a blue-curtains interpretation.](https://old.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/28l5vh/what_is_the_curtains_are_blue_referencing/)

              >The institution causing harm is always being led by a person to do so, and the institutional power they hold isn't questioned as a problem with the institution but with leadership.

              Again, this wasn't even close to the feeling I've gotten from the series. The Ministry at large is often portrayed as an incompetent entity, on almost *all* levels of its operation. From the Minister to his Undersecretary, to a head of office (Ron's father), to the random mook that's been assigned to visit the Gaunts, etc.

              And "x isn't questioned" should be rephrased as "*the characters of the story* don't end up questioning it on-screen". I.e., in continuation of my previous point, what the *characters* do or do not should not be used as an indication of how the narrator / author feels about it. 

              >It's not that the ministry is by the very nature of its systems harming anyone, it's always some bad actor holding the reins/leash.

              How could this statement potentially be falsified? No matter what example I come up with, the opposite side can argue "see, that scene from the story treated it as if it was due to that specific employee rather than their whole institution, etc". After a certain point, highlighted incompetency of individual members of an organisation becomes a highlighting of incompetency inherent to that organisation. And I think there were enough such examples related to Ministry workers in the story to deem the Ministry itself as having been portrayed as incompetent.

              ---

              >because she's a tone-deaf person with bad opinions about an important topic

              You include two unsubstantiated premises in this sentence: 1) that she's tone-deaf — e.g. instead of "being principled", "having integrity", "being ready to risk her reputation to voice her opinions on an issue that matter to her", etc and 2) that her opinions are bad. To repeat from my previous comment: just because someone thinks her opinions are bad doesn't automatically make them bad. Not in the sense that her opinion is good, but rather that its "bad"-ness is not proven by default, that her opinions, *at the very least*, are controversial instead of plain "bad" — until proven otherwise.

              >JKR doesn't know how to back down or how to learn she's wrong 

              Again two unproven claims: 1) that backing down would've been the proper thing to do for her; and 2) that she's wrong.

              >... to think trans people are raping women in bathrooms.

              ... and this part is straw-manning her statements.

              >uses her platform to push legislation that will harm people ... at this point she's proven she's dangerous. 

              Yet more unsubstantiated statements assumed by default to be true.

              And please notice again that I am not saying they are wrong, or that their opposites are correct. I am saying that: 

              1) the status of these statement is *at least* unclear — so you can't compose statement that rely on them as if they were true by default; and that ...

              2) their status can not be cleared during this discussion — and other similar discussions here — because discussions of politics are explicitly and strongly forbidden on this sub (and to some degree modern-day reddit as a whole).

        Is she really though? This gets repeated uncritically so much, but have you actually seen examples of such? I never have. 

        I remember looking into it shortly after she first started being called a "transphobe" and "anti-trans", but all anyone could produce as a tangible example of such, besides guilt by association and vague inferences, were beliefs that were just slightly out of alignment with that of mainstream trans ideology of the time. Still vastly more progressive and inclusive than the majority of Brits would endorse **at present**, not to mention the US or the rest of the world.

            Yes, she got "radicalized" and made herself a spokesperson for the movement... eventually. The current fixation is weird, I grant, but understandable given that in the past 5 or so years she's received a multitude of death threats, rape threats, and has been literally burned in effigy countless times. 

            But why did the accusation arise in the first place? 

            [This highly upvoted comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/h0a3zv/why_is_everyone_so_upset_that_jk_rowling_believes/ftky60y/?context=3) from 2020 is a good glimpse into the mindset of the time. The points which aren't, ahem, mistaken("Nobody is saying biological sex isn’t or shouldn’t be real", rofl) can be summed up as "a newt told me". It's true what they say, heretics and apostates are infinitely more reviled than even the worst heathens.

                  Rowling described the boxer as male, not trans, and she is likely correct. The International Boxing Association president stated that Khelif was disqualified in 2023 for having XY chromosomes. The association did not make an official statement for medical privacy reasons, but Khelif has not denied this finding. Through some convoluted bureaucratic infighting, the IOC took over governance of boxing for the 2024 Olympics and declared that they would let athletes identify their gender just based on their passport. Thus, we got the controversy the other day when Khelif beat up a woman on international television, forcing her to concede in 43 seconds, to the general dismay of people around the world.

                    I don't really care to debate you, since you're 100% lost in the same way JK Rowling in hating trans people, but for anyone else reading this, I hope you understand that JK Rowling, the most famous anti-trans crusader, the leader of the TERF movement in the UK, did not in fact call the boxer male because she cared about anything other than using her as a cudgel to attack trans people. These losers will try to equivocate and mislead, but their one goal, the thing they obsess about 24/7 is trying to convince people to hate trans people as much as they do, and it's one of the most pathetic cases of brain rot I've ever seen. I really hate when people try to lie to my face and you should too.

      The JKR stuff is definitely interesting. The protagonist is subtly trying to steer her away from becoming who she is today.  


      Still, it's hard to say who the "real JKR" is. Personally I think she was an okay person who became too successful and simultaneously grew a big head while not being able to handle the enormous degree of public scrutiny that came with her fame. 


      She was always stubborn, but the unchecked ego growth induced a pathological inability to admit wrongdoing, and this is what really kicked off her adversarial relationship with the readers and her refusal to acknowledge negative bias in her work--instead she doubled down at basically every turn, eventually making her into who she is today: a creative who peaked in the early 2000's and hasn't really grown since.

        It is a bit of a puzzle how... "empathy" (or a better term) just *dies* in some people after they reach a certain level of success.

        I'd like to think of myself as somewhat progressive, and I try to be kind of everyone, everywhere who isn't actively trying to destroy the environment and human civilization. I'd also like to think I'm fairly settled, in terms of personality, sentiment and outlook.  But what if a billion dollars fell into my lap tomorrow? How much would I change? How would my perspective shift?

        To everyone except the extremely online, JK Rowling is just that British Harry Potter lady who gave so much money to charity that she stopped being a billionaire. 

        > She was always stubborn, but the unchecked ego growth induced a pathological inability to admit wrongdoing, and this is what really kicked off her adversarial relationship with the readers and her refusal to acknowledge negative bias in her work

        The idea that a YA author needs to "acknowledge negative bias in her work" is bonkers. Her alleged offense is having poor taste when it comes to naming characters (Remus Lupin is at least as dumb as Cho Chang) and using a standard depiction of goblins lifted from European folklore, which makes the whole thing even more absurd.

        > eventually making her into who she is today: a creative who peaked in the early 2000's and hasn't really grown since.

        She made FU money on a multi-billion dollar YA franchise, and now writes whatever she likes whenever she feels like it. That's the definition of success for any author, lol.

          I think you should consider a venn-diagram in this instance. The current generation of teenagers is very very online, especially the kind that reads. Whether it's due to the pandemic or to a natural progression, I've seen teenagers hold up her books as objects of ridicule a bunch of times, even at random bookstores where I live. In terms of reputation she's not at a good spot. If she ever wrote something for teens again, it would not be taken seriously by the majority of the intended audience

            The Hogwarts Legacy sales seem to indicate that her brand is still in good shape. It made well over a billion dollars despite boycott attempts, and efforts to pressure Twitch streamers not to play the game backfired. The harassment campaigns and abuse instead created a Streisand effect that encouraged more streamers to play it. If that's the sentiment among even very online zoomers, I think Rowling's detractors are a very small, very vocal minority.

          Just because you lift from folklore, doesn't mean that folklore wasn't objectionable in the first place. There is some *really* bad historical/folk stuff out there, and I don't think you get an instant 100% off-the-hook free pass as an author just because you didn't put in the legwork or are ignorant.



          Also, the goblins and the stereotypical naming aren't the only "alleged offenses". There are plenty of other examples:


          - Those moments where she tried to convince people she doesn't see race by making Hermione black or that she's inclusive by making Dumbledore gay long after publication ("performative wokeness")


          - The whole thing where she took a bunch of Native American material and reinterpreted into her wizarding world


          - Fenrir Greyback as a problematic metaphor for HIV/AIDS



          - Honestly everything involving house elves


          - ...




          I could go on, but I'm not arguing that she isn't a successful author, I'm just disappointed that she isn't a better person as I am with many highly successful and wealthy individuals.

            Stuff like this is also part of why the YA market has turned into such homogeneous slop. When everything goes through multiple passes of sensitivity reading, review, and committees, it puts risk-avoidance ahead of the author's voice and vision.

YA, where Hunger Games is the definition of woke, but all of whose imitators aped the post apocalyptic love triangle formula? You’re seriously blaming woke for YA slop and not cheap publishers paying minimum price for hastily written slop that copies superficial elements of the last big hit?

This sort of influence will further have a chilling effect as authors and publishers self-censor in response.

                I think it's a contributing factor. It adds a new dimension of risk for publishers, which as you have mentioned tend to be risk adverse. They don't want to be in a position where they have spent a ton on marketing and printed thousands of copies of a book, only for it to get cancelled or review bombed. Fortunately the Internet has also made far easier for authors to monetize their work without going through the big publishing gatekeepers.

              JKR is not an artist in a vacuum. She's a political actor who has made it a point to come out explicitly against trans people and progressive policies since.

              Now this is a flawed premise.

              JKR's art is not some secret lore that you need to go out of your way to find--it is something that actively seeks people out. It is a multi-billion dollar franchise that has run advertisements which were seen by a significant percentage of the global population. 

              Also, sure, *I* don't need to engage with JKR's art if I don't want to, but *that's not the point*. The point is that I don't want others to engage with it. Specifically, it might be someone's first or only contact with fantasy literature, and as someone who loves to read and wants others to read more, I'd like the first thing they read to be something better than HP.

              Also, I don't get where your idea of all modern YA being homogeneous slop comes from. In fact, I'd say we are in something of a golden age in terms of fiction right now, because more people than ever are empowered to write and make their works accessible without traditional gatekeepers like publishing houses.

  [Slumrat Rising] (https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65801/slumrat-rising) has finished on Patreon. It'll be finished on RR in... 4-5 more weeks? Something like that. I highly recommend this story, even though it's not exactly rational. It's one of the few western cultivation stories that actually innovate on the idea of cultivation with a distinctly western twist, instead of just being eastern cultivation in a European skin. In this story's case, that has to do with Christian cosmology, especially the Gnostic parts of it (though I guess it's not really Christianity in the orthodox sense). The end result is a setting that is well and truly something I have never read before. There's a cyberpunk dystopia, there are Old Testament Angels and demons, there are arguments on the meaning of God and theodicy and a good amount of philosophy starting from Plato to Singer. It is not very religious, but it does use aspects of the Christian cosmology to create the world and power system. At it's core it's a story about finding out what it meas to be human, in the context of the world that Warby has created. Easily one if the best stories on RR, in my opinion .

  **[The Years of Apocalypse - A Time Loop Progression Fantasy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/81002/the-years-of-apocalypse-a-time-loop-progression)**

  book1 just finished on RR. This is probably the best timeloop fiction I've read, excluding MoL ofc. It has a few weak points, one of them being weak support characters. However, I want to say that the author has been improving their writing quite a lot over the course of the book. Looking forward to where they take this. Very easy to read and enjoyable. If you liked MoL, you'll probably like this one too.

  **[Systema Delenda Est](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/83315/systema-delenda-est)**

  coincidentally, book1 also finished this week on RR! This is written by InadvisablyCompelled, the same author who also published Paranoid Mage, which is infamous because it's a pretty crazy bait and switch that quite a few people were very unhappy with. Unlike Paranoid Mage, Systema Delenda Est is exactly what it says on the cover (so far). Crazy tech vs. system magic, /r/HFY vibes. As expected of InadvisablyCompelled, the writing is quite good on a technical level, probably as good as it gets for RR.

  One of the most famous fictions on this sub, as it drove half of the users here insane with its slow upload schedule.

MC is pretty damn annoying for a long time, but there's a good in-universe explanation for why that is, and it gets better later on. Once I got past that, I found myself surprisingly enamored with the characters, which was unexpected but very welcome all the same. It really is quite good.

  **[The Stubborn Skill-Grinder In A Time Loop](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/83294/the-stubborn-skill-grinder-in-a-time-loop)**

  This one is pure slop. The Double Big Mac Menu with fries of timeloop fictions. Sometimes I half suspect that this is a parody of progression fiction as a whole. MC has the most busted power of all, which is endless willpower and endless soul-power or whatever. Why? Fuck you, that's why. I remember at least 10 instances where he should've died a hundred times over, but the author just goes *"anyone else would've died, but Orodan didn't because he has endless willpower so he just kept resisting forever lmao"*. It's that kind of fiction. The progression is still enjoable, and it keeps going for quite a while so there's that. If you just want to read about some random twerp grinding skills until he can take down gods and if you don't care too much about insane cheat-powers, this one might do it for you. Just know what you're getting into it. It's slop, and unapologetically so. If you're good with that, give it a go.

    > Delve

    My problem with Delve is not so much what it is, as what I felt it was promising in the beginning (that I never got).

    The author will never fully detail the system (of course), but worse is that I'm never going to get more than a mention of a skill name or class name here or there. No non-MC builds will ever be detailed >!(it's 265 chapters and we still don't know Jamus' 13 skill build that he has had for basically all of those chapters)!<, we'll probably never even get a full list of the 144 non-hidden skill trees (because they probably don't exist).

    There will be no well-balanced and optimized party bravely delving into the depths to kill an essence beast above their level. And it makes sense that this will never happen, because that would be taking unnecessary risks. It makes perfect sense to always have a high-level babysitter there to make sure nothing goes terribly wrong, and by the time the MC catches up to the babysitters >!he'll probably just be bypassing the level cap with soul stuff, which has been explicitly confirmed to be possible!<.

    So yeah, if you like politics, uplift, >!cultivation!<, and organization building Delve might be for you. Just don't go into it thinking it's something that it's not.
    ```

    - u/aaannnnnnooo:
      ```
      Delve has the problem that people are naturally averse to dying and tend not to take great risks. To create a world and plot where the mechanics of the magic system are used the best requires a large amount of artifice to the world and characters that Delve refuses to implement, because it's less realistic and grounded and more contrived.

      Amusingly, a VRMMO is the perfect type of story for Delve's magic system. MMOs lack real life stakes so people can experiment, and are known for theory crafting, optimisation, and party gameplay.

      An alternative would be a more organisation-focused story; developing a plan for communications, optimising a build with a level budget, and then levelling people up in the specific way to fulfil the protagonist's needs, instead of delegating it all to other people and having that development happen off screen.

      The inflexibility of the magic system as well, with everything being permanent, only exacerbates things.

        Like every one I've tried was clearly written by someone who doesn't play MMOs and moreover probably doesn't even play video games because they are almost never *fun* to play. They're filled with the P2W, completely awful balance like hidden classes that can solo raids, and just in general lack any mechanical depth. And usually even the social side of MMO isn't done well.

        The best one I've found is Log Horizon which isn't actually a VRMMO, but does everything well. And King's Avatar which does the social side pretty well. But sadly it's also filled with a lot of the typical Chinese filler content.

          It fleshes out what an actual game might do with that technology, and at the same time, it’s more original than most actual MMOs. Not a numbers-go-up story. There are exploits, but more in the sense of “players organizing cheese” than “MC breaks the rules.” I enjoyed it a lot and I hope the author returns.
          ```

        - u/aaannnnnnooo:
          ```
          I'm in agreement with you. I very rarely give VRMMOs a go because they're so often plagued with the same issues of being objectively bad games and also often feel like they're written by people who only consume fiction about MMOs and esports rather than being a fan of those things in real life.

          Log Horizon is the best one I've seen as well. Although, amusingly, Overlord is also a good example; the MMO feels like an MMO when the past is mentioned, with a cash shop and P2W items and high-level gameplay involving putting 100 different buffs on yourself.

          There's a real dearth of exploration with what a VRMMO can do in the genre. Dungeon Crawler Carl played around with 'patches'--the system responding what players are doing to fix loopholes and exploits. Ar'Kendrithyst and Axiom of Infinity: Souleater does that as well, and none of those 3 are actually VRMMOs.

          Patches, DLC, expansions, cash shops, paratext surrounding the game, esports, non-realistic and mechanical game mechanics, realistic guilds; it feels like VRMMO stories often shy away from the facets that differentiate VRMMOs from other litRPGs. 

          There's often discussion around a lack of stakes with VRMMOs because none of it is real, but that's also a failing of the writer for not taking advantage of the genre. Casual players, esport athletes, people going for world-firsts, etc, all experience stakes when playing a game that can translate well to a story as long as the foundation has been laid to make those stakes matter.

      Onwards to Providence actually has an AI micropolity major character that I suspect is a reference to Crystal Society.

        Oh, that's very interesting!

    Onwards and shining wyrm are by the same author, and I’ll second those recs. Onwards especially is great xenofiction, with almost every chapter exploring the mind or culture or communication difficulties of some new species. Shining wyrm has that in much more limited ways, but gets to explore the mentality of weirds, which are basically avatars of conceptual Truths in addition to Jewel herself and major mysteries related to spirits and gods in her world. The authors 40k fanfics, one involving a sparkledog of hope demon and the sequel involving a necron pair are pretty good as well, and also explore some xefiction ideas. The author has an actually rather narrow “genre” they write in, especially if you know about their goblin comic and other abandoned projects.

  Looking for generally good stuff from the last year or so (started, or finished, or got known). 

  I have already read most of the most known rational fiction around. I have enjoyed Alexander Wales' works the most, so looking for stuff close to that.

    Wildbow started [Claw](https://clawwebserial.blog/about/) about a year ago. This is the least "fantastical" of his stories; it's basically our world except it's 20% more down the drain ours is circling. The main characters are sort of "Federal Witness Protection" except for criminals who want to start over. The main plot is about a gang war erupting in the town where they live and raise their two children.

    [Pale Lights](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65058/pale-lights/chapter/1124855/chapter-1) is very, very good. Fantastic worldbuilding and characterization. Same author as Practical Guide to Evil. 

    [Zeroth Moment: My Cheat Skill Is Stupid, So I'll Just Ignore It](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/70672/zeroth-moment-my-cheat-skill-is-stupid-so-ill) is a great subversion of the portal fantasy genre. I would say you need to read the first volume to the end(which is not long) to get a feel for what the story is trying to do, what the tone is. 


    [A Young Girl's Game of Thrones](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-game-of-thrones.1095557/) is pretty good, though I advise anyone reading it to skip the comments. I don't know about anyone else, but for me all the fawning and pedantry sets my teeth on edge.

      Spacebattles has the worst comments of any site that I've seen. Downloading the entire story and reading it separately in an ereader makes the experience so much better.

    https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/83294/the-stubborn-skill-grinder-in-a-time-loop - Deceptively good. Highlight of the year for me.

    https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/83315/systema-delenda-est - A system that takes over worlds takes over Earth, posthumans that were outside Earth during takeover take Earth back and wipe out the system, then posthuman MC goes to war with the system across the network of its other worlds.

    https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/81002/the-years-of-apocalypse-a-time-loop-progression - Time loop story. Pretty dry before MC realizes she's looping (11 chapters or so), I'd suggest skimming or even starting at 11, but then it gets quite fun.

  Came across some Raildex/Toaru fanfic the other and wanted to ask if anyone had any that they'd recommend or if its as messy as the novels.

    I enjoyed [In Memoriam](https://archiveofourown.org/works/864249/chapters/1657513) by Shockz, which is a rational-adjacent rewrite of Toaru.  
    [An Uncertain Magical Index](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/an-uncertain-magical-index.1127309/) by The Young Pyromancer is also quite enjoyable, which features Index as a protagonist. Index acquires agency over her own fate, and takes a level in badass.
