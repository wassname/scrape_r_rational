## [BST] Itching to write self-indulgent self-insert RatFic

### Post:

I wrote a short snippet for [MLP Loops](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/98568/); and started to write a longer set, but they were rejected due to not quite fitting with the setting.

I seem to have caught a writing bug - since then, I've found myself doing some worldbuilding and plotting for a story. Not MLP, not related to any particular setting; including Hanson's [Long-Term Growth](http://hanson.gmu.edu/longgrow.pdf) article as background, as well as cryonics, immortality-seeking, the size of AI mind-space, my usual play with changing the usual one body to one mind ratio, prediction markets, attempts at munchkinism, and other such rationalist tropes.

What I haven't actually done... is make the decision to start writing the thing. Somewhat relatedly, I haven't decided which, if any, online techniques should be used in the writing process (betaing, using Google Docs, etc) and/or where to make the story available (Personal website, DeviantArt, a forum such as SpaceBattles, LW Discussion, etc). I'm posting here to /rational in hopes of evoking suggestions I may not have considered; so that once I know what the available options *are*, I can decide whether or not to pick any... and whether or not to write at all.

So: What suggestions have you got?

  >What suggestions have you got?

  Just start writing as quickly as possible and publish regularly somewhere. Something really simple like Wordpress blog or Google docs. If you have more energy you can do something more fancy, but that shit is secondary. You can post links to /r/rational and people here would offer feedback. You can post links to other websites.

  It doesn't have to be good in the beginning. It's generally agreed that [Worm](http://parahumans.wordpress.com/about/) kinda sucked during the first few chapters, but it became really, really good later on because Wildbow just kept writing a *lot*. Just write and you'll improve.

    A piece of advice that's hard to argue with.


    ... A possible first line:

    "Looking back, I suppose my story really begins on the day I died. Of course, I didn't realize that had happened for quite some time..."
    ```

    - u/AmeteurOpinions:
      ```
      Actually, that's kinda weak for a first line.

      Books are not movies. You don't open with a slow fade-in. Just start showing what is *there* and keep going.
      ```

        > Just start showing what is there and keep going.

        Alternative for an *in media res* first paragraph:

        I woke up as sick as it was humanly possible to be. The only reason everything within five feet wasn't covered in noxious fluids was my GI tract was, mercifully, already empty. Even given all of that, somewhat more concerning was the discovery that my legs ended mid-thigh. Thinking about that used up enough of my cognitive resources that I didn't even try to figure out how concerned I should be that I was hallucinating a pink-furred rabbit-woman puttering around at the head of my bed, and was barely able to pay enough attention to the fact that she was naked to try to remember the more aesthetic details when I could properly appreciate them...

        (Second paragraph: Throw in an earthquake, or at least what seems like one, and build up from there...)
        ```

        - u/AmeteurOpinions:
          ```
          Much better (and weirder).
          ```

          - u/DataPacRat:
            ```
            It's probably safe to say that 'weird' is going to be an understatement...
            ```

      - u/DataPacRat:
        ```
        Okay, so maybe that could be a meta-text blurb, ala part of a novel's back cover, instead of part of the story proper.

        I suppose that also means I should leave out anything along the lines of "This narrative is derived from personal memories, available recordings, written notes, and interviews of willing survivors. All of these have their various biases, and narration imposes its own requirements on what to include and what to leave out - but the result is as true a story as I can make.", or any other hedging about where the story actually comes from.
        ```

  :3

  Whatever you're writing is going to suck for the first few iterations, especially if you haven't done much writing recently. You might not want to worry about where you're going to publish it until you've gotten some feedback from, say, here.
  ```

  - u/DataPacRat:
    ```
    I expect that whatever I write is going to be roughly the qualify of fan-fiction. If I do better than I currently anticipate, it's going to be *good* fanfiction; but I'm under no illusions that I'm going to get it onto paper.

    I suppose that one thing I'm looking for is where I can post to *get* the best possible feedback.

  In case anyone's still reading this post... I've written 3,000 words today - and they're gloriously terrible, full of infodumpy badness and horrible conversationing, and attempts to imply things that are so subtle they're downright invisible. It's going to take a near-total rewrite before I'd even be willing to show the result to anyone else to tell me how bad it is. Still... it's 3,000 words more than I've written in just about any day in recent months.

  I've finished a first draft of an intro sequence. It's... still bad, but not as bad as before. (Which doesn't say much.) I'm planning on continuing writing what happens after that, but in case anyone here wants to read and comment (or read and laugh at how far my writing skills have deteriorated), I've put a copy up at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU8o3wSAiufh-Eg1FtL-6656dNvbCFILCi2GbeESsb4/edit?usp=sharing .

    ... How the bleep have I been writing 4,000 words a day for the past 4 days straight?

  Link to your loops.

  and the whole "we have achieved congress" eldritch multithreading neuroarchitecture loop did fit the setting? 37.11

    [Loop 87.6](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9216685/91/MLP-Loops), and the rejected ones are in the discussion forum at SpaceBattles, whose search functionality appears to be currently disabled.

  Hi.  I know you on like every rationalist forum you're on.  I'm the one with the constant TTGL references.

  Related matter: how's your life-extension-through-exercise routine going these days?

  LET'S SEE YOU GRIT THOSE TEETH!

    I have just recently acquired a bicycle, which lets me go three times as far in a given time as walking. On the downside, I have to concentrate more on riding it, which doesn't leave as much attention for thinking and plotting...
