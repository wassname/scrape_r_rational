## Thank you for your work

### Post:

Hello r/rational, 

I am quite new to this genre and thus I have read only HPMOR and Metropolitan man when it comes to rational fiction. And I can't seem to read anything else...

Like most humans on the planet, I don't agree with stupid "heroes". They are heroes and if they are stupid then they're worse than villains, I think. Or they should just hire a very intelligent advisor... Having powers means that you should have both the IQ and EQ in my opinion. Otherwise you'll be a monster or you'll be an idiot. Both isn't good.

I sincerely thank all the people trying so hard in writing rational fiction. Magical power is almost always bad in the hands of humans and a magical world with humans is definitely not a fairy tale. I believe that rational fiction really highlights that. So really thank you :)

I also have a request. Can you recommend me something which is mostly (or completely) written from the perspective of a rational protagonist. I now realize that once you've read that perspective, you'll always come back for more.

  There’s a list of noteworthy rational works in the [wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)  My personal favorites are:

  - Friendship is Optimal:  Hanna, the CEO of Hofvarpnir Studios, just won the contract to write the official My Little Pony MMO. Hanna has built an A.I. Princess Celestia and given her one basic drive: to satisfy everybody's values through friendship and ponies. Princess Celestia *will* satisfy your values through friendship and ponies, and it *will* be completely consensual.  (Copied from the description.  It’s extremely good even if you, like me, have no other interest or background in the MLP fandom.)
  - Pokemon:  The Origin of Species:  A rational take on Pokémon Red/Blue, seen through the lens of three very different protagonists.
  - Worth the Candle:  Most of the time, LitRPG is about as un-rational as it gets.  WtC, however, is a brilliant deconstruction of the genre that plays with and subverts most of its key tropes.
  - Worm:  Arguably the best web serial in existence, Worm isn’t *technically* rational, but features many of the same themes.  It’s a reconstruction of the superhero genre with some of the best worldbuilding and characterization I’ve seen in fiction, and I rarely miss out in a chance to recommend it.  The sequel, Ward, is in progress.  (Avoid r/parahumans, though, as it tends to be very spoilery.  The same goes for the subreddit of...)
  - A Practical Guide to Evil:  If you’re familiar with TvTropes, you’ll appreciate this one.  In the guideverse, common tropes and patterns in fantasy, such as heroes being guaranteed to survive long falls off cliffs and villainous monologues signaling imminent failure and/or death, are intrinsic laws of the setting.  Meaning they can be exploited by anyone enough savvy enough to recognize them...be they heroes or villains.

    I personally stopped reading (and won't continue) reading A Practical Guide; not because of anything against it (in fact I think it's a really good story) but you can sort of learn the same lessons by actually reading the original stories where the tropes are from too. Plus to me it's kind of the same "journey" as WtC and I just prefer that one, so I read that instead.

    Agreed on Worm. One thing I would like to see in the world is a faithful take on Worm as a movie or TV series, because I think making it that visceral would be beneficial to people to see just how bad a world that requires "superheroism" actually is.

    Also, historically I effectively paid about $16,000 just to read it and learn a bit about how statistics was typically taught, which in hindsight is probably the best bargain I ever made (despite lack of academic achievement 2014 was a good year for me) and so I'm hoping that the author will make a significant amount more money from the work than they have.

    This sounds so desperate in my head. It makes me laugh because you're writing one of the most popular things on this sub.

    (It's like 440,000 words of not-finished and it's ALL from the perspective of a rational protagonist.)

    Is it any good? I've noticed it for a while, but I never read any of the original series, so there's no background basis of familiarity and I've been hesitant to really jump in.

    Edit: ok, y'all've convinced me. I'll give it a try!
    ```

    - u/None:

      I got a couple dozen chapters into it and stopped because it was on a long break from updating, but I plan to get back to it. It's pretty good. Original series glossed over how fucked up things were a lot, this doesn't.

      100% of my Animorphs knowledge comes from Reckoning, and I think the story is awesome.

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      I'll let others speak to whether it's good or not, but it's written to be accessible without knowledge of canon.  Give it 2-3 chapters and the confusion of being dropped into the middle of things should be totally gone.  All you miss by not having read canon is the occasional reference/easter egg.
      ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      It was good. Really good. But I don't know how it is now. I stopped because there was a hiatus that coincided with a timeskip and a shift in tone, meaning that I had difficulty getting back into the story since I wasn't as invested anymore and didn't really get what was going on.

    Thanks for the speedy reply and for your recommendation, I'll definitely read it :)

  I say that it's like getting your fiction in mental HD.

  I definitely recommend the [sub's wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index) for an explanation of what Rational Fiction is and lists of things to read.

  I'd like to draw your attention to the following.

  I don't agree with that sentiment at all, because I don't expect perfect decisions from protagonists.

  In fact, I love idiot heroes. I love characters who are bumble-kings. Characters who stumble and fail their way to victory. Because characters who aren't perfect, who are flawed, who have limited information, who don't always get what they want, who make terrible choices, are *fascinating*.

  Because they're *human*. Certainly moreso than characters who make correct decisions every time, all the time.

    I think you’re going too far on the opposite end.

    People like competence, like rational thinking, like protagonists showing off intelligence as long as it is *realistic*. Realistic being defined as people making the best decisions they could (at least, better than what the average reader could think up in short time) given the limited amount of information at their disposal, in pursuit of their short and long term goals.

    Rational protagonists are not emotionless robots nor perfect, they can very well have personal flaws, weaknesses and certain biases. They are merely those who make decisions that the reader can recognize as brilliant or ingenious occasionally, and arrive at their decisions in a way that can be easily followed along.

  Klein from [Lord of the Mysteries](https://www.wuxiaworld.co/Lord-of-the-Mysteries/1486806.html) is one of my favourite rationalist MCs in that he often walks the reader through his thinking processes and leaps of logic. The guy’s personality also shines pretty easily through his actions: a stoic miser with a strict moral code, a paranoid yet lonely fellow who keeps getting himself dragged into deadly situations (mostly of his own making) yet thrives in total chaos with his Batman levels of preparation, ability to think in his feet when plans inevitably go wrong and great talent at misdirection.

  I’ve managed to get a few people here reading it over the last few months and it was mostly well received, with a few cultural/translator poor word choice issues due to being written by a Chinese author. I think you might like it too.

    Thanks for the rec, I'm reading Forty Millenniums Of Cultivation so some offbeat grammar is no problem for me.
