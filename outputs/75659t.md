  My 2 cents: So the Iris just wants everyone to settle down and have a good story dammit.

  It looks like the easiest way for the conflict to resolve is to fork the simulation. One where Lakshimi's "story" can run to its conclusion and one where everyone isn't turned into computronium. The only glaring problem is that the Lakshimi "story" can't just be halted by the Iris since deus ex machina makes for a bad story, so I think an outside element like tracer's time travel will probably come into play in the (Lakshimi-loses) simulation fork.
