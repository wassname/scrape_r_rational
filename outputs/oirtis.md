## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Saw a rec for Virtuous Sons a few weeks back, and the prose/characters/worldbuilding is all butter smooth. The fight scenes in the latest chapters are especially noteworthy - never before have I reread the same chapter three times in a row. Give it a go, might be up your alley too: [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia)

    As always, Unsong, which hooks you from the first lines. The last line of the [prologue](http://unsongbook.com/prologue-2/) always get me:

    >because it turned out there were far *fewer* things in Heaven and Earth than were dreamt of in almost anyone’s philosophy.

    ...and then there's Chili and the Chocolate Factory. Verbatim from chapter 5:

    >Creatively described space-themed robots dropped in through the ceiling and attacked both Maruma and Mr. FF, who engaged them in battle. If anyone had been watching, they wouldn't have had any trouble identifying where everyone was and what they were doing at all points in the fight, which lasted exactly as long as it needed to without becoming repetitive. There was much less of a focus on individual blow-by-blow action than there was on how everyone was feeling and operating in the heat of the moment, which gave it all a cohesive flow that nobody really took the time to appreciate.

  I'm looking for more web serials in the crafting/shopkeeping genre and in the dungeon core (non-murderhobo) genre.

  For the crafting/shopkeeping one, as a level-setter/context, I will say that I *really* enjoyed the Magic Shop arcs / chapters of Never Die Twice and was sad when they ended. I also like the crafting bits in The Way Ahead and liked Dungeon I/O. I really disliked, like "wow, if this can be successful, why am I not writing my own stories" level of disliked, Magical Smithing.

  For dungeon core stories, I read and loved No Epic Loot Only Puns, Woke Up As A Dungeon Now What, Blue Core, Oasis Core, Lonely Dungeon, and the dungeon core side story in Cinnamon Bun. I disliked Thieves Dungeon. Not interested in stories where the dungeon actively seeks out people to murder without cause, thanks.

    You may be interested in [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/). Its one of the the earlier works in the dungeon core genre, and well written. It is a crossover between Sailor Moon and the Dungeon Keeper series, though little to no knowledge of either is required. It is unfinished and continues to update, albeit once a blue moon; it is currently sitting at near 900k words.

    The premise is that Sailor Mercury is transported to another world and gains a dungeon core in a world where only evil people have dungeon cores. This causes problems for her as she tries to find a way home.

    I was about to recommend [I Woke Up as a Dungeon, Now What?](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/) before recognizing it in your list. For those who aren't familiar, it's a pretty neat Worm/original dungeon core story. I think it really nailed the "weird new system to play with" parts while maintaining decent prose and proofreading.
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    There's a story that kinda sits at an intersection of both, sorta: [Dungeon's Pet](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43346/dungeons-pet) is a good slice-of-life story about a member of the Scholar's Guild who accidentally makes contact with a dungeon, and realizes that it's way more intelligent than it ought to be for this stage in its development. 

    There's actually very little dungeon core stuff in this story - it's mostly about the human character trying figure out the balancing act of life. Gotta spend time with your friends, gotta figure out how to make money when you'd rather just spend all day in the library, and since this is a world with monsters and stuff, gotta figure out how to get more powerful. 

    The crafting / shopkeeping part comes in when the MC realizes that, although the Scholar's Guild is perfectly happy to support scholars in their quest to read all day and write papers all night, anyone who needs adventuring equipment needs cold hard cash. So the MC needs to figure out how to turn her skills into money, and goes through a few different kinds of jobs.

  What's the longest book, or series of books, that you've ever read? Was it worth it?
  ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    Taken literally, probably the bible. I don't regret reading it, but I'm not super recommending it, either. If you read one thing from it, read Ecclesiastes. I think it was secretly written by a secular humanist and snuck into the bible as a hoax. The Jesus stuff (four synoptic books) is surprisingly OK, Jesus was a radical and everyone after has tried as hard as possible to water him down. Actually, you know what, I am recommending it, just pick and choose and maybe read 6-7 books total out of the full 72.

    In terms of stuff recommended on this sub, probably I *Shall Seal the Heavens*, a CN translation. I found it entertaining at the time, and it got me through some tough months at work. Wuxia played straight , possibly the best example of that, to the extent that the word "best" is appropriate for CN translations.

    Stephenson's **Cryptonomicon** is really long, but also really good, and still worth reading. It's brand of cryptoanarchism seems further away now, but maybe more enticing, given how we live in the shadow of a few tech companies.

    Mystery novels are short, but the series tend to be really, really long. I've enjoyed, for example, Robert B. Parker's Spencer series. The Dresden files seems loosely based on these, at least some of the plot structure, the slice of life stuff, and a couple more specific inspirations in characterization, naming, and dialogue. If you'd like to try out Spencer, *The Judas Goat* has a lot of tense stakehout and gunfighting stuff (it's pretty hard boiled for a mystery series). In **Playmates** he investigates a basketball scandal and gets into some racial politics that are probably now dated, but it's a good novel. The best ones are probably *Early Autumn*, which has a thread where Spencer helps a young man to put his life back together, and *Small Vices*, where he gets badly injured and has to put himself back together. They have a buildung or progression element that might appeal to people here. 

    Generally what you read these Parker novels for is a tight plot with crisp dialogue and some terse but evocative description. He writes in some of his likes and dislikes, I think reading these as a teen primed be for liking weightlifting, boxing, and cooking. Spencer is basically a fantasy of moral masculinity, they can be a bit hokey but it's probably not the absolute worst thing to aspire to.
    ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      I'm definitely a Stephenson fan, having started with *Anathem* at the same time that I was living in an Honors dorm at university. The parallels to the avout were...uncanny. Sadly we didn't achieve any of the more exotic things to happen in that book. *Cryptonomicon* was also excellent and left me thinking about analog computing for weeks. I've finally bought *Snow Crash* but haven't gotten around to reading it yet.

      I was ready to dismiss the Spenser-Dresden connection as convergent evolution/shared influences, but your description and the titles were pretty convincing. RE: the fantasy of masculinity, I kind of feel the same way. Just because it's popcorn doesn't mean it's not fun and/or validating.
      ```

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        I noticed the connection when starting the Dresden novels, but it's since been validated in a Butcher interview. But if you've read a lot of Spencer novels, the influence seems pretty strong. It's not derivative of the Spencer novels, just influenced in style and structure. I wouldn't even say the moral masculinity thing is the biggest connection, though it's there. It's more in the handling of recurring characters, the taunting of the bad guys, the attention to day-to-day details that fit into the story a bit, the strong connection to the city (Boston / Chicago), and the basic way the mystery is solved (driving around getting shot at + set piece cofrontations for which the MC prepares). He even named the love interest Susan, though that's more the cherry on top.

        Also I've read a lot of both mystery and fantasy, even extensively. And the SPencer novels have a somewhat unique formula or flavor. Honestly, strong influences like these aren't uncommon in genre fiction, look at, say, The Black Company and the Malazan series, or Dune and the Prince of Nothing series.

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      The King James Bible has 783,137 words. That's a lot, but that's not huge for series standards. The Harry Potter books for example are over one million words. Are you sure that's the longest you've read? Single book, sure, possibly, but series wise, it seems unlikely.
      ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    This is making me realize I have no idea how long most of what I read is.

    *Worm* (1.6M) was and is incredibly worth it. Debatable if it counts as a book or series or what given the format.

    Jordan's/Sanderson's *Wheel of Time* (4M) was worth it, but I have a harder time recommending it now. It was very formative for me (and presumably a lot of fantasy authors); there are so many vivid and memorable ideas, especially around the One Power and its cosmology. The sprawling plot and word count is, I'd argue, part of the charm: it sells the idea of a living world, of events too large for even the greatest of heroes. That feeling is what made the series worth it, and it's rare that I've seen it replicated. Malazan and the Prince of Nothing series head into that territory as well, but I haven't finished either. Yet. In short, if anyone reading this is a high school student like I was or otherwise has lots of free time, getting immersed in this crazy series is probably worth it.

    Speaking of Sanderson, apparently *the Stormlight Archive* (1.6M) finally exceeded *Worm* in length. I'm a huge fan of Sanderson's Cosmere but I don't think it hits the same notes as the sprawl of WoT or Malazan. That doesn't mean it's not totally worth it, and people on this sub are likely to enjoy *Way of Kings* at the very least. I didn't enjoy the latest book as much, but I think that was more due to how I was reading it/where I am in life than it was due to the book itself; I will absolutely buy and read the 5th and sort-of-final one when it comes out in a couple years.

    Ah, heck. *A Song of Ice and Fire* (1.7M) is longer than either of those. It's great. The "worth it" factor has dropped a bit given the stall in new books (decreasing likelihood of a decent conclusion) and the assimilation into popular culture (decreasing novelty factor and proliferation of imitators).

    Internet formatted stuff is complicated. I haven't gotten through that much of *Homestuck*, but I finished *Problem Sleuth*, (50K???), which is much, much longer than its word count suggests. It might have been worth it? Great jokes, but God, it just keeps going. Also, [this site](http://readmspa.org/stats/) offers some eldritch graphs from beyond time and space if you want to try and comprehend the amount of content involved.

    Fanfiction and quest content is hard to count as I've read so much of it and I don't care to trawl through every saved link looking for wordcounts. *Marked for Death* (2M) beats out most of the above and is excellent. *A Sword Without a Hilt* (5M) was fun but exhausting; I've not finished it, but it's totally possible that I've read more of it that most other web fiction.

          ```
          Maybe, but "Marvel Comics" isn't really a fully cohesive work and was written by hundreds(or even thousands?) of different authors. Saying it's the longest work is like saying the Harry Potter setting is the longest work if you include the sum of all fanfiction.

        > Is it debatable? I don't think anything comes close at this point, it's passed 7milliom words now hasn't it?

        According to the [self-published author Mark Leach](http://www.marienbadmylove.com/):

        > As of Feb. 1, 2013, "Marienbad My Love" consisted of 17 volumes totaling 17.8 million words and 10,710 pages. While I have not added to the book in recent years, I still consider it to be a work in progress. I plan to make it my big project in retirement.

        > What is this novel about?  Here is the book jacket copy: Exiled on a deserted island, a Christ-haunted journalist-turned-filmmaker attempts to persuade a married women from his past to help him produce a science fiction-themed pastiche to the 1960s French New Wave classic, Last Year at Marienbad. Through this act of artistic creation, he expects to carry out the will of God by prophesizing the death of time and the birth of a new religion. If only he can make the woman remember him.

          This arguably doesn't count, as his work seems tailor made to break records like this instead of being a sincere work. The same work has shit like the "longest word", which is 4 million characters long and the "longest sentence", which is 3 million words. It's very likely that this work was constructed/written using a ton of copy/paste and splicing or is procedurally generated. The author says that the work was "assembled" by him using text he has "written and appropriated".

    Probably the Malazan series, and yes. I also read much (>700 chapters/10 books or equivalent) of Reverend Insanity, I Shall Seal the Heavens, and Wheel of Time, and would not consider any of them worth it, though Wheel of Time and Reverend Insanity I'd put on the edge of worthwhile. Not terrible, but not quite good enough to justify their length.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      I didn't realise Malazan was longer than WoT but I guess there's a lot more skimming over incomprehensible references in Malazan, not that I mind it

      I think both were worthwhile as a fairly fast reader but probably as a youth I had a lot of time for that

      Actually if you mean worthwhile as in value for time maybe it's not worth if you really would read 20 short books instead, but I think such epics offer a different brain feel, really immerse and escapist

    Longest single work: *Worm*. Worth.

      Which issues did you read? I only got into the series by issue 2500 and then tried the "Silberbaende", but I found even those summarized versions of the early issues pretty terrible. The newer stuff is mostly good in my opinion (as far as constantly changing authors can be).

        Oh, in retrospect they're all pretty bad, but as a 12-14 year old boy the endless space battles and superpowers were actually fascinating. 

        Then there was the occasional story by Willie Voltz, which were sometimes actually well-written and even beautiful to read.

        But yea, you could definitely tell that the authors were 95% male and (at least the early ones, particularily "Kanonen-Herbert" Scheer) heavily influenced by growing up in Nazi Germany.

        Also I really liked the idea of someone solving the Cold War by making himself a big enough threat that the rest of the world is forced to band together, laying the groundwork for a united Earth.

    The Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian (The Russell Crowe/Paul Bettany movie "*Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World*" was based on those). The golden age of sail, written in a style making as few concessions to the modern reader as possible. 20 Books (and a semi-finished 21st), \~300 dense pages each, I think. I've read all of them at least once, most of them twice, I think.

    It's hard to be sure because word counts can be hard to estimate. For example, Harry Turtledove's first *Worldwar* series (1994-1996) was only 4 volumes long, but it probably added up to close to a million words. On the other hand, Simon Hawke's *The Wizard of 4th Street* spanned 9 volumes plus a related standalone, but I wouldn't be surprised if it contained fewer words.

    Web serials are easier to compare. I am pretty sure *Worm*, at 1.68M words, and its fanfic *Taylor Varga*, at around 1.5M words at the time I dropped it, are the longest Web serials that I have read.

  I've asked this already, but I think I'll try to repeat myself every few months until I get an answer. There always a chance for some fresh blood in this sub who'll know a work fitting my request. 

  I'm looking for monster/human romance with intelligent characters. The monster shouldn't be humanoid or, at the very least, not something super mainstream and inoffensive like "big tiddie spider gf" or "kitsune dude." Characters don't have to be rational (I would *love* that, but alas, that's too high of a bar), but they should at least have more braincells than average webnovel protagonists. Romance doesn't have to be the focus of the story, but it should be between the main characters.

  It doesn't matter if it's fanfiction, webnovel, a published story or even something in other medium entirely, like a comic or a videogame. I am hungry for content to the point that its form is irrelevant. 

  Thank you very much in advance!

      Hmm. I think I tried reading this one around five years ago (for reasons unrelated to monstrous romance) but couldn't get into it for whatever reason. I might try it again based on your recommendation. Does the MC do any romance stuff with Cio while the latter is in a "distinctly inhuman form"?

    Tumblr might be a good place for you to look, it has a fairly strong monsterfucker community. The only author there who comes to mind at the moment is Unpretty who's currently writing the serial [Astielle](https://kittyunpretty.com/astielle/), inspired by Breath of the Wild in which the female Link-equivalent seems to be falling for the shapeshifting Ganon-equivalent who spends most of his time in the form of a giant bovine centaur. Her writing has been recommended here before, I think, and it has a witty style to it.

    [Marriage and Monsters](https://archiveofourown.org/works/18738010/chapters/44446768) was posted here while it was updating, and the central couple are a human man and his formerly-human wife, now transformed into a dragon. However, this is more looking at how their existing relationship is changed rather than the usual romantic progression so it might not fit your tastes.

    [Bones of Black Marrow](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14692911/chapters/33950472) is Homestuck fanfic, erotica, the main couple are gay, and the monstrous half is in human form most of the time - that's not what makes him a monster. If none of those are dealbreakers for you, there's a lot to recommend it: I don't think you need any prior familiarity with the original work, it's very well-written, heavily explores a monstrous perspective, and pushes the limits of hypertext on Ao3 like a digital House of Leaves.

    If you're at all into Worm fanfiction, I can recommend [Gold Mourning :: Lust, Love, and Death Metal](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/gold-mourning-lust-love-and-death-metal-oc-non-bb-pre-canon.807190/). The pitch: AU where Crawler didn't join the S9, but killed them and founded a Death Metal band. The romance is between a fangirl (a cape herself, limited fleshcrafting) and the monstrous, increasingly amnesiac Crawler. The [excellent artwork](https://i.imgur.com/QscnXJQ.png) for the fic should tell you whether it's for you or not.

    Dorohedoro manga has a humanoid crocodile and a badass girl as main pairing, crocodile man is trying to regain his human form though so that might go against your request.

    Saya no Uta is a nice visual novel where the main character has a relationship with a potential monster. Don't look up the synopsis and dive right in.

    China Mieville's Perdido Street Station has a pairing with a human man and a humanoid insect from what I recall, don't know if it's literally "big tiddie spider gf" though, but might be worth a look.

        The insectoid in Perdido Street Station is a Khepri, a human body with red skin and an entire scarab beetle instead of a head. Whether this counts as sufficiently monstrous is Questionable, but I will add that their species lifecycle and culture is absolutely alien.

  I want to de-rec r!Animorphs as a ratfic (you might enjoy it otherwise, just don't expect it to be one). I started it because of the interest here, and because someone who is writing reviews keeps saying how it's better than Metropolitan Man or MoL which set my expectations high.

  However, it seems like very little effort has been put in making the world and tech make sense - I kept reading waiting for an explanation how alien races can be so advanced yet so unintelligent, why this is their main weapon (it didn't even make sense to be a focus as their original body is very strong already) or how any of it makes sense (maybe they are all really supposed to be of bellow average intelligence except for one single alien, and all the tech predates them?) but I didn't see anything like that before giving up. It's possible it all comes together in later chapters but forcing myself to read through it proved too much, and the execution of different character viewpoints for every chapter was only so-so executed.

  It read as if the author tried to imitate a ratfic but forgot that was the goal when fixing the worldbuilding. Again though, I didn't finish it so it is possible it all comes together.

          Is that how it actually is in the story? If that's true, then fair enough.

          In general, though, I'd say you can't look at political decisions or tactical behavior and make any judgments about the kind of intelligence that lets you develop technology. They're essentially orthogonal processes, and it's so hard to coordinate politically that large groups and the institutions that represent them are always doing stupid things. It's more the default than the exception.

      I just started reading it since it was finished. I just finished chapter 10 and am wondering whether you'd recommend reading the originals.

      I never got into them when I was young perhaps surprisingly considering how much I read then but I'm not sure it's worth it as an adult.

      Still the events in CHAPTER 10 (editted for correction) they surely only make sense from the context of the books.

      I am willing to read an entire series if I will enjoy the rational take a lot more for it.

        Chapter 9, the Interlude? Rather, it's an attempt to portray thoughtspeech imagery for someone not native to it. It's portrayed in a more *alien* manner than anything in canon, and doesn't have an equivalent (treating things as appropriately alien is a running theme with The Reckoning).

         However, this is an example of what the author has done to fix up the worldbuilding: in canon the 2 hour limit was universal, had no built-in warning system like this (no matter how uncalibrated it was for non-Andalites), and resulted in one being trapped in morph forever. This happens to one of the main characters in the first book, which is rather inconsistent considering it implies that a human brain could run on a hawk brain indefinitely, unless the Z-space connection is intact permanently, which brings into question what the hell the 2 hour limit is in the first place. 

        As you can see, this all goes unsaid in The Reckoning. There are a few references and plot points that are clear imports from canon (oatmeal, anyone?), but in this case it's new plot dominos. 

        To answer your question, I think that the original novels hold up (I give them a reread myself every couple of years), with some caveats. First, it's targeting a YA audience, so it restricts its language, subject matter, and vocabulary in a way that the Reckoning does not (it still charges headlong into topics such as war, child soldiers, PTSD, and collateral damage, which is largely the reason it still holds up). Second, its references are hopelessly chained to the mid-nineties, so expect to be mired in mentions of AOL, N*SYNC, Xena: Warrior Princess, and a host of plot issues that a smartphone would effortlessly do away with. 

        That said, I wouldn't consider it a waste of time if you're the type to watch an anime for backstory, heh. [I have a reading list here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-MrWavvGxyyHQaX1slnuuUfHBnW2bE08MYPXOGN0wlU/edit?usp=drivesdk) if you want some guidance on what's skippable and what's not.

            Oh!  Well in that case, here's what canon does and does not have in common with chapter 8:

            * >!The first incursion into the Yeerk Pool is indeed a shitfest!<
            * >!Come to think of it, every incursion into the Yeerk Pool goes wrong somehow!<
            * >!One of the Animorphs gets stuck in morph on the first mission (Tobias as a hawk in canon, Jake morph-dying as himself here)!<
            * >!The Animorphs do get themselves eaten by Taxxons at least once,  although this is much later in the series!<
            * >!Rachel is frequently a one-woman wrecking crew!<
            * >!Marco is gorilla boi ooh ooh ooh ahh ahh ahh!<

            So yeah, all told, a vet of the series could have expected it to go pear-shaped, but the specifics are new (all mostly due to the changes to how morphing tech works, and how the world is in general much more punishing of elementary mistakes).

        >Chapter 9

        You mean the 1st interlude? That *is* pretty hard to decipher on a first read. One of my main gripes with r!animorphs is its general illegibility; often you have to go back a few times to really get what's happening. When I mentioned this in my original review, I got a few comments saying that puzzling through the text was what they loved, which goes to show you cant please everyone.

        Reading canon won't help much with this problem, like this interlude. r!animorphs takes the general concept of the canon, and makes the scifi harder, the characters smarter, and is def aimed  mature tone, which means it will read very differently to canon, which is FULL of 90's pop culture references (as opposed to r!animorphs, which is set ~10 years from now- they could be the originals' children)

        Normally I wouldn't recommend reading the original animorphs just for this, but you in particular might appreciate it; they're pretty unique for 90's YA serials- much darker than what was generally considered acceptable.

        I'm not the person you asked, but I was a fan of the originals and can offer some perspective, if you like. I read quite a bit of the *Animorphs* series when I was a teen. The series is built on imaginative ideas with engrossing plots and well fleshed out characters. I enjoyed it at the time.

        That said, most of the series is extremely tropey. Reading the originals could be fun if you are curious how it compares to fanfiction, but temper your expectations with knowledge that the plot and worldbuilding of the original is about as contrived as the average teen-marketed, episodic TV show.

        In my opinion, the best parts of the *Animorphs* series are actually the companion books that aren't part of the main episodic plot. They give a broader view of galactic events and the backstory of the series. Also, they are constructed to tell a more satisfying, complete story without the hackneyed, 'cliff hanger' style ending of most of the episodic books. In particular, I remember enjoying *[The Andalite Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andalite_Chronicles)* and *[The Hork-Bajir Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hork-Bajir_Chronicles)*.

      > just coming up with good "hows" and "whys"

      Yes, that's the part that I don't think was done very rationally. Take HPMOR for example - there are clear reasons why wizards are less knowledgable (outside of magic) - tiny population and no incentives for them to seek non-wizarding knowledge due to the power of magic (similar to how animals without predators end up 'weak'). Magic itself is nonsense but at least it's hinted that it was left behind, and that a lot of parts of it are hacks or limitations to deal with how destructive it is. Other parts like value of money is just completely changed as it doesn't make sense in the original.

      Here instead the author seems to mostly roll with the limitations of the canon or to only have justifications for some arbitrary parts.
      ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        That's not very far in at all. I don't think that gets you discussion about the Andalite society at all, and the Yeerk would only barely have been touched on with more questions than answers by that point.

        Suffice it to say, your concerns about the worldbuilding not being thought out are entirely unfounded. At best you might complain that the author didn't spill all the beans in the first ten chapters.

          So there are answers to the problems I hint at? I did admit that's a possibility it just seemed unlikely after seeing the main villain's interlude which just deepened my concerns. How far do you think I should read to reach the point where those problems start being answered?

            Most of your questions do get answered, but patience is required. The main selling point of the reckoning isnt so much the worldbuilding but the characters' decisionmaking.

            I'd say read until chapter 18 (cassie 3) to decide. Youll get a bit of insight into alien psychology and a glimpse of the bigger picture by then. If you're not hooked by then, it probably wont hook you at all. Chapter 11 is way too early to give up though.

              >The main selling point of the reckoning isnt so much the worldbuilding but the characters' decisionmaking.

              I mean if that's what you like sure, I'm just pointing out that it isn't done in a ratfic way (as far as I read). Also I personally didn't especially like the characters - I liked Marco but then you have to sit through 4 chapters of other ones to read one of him, and the kids in general had a pretty mediocre approach to everything though I can imagine they suddenly get better because they toughen up from the deaths or something.
              ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    In addition to what ketura and others have said, there are rationalizations for each of those points that I found very convincing; answers are supplied gradually over the course of the book, and I don't believe you'd have to wait until chapter 50+ to get them. The alien cultures in particular are well-designed once we see more of them.

    That said, while I will defend this fic as *rational* and even *rationalist*, it's totally valid for you not to enjoy its specific presentation. The multi-viewpoint setup where each character has very limited information about the setting is definitely a departure from HPMOR or Metropolitan Man, and I can see that being annoying or frustrating.

    I don't know, I might have a bad read on it, but I noticed the cultivator characters, notably the animals that "awaken" and start on that path, have these innate urges to lord their power over others, strike back against slights, etc. Combined with how "human" the animals act, I took it as a "the source of cultivator power also subtly mind controls people into being typical Xianxia assholes." That all seems like a way to keep a world in constant conflict and cripple progress, which justifies a traditional Xianxia setting, as well as justifies not have an immortal all powerful dude eventually decide to sit down and just whip things into shape with eons of knowledge, resources, and accumulated power, knowing they'd be on top of the pyramid and fueling their own growth better by installing themselves as immortal godking. 

    The whole "the land is scarred and weakened by those who abused it and took selfishly from it for personal power, but its still alive and aware and reacting to those living on it, empowering those who help it" seems like a way of adding a climate change-esque aspect to the story, although currently only seen at a ground level. The brief appearances of cultivation pills and similar aids, where you turn valuable ingredients into cultivation "shortcuts" that build up a hard to notice corruption in you, that you need to stop and take time to purge, also helps further explain the Xianxia asshole cultivator stuff, and explain why the main character/cast not using that shit willy-nilly lets them steadily grow in power rather than leap ahead and stall out once their Xianxia magic shit gets hamstrung from accumulated corruption and they get turned into bigger assholes. Like there is that bodyjacking demon thing running around in the background that mentioned stealing power from people in a way that would permanently stop their future growth, without anyone realising what had been done to them. 

    Like there's stuff going on in the world that fits in with the worldbuilding, its just kind of not focused on or really investigated as the main character does his slice of life stuff. It could be set up for later pay off, it could be me reading too far into things, or it could be part of the higher level "the only winning move is not to play" meaning behind the story that getting powerful so you can compete with other powerful people is a rabbit-hole-slash-arms-race of greed, conflict, and death 99% of the time, so just focus on being happy with yourself and those around you instead.

    You don't read Beware of Chicken for rational character development and power munchkining, it's basically the same as something like A long way to a small angry planet or The Goblin Emperor. I'd highly recommend it to someone in the mood for something wholesome and happy.
    ```

  - u/sprague-grundy:
    ```
    It's definitely wish fulfillment.

    I think it's interesting because most wish fulfillment fiction is about wishes like "have an enormous harem of hot girls" or "crush everyone who wronged you", but Beware of Chicken is about wishes like "live a happy and productive life", "help other people be better versions of themselves", "have a happy and healthy marriage", and other wishes that many people have but which don't normally translate well into fiction.  The main character ends up powerful, but the thing that's fun and different is what he chooses to do with that power.

    I think it's also interesting as a subversion of Xianxia tropes.  Many xianxia stories have an all-consuming quest for power at the core of not only their main character, but the structure and social organization of the entire world.  The author of Beware of Chicken doesn't think too highly of that, and it's interesting to see those same tropes played as a bad thing.  (Kind of like that one Yudkowsky story where the hero realizes at some point that half the shit they do to evil mooks, like scaring information out of them with threats of violence, would be a war crime on earth.

      Yeah, it's kind of a pastoral/ stardew valley-esque wish fulfillment (vs. the standard xianxia edgelord power fantasy lol), so more relatable/ wholesome for a lot of folks. 

      I do think it kinda undermines itself thematically though, because though he rejected the standard asshole xianxia protag approach, he still ends up quite conventionally powerful, i.e. there's no sacrifice? It makes the jerks kinda caricatured brainless dicks who never once figured out in eons that there's an alternate way where you actually end up more powerful without being a dick (bit like how in Bioshock making the evil choice is straight up suboptimal in terms of power scaling, so there's basically no reason to go that route)

        I suspect he actually dodged a bunch of bullets via blind luck by starting the project in a highly depleted zone.

Trying this stunt in places with more actual local influences likely just drives you mad.

  - u/TREB0R:

    I wouldn't recommend it either, but I think you're being overly critical of the story. The main character becoming a stronger cultivator than those trying doesn't make sense in context of most Chinese cultivation stories, but the author is allowed to have what they want in their setting and they decided that being more in tune with nature is a better path to power than chasing power itself. 

    I think the story had a nice first book that had a novel concept of a main character in a xianxia world not chasing power. Unfortunately, the second book doesn't move beyond it's initial novel concept and lacks direction. The story has stagnated with too many point of views from characters that I personally don't like reading about with no real goals in mind. It's another story that I feel like since it is described as a slice of life, the author stops making an effort of progressing any sort of plot at all.

      We don't actually know that Jin is stronger than the cultivators actually chasing power. I suppose we'll see that when he gets hunted down, perhaps.

      Everybody seems to forget that Jin was stronger than all the locals at the very start of the story. It's like a giant, well fed cow moving from lush grasslands to the sahara desert. Sure, he's bigger and stronger than the scorpions and the lizards who are all trying as hard as they can, but he basically cheated. 

      Azure hills is the crappiest environment for cultivators possible in the whole world. One of the guys chasing Jin from his original sect mentions that the food isn't filling, that even the air is hard to breathe.

        The mc/healed and bonded with the spirit of the land, which has allowed him to gain power. Being more in tune with nature in general, probably won’t do shit for you.

        MC is feeding Qi to the land where the land spirit current resides. No other farmer in this world has Qi, or a land spirit hanging around in their land.

        The animals aren’t similar to the mc. They adore and respect him, because they gained the ability to think and become sentient because of the mc/land spirit. He’s literally also taught them everything they know since they gain sentience. Ever wonder why kids are like their parents?

        You’re also assuming that the mc is strong. He’s strong for azure hills, but on a global scale he might not be strong yet. And not everyone will luck their way into healing a land spirit which they bond with. Although I don’t doubt the mc will become strong.

        His path to strength is also very different, because his strength is tied to strength of his land, which is a major drawback. You’ll notice that the MCs “vows”, when he gains power, are always related to protecting the land. If someone destroys his farm, he’ll either be powerless, or tainted.

        The story also has a comedy tag, and is primarily written in that format.

        But considering that you’re the kinda guy, who wants to see a girl in a story raped because of a characters choices, I’m not even sure why I wrote this.

            I mean yeah kind of at least you're saying one thing and then immediately going back on exactly what you said. Like you expect that someone *should* be raped and then immediately are like I would of course drop something that would actually do that.

    Support. It's just plain boring. Can't say it's hypocritical because it's not even pushing any agenda, beside simplistic "good creatures are lucky, evil are punished".

    I stopped reading Beware of Chicken at the end of book 1 because it was just doing the usual "good = reward, bad = punishment", which is entertaining up to a point but ultimately unfulfilling, because Super Moisture Farmer Luke Lars vs Sabotaged Death Star Vader (who is probably redeemable and will be adopted into the Lars family and taught the proper use of the force that transcends Jedi and Sith) always tends to be.

    At the same time, your more specific critiques elsewhere in the thread are, in few words: Cringe. Grow a heart and a brain, and maybe straighten out that crooked spine.

  Due to circumstances beyond my control, ff.net and stories posted there are unavailable to me. For reasons of posterity, I am looking for a pdf/epub/anything not named ff.net version of Chili and the Chocolate Factory.

    You can get epubs versions of FF.net-hosted texts at fichub.net. In this case the URL is https://fichub.net/fic/HmYLFAKt

      Also you can copy ff.net links into fichub and get an epub back, that might be a way to bypass accessing ff.net stories, as long as you have the plaintext links.
