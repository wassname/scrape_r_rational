## Just finished HP:MoR and looking for another series like it — where genius characters use their brains to win against all odds. (Also kinda like these animes: Death note, Code Geass, No game no life.)

  Have you read Mother of Learning? Main character isn't a genius per se, but he is competent.

  If you’ve just finished HPMOR, go give Significant Digits a try. Unofficial sequel which takes methods of rationality and runs with it. I’d say it’s better writing and there are bits that are bloody amazing. Def worth a read.

  Otherwise Mother of Learning is my favourite - long, the writing style takes a while to get going, but is a very well thought out and iterated upon universe

    Personally didn't enjoy sigdigs nearly as much, but I agree that it is worth checking out to see if it does happen to suit your fancy

    I second this. Significant Digits takes longer to build up, it isn't as light and accessible as HPMoR, but it really is very good.

    Even if you don't read the rest of the story, at least read [the Azkaban chapter](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/2015/07/significant-digits-chapter-fourteen.html). I don't reread all of SD every time I read HPMoR, but I always read that chapter.

  I'm shocked that nobody has mentioned **Worm**, I figured it might be very popular in a subreddit like this. 

  Worm is a webserial set in a grimdark superheroes-and-supervillains universe. Reading it completely dismantled my chances of ever enjoying another superhero setting again, because I know none of them is ever gonna come close to being as good.

  Short blurb: Sometime in the 1980's, for reasons not fully understood, around 1 in every 10,000 people started developing powers. Parahumans -- or capes as they're often called -- can develop a *massive* array of different abilities: Exuding gaseous shadow, warping landscape, shifting into parallel states of reality, shapeshifting the bones in their own bodies, constructing hyperadvanced modular technology, developing a supercharged ability to pick up on subtle hints and form conclusions, and many, many more.

  Here's the catch: Capes usually manifest powers during the worst, most traumatic experiences of their entire lives. Villains are fucked up. Heroes are fucked up. Everybody in the series has more baggage than LAX on a busy day, and when you throw superpowers into the mix, that makes *shit go down.*

  ---

  Geniuses with mental powers act like geniuses with mental powers, working in the shadows to leverage events to their favor. But *everybody* plays smart, thinker or brute, because those who didn't often wound up dead very quickly. All powers -- every single one of them -- have strengths that the users exploit and limitations that they need to cover to prevent being exploited. The victors are usually the capes that can outwit their opponents, discover the flaws in their armor, and drive the stake in deep before the other gets the chance to. Synergistic power combinations, truces, citywide strategy, negotiation, espionage, alliances, tactical retreats and logistics/counterlogistics operations are bread and butter for parahumans.

  The ultimate example of this powers-as-chessgame theme is the main character herself. Taylor controls bugs. Specifically, all arthropods in a 1-3 block radius. This may seem strong in a vacuum, against normal people. But bear in mind this is a universe where people can literally bathe themselves in fire, use blades as if they had the range of a sniper rifle, transform into hounds of whirring metal saws, fly around nigh invincible, absorb powers, fire energy beams from their hands, increase their size and resilience 10x, hit with the strength of 100 men, conjure infinite weapons and level buildings with their bare hands. Oh, and did I mention that there are 3 massive cryptic beings called Endbringers which show up once every few months in an attempt to systematically genocide the human race? In this universe the ability to control bugs is often, on its face, ludicrously outmatched. 

  But her power is a lot more versatile than it appears on the surface, and Taylor is completely *brilliant* at leveraging it. Let's break it down:

  All bugs in a 1-3 block radius. Cockroaches, fleas, biting beetles, wasps, bees, spiders. She can feel the locations of people or things through their senses, perceive where each and every one her bugs is, and direct them all individually, but with the coordinated strength of a general commanding an army in realtime. Also, the number she can control is essentially infinite.

  Her range of control is limited, of course. But if she chooses to cruise around in a van and collect millions and millions of insects into one place before initiating a fight, who's going to stop her? Spider silk is light and has all the tensile strength of steel, but in the real world collecting it is very slow and difficult. Taylor, however, can have them breed and weave silk all day long. So she gets near unbreakable cords with which to orchestrate her attacks, and can distribute silk-reinforced body armor to her teammates. 

  What else. Having wasps airdrop other insects that can't fly? Check. Pre-coating flying insects with capsaicin or pepper spray to further incapacitate opponents? Check. Planting insects on people to track them? Check. Manipulating objects with her swarm? Check. Creating simple doppelgangers by forming bugs into a roughly human shape? Check. Emulating speech through the coordinated buzzing and chirping of her swarm? Check. And that's just a few of the basics of her toolkit; how she uses each of these with each other, builds them up, and combines those abilities with those of the people she's fighting beside, is nothing short of genius. It makes her power one of the most dynamic and enjoyable in all of Worm's truly *massive* cast.

  [You can read it free here.](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) It's extremely long, at 1.7 million words (the entire Harry Potter series is just over a million) but excellent all the way through. As a web serial it was released in small chunks, so it's very conducive to being picked up and put down at your leisure.

  If any of this sounds like the kind of thing you're into, then you owe it to yourself to give it a read.

    I think it's so well known in these related circles it's just assumed. Though you're right to reccomend it, no reason to assume.

  Two recs:  
  Kaiji Ultimate Survivor (Anime): a man must compete in gambles with the yakuza in order to clear his debts.  Tense and about using strategy and meta gaming.  
  The Empty and Box and Zeroth Maria (LN series): I think it was the third volume which has a game somewhat like mafia or werewolf of social manipulation, but the entire series is really good with the first volume being a time loop.

    Always second Kaiji.  Maybe not 100% exactly what OP asked for, but close enough.  It is very good.

  *The Martian* by Andy Weir

  *Mistborn* by Brandon Sanderson (street smarts + magic practice rather than book smarts)

  - u/kryptomicron:
    ```
    Neal Stephenson's books are pretty good in this regard generally.

    Seveneves is one of my favorites by Stephenson and the first part is a pretty gripping 'nerd thriller'.

  This is more just an anime recommendation as this series only feels like the MC is a rationalist if one justifies it themselves in their head (but if you like anime): Knight and Magic. It definitely has some aspects of trope awareness for example.

  Another that I just like a lot as good rationalism and would recommend to anyone after reading HPMOR is Worth the Candle. For the parts you seem to enjoy however it's a *very slow burn*. I'm talking like 1 in 15 chapters displaying the quality that you seem to be aiming for (e.g. in the \~200 chapters currently in the series I would say I can think of about a dozen "extremely smart MC outsmarts everyone" scenes (they are often the entire chapter) though I will say that in the last few blocks of \~20 chapters we got two and a half excellent ones and I really enjoyed it, and there is an implication of rising tension as the MC seems like he will soon be having to face more threats that have been built up throughout the series). I would say read till the end of chapter 14 (the end of first book, the first time this quality is displayed) to see if you like it or not.

  Finally as a fantasy example that is somewhat less rationalist (but with a decently rational universe) I would recommend Practical Guide to Evil. It's *sort of* "young adult" and feels a bit more adventure-y than say HPMOR, or say Death Note. But the main character's thing is definitely out smarting everyone.

  Liar Game is a pretty good Rational manga. Here's a summary:

  >Written by Shinobu Kaitani (also the author of One Outs), Liar Game is a manga and drama series about the struggles of Nao Kanzaki against a mysterious and nefarious organization called the Liar Game Tournament Office that places innocent people through psychological games using their debt as bait. All its members wear masks and any participants of the game are free to drop out, assuming they pay their debt which the game forced upon them. With debt that frequently is in the 100 million yen range and quite often more, it's no small deal. Said organization will also collect the debt "any way possible..."
  Using the help of recently released conman/genius/Chess Master Shinichi Akiyama, Nao seeks to rid herself of debt and also save those who are participating in the games. Expect all kinds of plans and cunning to apply here, as it is a Battle Royale of wits.

    Thanks! That's actually been on my list to read for a while. I was also hoping for non-manga recommendations if you had any :)

    Kyaaahh someone else has read Liar Game! I love this manga, it's one of my favorites and I highly, highly recommend it. Great plot and very interesting use of game theory, plus the characters are pretty cool. :)

  There's 40 millennium of cultivation which seems to fit your criteria
  ```

  - u/Bash717:
    ```
    It seems that it's not fully translated yet?
    ```

    - u/DistantVerse:
      ```
      40MoC is truly amazing- a rational cultivation novel set in a sci-fi universe that isn't a mere veneer over a traditional one. Characters all have their own solid motivations, and there are layers within layers in plotting, evolving from what appears to be a standard beginning. MC is smart, but within reason since older, more experienced enemies can out-think him. 

      There are obvious references to Warhammer 40k, Star Wars, and others, but nothing that infringes on the story's own sense of fun. The author really gave a lot of consideration to working out his story and the background universe. Having read up to the latest translation (almost 1900 chapters out of 3335), I'd say it is my #1 pick for cultivation novels (and I've read a lot of these). Those chapters cover a lot of complete story arcs and should keep you occupied for a long time.
      ```

      - u/Bash717:
        ```
        When do you think the entire series will be completed and translated?
        ```

        - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
          ```
          It's not that kind of series.  The author just goes on writing.

          It's the literal best at what it does, which includes a particular kind of plotting.
          ```

        - u/DistantVerse:
          ```
          Probably be another year to complete translation. However, the current translation point is actually a good place to read up to because it's the end of book 5, a major story arc. Essentially, it's the end point of a major series, with a sequel series to follow (kind of like the Belgariad and Mallorean, or Mistborn Era One and Era Two for ratfic).

  Metropolitan Man.

  [https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man)

  Also, since you like One Outs, the author of One Outs did a manga that's like Liar Game called Alice in Borderland. And it's great. I liked it even more than I liked Liar Game.

  The anime version was never completed. But there's going to be a live action version soon. Which may or may not be any good. So just read the manga. Or watch the anime and then switch over to the manga.
  ```

  - u/Bash717:
    ```
    Cool thanks! Why do you think Alice in Borderland is less talked about than liar game?
