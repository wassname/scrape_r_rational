  ```
  This episode is a bit short, I'd personally prefer longer chapters that are less frequent, but this fic still has a lot of potential. I've been hoping for a RWBY fic that has genuinely good worldbuilding and you're signaling that pretty well.

  - u/avret:
    ```
    Length: I wanted to set myself a weekly update schedule to avoid the pitfalls in terms of consistency I fell into with my last fics and because this is the first betaed fic I'm writing and schedule helps the betas, but expect chapter length to increase once I get home(i.e. for the next update or the update after)  and can use a real keyboard to type rather than a 9 inch tablet screen. 
    Worldbuilding: Thanks! It's been genuinely interesting to try to preserve as much of remnant as possible while making it all fit together.  (well, almost as much as possible. I have cut out a few things to serve my purposes and darkened everything up a bit.)
