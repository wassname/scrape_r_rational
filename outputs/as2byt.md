## [RT] [WIP] Battle in 5 seconds After Meeting - Chapter 27

### Post:

Link to the chapter [here](https://helveticascans.com/r/read/battle-after-meeting/en/3/27/page/1).  
I saw this manga recommended in the sub 2 months ago ([here](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a7tvgb/rt_battle_in_5_seconds_after_meeting/)) and I gave it a read and like many of those that replied in that thread, I agree that the story has a lot of qualities that this sub appreciates in stories, especially in this latest chapter where there was an explanation of how he conducted experiments to break down aspects of how his ability works. It was those series of experiments very reminiscent of some stories I read from this sub like (MoL and Pokemon: OoS vibes) is I wanted to post and share it.   
Anyone else keeping up with this and have guesses to what avenues the protagonist will take to further abuse his ability?  
 
Potential spoiler: >!I think having another ally like Yuuri would be best to give Akira more options for abilities to use in a fight/to escape and to have a safeguard in case Yuuri gets taken by surprise and is knocked out. Also, I hope the new character Mary gets a bit more screentime cause her ability sounds really powerful if it could be used in conjunction with others. For instance, making really small dolls with their heads cut off and having someone who can discreetly place them on anyone would be pretty OP if size of the doll was no issue.!<  
  
Anyway, happy reading and hope you enjoy. Thanks to /u/hzla00 for the recommendation.

  I read this up until the in-progress point, and found the experiments with the power and logical thinking about its implications to be the only worthwhile part of it. So much of the rest is just standard shonen garbage, including the nonsense premise, rapid shifts in plot and scenario, and the completely unrealistic side characters who act nothing like real people and deliver terrible dialogue with a straight face (which I don't think can be blamed entirely on translation, but I don't know).

  This isn't a counter-recommendation, but know what you're in for.

    Thanks for the reply! I'm a big fan of yours and seeing a reply from you is really cool. Just want to say that your works is awesome and I look forward to all your releases!  
    Back to the OP, I agree that outside of the experiments he performed to understand his power, the story is not really very rational, especially with the way the characters are written. I might just have a soft spot for standard shonen tropes so that plus a side helping of some rational thinking, even in very small doses, is pretty good for me. You're right that people should know what they're in for. Next time I recommend something I'll try and be more transparent with that kind of info, as I know that I myself appreciate recommendations more when they tell me what I'm in for.

  Why didn't he just tell her to think "Teleport" and got them out of there?

  - u/None:
    ```
    Hell, why didn't he just tell her to think *omnipotence* after it was established that her knowing his ability didn't make it belief-based power-granting impotent? I was expecting it to break the moment he told her, because without that sort of limit, going for omnipotence is the obvious next step. But no. :/
