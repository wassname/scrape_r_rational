  Going to go against the flow here; the garbled syllables didn't bother me at all. He's a dog and that's not English and he's almost to the point he knows all the basic words and it's been a couple days!

  Seconding what fortycakes said about hoping our dashing, perceptive Goodest Boye gets to rest and heal soon.

  Marza's species is *super* interesting. This chapter gave some insight into what their deal is, but I look forward to gleaning more details.

  A slightly slower chapter, but Athos is starting to get more of a handle on the language so answers to some of the "what's going on?" questions should begin to be visible.

  I continue to enjoy this. Interesting premise and its nice and lighthearted so that really tickles the fancy at the moment.
