  Well, after all, Harry is a Parseltongue. Of course he can talk to adders.

    Take it, take my upvote for that god-*awful* pun.

  For anyone who may have read the previous chapters, this is the chapter where the computational/electronic concepts are taking a more central role. Yay!

    Also, Hermione is terrible at this. The idea of disabling runes by filling them simplifies everything. And look, global reset. What she should really do, though, is design an FPRA: Field Programmable Runic Array. I bet it would be a lot simpler than the electronic version.

    Yessssss! Magic computers! Although it looks like magic is just standing in for electricity here. I hope magic computers can have unique advantages to electrical computers beyond just able to operate in Hogwarts. I doubt magic switches can get as small as modern transistors, but not needing to be physically wired together could mean more layers of magic transistors are possible. If magic traveled faster then light, or was more instantaneous than flowing electrons then you could break the gigahertz clock-speed limit. If magic signals could hold a superposition, then Hermione and Harry could easily surpass our current quantum computers. That would be quite magical!

      Time turners are a thing so maybe  they could make closed time loop computers whith them and solve instantaneously all problems in PSPACE.
