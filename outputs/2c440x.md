  I can't be the only one who thought that he was going to grab a periapt of Wisdom +6 and a few other buffs to that particular stat after that talk with Loki, can I?

  I'm trying to imagine a Jake who take a bit more time to think through his intelligent ideas before doing them and can more accurately interpret the actions of and empathize with others (Sense Motive is a Wisdom based skill) and it seems like it could be a rather large power boost - especially when dealing with inscrutible semi-omnipotent beings.

    That would be a smart thing for him to do, yes, but it would break the story.  Jake has two flaws: he's not terribly good with social situations unless he's making a concerted effort, and he's not terribly forethoughtful.  If I gave him CHA and WIS boosts those flaws would go away and he'd just be a Gary Stu.

    Until now I've been quietly ignoring it, but I should probably have it come up and have Jake go "forget it, you are not mucking with my personality again"

  I've noticed that when I post chapter links, they are mostly upvoted but also get some downvotes.  I'm curious -- are the downvotes due to the content itself, to the way it's listed, or to something else?

  If you've downvoted any of these threads, please let me know -- I'd be curious to see if there's something I can optimize so that you are seeing fewer things you object to.

  Once again, there were a bunch of reviews and my Muse was feeling active, so I'm dropping a bonus chapter.  Like the title says, it's an omake, NOT part of canon.

  Impressively enough, ch55 is already written and ch56 is in progress.  My Muse is totally kicking astroturf.

    I really enjoy this story, and  have already had to smack down attempts by my players to use ideas from it.

  ```
  So, what are the odds that if Jake survives, he will ascend to demi-god or higher status?

  That universe could use a god of 'outside perspective' that is not a troublemaker.

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Well, it wasn't in my story notes, but it could be interesting....
    ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:
      ```
      If Jake ascends, his domain must be "Outside Context Problems". Because he both is one, and regularly faces them.
      ```

        ```
        Note to self: next time I build a religion, build it around a God of OCPs. It'd neatly group together existential risk, applied epistemology, and black swans, and you could probably throw in the pile of general rationality knowledge that usually gets spread out over wisdom, trickster, knowledge, secrecy, and arcane deities. It also provides a nice clean counterpart to the Arcane Deities that are usually opposed by an ill-fitting Secrecy Deity; "using knowledge effectively" is much better balanced by "using *lack* of knowledge effectively" than it is by "keeping secrets".
        ```

        - u/VorpalAuroch:
          ```
          First you'd need to come up with a simpler term for it. It's not a mentally-primitive notion like 'Magic' or 'Secrecy' or 'Trickster', naively.
          ```

          - u/Empiricist_or_not:
            ```
            Extra contextual crisollogy: the religion of endings and how to stop them. 

            "An Outside Context Problem was the sort of thing most civilizations encountered just once, and which they tended to encounter rather in the same way a sentence encountered a full stop [a period]."
            ```

    - u/clawclawbite:
      ```
      I don't know Loki's big picture goal(s), but if this chapter was real, than getting a part time demi-jake sidekick would be a likely agenda item.
      ```
