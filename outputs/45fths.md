## Aeria status update

### Post:

Hey guys, you might remember me as the author of [Tales From Aeria](http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com/) and been wondering why I stopped working on it. I'm not sure how many of you actually read that, but I wanted to assure everyone that its not a dead project.

Fall of Oso is kind of at a weird point. I know where the story goes from here, but writing it is proving to be a challenge. I'd welcome anyone who wants to help me brainstorm for things regarding that, if you don't mind spoilers, send me a PM and we can discuss my plans for the plot.

The other thing is that I have a completed(ish) manuscript for another story in Aeria already finished. It needs some editing and tweaking, making sure things are consistent and such, but its nearly ready to go. I just need a few beta readers to help me iron the whole thing out and I'll be ready to start posting it. I really need help with that. Its an already completed story so its very long. What I'd like are a few people interested in doing a full read through for me and giving a more generalistic commentary on the plot, characterization, and things like that, and then have a few others who'll read through chapter by chapter with me prior to each chapter's posting and help me check for grammar and sentence structure and other more nitty-gritty details. Once I have things in swing, I'll post one a chapter a week, though I may break some of the chapters up a bit as some of them are quite long. All in all there should be at least six months of serial content that is ready to go aside from editing and fine tuning.  

If you're interested in helping with any of those things and get a early view into the world of Aeria, hit me up via PM. 

Cheers o7
