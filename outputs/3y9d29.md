  I strongly urge everyone to go see this film.  If you're thinking that's because of my politics, just go see the film, because the film isn't about my politics.

  * It's about checking the numbers when other people won't.
  * It's about putting your money on the numbers when everyone else is playing dumb.
  * It's about sexy celebrities explaining financial instruments.
  * It's about people treating "X% chance of Y" like it's entirely real and actually matters.
  * It's about the market remaining irrational longer than you can remain solvent.
  * It's ultimately about the consequences of winning when you were betting against basically everyone else.

  I just got back from seeing the movie.

  If you read *The Economist*, you won't learn anything from the movie, but it still manages to be entertaining and suspenseful.

  The one thing I didn't like were the celebrity interludes. The first one is literally just some woman in a bubble bath talking about mortgages for a while. Those bits are probably aimed at a different audience than me.

  Can't wait for the movie 10 years from now to explain QE to everyone.

  For a contrary perspective, here is a [short largely negative review](http://ericposner.com/the-big-short/) by Eric Posner, who has [taught a course on the financial crisis](http://www.law.uchicago.edu/node/652/courses) at the U of C law school.  Here is some [followup criticism](http://ericposner.com/neil-irwin-on-the-big-short/) again by Posner.

    Wasn't Eric Posner the guy who claimed we need to shut down the free Internet to fight ISIS?

      [This article, "ISIS Gives Us No Choice but to Consider Limits on Speech"](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2015/12/isis_s_online_radicalization_efforts_present_an_unprecedented_danger.single.html). It's one part treating ISIS propoganda like an infohazard, one part being contrarian for page views, one part Posner being a moron.
      ```

      Yep, same person. 

      IMHO, Posner suffers from a sort of contrarian-disease common to many academics. In academia, sometimes you get more brownie points for being *clever* than for being *correct*. 

      A defense of free speech along the standard lines will bring out a big yawn. An attack on free speech that lands more punches than you'd expect will get you an article in Slate. See also [Posner's response](http://ericposner.com/more-on-anti-propaganda-laws/) to the critics on free speech, which is also more persuasive than I would guessed it could be. I wonder if he plans to turn these arguments into an article for a law review. 

      I find him to be a valuable person to read provided one filters for the above bias. As far as The Big Short, for example, I think he has some good criticisms.

  This is a film adaption of the novel, which is excellent [(amazon link)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0393338827) and worth a read. You'll learn more than you ever thought you'd know about the subprime mortgage crisis.
