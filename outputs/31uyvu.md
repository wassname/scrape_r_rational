## What stories have the smartest or most rational protagonists?

### Post:

I want to see what you all say here.     

There are stories where the author gives important information freely and there are stories in which the author gives important information that has been *earned* with reason and intelligence. The 2^nd is much more satisfying. But if a character is too smart, if the author makes the steps of reasoning too easy to follow, the reader isn't going to appreciate how intelligent the character really had to be.         

I'm looking for writing techniques here. Why does one character seem like a genius for figuring something out while another seems like a normal person because this was just an obvious thing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Show me the borderline. Who are the characters you think tackle the hardest problems without making them seem trivial and thus not impressive?      

Feel free to use any literature.  



--EDIT: Thanks for the reading list everyone.

  *The Metropolitan Man* has a good level of revelation regarding Lex's gradually increasing knowledge about Superman, and the techniques he uses to gain that knowledge. We get some detail about what he does to put his ideas into practice, but not full detail, because seeing all the go-betweens between him and his final lackeys would be boring.

  HPMoR is interesting, it successfully conveyed for Harry (to me) "Very smart, but nonetheless, overestimates his own intelligence (or at least his ability to apply it to achieve ends he wants)". 

  Another possibility is to have the super-smart character just go ahead and do the super-smart thing, without being the POV character, and then have some other quite-smart-but-not-*that*-smart character work out for the audience exactly what their thought process was. I'm sure there are a lot of examples for this, but the one that comes to mind, of all things, is when some onlooker (I think Asuma?) explains for the audience exactly what Shikamaru is doing in the third chuunin exam. (I think Shikamaru's canon tactics are relatively elementary compared to a lot of smart characters on fiction on this sub, but still advanced compared to the rest of his canon; forgiven because it's targeted in such a way to be accessible to a younger group of readers/viewers.)

    Nice!     

     I don't remember being impressed ever by Shikamaru.        

    HPMoR was entertaining as hell and I'd consider it mostly a success on showing the work the protagonist had to go through to reach his conclusions.      

    Thank you very much, I'll read *The Metropolitan Man* now on your recommendation. I did hear that Lex was meant to be smart but I've never read anything from that universe canon or non.

      Canon Shikamaru was somewhat more of an *informed* intelligence; what he put into practice wasn't nearly as high-level as what one would expect after being told how smart he was (200+ IQ?). This could be because of lack of ability on the part of the author to imagine a really super-smart character, but looking at it more charitably, it's because the format was meant to be accessible to elementary age kids, and so it couldn't get *too* complex without leaving part of its audience in the dust, so to speak.

      Also, there's the fact that Shikamaru is really lazy. Really, really lazy. He has no designs on saving the world, dominating the world, optimizing the world -- his end-state of his utility function is that he wants to grow old with a normal family and enjoying relaxing in his old age. He probably figures it's too much *effort* to expend the whole of his intelligence, he figures he can get to his end state with minimal effort. Until Pain, and the events after Pain, such as the Great Ninja War, anyway.

      That said, I do like Naruto's use of the "watcher explains to audience what's going on" trope. Naruto uses it to make sure younger viewers are able to keep up with Shikamaru's moderate-level schemes, and also, with things happening in combats like Lee vs. Gaara that wouldn't be obvious to viewers otherwise. (Kakashi/Gai explaining 8 gates to Sakura/audience, for example.) Not sure if that has a trope name on TVTropes; it should. I think this trope could be used effectively to accomplish what you want, if the intelligence level were scaled upwards to something more targeted at smart adults.

      And, glad to help!

        > Also, there's the fact that Shikamaru is really lazy. Really, really lazy.

        The following occurs to me:

        1. Shikamaru would become a very different person under the influence of prescription-strength dopaminergic drugs. He basically has ADD.
        2. The regular military kind of "soldier pills" have a dopaminergic as a large component.
        3. *Chouji's* family are basically "street-fighting biochemists" who create various nootropics and then tune their bodies over the long term to work optimally when under the influence of those nootropics.

        Which is all to say, as often as Shikamaru and Chouji are together, there's absolutely no reason Chouza wouldn't have noticed that Shikamaru was a bit lazy—thought further that this made him a bit of a liability to his teammates, being perhaps unwilling to check thoroughly for traps when scouting and so forth—and brewed up an exact fix for that. (Save, perhaps, for Shikaku and Yoshino not liking the idea. But I can't imagine Shikaku in particular would object, having observed Chouza's continued health and efficacy for as long as he has.)

        It's sort of an extension of The Watson, but more applied to a single instance than to an entire character. I rather enjoy when it happens in fiction (the best use that I can call to mind is in A Knight's Tale, when someone asks another character what the rules of jousting are, and it makes total sense in-Universe for that to happen). I'm sort of compiling a list of examples like that, actually, in the hopes that I can someday make that an actual trope: I'll add your examples to the list.
        ```

          Isn't that already the TV Trope of [Informed Ability](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAbility)?

          Also if you already thought of a trope to add, just go ahead and post it. It's fine if there's only like five examples. That's the point of having a community, to allow multiple people to add to it.
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            I might go ahead do that, yeah. I mean, I only have like, two examples by this point. I was hoping to at least get five before I made the YKTTW page.

            I... don't really see how it would be Informed Ability. It's a bit of exposition done by having one character (acting as The Watson in that specific circumstance) ask another character to explain to them what's happening. It's not quite The Watson, because that's an example of a character archetype, and this is just a single instance; a character who otherwise acts as Mr. Exposition in other circumstances could even do this, if there's a single thing they could reasonably be confused about.

            Edit: I was referring to what /u/Chimerasame referred to in their third paragraph as "watcher explains to audience what's going on" trope", by the way.

  Gotta throw out Worm, my favorite book.

  All of the characters work off of what they know, and make intelligent decisions based on that knowledge. There are several different layers and factions at play, some of which know about each other, all working towards different (or the same) goals.

  It's just a beautifully designed story, with awesome characters.

    I loved this book, but the protagonist did just happen to know everything he needed to in order to survive. The character had a large amount of background information to draw off, so the audience didn't really get to see him figure stuff out.

      I had the same thought when I heard "botany/mechanical engineering", but I amended it as I read on. He happens to know *most* of what he needs. Gaps in his knowledge definitely bite him in the rear on several occasions - chemistry being a big one.

  Not exclusively, but Cormack McCarthy's characters are great in this regard. Specifically the father in the road whose rationality is contrasted against his son's child mentality. Or the gem of a story within blood meridian: Without spoiling it, the Indians pursuing up the volcanic mountain

  >I'm looking for writing techniques here. 

  Here are the three super secret methods of depicting genius that I have identified that a person who is not a genius themselves can use to portray genius:

  Method 1: Puzzle-Solving. It's not necessarily a hard problem, but within the context of the story we're going to have most characters not figure it out, Protagonist finds the solution via an insight which the reader can understand. Protagonist uses that insight to win. Examples: Ender's Game

  Method 2: RPG-style Skill-Tree. Have the character slowly work on a skill, which progresses in sensible but hard-won steps, and that skill makes them hold an edge. Bonus points if the protagonist explains exactly what the other characters are doing wrong, and has "insights" within the magic system (which may be opaque to the reader, it doesn't matter). The depiction works because that's what happens in real life - you slowly gain skills and become more powerful. Examples: "Mother of Learning", "hogwarts battle school". (This is a very common fanfiction trope)

  Method 3: Genius Aesthetic. The protagonist has all the stereotypical qualities of a genius. He has complex monologues. He has Machiavellian plans. He sometimes casually makes deductions from the evidence presented to the reader. (Note that it doesn't actually matter if the reader *could* realistically have deduced it from the evidence presented, as long as it *uses* the evidence presented.) Examples: Death Note, Sherlock Holmes. 

  >Why does one character seem like a genius for figuring something out while another seems like a normal person because this was just an obvious thing.

  You chose a puzzle that the reader's mind doesn't *automatically* solve using background processes while reading AND you *showed* the reader that it's not obvious (even if it actually is pretty obvious) by making it non-obvious to all the other characters. What sorta loony toon would *actually* hold on to the old notion of "down" after spending even 8 hours in 0g? Yet when you read Ender's game it all seems plausible. If you go a purely Aesthetic route with so-called "puzzles" that the reader could never really hope to solve, it's same effect on most readers as long as it *feels* like it makes sense, which is how Holmes was so successful. 



  Also, you might want to see Yudkowsky's ideas on the topic. 
  http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing

  I can identify elements of all three of the above methods used heavily in HPMoR. Yhere's also a fourth element of genuinely valuable rationality content incorporated into it that really pushes our impressions of Harry's intelligence over the top.

  I feel genius in terms of persuading others, lying to others, and manipulating others for your own ends is portrayed really well in R Scott Bakker's Second Apocalypse trilogy, in the person of Khellus Anasurimbor. The story follows a delicate balance of having him make persuasive, followable arguments and persuading others from their viewpoints, with Khellus's internal narration so we can see the manipulation, with a couple of other characters' internal narration who eventually see the truth of his deceptions. I felt like Khellus embodied certain ideas of deceitful/manipulative intellect very well. Basically none of his techniques or abilities could be used or emulated by a reader, but it still felt pretty convincing when reading it.

  Several characters from Anathem by Neal Stephenson portrayed academic/intellectual/scientific/mathematic intelligence very well and persuasively, and even conveyed certain fairly trivial insights to the reader and made them feel like reasonable insights.

    I bounced off Bakker due to the severe sexism. I mean, really quite horrid levels of it.
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      Fair enough. There's lots of reasons to dislike those books. 

      I thought that the characters were probably about as sexist as the average for the real-world time period of the actual Crusades, which is pretty extremely sexist - and the characters' sexism wasn't tempered by any sort of contradiction of their viewpoints in the rest of the narrative. There were a lot of opportunities to present female characters in a better light that Bakker could have taken but he did not do so. The followup books to the first trilogy seem to be somewhat better in that respect, but still skew pretty strongly sexist - if you dropped the first series, you'll probably want to avoid those too.

  The short webcomic [Fleep](http://www.shigabooks.com/fleep.php). The protagonist tackles some damn hard problems, but shows his work at every step so you *know* it's solvable - if you happen to be a genius with encyclopaedic knowledge and excellent Fermi estimate skills. Finest example of competence porn.

  Might only be fun for a niche audience though, so I don't know if it's a good example to follow.

  There is something to be said for the Outside Context Problem style stories where a person usually armed with modern science, gets put in a civilization without it.

  A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an early exploration of this trope.

  Other good ones is Two Year Emperor (person with knowledge of D&D as game, gets thrown into universe with D&D as reality,) and Dungeon Keeper Ami (Saylor Mercury in the Dungeon Keeper 'verse.)

  [The Games We Play](http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-four.311394/) is a crossover of the manga the Gamer and the online anime styled show RWBY. The story is set in the RWBY universe where one of the main characters gain the powers of the Gamer(from the manga the gamer obviously) as a semblance then proceeds to use the power in the most effecient way possible. The story also happens to be the most watched forum on Spacebattles and as is updated regularly.

    It's a decent fic, but I do not consider Jaune a truly intelligent or rational person. Mostly because he has really bad judgement about where to invest his resources. I'd sooner describe him as an average guy, who just happened to win a power lottery. As far as the rational characters go, the best you'll find in TGWP is his granny, but she's barely in the fic.

    For me, the big problem with Jaune, aside from his priorities, is that he doesn't feel agenty. All he does is react to stuff and even his long-term plans get thrust upon him.
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      This is true, but my real problem with Jaune is that his ever-growing power list makes his chapters boring chapters for 99%+ of all chapters.  Characters are more interesting when they have a meaningful chance of failing, and adding abilities on until a character sheet starts to be written in small text on a poster because of all the abilities is not conductive to that. The author has had like one section of the past ~hundred days be actually a conflict that mattered and that Jaune could lose, and and that was a long time ago. The vast majority of recent entries be either meaningless/stakeless fights, unloseable fights, or reactions/aftermath/explanation chapters - if you thought HPMOR aftermaths excessive, well, you ain't seen nothin' yet!

      Also, writing a high number next to 'intelligence' doesn't make a character feel meaningfully intelligent, nor does giving them bonus spells for intelligence or whatever. Actually having them do intelligent things makes them feel intelligent, and there's been a paucity of that. 

      I'm almost at the point of giving up on the fic, in spite of it's strong points and strong opening.
      ```

      - u/AugSphere:
        ```
        I would not mind his power list if he actually applied it to meaningfully counteract the known threats or ran some experiments to try and understand how it actually works or did something else productive. Instead he's just killing time waiting for the next big crisis to happen while name-dropping Malkuth theory every other sentence like that label means anything by itself. Feels like he's literally incapable of spending his time productively unless some immediate goal has been handed to him.
        ```

      - u/thakil:
        ```
        Yeah I gave up a while back because of this. It was sort of fun how he applied his power initially, but as the character himself says, it's utterly broken and he just becomes so extraordinarily powerful there is no real power. I stopped around the point he was doing some pointless sparring with some characters we'd never met before.
        ```
