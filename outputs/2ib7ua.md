## [D][MK]Munchkin this nickel

### Post:

Here's a nickel. You can, at any time,  telepathically command it to return. It ~~returns~~ disappears in one place and teleports to your right palm, tails down, at rest relative to your palm. The return is instantaneous, no matter where the nickel is. It therefore travels at infinite speed. 

The nickel is not indestructible; it has physical properties similar to a regular nickel, and can be bent, cut, etc. However, whenever you call it, all of its atoms it will return in unharmed form, at 20 degrees celsius.

You otherwise have only what regular physics and technology as we know it can do.

How much power can you gain?

  Everyone's already going for high-concept stuff.  Lemme try a few simple things.

  * You can cheat vending machines and money-changer machines with it.  Can't do it too much or else you get caught, but I imagine you might be able to make/save a few extra hundred dollars a year.  Maybe more if you find a good place without surveillance.

  * You can go to the James Randi foundation and use it to win the million dollar prize.

  * If you press your palm flat against something, and then return the nickel to your palm, it should end up meshed in whatever you're touching.  You could then rapidly teleport it over and over again, disrupting the chemical structure of whatever you're touching as the coin repeatedly tries to undo the changes to its structure.  Probably a potent tool, that.  Could drill through just about anything, given enough time.    Not to mention the interesting potential for chemical reactions, depending on the structure it ends up forming.

      Should only be dangerous if the telefragging nickel is expelled at high speed, or if it causes some sort of explosive reaction.  Otherwise it shouldn't be _too_ dangerous, presuming you're using it for woodworking or metalshaping rather than trying to use it in a fight.
      ```

        Well, whatever interesting chemical reactions you were talking about would happen in immediate vicinity to your hand.

    Playing off of point 1, go to Atlantic city or Vegas and play nickel slots. Every win would put you ahead. Play 2 machines for a greater rate of return. Oh and be sure to have a way to fake a diminishing bucket of coins.
    ```

  Dissolve it. Nickels are 75% copper and 25% nickel; they should dissolve in sulfuric acid, though I've never tried the experiment.

  This will produce a solution of SO4^(2-) sulfate ions (how do you write that when Reddit doesn't do subscripts), and a mixture of Ni^(2+) and Cu^(2+) ions. The dissolution will also release a cloud of hydrogen gas.

  I'm not really sure how the recall power will deal with the nickel being disassembled like that. I'm hoping for a lightning bolt, or maybe an explosion. Intuition says that I'd recall the exact particles that the nickel was originally made of, but electrons don't work like that. They're not tracked individually, two indistinguishable particles really are indistinguishable at the most fundamental level we know of. I could probably break quantum physics with this nickel, but I don't know enough to say how. (Also, experiment with FTL messaging, that's also potentially powerful.)

  For an accidental version of the same phenomenon, allow the nickel to rust before recalling it.
  ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    Suppose, for practical purposes, that the nickel brings with it any electrons attached to the nuclei that make it up, plus or minus any extra electrons needed to bring it back to neutrality when it returns.
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      Well... then I think I could use this to disassociate water into hydrogen and oxygen, providing free energy. A slightly more efficient way of energy generation than dropping the nickel down a hole and re-summoning it, but still not brilliant.

      Still, that's the best I can think of at the moment. Stealing money 5c at a time isn't very profitable. The coin isn't very useful as a tool, even accounting for the fact that I can access it after being thoroughly strip-searched (there's no time in my life where that would have been remotely useful).

      I assume it's cheating to show the coin to the James Randi foundation and the Nobel Committee, and just collect a huge amount of prize money. It's probably what I'd do for real though.
      ```

      - u/Chronophilia:
        ```
        Oh, and test for speed-of-light delay. Make a friend in New Zealand (roughly on the other side of the world from me). Synchronise our clocks and use high-speed cameras to monitor the coin. In theory, there should be a 0.04 second delay between the coin disappearing on his end and reappearing on my end. If the delay is less, I may have proven the existence of FTL communication, and further tests are warranted.
        ```

        - u/fljared:
          ```
          Oh, it's definitely superluminal. In fact, there's no delay at all- The coin immediately appears in your hand when it disappears from wherever it was.
          ```

          - u/duffmancd:
            ```
            So, I don't know whether this is deliberate, but there is literally no such thing as simultaneous events in relativity. What is simultaneous for you is not simultaneous for someone moving at high speed relative to you. So I'll assume that "the return is instantaneous" is from your POV. You could use this to make a time machine, but to send one bit to the past you'd need to do a relativistic flyby of the Earth so not very practical.

            Using the 20 degrees you could heat or cool something to 20 degrees. Or rather you now have a theoretically perfect heat bath. Stave off the heat death of the universe, destroy some entropy!

            You could create a reactionless drive by firing out the coin and resummoning it. This could help you with the time machine above. A rail gun could fire the coin quite fast at the cost of excess heat, but we do have an infinite heat reservoir.

            Also, what happens to things in the way when it returns? Do the just disappear? What happens when you melt a normal coin and your coin together and then summon your coin back? You'd be left with a piece of metal with 50% vacancy spread evenly, I suspect that this would be like nanoporous carbon except with metal and be quite good at storing gasses. Though it may be better to mix it with something already used like metal hydrides.
            ```

            - u/fljared:
              ```
              Entirely practical. What's the point of FTL magic coin if you can't violate causality?

              What sort of heat bath would you make? You'd be losing useful energy whenever the coin was summoned back at a temperature > 20 degrees.

              All atoms of the coin return when summoned; Anything the atoms were part of are filled with either air from where the coin now is, or vacuum if your hand was closed/in space.

                  Yes, though once the water was there, it would be absorbed or leak or whatever else a space filled with water would do.

  A modern nickel is 75% copper, 25% actual nickel, weighs 5g, has a value of $0.05, is 1.95 mm thick and 21.21mm in diameter, per [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_%28United_States_coin%29).  

  Of these properties, the most straightforward to begin to abuse is its mass: drop it down a vacuum tube of arbitrary length, convert potential energy into kinetic and then into heat at the bottom, return to top where your palm is facing down for it to drop again.  Breaking conservation of energy in this way is convenient, but not exactly groundbreaking.

  Perhaps more powerful is its property to be transmuted in form and then reassume its original shape at a new location.  You could, for example, melt it down, grind it up, distribute it in a food supply, then hold that population hostage to having the copper in their body forcibly ripped at high speed from their body.

  Make a copper/nickel bullet that leaves no trace?

  Abuse the ability to make it resume tails down to convince people you can control fate, start a cult following?
  ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    I wasn't quite clear in the initial post; The nickel teleports, not moves, to your hand. 

    That being said, if losing 4g of copper all at once kills someone, it would work as an untraceable poison.

    That cult thing would be fun, until someone wanted you to use a different coin, or a flip heads.
    ```

- u/ulyssessword:

  I think that the teleportation out of your palm is much more useful than bringing the nickel back to you.

  A micro SD card is smaller than a nickel,  so I could use it as better communication than other people have proposed by replacing the nickel with 64GB of data at the far end.  This can be done with anything small or delicate as well.  You can mail the nickel to another lab (without any special precautions) and swap it out for some cryogenically preserved biological samples once they're ready.

  With constant/rapid commands, you might be able to scrape away material from any surface.  Press you palm against a wall and summon the nickel.  There will then be a nickel shaped hole in the wall, filled with the nickel.  Next move your palm over a bit, and repeat.  The first hole will still exist, but it will be filled with a nickel-shaped plug of material which can be easily removed.  Repeat as often as you want for more holes.

  IIRC, Gorilla glass works by swapping out sodium atoms for potassium in some complicated process, increasing strength.  Find a process that can use this technique with nickel and/or copper, melt the nickel down, refine it etc, put a bit of the other metal (gold? palladium?) in your palm, then recall the nickel to swap out the atoms.
  ```

  - u/Chosen_Pun:
    ```
    With the scraping method described, what happens if you move your hand less than a nickel's width? The material replaced by part of the nickel on the second cut would have to end up in the same location as the other side of the nickel, unless the magic was smart enough to turn the crescent around to fit in the hollow of the first cut. (If the magic's not smart enough, and if it prioritizes the 'unharmed form' of the nickel high enough, the ability to straight-up destroy matter sounds pretty exploitable)

  You could use as reaction mass to drive a spacecraft, just need some sort of railgun to repeatedly shoot it out he back of your ship. It's not very good for FTL signaling since it only works once. You could attach it to a sensor and use it to telepathically trigger some machine, maybe as an emergency signal. Randi's prize is probably the best option.
  ```

- u/triangleman83:
  ```
  Ok so the nickel returns to just above your palm whereas anything that was above your palm is teleported to where the nickel was.  Essentially you can teleport anything you want into the space where the nickel was.  It sounds like any fluid my cupped hand was holding, whether it be air, mercury, sulfuric acid, or (not a fluid) vacuum, would be sent off to where the nickel was.  I'm not sure how I'd stick my hand in a vacuum yet but I'll revisit that later.

  Now, the first thing I'd want to do is be able to put that nickel anywhere I wanted it quickly, so creating some kind of railgun type launcher that I could hold in my left hand would be needed.  Now we could go one of two ways, which I will need a question answered.  Either I replace the nickel mid-flight, or I replace the nickel after it has struck its target.

  My first question would be: does all momentum on both nickel-sized collections of atoms cease upon the command?  If I commanded the nickel to return in mid-flight while holding my right hand in a bowl of water, would the water be moving with the same velocity?  Same momentum?  Or zero velocity relative to my palm?
  ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    The coin returns to rest relative to your palm- If the coin is sitting on the ground and you're on a plane, the coin appears moving a 500 mph (Relative to Earth) and at rest (To you) 

    If you're swinging your arm around, the coin appears on your palm at that same velocity as your palm is going- That is, it's at rest relative to your palm, but moving in relation to, say, your stomach.

    The atoms you exchanged for the nickel are given the coin's velocity (NOT its momentum) at the time it was exchanged. That means if the coin was on a rocket a .2 c (Bringing up its own problems, but look past them for a moment) and you summon it, the coin appears at rest in your palm, and the water appears in rocket, going at .2 c along with the rest of the ship.

      If someone cuts off my hand and then cuts it in half, what happens?
      ```

- u/TimTravel:
  ```
  Depending on how it works I might be able to get mild time travel. It depends on what happens from the perspective of someone standing next to the coin.

  For the sake of convenience in this example I'm the other guy and my friend has the coin. Bob summons coin if and only if the bad guys are attacking. Let's see if I understand lorentz transformations correctly. I'm moving rapidly away from Bob near the speed of light. Or maybe towards. I'm tired. I observe the coin disappear. If the coin disappears Bob-simultaneously with its reappearance then its reappearance should be in my future. I now know that the bad guys are attacking. Fiddle with the parameters enough and I can probably get a temporal paradox but it takes time to reload. Depending on the paradox resolution method that could be powerful. Best-case scenario, if I have a policy of causing a paradox unless x happens, x will always happen. [Massive monologue on time travel.](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2h2b84/hermaues_mora_and_all_his_knowledge_have/ckpt61m)

  One coin won't make a big difference, but put coin in cold environment, teleport coin to self raising its temperature: free energy. Stand in high place. Drop coin. Summon coin. Free kinetic energy. Allow coin to get hot. Summon coin lowering its temperature. Reduce entropy.

  I could do a hell of a magician act. I could probably make real money that way.

  Would work on vending machines.

  It's too small to use as an effective throwing weapon.

  I can technically never go broke ignoring debt.

    >It's too small to use as an effective throwing weapon.

    For the most part, but the swap feature might help there? For example, a match or flashcotton in one hand, throw the nickle, light the flame, swap. Getting the same aerodynamics out of such a tool seems like it'd be harder, never mind the possibility of the flame dying before it reaches its target.

        Probably the easiest would be something that triggers when a circuit is broken- Nickels conduct electricity, so you could put it in a simple circuit.

        Of course, you've just made it so you don't need a remote trigger for your device- Only useful if you need to make a fake remote to be taken before triggering the device with a nickel return.
        ```

      - u/Chronophilia:

        Clever. It only works once, so it's inferior in many ways to a radio-controlled trigger. But nobody would ever expect it.

  If you melt down the nickel, use the result to create a hollow shell, then fill the shell with whatever substance you want, you can use it as an untraceable delivery for said substance. Probably nerve gas, if we're talking weapons. Or just use it as a stopper, for a larger quantity in a container. Or brown recluse spiders, if you want something exotic.  

  Another idea is to give a solution of the nickel to somebody, then see how it affects the body when removed. Repeated enough times could give a map as to how the body absorbs certain substances (Possible medical uses? I'm not certain there would be any benefit to this. Besides torture, since I can't see this being easy on the body. Actually, by varying the times you issue the return call, you can probably chart out the optimal times to return to get certain responses)

  I can see the FTL signalling having some use as a single-shot undetectable communication for coordinating two groups without any visible interaction. Nickel disappearing is the go signal, and nothing was sent, so nothing can be intercepted. This would gain more usefulness in higher surveillance areas. 

  >The nickel appears a little over a half a hand-depth over the center of your palm is, or the center of the components of your palm, if your palm happens to be over a large or oddly shaped area. (quoted text from an earlier comment by OP)

  Definitely abusable. If you split your hand in two, and pull the two halves apart, the way I read this is that it would return instantly to the point halfway between. So it can be teleported into walls, and by spamming the return command, you could keep replacing nickel sized holes in the wall, until your through. So a perfect wall breaker if you can manage to get to any two equidistant points from that wall.

    I think they did some studies like idea number 2 with radioactive substances some time in the last century.

    Though now that I think about it, the discovery of those studies was that 95% of the atoms in your body change by the year...

    Which means that the atoms making up "Your Hand" ought to be spreading out so much that they ruin the ability...

    I'm gonna cheat here and say "Your Palm" becomes defined as the object which you define mentally as "Your Palm" to get around the Ship-Of-Theseus problem. And it's what you *actually believe* is your palm, not just you declaring that that piece of sheet metal is "your palm". 


    ...Annnnnnnnnnnd I've gone off track. Back to your third idea: The coin exchanges whatever was where it was at with itself at wherever it was, so the wall will still keep. Of course, you've now got a wall full of nickel-sized slices of material unconnected to the area around them, so a good hit should fully dislodge the wall. Or you could move the hands a bit off center between each jump so the coin reappears in the air and then exchanges itself for more wall material, which is deposited on the floor.

  How far above your palm does it warp in? What happens if there's something above your palm, or touching it?

  The return to 20c is abusable.

  Have your hand surgically removed, place it with the coin in a specialised heat engine and spam the return command to generate electricity. Use this to generate actual power, or build a commercial empire around it to gain political power.

  You could also abuse it to shed momentum for space travel, e.g. sever hand, attach to flywheel, get it moving arbitrarily fast with conventional power and them spam return for a zero-cost constant acceleration fuelless engine. Timing might be a problem, but you'd have to eperiment with that.

  There are questions about what happens if the atoms of the coin no longer exist, eg if they're combined with antimatter. Also what happens if your palm is atomised over a wide area, does each surface atom of the palm get a corresponding coin atom, or is there a central atom? Also what happens to matter occupying the space when the coin teleports in? If its destroyed, then it could be used to cut hard materials.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    The big problem is that the effect isn't really large enough. With a heat engine in your hand, you're generating power, but you're not generating *enough* of it to really make a difference. It's got to be something like making pennies per hour - probably even less. It's the same issue with using the nickel to generate power by dropping it over and over - while you're getting out more than you put in, you're not getting enough out of it to really make it worthwhile.
