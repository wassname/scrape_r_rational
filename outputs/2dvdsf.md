  If this is what we're doing, I recommend [this](http://youtu.be/JxgEXDnXD6M), where Mario finds the exact pattern of jumps necessary to take over the universe in a minute and a half. Not just fiddling with the details like Red here; Mario decides he'd rather be playing other games, so he does.

  Red gets in on the action too, [manifesting dancing numerical constants](http://youtu.be/3UnB1fomvAw) and [replacing reality with something he prefers](http://youtu.be/aYQpl8Jj6Yg?t=10m30s).

  Breaking out of the Matrix is really dangerous you guys.

  Considering the Ocarina of Time post, I figured this would fit in even better.

  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3EvpRHL_vk) is a different video from the same guy, showing off the creation of an entirely new game using the glitch.
