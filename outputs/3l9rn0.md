  One of my favorite parts of this work (and I've seen this in other works by alexanderwales) is characters without the benefit of our scientific and philosophical traditions figuring out the basics for themselves. Understanding incentives or behavior that follows from rules, or trying to do things like figure out the risk of someone with superpowers destroying the world given the random odds of psycopathy.

  awesome! I wonder how Dominic is going to solve this one, IF he does. I notice how Lothaire's prediction of the consequences of the existence of multistrati seems to parallel the real world and its ridiculously extreme wealth inequalities.

  Great chapter, can't wait to see what happens next!

  A funny story about SotL.

  I had consistent headaches for about a month. And my eyes felt weird, so I had an eye exam, figuring those were linked. When was my last eye exam? Oh, during the Reagan era, most likely. Maybe *maybe* Bush the Elder.

  So, I have astigmatism. The examiner does all sorts of horrific-ish stuff to my eyes, diagnoses me with astigmatism, and then gives me test glasses, saying "These should be much better." 

  I try them and look at the new eye chart (its digital, so the letters change each time she clicks). I can now read the bottom line. But I take them off and on a few times and say, "That's odd. It's clearer with the glasses, but I can still read them without them."

  Optometrist does not believe me. She changes to the next chart when I have the glasses off. I can still read the bottom line, but it's blurry. 

  Now she's annoyed!

  "You couldn't read that line when you sat down for the exam." And its true. She's confused. (And *I notice that she's confused*).

  I mentally review what she's said, and the headaches are caused by aging muscles and also be switching focus from near and far. And, right before the exam, I'd been reading SotL on my smartphone. Like I'd been doing for the last four weeks. (Before, I'd never read anything longer than a text or maybe an email on my phone, but I'd had lots of 5-10 minute spare blocks recently). 

  So, I'm still getting glasses, but I think I'm done using a smart phone as a reader for now. It's a good enough story that I'd kept reading it (whenever I had a few spare minutes) even with the headaches.

  So, SotL -- *Good story, helps diagnose eye problems.*

    Try making the font on your phone larger.

  I'm calling it now, the fact that the artifact acts the same way (emitting one tone for each power) whether it is taking powers or giving them will be a major plot point in the next few chapters.  I predict somehow Welexi is tricked into thinking the artifact has someone's powers in it (maybe he hears the tones, and then sees someone acting weak), and puts his hand in to get them, only to have his own abilities stripped.
