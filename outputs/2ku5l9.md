## This trailer gave me chills - seems like it could be the film of Eliezer Yudkowsky's AI-in-a-box experiment.

    This is the international trailer freed from silly region restrictions.

    Warning - it's not obvious, but I think this trailer [allows you to infer part of the ending](#s "one of the characters discovers that he his himself an AI - when he cuts himself to see if there is circuitry underneath.")

    On the one hand, making it turn out he was the real person the whole time was kinda a cop-out.  On the other hand, his acting and character were so fucking wooden I believed he was a robot long before they stuck electrodes to his dying head.

    You can't condemn a character for what ideas they didn't have as opposed to the choices they make. That said, I really would have expected he would realize that he just needed to [Transcendence](#s "make his minions fall over and the tentacles in sight dissipate").

  A movie with actual moral ambiguity? I really hope so

    Is this a Hollywood film?  Because what happens in *those* is that they start out trying to make a genuine statement, and then just end up switching to an uberfascist Nazi cult that hates freedom.

  Ah, fuck the unnecessary spoiler at the very end of the trailer...

  Hey, one more source of similar frisson is in this hard sci-fi book Echopraxia, by Peter Watts (author of the side-quel Blindsight).

  Interesting trailer!

  >The "dramatic" text at the start of the trailer is just silly. The rest is okay, but they could have done without the start. If you merge organics and machines, you don't get something godly, you get a down-grade. Organics are superior, but humanity is only about 0.01% of organic life's potential. People who assume we're the maximum potential also assume the only way to get more powerful is to use cybermods, but we're not anywhere near organic life's maximum. We still have 99.99% of the way to go on that front. I predict that cybermods will be very useful for a period of about 50 years, but then genemods will make cybermods and AI as obsolete as an abacus.

  Why do I keep reading youtube comments. Please, someone put me out of my misery.
