  1.  You know the library is too small.  Don't require me to send you an email if my book isn't found send me to a form: where I can give you the link and you can scrape the chapters.  Requiring human interaction on your part prevents this from scaling, and just ban behavior.

  2.  You need a TOS to define bad behavior, much let users know what you are doing with the throw away email addresses we had to make since you didn't have one and the associated passwords.

  I have a fairly polished proof of concept ready. It hasn't launched yet, and I'd like to get feedback from readers and especially authors before launching. If you have any concerns, please bring them to my attention! 

  The app is working, so if you'd like to poke around before the launch, feel free to put in your email on [the sign up page](http://webfiction.co/hello). Any feedback is welcome! Here are some links to the working app: (although you need to sign up to get bookmarking and notifications).

  **For readers:**

  - Would you use this? 
  - What is missing or what would you change?
  - Which books should I add?

  **For authors:**

  - What could an index do that would help you?
  - Do you have any concerns? 
  - What can I do to help facilitate your work?

  Thanks for checking it out. Especially thanks to Wildbow for pointing out some issues with permission and art, which I've fixed, and to Eliezer who gave me permission to feature HPMoR.

  It's a good start - the indexing model seems solid and I like the style.  I think there are two critical aspects to get it off the ground:

  1. Discovery - if you can get a (moderated?) system of tags and recommendations working, the site has real value.  

  2. Content - some combination of automated scraping and moderator/admin review.  What degree of curation do you want to enforce?
  ```

    1. Yeah! I'll see what I can come up with.

    2. Hmm... I'm torn about this. I want to encourage anyone to write, because that's what's cool about self-publishing in the first place. But it would also be nice to have some kind of list you can trust: everything on it is pretty good. Maybe some kind of "top page" vs "new" thing like reddit.

      Maybe have public and private listings?  Public listings are curated (to some degree); private listings can be scraped on demand.

  Bookmarking is a great feature to have if it works reliably.

  Suggestion:

  match users following the same story *and* in the same progress (chapter) - facilitate spoiler free discussion. 

  EDIT:

  Also cool technology, will surely study source to improve my haskell-fu.
