## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

    Eliezer Yudkowsky described buying a *massive* amount of artificial lights and just hanging them up everywhere in the house. I think it was in *Inadequate Equilibria*. I don't know how much disposable income you have, but that might work.

    EDIT: In this case I think you'd be generally be searching for LED flood lights. They'll cost you anywhere from 30-100 dollars a pack.

        Eh.. a 26000 lumen LED bulb (Which is basically "Your room is now suitable for growing crops") runs 160 dollars, and assuming you run it 16 hours per day, around 10 dollars of electricity per month. I mean, this might hurt if you are lighting up the entire house like that, but as SAD preventatives goes, not really that bad.

    I use [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Verilux-HappyLight-Lucent-Bright-Therapy/dp/B079YBGPM5/ref=zg_bs_13053141_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=VZN33WQ547B69BZ8Z5MT), a Verilux 10,000 lux LED lamp that's set up next to my computer so that I can use it while I'm surfing reddit (or whatever). It's super simple, which helps make it fairly cheap, and I've been using it for the past two years with okay results. It's hard to tell though, because the interventions for SAD are:

    * More sleep
    * 300 mcg melatonin at night to regulate sleep
    * Vitamin D supplements
    * Exercise
    * Light therapy

    So the relative success of light therapy itself is hard to judge. *Personally*, light therapy gives me a touch of nausea until after I've adjusted to it, so I start with 15 minutes and increase whenever the nausea starts to go away. I'm at an hour now, with no nausea, but the nausea comes back if I skip a few days (as happened with Thanksgiving).
    ```

      Perfect! Thanks for the recommendation! I've been trying to get more sleep and have melatonin tablets but Vitamin D supplements never occurred to me.

      I also use a light box in the mornings, mainly for a sleep disorder. I also use a blue light filter app on my computer (f.lux) and on my phone (a default option with some samsung galaxy phones) to reduce my blue light exposure at nighttime. It's also a good idea to avoid chocolate in the evenings and avoid drinking coffee in the afternoons and evenings. It's also good to set your alarm to wake up at the same time every day so your sleep cycle is regular. It should also go without saying, but a lot of people don't sleep enough. For some people 6 or 7 hours a day don't cut it and they need 8 or more. Daytime naps should also be avoided, they tend to ruin your nighttime sleep. That doesn't apply to elderly people though since sleep patterns tend to change as people age, with elderly people often sleeping less at night, getting up very early, and taking naps during the day. 

      Another thing most people don't realize: don't lie down on your bed for anything other than sleep or sex. It reduces the psychological association between your bed and sleep. 

      If all else fails go see a doctor. People who wake up feeling unrefreshed in the morning may have sleep apnea, and people who feel refreshed in the morning but tend to fall asleep during the day such as while driving may have narcolepsy. Hypothyroidism can also cause fatigue, and so can some other conditions. Some medications can also be sedating.

      Edit: Also, I really shouldn't have to mention this but it's disturbingly common so I'll just say this: don't use alcohol as a sleep aid. Not only is alcohol terrible for you, but it's also terrible for this. The alcohol gets processed by your system through the night and people end up just getting up early. It also messes up your sleep cycle. Same with benzodiazepines, don't ask your doctor for xanax for sleep. Benzodiazepines are also pretty addictive, so like alcohol tolerance develops. There are better medications like zolpidem for that.

        Wow, huge thank you for the reminder that chocolate contains caffeine!

        I recently "quit using all caffeine" and haven't seen any improvements in my urge to sleep. Eating dark chocolate as my late night snack is probably a larger part of that now that I'm not drinking 240-300mg of caffeine daily. 

        The silver lining is that this encourages me to have the chocolate as my first meal of the day!

    This is relevant to my interests.  Particularly, I'm in the market for a natural light alarm clock.  The melatonin I take to fall asleep has made it much harder to get up before dawn since winter kicked in.

      ```
      I bought a cheap ($10?) wall timer and plugged my bedside lamp into it. The lamp is a cheap Target one with a low-lumen, warm-temperature LED bulb and a cheap shade. Total cost of the entire kit may have been $50, but I was buying retail for the lamp and shade instead of used.

      The lamp turns on at 7:30 a.m., more or less, and my mechanical alarm clock goes off at 8, more or less. It's all very analog.
      ```

    - u/derefr:
      ```
      I’ve found that ensuring that the first thing I do in the morning (before showering et al, literally within five minutes of the alarm if possible) is *eating something substantial*, has calibrated my brain so that it naturally *wants* to wake up right when my alarm goes off. (This is, AFAIK, to do with orexin release in the brain being the counter to adenosine release—animals naturally recalibrate to wake up at the time of best historical meal availability.)

      Sadly, this means that you can’t spend any time cooking in the morning before eating. Depending on your meal preferences, that either translates to preparing breakfast the night before (e.g. non-instant porridge), eating something you don’t cook (e.g. granola and yoghurt), or eating an “instant” meal (e.g. a grocery store frozen “breakfast wrap” which you just microwave.) I alternate all three methods. If I crave more complex breakfast meals, I’ll prepare those as brunch on weekends, after first having toast or a granola bar (something small that will kickstart your appetite) the moment I get up.

      I also, more recently, acquired a light therapy lamp, which I sit in front of while eating said breakfast. This was a good multiplier for the wakefulness-calibrating effect of eating first thing upon waking up, I think, but when I tried it on its own, it didn’t help nearly as much as eating first thing on its own (i.e. I quickly went back to feeling unable to get out of bed.)

  So, I didn't get an extension on my temporary role investigating fatal car crashes (boo!) but that means I am moving my trip to Paris forward, like, a full month (yay!). 

  So, from ~June to ~November, I'm going to be living in Paris - around the 19e, if anyone in the area wants to be my new best friend. I'm working on my visa application this coming week - I've booked in a 6 month course in a language school. 

  I'm excited! And terrified. 

  I've got paid leave from work so my "passive" income will be about 1200 euro a month, but the visa should allow me to work an additional 20 hours a week. It looks like a room in an apartment comes to about 600 euro, so I shouldn't starve to death even if i don't manage to find a job (double yay).

  Anyone have any recommendations / suggestions / unsolicited advice?

  I've been interested in reading both fictional and non-fictional works that make use of Social Combat, preferably one that handles the [Guile Hero](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuileHero) vs [Manipulative Bastard](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManipulativeBastard) tropes. I'm tired of direct battles and magical/sword fights. Are there any good works you can recommend?

  I've read that [Luminosity](http://luminous.elcenia.com/) is a good work of fiction with a manipulative heroine, is that true? Does it handle social combat well? Is it really like [House of Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(U.S._TV_series)) but with vampires?

  On non-fiction, I only know the classics such as:

  * [The Prince by Machiavelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince)
  * How to make friends and influence people by Andrew Carnegie
  * 48 Laws of Power by Green. This one has the caveat that it heavily contradicts itself in some parts so I question it's usefulness.

  Are there any other good non-fiction social combat books you could recommend?

  Also I've been wondering just how far social combat and guile can take you. Implying you're successful in manipulating someone into giving you a high position at work for example, even if you're very charismatic, if you fail in most of your assignments in a row, it will soon catch up with you.

  So, I wonder if characters who invest heavily into social skills at the expense of the rest would really be using an optimal strategy.

  -------------------------------------------

  This week I've been reading the book [Bounce](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7845157-bounce), and really enjoying how it demystifies the concept of natural genius. It explores geniuses such as Mozart, Newton or more contemporary ones like chess grandmasters and the training they have undergone to achieve "genius" status. It's inspiring to think a person could reach such a level provided enough effort and sacrifice was made. Still, I wonder what are the limits of such a "Theory of Effort" and if it applies to outliers such as [Kim Ung Yong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Ung-yong).

  It also makes one question just how much they sacrificed to reach such a level of mastery and if their stories are correct. Maybe their training regimes could be reverse-engineered to reach the same achievements as them if enough effort and resources were invested.

  I've been toying with the idea of a Boku No Hero fanfic about a villain that makes use of guile and careful planning to compete with Deku's brute force approach, with the plot twist that his Quirk is super-strength. The idea would be that he had developed his tactical mindset and guile by reverse engineering smart villain's strategies and using rigorous training to imitate their skills without being naturally gifted himself.

  -------------------------------------------

  Any fans of [World of Darkness? I've found that the character sheets](https://mrgone.rocksolidshells.com/nwod.html) are great to depict almost any character. They show each of the attributes and skills that characters can practice in a measurable manner, with the flexibility of adding more traits if you so wish.

  I've found them useful to describe a character for a story, simply adding or subtracting attributes and magic systems, along with allowing to more easily keep track of equipment and progression the character makes through the story.

  -------------------------------------------------------

  Finally a question to the community. When you write original stories, do you start with the worldbuilding and get the story concept from there? Or do you prefer to create the character and think of the scenario they interact with,  and build the world around them afterwards?

  Do you think there's an advantage to one approach over the other?

    > Social Combat

    Some books that come to mind:

    - [How to Profit by One's Enemies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20553844-how-to-profit-by-one-s-enemies) by Plutarch. A very short yet timeless text that is over 2000 years old.

    - [The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1111.The_Power_Broker) by Robert Caro. A fascinating portrait of power. From the cover: "Without ever having been elected to office, he dominated the men who were - even his most bitter enemy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, could not control him - until he finally encountered, in Nelson Rockefeller, the only man whose power (and ruthlessness in wielding it) equalled his own."

    - [The Cultural Revolution: A People's History, 1962-1976](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26073079-the-cultural-revolution) by Frank Dikötter. How Mao used the Cultural Revolution to manoeuvre his opponents into lose-lose positions. This [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/Scholars_Stage/status/1084237324748185600) does the book more justice than my description.

    - [The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11612989-the-dictator-s-handbook) by Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith. Leaders do whatever keeps them in power. Everything else is just bread and circuses. I'd describe this book as Freakonomics for politics.

    Fiction:

    - [The Traitor Baru Cormorant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23444482-the-traitor-baru-cormorant?ac=1&from_search=true) by Seth Dickinson. A savant accountant takes on an evil empire from the inside.

    - [Daughter of the Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/589979.Daughter_of_the_Empire) by Raymond Feist. An inexperienced heiress of a suddenly ruined aristocratic family must ensure their survival in an empire that loves power games.

    If you're into podcasts, we did two episodes on this for Rationally Writing, [Top Down Storytelling](http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-21/) and [Bottom Up Storytelling](http://daystareld.com/podcast/rationally-writing-22/). But if you don't have an hour and a half to listen to those:

    I usually start from the worldbuilding and then move outward from there, finding themes as I go. This tends to make for a much more naturalistic piece, less tightly plotted, but more believable simply because the world doesn't exist to serve the plot. That said, there's something of an iterative process where I move back and forward between approaches, first making the world, seeing what kinds of plots come from that, and then going back to tweak the world if I think there's not enough room for interesting plots, or if there are more interesting quirks that might come from slight rules changes. Because a world has many parts, this can be a long process of going back and forth, seeing the effects of changes, making tweaks, seeing different effects, looking at possible plots, and going through more iteration.

    The advantage of the *other* approach, doing the story concept first, is that your story can have tighter plotting, less extraneous bits, and hit your themes harder.

    (I don't think that one is strictly superior to the other, but I will say that it'll be easier to adhere to /r/rational standards if you're finding the stories in the world, rather than building the world to suit a story, generally speaking.)

    Also, [see here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9AfeqVGDHDY5ldctk444LNCt4V33ffl2DWCqQo7zLc/edit?usp=sharing) for a longer essay on narrativism vs. simulationism.

    Twig has plenty of action scenes but there's also a lot of cloak and dagger type stuff. Sy is very much both of those tropes, to the point where he even candidly calls himself a manipulative bastard a few times.

    &#x200B;

    I don't use a full RPG character sheet, but I have a template with sections for different things like primary trait, motivation, gear, etc. Characterization is really hard for me, so having a step-by-step checklist for the soft stuff helps a lot and the other sections just make sure I have a central reference so I don't mess up continuity.

    >When you write original stories, do you start with the worldbuilding and get the story concept from there? Or do you prefer to create the character and think of the scenario they interact with, and build the world around them afterwards?

    I started with an interesting idea: what would The Magicians crossed with Ender's Game look like? From there I just kind of kept picking the "inspect" option on each new idea. For example, Battle School had a single objective (kill the buggers). I decided that my Academy's leaders wanted to take over the world, not because evil, but because they didn't want everyone else to ruin it. That in turn begged the question of why they hadn't already, so I chose to have magic be strong, but not so strong that a group of sorcerers could take on an entire army. That led me to having the Academy be secretive and more interested in political manipulation than direct power. And so on. I didn't get down to characters till the end (ish, since it's still being worked on).

      Seconded. Although it's very dark in several places which ruined those parts for me. Definitely not for the squeamish.

    >  preferably one that handles the Guile Hero vs Manipulative Bastard tropes

    "Going Postal" by Terry Pratchett neatly fits into this category (on the fictional side).

    The hero - well, the *protagonist* - is Moist von Lipwig, a con man, a trickster, a double-crosser who swindles and cheats and steals his way through life, until he gets caught and Lord Vetinari offers him a choice between more-or-less honest employment (running the Post Office, which hasn't worked properly in decades) or a sharply truncated life. And then takes steps to make *very* sure that Moist can't get out of the deal.

    The *villain* of the story is someone who starts out having succeeded where Moist failed, having conned, lied and cheated his way into being both rich and respected, secure that his position is nearly entirely untouchable...

    That'd be cute, do you think people are that stupid that in what? Centuries worth of competition they haven't had the idea to emulate the top people in their fields ? 

    &#x200B;

    Anyway on your other point, no there are hard limits to how far you can get with just training. Yes you can get very good with training and effort, but the people at the top are all doing it too, the outcome of this is that people with natural advantages are more likely to win and be at the top at competitions. i.e higher long capacity, height in certain sports, arm length, leg length etc. 

    &#x200B;

    It's not necessarily PC or how we'd like things to be, but it is how it is. Olympian medalists for instance tend to have a more similar body structure and characteristics to their competitors than to their own siblings and parents, that's how competitive these things are..

      > That'd be cute, do you think people are that stupid that in what? Centuries worth of competition they haven't had the idea to emulate the top people in their fields ?

      That's what I wondered. According to the book, most world class athletes, artists and academics spent an average of 5 years practicing 8 hours daily to reach their genius status. That assuming a good amount of resources and focus is spent and methods are given to motivate them to keep going.

      According to the book, most young geniuses simply started at a very young age when their brains had the most plasticity and thus on average only started showing their true talent at 5-10 years old.

      I bet there's a genetic component too, it would also be interesting to see how it develops across generations.

    > When you write original stories, do you start with the worldbuilding and get the story concept from there? Or do you prefer to create the character and think of the scenario they interact with, and build the world around them afterwards?

    I sort of build these out in tandem. For my current work-in-progress, I started with a couple of kernels that I built my world around. I came up with an idea for the antagonist, then got stuck for a while trying to make a protagonist or any kind of plot, or even meaningfully tie together the two different seeds that my worldbuilding was founded from. Eventually, after agonizing brainstorming, I got all of that to click into place, a story idea and character I was excited about, and that formed the basis for an outline. Since then, I've had to simultaneously flesh out the world and the characters as necessary, sometimes tweaking background details in the world to allow for the story I really want. Sometimes, though, characters that started as background or plot really ran away from me and took on their own life, which feels magical. (Usually this happens when I actually start writing them on the page, since before that point, it's too easy to think of them as blank faces pinned to a particular plot function without fleshing them out.)
    ```

  - u/GeneralExtension:
    ```
    >When you write original stories,

    I don't have a lot of experience, but the reason for the number of stories which take place on Earth (as opposed to someone designing a world) became more apparent after I came up with a story and that was what happened. People interact with this world, and it's familiar, so working with that just takes generating a story and characters, as opposed to also coming up with a world. (It can literally spring from looking at something and going "What If...".) If I end up making it into something I probably will make a different world  for it - it requires some things to change, so the background (stuff that happens before the story starts, and out of view of the characters) as well as how people operate needs some work. (A different society, or less atomic culture or something might be required for the number of groups to exist to make the story feasible.)

    So you can come up with a story by initially thinking about it taking place on Earth, and then if things diverge too much, I think you can flesh a world around it, and rework it. What easiest or best probably depends on you - there's a story about writing that goes like this: An author wrote a book, and wrote all the fun parts first, but then didn't want to write the rest. They looked through what they'd written, cut the boring parts out, and sent it to the publisher.
