  I think the thing that bothers me most about that prompt is that as soon as a lot of people got access to the chip time just wouldn't progress, making most of the stories automatically implausible.    
  Once enough people get the chip there is guaranteed to be at least one person who for whatever reason will always reset, maybe they're crazy, maybe they only have a few days to live.     
  So as soon as the chip reaches mass market nothing new will happen ever again.. You know what since that other thread is so full I'll just post a story, here.

  At exactly midnight UTC, four PM where I was, I noticed a number appear 7212; that was pretty unlikely, I was kind of expecting to get the max number the chip could display or something like that, or maybe the number rolled over I hadn't thought to check that. The one thing I could definitely be sure of was that by the anthropic principle, I was almost certainly not actually this early in what could potentially be an infinite series of resets.     
  I was among only a small number of people who had realized the implications the chip before it had reached mass market. When it resets, it resets the whole damn timeline; which means as long as there's at least one person willing to reset no matter what, things will never progress. I was pretty tight on cash, but I like many others was still clever enough to realize what this meant. As thus I had taken out a substantial amount of loans the day before and had gotten as many credit cards as I could, no reason not to after all. I'd also committed _just so much_ fraud the day prior, I almost felt bad, but I'd ensured my actions wouldn't affect anybody seriously within a single day.      

  This was the trial run for the chips, so they cost over a hundred thousand, just barely within my reach with the methods I had employed. Of course I was hoping a lot of the rich buyers would be pretty willing to give away money when they saw how high their numbers were. 

  I checked the reddit group I and several others had had the foresight to set up beforehand. They had named it r/areallyhighnumberofresets to hopefully get a few more people in the trial run to check it out if they checked google when they saw how high their number was. I checked the reset number thread and it seemed that _everyone_ had 7212, well wonderfull. People were already speculating what kind of error would cause that after big enough number of resets, but it didn't seem likely we would get any answer. Some people were gloating that they hadn't paid for the chip and were just as well off as those who had. A few had taken the same monetary strategy as me but just not bought the chip, I immediately felt very stupid.  

  I had the foresight to travel to the bay area due to the large number of people there who got chips, both the rich, and the people clever enough to take similar strategies to me to get lots of money quickly. I got out out of my rented RV already parked in the lot we had agreed to park in, and biked a few blocks to the mansion we had agreed upon as a meeting place. I had woken up only a few hours prior and had enough modafinil to get me set for the next 24 hours and enough to share, now to see what to do for the next consequence free day.
