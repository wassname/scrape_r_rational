## Has anyone come across a rational redo of The Last of Us world?

### Post:

I was looking for a rational explanation of the origins of the entire outbreak. I can imagine the real life foraging and zombie cannibalism that might be taking place.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/7uoame/how_did_cordyceps_originate/) was one of the better insights I had come across in a while on this topic.

All sources are appreciated.

  Human cordyceps strikes me as a bioweapon. Cliche perhaps, but it's the only explanation that makes reasonable sense. It jumped whatever hotlab it was in, was way more effective than by design, and there you go.

  Unlike a lot of zombies, cordyceps has potential for rationality. It's harshly simple to get infected - no bites necessary, just inhale some spores. Spores that are bursting out all over the place, because humanity has provided plenty of warm and dark environments for them to grow in, even putting aside infected getting immobilized and consumed.

  Useful modifications:

  -Infected aren't mindless, at least at first. Cordyceps cannot control. It's a fungus. Cordyceps *manipulates*. It floods the brain and body with a mix of hormones and neurotransmitters to reach particular behaviors (I couldn't find any clear info on the mechanism of real cordyceps). The smell of human sweat triggers aggression and paranoia, unless mixed with another agent emitted by cordyceps. Light sensitivity keeps them out of the elements, while little modification is needed to make humans seek warmth.

  -So runners can still reason, but they can't be around other humans very long without going into fits of rage, which with the preexisting tension means things are unlikely to go well. Cordyceps can also trigger cravings for meat or just consume enough calories growing that the body will crave the density of meat anyway. Only so much meat available in the apocalypse... You could also get syrup-guzzling infected trying to resist the inevitable.

  -The inevitable being becoming a clicker. Clickers have had parts of their frontal lobe eaten along with the face and are no longer rational. The clicking is no good for actually locating anything (which, to be fair, it isn't in the original either), it's just a common tic caused by the massive brain damage. Clickers can't really hunt (well) or cook anything, so they're almost always hungry, and humans are one of the few species that humans can run-down in pure speed.

  -Eventually though, clickers get too hungry, too tired, and too brain damaged. They seek out a warm closed space and die there, bursting into spores that are going to engulf the first poor motherfucker who opens the door of what was once an Arbys.

    That's a good explanation.

    I was just wondering if the origins would be centered more around the families of Joel and Ellie. The entire episode reminds me of the Attack on Titans story arc.

    Incidentally, GameTheory just made a case that there are actual pathogens that can come close to the "zombie" trope: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrPBaocN77Y

    It focuses on rabies rather than cordyceps, but it's interesting nonetheless.

    >The clicking is no good for actually locating anything

    To be fair, [echolocation has been shown to work for humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_echolocation) and it's not completely unreasonable for the cordyceps to have some enhancing effect, possibly due to the material of it given that a solid mass is protruding from the brain. 

    Of course, it's harder to connect it to the military as it seems a bit tacked on and complicated to be by design.

  >!Spoiler for the ending of the last of us: 

  >!Cutscene: Joel meets with the researchers. "Are you sure you can manufacture a vaccine with the data of the autopsy? Whats your confidence level? Have you exhausted any other alternatives?" Susan, the head researcher, earnestly nods. "Yes." She pushes a file folder over her desk to you. "This outlines what we know so far. Best guesses, detailed analysis of the attack vectors, possible immune system responses. These are the historic cases where something similar was done. This-" She dumps another huge folder on the table "- contains the compiled records of other labs, back when the Centre of Disease Control stil was active." She takes a second to open up the report and taps a conclusion at the bottom. " Quote: our best chance of long-term success in finding a vaccine is a natural immune carrier that will probably spring up in time. We leave this report and procedures to be undertaken in case this happens to the capable hands of our successors. End quote. Note that this report was writen a year past the outbreak, making it a successful prediction."!<

  >!Joel sat and tried to do his best to integrate all this information. With a sickening feeling in his stomach he struggled to accept the inevitable. The calculus was clear, Ellis life just didn't weigh up against the thousands and thousands of lifes that would be safed just this year alone. Not to mention that a return to technical civilisation on the the pre-plague level was impossible without a permanent solution. Crying, his face in his hands, he chocked out "Give us a week, will you?"<!

  >!Later, when Joel had the talk with Elli... Over their journey together he had come to expect this level of quickmindedness of her. His heart burst with love and agony as she just calmly nodded "Yes, that makes sense."!<

    >!You don't have to make the characters constantly do the rational thing for the story to be rational though. Joel had his daughter die in front of him and has been haunted by it ever since, he's accepted Ellie as his new family and suddenly finds out that after all their hardships and grief, she's now going to die.

    >! Him valuing her life over the rest of humanity and deciding he can't accept this outcome isn't irrational, it just means that he has a well established and believable character flaw that has made him value things differently. Changing his values to be in line with the greater good doesn't make the story more rational. After all, villains can be rational too.
