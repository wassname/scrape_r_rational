## Tian: A LitRPGXCultivation story

### Post:

Hi /r/rational!

I've just started a new fic for the RoyalRoad writathon and I was hoping you guys would be willing to check it out and leave a rating! It's a LitRPGXCultivation story that I feel doesn't discount either genres, but chooses to explore both in a rather detailed and fleshed out manner.

It focuses more on worldbuilding, action, and the main character's growth above all else, and I am honestly quite proud of it so far. It is also my first attempt at writing a rationalfic, and I feel like every single one of her actions so far have been driven by logic.

Do consider checking out and leaving it a rating!

    Xianxia/Wuxia/Xuanhuan. Tian's Cultivation is more Xuanhuan, which is not the traditional Xianxia-style story, since the only Cultivation I've read is pretty much Cradle.

      For anyone less familiar with the genre, could you give a description that isn't just more jargon?

        Xianxia has sort of daoist roots. Characters advance on a road to immortality by accumulating energy into their dantian, opening meridians and generally doing a bunch of stuff that sounds like you fell into a world where eastern medicine actually works. The literary tropes tend to be eastern in flavor. There's often a much higher focus on lucky chances than in western literature. The world building scales tend not to make numerical sense. When characters routinely hit the powerlevel of superman fairly early on, and can chuck mountains at one another, well, the only way to make that work without collapsing everything down to a point is to make the world bigger and older. Trope wise: Traditional xianxia will be full of beauties with jade like skin, and the protagonist almost always gets a "cheat" of some sort that lets them accumulate energy quickly or otherwise compresses the timetables that are involved. [White tigers, black turtles, azure dragons and phoenixes/vermillion birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Symbols) abound. The format tends to be very longwinded, given it is often written by the word in serial format and folks generally try to pace it to match something like "Journey to the West", which is a massive epic. The climb to immortality and beyond tends to run against the will of the heavens, and so the heavens try to strike the characters down for their conceit. You'll see heavenly tribulation as a plot device folks will have to overcome (often literal lightning bolts of weird energies striking the character as they pass certain power level caps along the way, usually viewed as detrimental, but by trope, almost always beneficial to the main character). A lot of it is written with very cartoonishly evil bad guys with very thin skin, and there's lots of face-slapping and eastern mores around filial piety.

        Wuxia is basically the kind of world found in "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon". Beyond human levels of human martial arts. Xianxia usually incorporates wuxia elements. As a genre of its own it may be viewed as the "low fantasy" to xianxia's "high fantasy". Fewer magical beasts, more martial arts.

        Xuanhuan is more or less easternized western fantasy. More traditional role-playing world building elements are often straight up lifted from D&D scenarios. A western reader will recognize more bits of the world building, but it may well have eastern flair. Often smaller worlds, more traditional fantasy elements. You can see elves and the like.

          Thanks that was super helpful! I've seen a lot of these terms before, but never saw it laid out in this much detail.
