  Have you read the [Alexandra Quick series](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle)? It's a series of Harry Potter fanfics set in North America and it has some very solid world-building. *Especially* if you're going for canon flavour. There are four stories so far, with a fifth being in progress, so if you haven't read them yet you've a lot of reading ahead of you, I dare say!

  I'd definitely recommend them, even if it's just to ensure you don't do the same thing all over again, as AQ really does do a standard and canon-compliant version of wizarding North America very thoroughly already, complete with old colonial issues and Native Indian traditions and the whole she-bang.

  I also quite enjoy the stories on their own (to the point that I actually think I like them more than I do HP:MoR, meaning AQ is my favourite fanfic of all time), though I could not justify calling them rationalist. Rational, *maybe*, in that characters tend to act and feel like actual real people. Some characters (including the MC a lot of the time) are idiots, but they're very believable idiots.

  Edit: And, silly me, I forgot to actually respond to the question regarding giving you help/feedback with your world-building. I don't think I've got the time myself for that, currently. Sorry.

    There's a fifth one in progress! Fuck yeah!

    I also came in here to recommend that fic. It's the basis for most of my headcanon concerning North America. (I don't quite agree with everything, but most of what's there is really solid.)
