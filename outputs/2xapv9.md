## [D] So I'm up to ch27 of Mother of Learning... (spoilers, obviously)

### Post:

Is it just me or is this Time Braid?

Not so much with the Aranea and lack of underage sex, but seemingly everything else is Time Braid retextured with DnD.

The protagonist is an intellectual with small mana/chakra reserves but good control, who is reliving the same month repeatedly as a result of being anchored to a charming but dimwitted boy with massive mana/chakra reserves whose entire family is dead. The protagonist discovers at some point in the loops that they have a hidden innate power. They bring other people/spiders into the loops by storing backups of their memories inside their own soul to be given to the next iteration of the other person at the start of the next loop. After enjoying a period of dilligent study and the occasional bit of messing around they discover that an enemy is also looping and has the means to deal them harm in a way that will carry over into subsequent loops.

  If I remember right, Mother of Learning was inspired by Time Braid.  Personally, I much prefer the direction Mother of Learning is going.  Crack like Time Braid is fun only in small doses for me.

    Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

    In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

    Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

    “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

    The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

    Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

    Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

    L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

      Well, now I have a better understanding of what crackfic is.  Does that meant the weird Demonic and Angelic parts were from somewhere else?  That's pretty much the part where the story lost me.

  Imperfect comparison. Many of your things are slightly rephrased universal elements of stories, others are poor comparisons, some are clear retextures.

  >The protagonist is an intellectual with small mana/chakra reserves but good control

  For the first chapter, yes, but after that her reserves grow pretty quickly. By the end of the first chapter she can walk on water for an hour and I don't believe her chakra limits come into play much.

  >who is reliving the same month repeatedly

  That's a very common plot point, very popular too. Time Braid was not the first one that did it by any means.

  >as a result of being anchored to a charming but dimwitted boy with massive mana/chakra reserves whose entire family is dead.

  Sort of. In MoL he's more tightly anchored, and if Zach dies he dies. Plus he's in the same timeline. While Sakura is anchored to Naruto that doesn't really come into play for most of the story. Zach is a very Naruto like character though.

  >The protagonist discovers at some point in the loops that they have a hidden innate power.

  As with most magical stories. You have to be vague because it's a very different power and as such a very different type of story.

  >They bring other people/spiders into the loops by storing backups of their memories inside their own soul to be given to the next iteration of the other person at the start of the next loop.

  Sort of. A spider brings people into the loop, people of her choosing, so the story plays out very differently to how it plays when the protagonist can bring people into the loop. He has far less control over what she does. 

  >After enjoying a period of dilligent study and the occasional bit of messing around they discover that an enemy is also looping and has the means to deal them harm in a way that will carry over into subsequent loops.

  After they do stuff they discover an enemy that can cause them permanent harm is an almost universal property of stories. Students, predictably, study and mess around. For dramatic tension to exist the ability to harm people permanently should normally exist.

    > Zach is a very Naruto like character though.

    In personality. He basically has Sasuke's backstory, though (last survivor of a clan of militants; rich but lonely; doted on by tutors; etc.)

    > A spider brings people into the loop, people of her choosing, so the story plays out very differently to how it plays when the protagonist can bring people into the loop. He has far less control over what she does.

    Still, the magic was introduced, and there's no reason given (so far) that Zorian won't be able to learn it for himself at some point. Other than that maybe being a waste of time with the loop winding down.

  Well, is there anything wrong with that? :-D
