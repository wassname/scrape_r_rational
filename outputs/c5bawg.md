## A fic I haven't seen on here, but which has very good elements of rationality.

  I adore TWI, enough to support the author on patreon, but don't think it fits here at all.

  Great serial, updates twice a week, with chapters that are regularly in the 15-20k words range because the author has an *insane* work ethic.

  But lets not sell it as something it's not.

    agree. it's exceptionally good writing, but it isn't rational. in fact i'd call it a great example of how rational elements aren't necessary to make a good story.

      "Exceptionally" goes way too far as an assessment of the quality of it, though.

        it sure starts off that way, but at the point the story's at now it's one of my most looked-forward to things to read every tuesday and saturday.

          When exactly does it get better? I tried getting through, but >!two main characters!< as of end of the >!city battle!< arc were so annoying to read, especially >!Ryoka!<, that I could barely keep my interest and eventually dropped it without much of a thought, year ago or so.

          I enjoyed MoL and to lesser degree WTC and Worm, but this...

  Please use real titles. “[RT] The Wandering Inn”. These ‘I won't tell you until you click’ titles are clickbait at best.

  A quick search on this sub shows that it have at least been recommended 8 times.

  I have to agree with others here, I'm a fan of this story and have recommended it before on r/fantasy, but I really don't think it belongs to this sub.

  *Maaybe* some Ryoka chapters, and some United Nations lately.

  But not the main meat of the story.

    Ryoka does at least think about leveling, but none of the POV characters investigate and hack the leveling system and classes, try to create their own, or try to plan for self-improvement and advancement.

      Laken Gaodart does. But he shows up in a later volume and gets low ratio of screen time.

  Great story, not rational whatsoever

   1 it  has already been recommended here sometimes

  2.Lets not turn the subreddit into merely a web serial subreddit.

  I see overwhelming favor for the work, but my personal experience says otherwise. People can assign different taste for differing opinion, and nobody should fault that, but my dislike goes deeper than that. Here's my observation with my personal opinion followed:

  1. High word count makes the work lack polish. You can scroll without reading much of the text and not missing any. After some chapters (my case is after two books), you'll feel that author's skill on writing does not improve as she still need tremendous number of words to deliver idea.
  2. Melodrama. You'll see similar sense repeated in multiple sentences without increasing impact. I assign it as melodrama as following sentence doesn't hit harder than earlier sentence. Just repetition. I think the author want to appeal to readers' emotion intensely, but she's lacking skill to invoke it.
  3. Idiot balls (many characters's guilty of this), forgetting priority (idem), disregarding the value of communication (mostly the ant-like colony under Liscor). Stubbornness seemingly the defining trait for many characters in Wandering Inn. Some rooted in lofty ideals, which is nice. Many forget the practicality of it, which is par course and quite nice if they can learn from mistake. Sadly, learning from mistake is not equal stubbornness in this work. I have intense hate of it. Especially when some ideals are quite fatalistic. I think the author plunged to deep into the rule of drama.
  4. Multi POV. You can dismiss this because it's entirely my taste: I hate multi-POV. Developing characters so that readers care for them takes time. Double the amount of time needed if they're idiots. I can only stomach multi-POV if the POV characters is highly competent AND offered a new perspective to conflict happening in the work. Given that my earlier experience that multiple characters in Wandering Inn are idiot, stubborn, (and I forgot that some of them are immensely egoist), multi-POV is really a bad thing here.

  So there you go, a differing opinion on work that many seems to like it so much.
