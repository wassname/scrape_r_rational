  >“All you ponies need to get it together!” Pinkie Pie said. “You’ve all been acting weird the minute we got in this forest, standing around discussing the villain's motives and plot rather than plunging ahead thoughtlessly like the ponies I know. I don’t think there even is any such thing as a dark economist, and if there were Twilight wouldn’t become one.”

  >Twilight blinked—at least she could feel the motion of her eyelids. Was Pinkie Pie seriously the voice of reason?

  >“Twilight wouldn’t become a dark economist,” Pinkie Pie continued. “She’d become a grey economist. Get it? Because twilight is in between the day and the night? Pretty good, huh? Been looking for an opportunity.”

  >dark economist

  That's called an "economist".  They're all dark.  They predict seven out of five recessions and can always find a reason that nothing will change and nothing will work.  Amazingly, things keep happening that the economists didn't predict.

  >Twilight’s panicked brain couldn’t keep up with a lecture from Pinkie Pie on logic, not while her tail was being pumped and her horn emitting light like a schizophrenic light bulb. “Sto-o-op!”

  I've never heard someone make the Twi Machine Gun sound so much like being molested.

  FURTHER EDIT: This is one of *the* most accurate interpretations of Pinkie I've ever seen.  *Good job.*

  FURTHER FURTHER EDIT: [Dying of laughter.](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/189965/5/my-little-economy-economics-is-science/pinkie-pies-test-uncertainty#comment/4479190)  And reminding myself to call Vanguard about opening another account since my IRA is already stuffed until 2015.

    I'm pleased to hear that since I don't actually watch the show. The characters of Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy in particular are expressed primarily through visual and auditory cues, which is hard to carry over to written text.
