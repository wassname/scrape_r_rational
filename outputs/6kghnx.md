## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Guys, seriously, LANGUAGE IS WEIRD. It is a SUPER POWER TECHNOLOGY. I didn't realise it until I had a moment the other day.

  OK, I'm trying to learn French, right? So one of the things I do is listen to a couple of french language news podcasts. Because I'm a language learner, I usually find myself struggling to understand, I feel like my comprehension is a few words behind the actual content of the podcast.

  Then the other day I was listening to podcasts while cooking and all of a sudden THIS KNOWLEDGE TELEPORTED INTO MY BRAIN. Instead of concentrating on deriving meaning from this podcast, I was just standing there making noodles and information about an[ archaelogical find during a Roman metro construction](https://www.thelocal.it/20170626/mini-pompeii-found-in-rome-while-digging-metro-line) was just INSIDE MY HEAD. I KNEW it, magically.

  And then I realised... this is what language DOES. It's what it's FOR. That matrix scene where he goes "I know kung-fu"? THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT LANGUAGE DOES.

  I know it's not a huge revelation but I had such a visceral response to it, and I feel like people DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW AMAZING LANGUAGE IS NOW.

  Also it means that my passive French practise isn't going to waste, which is pretty cool, eh.

      How was that for your enjoyment of them? I like a lot of songs in other languages, and often think that I would enjoy them less if I knew what they actually say, since when they're in a foreign language the vocals basically just become another instrument, whereas if they were actually saying banal or stupid things I would find it distracting.

  I have a perspective that I have never found anyone else endorsing.
  I don't think I'm wrong but I am suspicious that I seem to be the only one.

  Both linguistic descriptivists and linguistic prescriptivists are fundamentally wrong.

  Consider maps.
  It is not the job of map-makers to decide what roads should be where.
  They only observe where they are and present it in a convenient way.
  This does not mean that all cities have equally good road layout.
  No sane person who has had to navigate Boston without a GPS would say that Boston and NYC are equally good when it comes to the efficiency of where roads are.
  Naturally that doesn't mean we should bulldoze Boston and start over.
  It just means that if Boston had a grid layout from the start, that would have been better.

  Similarly, linguistics is the study of language.
  It is not the purpose of linguistics to evaluate which languages are better, or the utility of changes in languages.
  In the same way, that does not mean that all languages are equal and that all changes are fine.

  I only differ from (most) prescriptivists in that I don't care about historical usage, except in the same sense that I don't think we should bulldoze Boston and start over.
  There's nothing magic about historical usage that makes languages better or worse.

  I am (technically) a prescriptivist with the above caveat.
  My "prescription" is simple.
  The purpose of language is to communicate.
  Communication is any method of making someone else understand one of your thoughts / ideas / emotional states / etc better.
  Therefore, languages that facilitate communication more effectively are better languages.
  Changes in languages that make communication easier are good, and changes in languages that make communication harder are bad.
  Different languages can, of course, be better for different contexts or for different people.
  Sign language is better for the deaf.
  Languages without certain consonants are better for people with speech impediments.

  The thing that annoys me about (most) descriptivists is the subtle prescriptivist attitude they take toward any intentional attempt to change language in any way.
  If a change happens because a mistake becomes common enough that it isn't considered incorrect usage any more then prescriptivists will accept it, but if people intentionally try to make any change for any reason it violates the prescription of descriptivists.
  A true descriptivist should be indifferent to "artificial" changes, because they also occur naturally and trying to promote or suppress them would require a prescriptivist attitude in order to have any metric by which the attempted change is bad.

  I would list examples of english being suboptimal but I don't want to get bogged down in irrelevant details. To take an extreme example of a bad language, consider marklar from South Park, which is english except all nouns are replaced with "marklar". It is virtually impossible to communicate complicated ideas in marklar, so it's a bad language.

  Can someone help me munchkin my diet?
  The main thing is I hate eating anything mushy.
  It's easier to describe with examples.
  The limit around the consistency of ice cream: frozen hard-serve is good, but liquid or soft-serve is bad.
  Peanut butter is fine.
  Scrambled eggs are fine.
  Cheese is fine except feta cheese which I don't even want to look at.
  I don't mind chewy / crispy / hard / crunchy.
  I don't like sauces.

  The other main thing is I'd almost always rather eat the ingredients of something than eat them together.
  Texture is much more important than flavor but I usually don't like strong flavors except for salty and sweet.
  I do eat meat but after a recent Rationally Speaking I've cut back because of ethical doubt of the morality of it.
  I have less objections to humanely raised/slaughtered animals but I don't know where to go to find it and it might be expensive.
  Also less objection to fish but fish also tends to be more expensive.
  The only hard requirement I made for myself is that I won't eat anything at least as intelligent as a dog, so no pork.

  My food preferences are different enough from the general population that I can't easily find balanced healthy stuff because it's all geared toward the general population.
  Currently I'm not eating healthily at all and I'm bored with eating the same old stuff.

  Related...ly, I'm also trying to lose weight so any strats on effective dieting would be appreciated, especially if scientifically supported. In particular I'm finding calorie logging mildly inconvenient and although it's a small obstacle it's apparently enough that I haven't done it enough for it to accomplish anything.

  PS: If there's a word for people like me I'd love to know it. My cousin is the only person I've met with my food preferences.

    Purely-descriptive [cartography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography) (or [surveying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying)) and purely-prescriptive [urban planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning) (or [transportation planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_planning)) are totally-separate areas. Does the purely-descriptive "linguistics" that you describe have a purely-prescriptive counterpart? Or are you proposing that such a counterpart should be separated from the current umbrella term of "linguistics", and should receive its own, new name?

      I am proposing a purely-prescriptive counterpart, which does not seem to exist and I do not have a name for. It should probably have its own name. I think there's an agency in France which makes decisions about the language but I don't know how that's put into effect and it's my understanding that they're historical prescriptivists. It should be separate in the same way that cartography and urban planning are separate.

        - u/SevereCircle:
          ```
          Yes, but I don't think prescriptive linguistics should be limited to that. It should also include resisting or promoting changes in "natural" languages.

          I'm not sure how it should be implemented. There might not be a practical way to do it. It would certainly be silly to punish people with jail or large fines for breaking grammatical / spelling rules in print, and it would be financially impractical to charge them trivial fines because the necessary bureaucracy would cost more than the amount the fines bring in.

          I guess I'm saying that it would be a good thing if everyone just agreed to not always be indifferent to all changes in language and to decide based on reasonable criteria whether to support new changes with their own usage.
          ```

          - u/rhaps0dy4:
            ```
            In Spain, the RAE (Real Academia Española) is the state authority that defines language. They currently take only a descriptivist role, although with some time lag from when new usages enter the language. 

            People mock/laugh about changes that make the language easier. There is a culture of disdaining people who break official "Language rules". There is also a relatively recent history of imprisoning people for speaking regional languages. But now that those regional languages are institutionalized, they have their own correctness zealots.

            My point is that  teaching new rules in schools and instilling a culture of "speaking properly" is probably enough.

    - u/SevereCircle:
      ```
      I'd rather eat the ingredients of a salad than mix them up first.
      I like most fruit and some vegetables.
      It's mostly the heterogeneous property that I dislike.
      I don't mind things like cookies or goldfish which are mixed up enough that they seem homogeneous to the human tongue even though botanically / chemically they aren't.

      I've never really tried milkshakes. I did try Soylent once but I didn't like the taste. They might have worked on the flavor since then. I haven't kept track. I like the idea of Soylent, eating/drinking it to ensure I have enough of everything and eating other foods only for pleasure (within dietary reason).

      I don't currently object to milk or eggs but I'm not aware of the conditions of cows raised for milk or chickens raised for eggs so maybe I shouldn't be as optimistic about how humane their conditions are as I am.

        Ok, that's some good information. I guess another important variable is how much you're willing to cook for yourself, which helps a lot with this sort of thing. One strat that I have found well (though it seems not to work for you) is counting calories. If you can bring yourself to do it, it makes you much more aware of how much you eat in a day, and causes some calorie-optimization even if you don't set goals for yourself.

        One strategy is to identify times when you eat high-calorie-count food that doesn't satiate very well. Examples of this are things like potato chips or soda. These items don't satisfy or fill you up significantly (though they are quite fun to eat) which means they make bad snacks if you're hungry. There are a lot of healthy snacks you can use to replace these. In terms of stuff that is not soft and homogenous, snack items that I eat in place of these tend to be things like:

        * Bags of shaved carrots / baby carrots [(image)](http://i.imgur.com/DNxvJrz.png). Advantages: no prep time, crunchy, low calories. Disadvantages: refrigeration needed if you want to store long term, not salty, not very sweet
        * Pacific Gold snack pack beef jerky [(image)](http://i.imgur.com/0h6EAUj.png). Advantages: no prep time, salty, low(ish) calories, filling. Disadvantages: is meat, not sweet, quite chewy
        * Pure Protein brand protein bars [(image)](http://i.imgur.com/ShUIPk2.png). Advantages: very dense/filling, sweet, kinda sorta like a chocolate bar or something if you squint. Disadvantages: not as homogenous, very very dense so it needs water, not actually like a chocolate bar, even if you do squint.

        In general, the best strat for healthy eating is to have planned or ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook meals. Some ingredients that are useful to keep around: chicken breasts (frozen or refrigerated), rice or instant rice, and a variety of veggies edible cooked (such as broccoli, carrots, asparagus, etc). An example meal that is relatively easy to make, would be a chicken breast (baked, pan-seared, or cooked sous vide) accompanied by some veggies browned in a pan, like handful or two of broccoli or something, and rice. 

        The real next-level strat is to cook your weekday chicken on Sunday, then put it into tupperware containers. Each weekday for dinner, you put some rice in the rice cooker (though you can also cook it on Sunday if you want), heat up your vegetable choice in a pan, and microwave the chicken to reheat it. If you also pre-cooked your rice, you can have dinner ready to go in like 5-10 minutes by microwaving the rice and chicken to reheat them, while sauteeing the broccoli. We call this the "meal prep Sunday" strat and it is widely used by people who are trying to gain muscle or lose fat or both. By measuring out your dinners you can get exactly what you want calorically while still having filling foot. 

        If you don't eat breakfast, you should eat breakfast. Being overhungry at lunch and overeating is a problem that can be avoided this way. Also, some say that your metabolism only gets started buring calories after your first meal or exercise in a day. What I do for breakfast is have some boiled eggs ready to go, and have two of those with a piece of toast and either some cherry tomatoes or a baby cucumber. All this food can be eaten with hands if you have a napkin and is quick and filling. Two boiled eggs, a piece of toast, and a couple vegetables will be filling and good.

        I personally also pack all my lunches and choose all my snacks carefully. I make sure the items available to me are filling for their calorie content, even if they're not necessary healthy, like the protein bars. This way, if I get hungry around 4 pm or something, I can have one of those. Lastly, I typically have a shake after my workout, made with protein powder, milk, yogurt, and banana. These things are smaller calorie consumptions but worht mentioning. 

        So in general, I'd say your main goal should be to make it so that your food at hand is highly satiating for its calorie level. Things like preparing meals ahead of time will make it so that the easy choice is the healthy choice, too. In terms of separating food types, your best bet is the "seperately cooked chicken breast, rice, and broccoli" strat. You can sub in carrots or zucchini (though that's a little watery) asparagus or something for the broccs too. This way, the three items on your plate are cooked separately and are distinct.

        An ideal day in meals for me, then, that you would also be able to use:

        * Breakfast: 2 boiled eggs, a piece of toasted bread, and a handful of cherry tomatoes - 300 kcal

        * Lunch: 1 chicken breast, a half-cup of rice, and broccoli - 700 kcal

        * Snack: 1 protein bar - 200 kcal

        * Dinner: 1 chicken breast, a half-cup of rice, and sauteed vetables - 700 kcal

        * Post-workout: Shake containing 1 banana (frozen), 0.5 cups of greek yogurt, 30g of protein powder, 10z of fat free milk - 400 kcal

        * * I use AMP Wheybolic extreme protein powder, but any protein powder that's like, just the powder without a bunch of sugar and crap is good. GNC is good. Avoid Muscle Milk, it has sugar and stuff in it. You're looking for a powder where a 30 gram scoop gives you 1-2 grams each of carbs and fat, and 22-25 grams of protein. 

        This comes out to about 2300 kcal/day, pretty close to recommended daily value for calore intake. Things I vary on a day-to-day basis so that I don't get too bored of the food include the protein source (sometimes I use fish like tilapia, for example), the vetgetables (broccoli, zucchini, carrots, asian broccoli, bok choi, etc all make apearances) and the rice (sometimes I use brown rice, sometimes potatoes, sometimes quinoa. 

        The toughest part is having all this stuff on hand and being displined about planning out my week on Sunday. Assuming I actually do so and put everything in the tupperware, it's relatively easy to follow through.

        I recently started eating Soylent (v1.8 powder), and adding things makes a *huge* difference.  

        My original strategy (of mixing it then drinking some) tasted about like grainy pancake batter.  My current strategy (mix 3 tbsp cocoa and 6 tbsp strawberry margarita syrup into a 2 l batch, and let it sit in the fridge for two hours first) is much better, and tastes like an okay milkshake.

        Impactful quote:

        > if everyone simply removed seafood, chicken, and eggs from their diet, 99.7% of the total number of animals killed for food each year would be spared. Of course, this would also mean that the remaining 0.3%—403 million animals—would still be killed each year for food. However, the point remains: when looking purely at the number of animals killed, the most impactful single change that omnivores could make would be to remove seafood from their diet, followed by removing chicken meat, followed by removing eggs.

    As I understand it, you think the state of affairs is roughly: "we (society) have ownership of the language - we are responsible for it's maintenance, and with effort can make it better (or worse)."

    This is probably the most common American understanding of language... I think the quote is "Stop trying to make 'fetch' happen. [we don't want it, and this works a bit like a democracy] It is not going to happen.".

    It's interesting that I have a completely different perspective to you. I've never seen the "(most) descriptivists" that you describe. Instead, all the people I know that have a position on the issue are either complete historical prescriptivists or are in my opinion true descriptivists (ie. "I don't care about how the language changes, I just want dictionaries to say how people actually use the words instead of historical definitions"). 

    I think the issue comes in when the method - usually dictionaries - that prescriptivists want to use to control the language is the tool that descriptivists want to use to describe the language. So what you perceive as caring about "artificial" changes, I see as wanting to accurately describe what the language is.

      A simple example is consistent rules for spelling and pronunciation.

      Inflammable and flammable mean the same thing.

      Ambiguity between inclusive and exclusive or.

      The whole "literally" argument. I accept that it has been used figuratively for centuries but it annoys me that I might have to use the phrase "literally literally" someday to avoid ambiguity and that the phrase "literally literally" can still technically be taken figuratively if figurative usage of the word literally is also one of its definitions. Similarly, the phrase "a million" is also often used figuratively but that doesn't mean that "a large amount" is a definition. The definition is 10^6 (or if you like Peano axioms, the successor to 999,999), and that definition can be applied either literally or figuratively.

      It occasionally comes up that there are no [escape sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequence) in english. You can't verbally say the following sentence without it meaning that you intend it seriously: "I am 100% serious that I am not joking and that I intend to murder the king of france regardless of my tone of voice or the context in which I say this sentence or what I have said or done before speaking this sentence or what I intend to say or do after it or what I actually say or do after it and regardless of whether I am quoting someone else who said this sentence before me."

      That's a silly example but there are examples of where escape sequences would make a sentence more clear without making it overly convoluted. I just don't remember them right now.

      This is nitpicky, but last time I checked, the dictionary still defines a paradox as (roughly) "something inherently self-contradictory or something that seems like a paradox" which means by recursion that anything that has any nonzero similarity to a paradox is a paradox, which is silly.
      ```

      - u/rhaps0dy4:
        ```
        I agree it needs rules for spelling and pronunciation, and {in,}flammable meaning the same is weird, and some other word should be found for "literally".

        However, aren't we good enough at disambiguating whether "a million" is literal or figurative? Metaphors are essential communication tools too.

        Also, I don't understand how you would use escape sequences. Where would you put them in that long phrase?
        ```

    - u/SevereCircle:

      Another example is the rules for punctuation in quoting.

      Alice: What did Joe say, Bob?

      Bob: He said "I am here?"

      Two possibilities: Joe declared "I am here." and Bob asked whether that was what he said, or Joe asked the question "I am here?" and Bob declared that that was what Joe said.

      Also there should just be a clearly separate open quote and close quote symbol so you don't have to have silly alternation of single and double quotes for increasingly nested quotations.
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:

        >Also there should just be a clearly separate open quote and close quote symbol 

        Don't we? I know straight quotes (" ') tend to be more common on the internet and simple text editors, but every feature complete word processor I've ever used has had curly quotes (“ ” ‘ ’) inserted automatically. Alternating open and close symbols help make things more clear, but isn't technically necessary, in the same way that there's the sometimes-used convention of alternating parentheses () and brackets [] for very long mathematical equations.

        - u/SevereCircle:

          I guess, I just find it silly to need to alternate for only two levels of quotation. You wouldn't write f(3[4+6]).

            You don't, strictly speaking *need* to, in the sense that people will still understand you if you don't, but it just makes things easier to parse.

        > clearly separate open quote and close quote symbol
        Agreed.

        > Alice: What did Joe say, Bob?

        >Bob: He said "I am here?"

        > Two possibilities: Joe declared "I am here." and Bob asked whether that was what he said, or Joe asked the question "I am here?" and Bob declared that that was what Joe said

        It took me a while to understand how the first possibility could come to be. You should phrase that better, something like, \`Joe declared \`I am here.' and Bob asked Alice (I was putting `Joe' here) whether that was what he said'.

        However in this case I thought the punctuation rules were already clear. That is,

        >Bob: He said "I am here?"

        Vs

        >Bob: He said "I am here" ?

        Ah but to be totally consistent, the first one should be:

        >Bob: He said "I am here?".

      I'm not very mindful of quantitative data on what I eat so I'll just give a vague overview of what's common.

      I eat way too much candy but I already know that's bad.
      I eat frozen apple cider sometimes (I highly recommend it in moderation).
      A chicken breast is a common most-of-a-meal.
      Three peanut butter crackers are a common substitute for meat.
      For some reason I always eat them in threes.
      Waffles are not uncommon for breakfast.
      I've been eating a lot of grapes and strawberries over the past few months.
      I probably average about three apples a day and a small potato a day.
      A couple times a week I'll get McDonalds fries.
      I've been trying to get myself to eat more vegetables but in any given moment that I want something crunchy I'd rather have dry-crunchy crackers than wet-crunchy vegetables so I end up eating more crackers, goldfish or premium.
      Now and then I'll have salmon, which I like a lot but it's a bit expensive.

      That's about as accurate an overview as I can give right now.

        I have VERY limited training in this area (done, like, one and a half semesters of a 3 year nutrition degree), but what you describe sounds like food aversion, which is a psychological problem and should ideally be changed by fixing your aversion than by planning your diet around it. In an ideal world, I would recommend you see a psychologist to help you deal with it.

        In a quick and dirty world where psychologists are expensive, here's some ways you can try and deal with your food aversions:

        - Eat the unfamiliar food in familiar settings: so, don't get hummus at a restaurant, but perhaps put a little bit on a peanut butter cracker that you might have at dinner, keeping the rest of the meal identical.

        - Use anxiety-reduction techniques to deal with the anxiety you have about your "problem" foods. For example, you say you can't even look at fetta. Exposure and response prevention: start with looking at a picture of fetta, then looking at fetta, then touching it with the tip of your finger, then holding it, then touching it with your tongue (like you're licking a popsicle), then put it in your mouth but don't chew or swallow, etc. Work your way up.

        If you want to see how many vitamins/etc you're getting, this site is very good for analysing food logs: https://cronometer.com/

            ```
            Honestly, a food aversion can be very limiting and last for decades. It will impact your health if you are not able to eat a balanced diet because of it, and impact you socially if you aren't able to go out because you're too worried about being able to find something to eat. I'd definitely look into ways you can overcome your aversion.

  I've lately been thinking about the intersection of diet/exercise and [the Fermi paradox](https://www.seti.org/seti-institute/project/details/fermi-paradox).

  To my way of thinking, the obesity epidemic is mostly caused by market forces finding the chinks in the dietary reward systems of the human body. Part of it is calorie/satiation mismatching, part of it is hedonism, part of it is things being made less healthy in order to get them cheaper, but the end result is a lot of people having to devote considerable effort and willpower to staying healthy.

  So I was thinking about how an intelligent alien species might succumb to worse versions of that in different ways, essentially getting to a certain stage of scientific/industrial development and then filtering themselves out because they hijack their own drives. This wouldn't necessarily be to the level of extinction, just to the level of not making it very far into space.

  (This domain overlaps a bit with wireheading and drug addiction, but the latter isn't a threat to civilization and the former doesn't seem like it would be either - but then again, humans aren't much of a space-faring race.)

    One of the interesting questions here is: what do we mean by "making it very far into space"?  Von Neumann probes?

  Progress continues.  Most of the discussion this past week has been concerned with the exact boundaries around the modding of the game.  What parts do we expose, what parts do we prohibit?  In the end, we came up with three major possible areas that a user might try to mod, with different levels of support:

  * **Content Modding**.  This is adding new pokemon, items, stats, types, dialog, NPCs, anything that can reasonably be held in a JSON text file or multimedia file.  Due to the nature of the game, I suspect (and hope) that this will be the vast majority of modding effort.  Interpretation is rigid: if your text file is malformed, it simply won’t be loaded until you fix it.  Wonky custom objects might destroy the *balance* of the game, but not it’s *stability*.

  * **System Modding**.  This is actually where the majority of the code that *we* are working on is going to go.  Some systems will have their innards entirely in non-changeable code, but others (such as the society simulator) will have nearly all of their code in scripts that the ambitious modder can modify.  Being as this system is designed first and foremost for us, it will be flexible and power, but with great power comes great amounts of rope to hang yourself on: code that is written in scripts will be compiled and verified, but if you do something stupid you could very well bring the game down with you.  

  * **Core Modding**.  This term is borrowed from Minecraft, and is a catch-all term indicating any sort of player modding that changes *.dll’s or other code that we have determined Should Not Be Touched.  We absolutely will not support such modding (after all, who does?) and anything that modders do in this realm will be on their own heads. 


  ----

  I read a [very interesting series of blog posts here](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=28081) that detailed one man’s thoughts on the highs and lows of each Elder Scrolls game, from Arena to Skyrim.  I learned quite a bit, and found the insight fascinating.

  In particular, there was one quote that stood out for me in relation to this project:

  >The game that sat back and watched while a crab effortlessly murdered me at level 1 was happy to watch while I meted out the same treatment to its final boss. You gotta respect that.

  >Morrowind was the first Elder Scrolls game to give the player this feeling of constant, objective progress.

  >It was also the last.

  This sense of brutal fairness, of letting the player be slaughtered and in turn letting the player slaughter based on abuse of the same systematic mechanics, is very much the kind of thing I’m aiming for.

  Discussion about TES had me thinking in particular of that four-letter-word *level scaling*.  If you’re not familiar, Oblivion and Skyrim are well-known for introducing a feature (or a bug depending on your point of view) where you can go practically anywhere because the monsters level up with you.  If you’re level 10 you fight level 10 baddies, if you’re level 100 you fight level 100, regardless of where you are.  This certainly allows freedom of movement, but it can also sabotage feelings of progression if done poorly.  After all, if you go through the early game sections again, you’ll find that the rats have scaled with you and still take 2-3 hits, in spite of the fact that you’re wielding weapons used to slay gods and demons.

  Nonetheless the feature exists because of a very real problem: if hideously overleveled creatures wander the countryside, there is eventually a point where you come across a creature so powerful that you don’t even have a chance to run: you just get one-shot, and really, where’s the fun in that?  It might be forgivable in a game like Dark Souls, but in a game like this that aims to include permadeath?  Not so much.

  And so we imagined the red-headed stepchild of level scaling, which for now I’m referring to as *tiered difficulty*.  If you come across a creature that is hideously strong and able to put you and your entire team in a crater just by blinking, then it stands to reason that you are an ant and it won’t even care about you in the slightest.  


  What this means from a mechanical perspective is that creatures will respond proportionally to you as a threat: if you just walk by them, you won’t get hit by a Hyper Beam that deals 999,999 damage to you and the entire countryside in a four mile radius, but they *might* lazily swing their tail that deals 99 damage and puts the fear of Arceus into you.  The moment you start to challenge this preconception of weakness, however (probably by hitting back), the kid gloves come off and you’d better be prepared.  

  This concept I think manages to marry the mechanics of permadeath and brutal fairness, without turning the game into Save Scumming Simulator 5000 or reducing the feeling of progress.  You still have to step lightly around that mountain of an Onix, but later you very well might be able to come back and show it who’s boss.  

  ----


  Oh, and we also came to the conclusion over the last couple of weeks that we probably *can* include aging, so long as we permit maximum lifespan to be a function of EV total: if you’re training a lot, your creature’s lifespan increases to fit.  We had wanted to include the concept, but felt it would be entirely unfun to have your 30-year-old top-tier Rattata fall over dead of old age, and this lets us have our cake and eat it, too.

  Plus, Legendaries have been redefined to simply be creatures who have min-maxed the *shit* out of this mechanic.  


  Related to this is the problem of including systematic time-skips, but I’ll leave that for next week.  This post has gotten long enough as it is.

    To go a bit more in-depth about Legendaries (since we talked a *lot* about them), we've decided on a few important details.

    First, the Legendaries that you are familiar with belong to species of the same name.  Moltres is a member of the Moltres species, and theoretically there are baby Moltres out there.  A legendary species isn't inherently more powerful than other, normal Pokemon (though they will tend to have high base stats), they simply have a much easier time of extending their age by being strong, so many more of them proportionally become effectively biologically immortal.

    Second, being captial-L Legendary is *only* a matter of how strong you are.  The aforementioned legendary species are uniquely predisposed towards reaching this level, because they can become effectively biologically immortal and as long as they don't get murdered then given enough time they'll become strong enough to develop special powers.  The Stormbirds of Kanto, for instance, have massive AoE storms that make even approaching them difficult for all but the most powerful trainers.  A baby Moltres won't have any form of Storm at all, even a weak one, but as Moltres (or a Pokemon like Moltres) grows strong enough to become captial-L Legendary, they start to develop a Storm.  This *also* means that any ordinary Pokemon can, under the right circumstances, become Legendary.  A Machamp that trains ruthlessly for a thousand years might not only throw off the shackles of age entirely but also develop some special, incredibly powerful talent like the Stormbirds, becoming a Legendary in its own right.

    Lastly, for each (or maybe most, we're undecided) legendary species, there is one member of the species Arceus personally created at the start of the world as capital-L Legendaries.  These are the Originals of their kinds, inherently the oldest and strongest.  The Stormbirds of Kanto, for example, are the Original birds and have lived since the beginning of the world.  Chances are any other Zapdos you find won't come close to as strong as the Original Zapdos, even if they're capital-L Legendary and have their own Storms.  In some cases, though, the Original might not have survived all this time.  Shaymin, for instance, is a legendary species noted in canon to have many members, so we might represent that by saying that long ago the Original Shaymin was defeated and killed, and now all that's left is the Shaymin species (which may hold specimens that became biologically immortal and capital-L Legendary over the centuries anyways).

    I know nothing about pokemon but I'm a big fan of Morrowind. I really like the idea of monsters too strong for you not bothering to attack you unless you provoke them (which you might not even be strong enough to do if you're really an ant to them). It does raise the issue of letting people wander around high level areas at low levels because the high level creatures ignore them, but that could be fine as long as it's designed for it.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      There will have to be a bit of nuance to it. For instance, some species being obviously more aggressive than others, so that if you really do try and go through a high level area at the very beginning, eventually your luck will run out and you'll find one that won't leave you alone, even if it's just playing cat and mouse. 

      On top of that, I'm hoping for a good mix of creature levels, so even if half of the creatures are God tier in a high level area, there's still a good number of creatures that are only *twice* as strong as you, who might view you more as a cockroach to be squashed. 

      I'm also hoping to be able to train players at the beginning to take it slow, take things seriously, and don't treat this like a JRPG. I just want there to be wiggle room in the event that they ignore me, but not *too* much. 

      There's a lot of levers to pull to make this feasible, is I guess what I'm trying to say.

        That sounds fine. Presumably, these areas will be demarcated by signs laid out by helpful people who want to inform passers-by about the danger. 

        Also, have you heard of NEO Scavenger? I can't remember if you've already mentioned something like this, but one of the things that I like about the game is that the NPCs will interact with each other. More than once, I have watched somebody duke it out with a pack of feral dogs or something so that I could go in afterwards and loot their corpse. 

        I'm not sure how much corpse-looting will be a thing in this game, but I'm sure that there'd be some other way to take advantage of NPC-on-NPC interactions (the one that comes to mind is waiting until a battle in order to ambush the winner, whose pogheys will have been weakened by the previous fight).

          Right. Signs and also indications on the pokedex map giving a danger rating as decided by the Rangers. 

          As for Neo Scavenger, it sounds vaguely familiar, but I've been really bad lately about trying recommendations. I don't know that there will be the standard "every goon has some kind of usable loot" trope, but where it makes sense it makes sense. Dead or incapacitated trainers? Sure. Dead or incapacitated Pokémon? I imagine those will need to be taken (via pokeball) to skilled pokebutchers, unless you learn that skill yourself. But outside of those situations, I don't think you can loot a lump on the screen and get $200, a broken pokeball, and a pelt. 

          I definitely am 100% behind NPC interaction. A huge amount of effort will go into making those sorts of things systematic, so that in reality the player will (hopefully) just be one of the NPCs in a standard NPC-NPC interaction, if that makes sense.

            Oh sure. That wasn't what I was interested in. I was just using it as the first example that came to mind of a game with NPC/NPC interactions that you could take advantage of. 

            (If you like post-apoc/survival sims then you'll probably like NEO Scavenger. It's the first game where I've killed somebody literally just to get his shoes or his shirt and where the packs of dogs were sometimes less of a threat than dying of hypothermia)

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      >The hardest thing to pull off will be level generation

      heh, actually, I think the information system we have planned will be the hardest: we want information (usually related to the player's exploits, but can come from other sources as well) to spread naturally.  If there's no witnesses, then no one knows you did something...but if someone sees you and tells their friend, or their Team Rocket bosses, or the media, or the police, then information begins to spread at a pace proportional to the importance of the act.  You might have a reputation in one town that is completely different in another, because you acted like an asshole in the first and a saint in the second.  Simulating "society" as a sort of meta-NPC is what I anticipate being the hardest thing to get right, partially because I don't have a good game to ape off of, so it's all going to be mostly-uncharted territory, but also because it's just going to plain be fiendishly technically complicated.

      But to address your actual point: the worlds are only going to be partially procedurally generated.  The current plan is to have a mapmaking application that permits mapmakers to paint the broad strokes of how they want the map to look like, and mark which areas they want the world gen to handle.  Thus, someone might lay out Kanto the way it is in the games, going as far as maybe designing the towns down to the building, but when they get to Veridian Forest, maybe they lay down a road and mark the rest as "procgen Forest".  Maps will therefore have the important setpieces designed by human hands, and only let procgen do its thing on areas that don't have to be as structured.

      I want the terrain procgen to be powerful enough that someone could say "I just need a road that somehow connects these points" and the rest be filled in with wilderness of the appropriate type, but other than that, I prefer to let humans do what humans do well, and let the computer do what the computer does well.  Plus I like where this allows experienced players to have a general familiarity with the map, while still needing to stay on their toes for the mostly-novel wilderness.

  Had a discussion with one of my friends; he tried to convince me that people only change when exposed to things so they can see and learn for themselves that their current beliefs are incorrect. For example, a racist would only change his beliefs by being exposed to and interacting with a black person. I pointed out that there are plenty of people that interact with black/asian/gay/trans/liberal/conservative people all of the time and still discriminate against them to some degree. We didn't stick on that topic long; the main thrust of the conversation was him arguing that discussion is pointless; he won't talk with someone who's "set in their ways" about said ways because he feel discussion won't change their mind. I told him this rationalization was bullshit; even supposing that most people are that ignorant and pig headed (which they could be, I don't exactly have the numbers), there will still be a nonzero amount of people whose minds are open to being changed by discussion. And the root cause of most bigotry is ignorance and thus we need to work to counteract ignorance as best we can, i.e through discussion. Even if someone's mind isn't changed by one discussion (which it usually won't be, particularly for long held beliefs/values), your discussion can be a part of their evolution as a person. 

  The argument went back and forth in circles of varying size. He eventually settled on agreeing that some people can probably be changed by discussion but he's still going to hedge his bets and avoid discussing those topics with those "set in their ways" types of people because the probabilty of him changing their minds is really low. I conceded that it was his choice and our discussion went on in a similar, though less confrontational, vein.

  I'm honestly not too sure why I posted this; I supposed just to sort of mini-vent. I guess, for the sake of it, I'll also ask you guys: how important do you think discussion is, particularly to helping to cure bigotry and discrimination and general ignorance? I think it's vital. And that it should be immediately obvious that it's vital.

    I often hear this opinion, and I disagree. It's not that simple. My father works in construction, so he spends most of his time working with immigrants, legal or not. He knows more about the history and culture of Maghreb and Middle-Eastern people than anyone I know. He actually knows the differences between Sunni and Shia Islam (while I usually have to look them up on wikipedia).

    He's also one of the most prejudiced people I personally know. Some of his prejudice can be attributed to irrational emotion (the whole "the economy is wrong, someone must be to blame" dynamic); some of it to what I see as legitimate causes, like the fact that he personally sees and is complicit in the abusing by immigrants of the French social system (most of his employees will only work undeclared, because doing so allows them to get both a tax-free salary and unemployment subsidies).

    My point is, there isn't a single information I or anyone I know has that my father doesn't, and yet he strongly dislikes arabs. Maybe most of bigotry is caused by ignorance, and he's an exception. But I suspect for most people, the pattern is the same: it's not as simple as a lack of information, it's a different outlook. People can have the same information, but different priors; we're more likely to see the things we already believe, to discard the medias that disagree as biased, etc.
