## [RT][WIP] Gobbos with Guns

### Post:

So, after receiving critique on my previous story, *The Vasra Journals*.  I thought I might try something different (haha! No you didn't, you just read over the first four chapters and thought it needed a rewrite but you're too lazy to do a rewrite, so instead you wanted to make something new and avoid your masochistic wish fulfillment! Got you villain! /3rd person).

&#x200B;

\[So I decided to try something else and apply the criticism I receivedâ€”Honestly, thanks for that guys\]([https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20385/gobbos-with-guns/chapter/288148/fray-11](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20385/gobbos-with-guns/chapter/288148/fray-11))

So far there's only four chapters, and I love criticism, it's what I live for. (That and french toast)

May Papa Nurgle bless us with his holy contagion

  I like it so far! Though I would recommend injecting some enpathy into your main character. I think a pure psychopathic character might get boring, sooner or later.

    it's actually written in my notes

  This is quite an interesting start. It makes a lot of sense that there'll be a total lack of compassion if he's been raised in a gobbo village. I second the suggestion for having him grow somewhat out of his upbringing somewhere down the line.   
  I also hope he gets to learn magic.
