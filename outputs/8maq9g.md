## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You know a Word of Power.

  When you say or write this word, a man will appear somewhere within a mile of you and do his best to track and kill you, along with everyone else in your general vicinity, especially if they stand in his way. He has a number of powers, notably incredible strength, durability, and speed. If shot, he will growl in pain and bleed, but show little in the way of other effects. You can stall him, but not stop him for long, and he will gain more powers the more difficult you make things. If you hide in an impenetrable vault (for example), he will gain the ability to teleport in whenever or wherever you aren't looking. He has no known weaknesses.

  You can transmit this Word of Power without "saying" or "writing" it, so long as you're sufficiently circumspect in how you do it. The two keys appear to be obfuscation of the word, and delay of the full message; if you want someone else to know the Word, you would want to do something like using a cipher and sending only a single ciphered letter a day, with the full, ciphered word never spoken or appearing on paper.

  As a catch, if you transmit this Word to someone else and *they* say or write it, the man will go after you once he's done with them. This applies no matter how long the chain of transmission is.

  What purposes can you use this power for? How do you get around its limitations?

    What counts as killing me? If he can easily access a lever that turns off my artifical heart, will he use it and puff away, allowing an associate to turn it back on?

    What happens if multiple people say the word? Will he kill all of them before killing me?

    What if a device has a loudspeaker say the word? Will he destroy it before coming after me? Can I have him run around in circles pulling power cords from speaker systems as people plug them back in when he goes after the others?

    What happens if people use the word after I am dead?

    Hide in an impenetrable vault which has a door whose gatekeeper lets him in if he enchants an item with the ability to, say, bring back the dead. What powers would he get first? Teleporting past the gate, charming the gatekeeper, enchanting the item, Death-Noting me, ending reality, replacing the code on the nearest computer with that bitstring which maximizes my death probability?
    ```

    - u/RustyRhea:
      ```
      The man won't do any intellectual labor, nor will he be circumspect in how he approaches the task of killing you. His methods will overwhelmingly tend towards the extremely violent, regardless of whether there's an easier way to do things.

      If multiple people say the word, he will kill them in reverse order of when they said it, and he'll always start at the bottom of the "tree" of transmission, working his way up.

      The man won't destroy a loudspeaker saying the word, nor paper that the word is written on, only the person who set the loudspeaker playing or who wrote the word. (This does open the possibility that post-death, someone will stumble upon the word by hearing it looped on a loudspeaker, or scrawled on paper.)

      If people use the word after you're dead, you're in the clear, but if the person who transmitted the word to you is still alive, he'll go after them once he's killed the person who said it.

      If faced with a gatekeeper, he'll kill the gatekeeper, then attempt to use brute force to get past the door, increasing in strength and ferocity as time passes until his fingernails gouge steel and his punches crumple titanium. If this goes on for too long (more than ten minutes), he'll develop some other power rather than continuing to ramp up in strength and tenacity.
      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        What if a parrot says it?

        If I kill myself while he's going after me, does he stop his rampage? If I get defibrillated back to life afterwards, am I in the clear?

        If someone else says it while he's going after someone, does he switch targets?

        [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) is information-theoretically secure. If I generate a random key of the word's length, bitwise XOR them, and then send the result, does he come after me? If I generate the result but only send the *key*, does he come after me?

        If both are fine, then: What if I send them to different people? Else: What if I delete one before sending the other, rendering the other indistinguishable from a random value?

        If a quantum computer is in a superposition of containing a representation of the word and not containing a representation of the word, does he collapse the superposition into one of those states by coming after the operator/programmer wherever it does? That would amusingly produce an anomaly whenever anyone sends a quantum computer into a superposition over all words of sufficient length.

        If he appears *across* all quantum states *without* collapsing the superposition, this is a magic hack around the no cloning theorem and I don't even know how far up this pumps the power of quantum computers.

        If he goes after that person which leaked information about his name to a loudspeaker according to a convient metric, there may be a quantum algorithm that finds anomalies which can trick him into targeting himself. Note that an elegant way around this would be that encodings of "Quantum algorithm that finds anomalies" happens to be the set of words that summon him.

        What happens if I say the word multiple times while the juggernaut is already summoned?  Do I get multiple juggernauts?

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    ...as far as I can see, this is a Word that, the moment it is spoken or written, it causes a juggernaut to come and kill me. Why would I ever want to speak this Word at all?

      That's the challenge - to turn this into something useful.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Okay, so...basically, any use of the Word also leads to my own death. So, whatever I use it for, if I use it for anything, it needs to be more useful than the entire rest of my own life.

        I guess, if I'm trapped in a very small space with other people, I can rescue the other people by saying my Word and letting the juggernaut smash a path out for the others - but it's not something I'd plan for, because I'd far rather plan not to end up locked in a small space with several other people in the first place.
        ```

        - u/pixelz:

          It's possible that you could make the juggernaut speak the word of power - e.g., make that the easiest way of progressing toward you - so that the juggernaut is destroyed/delayed by another juggernaut.  You could capture some of the energy expended by the battling pair and use it to some good end - e.g., extract CO2 from the atmosphere.  Your sacrifice is less if you are terminally ill and/or can upload before your meatspace body is killed.

            Doubtful. It's clear that the Juggernaut's methods for finding me are unsubtle, brute force. It'll smash through a door or teleport, not say the password no matter how clearly it's described (and it can't be written down, not without sending the Juggernaut after me early).

            > You could capture some of the energy expended by the battling pair and use it to some good end

            If it's energy I'm after, there are plenty of ways to capture that *without* killing myself in the process. I'd rather just have a few more solar panels built than commit complicated suicide.

            Now, I'm not saying that there *aren't* things that are worth such a large sacrifice (especially if, as you point out, I'm terminally ill at the time). I just don't see how the use of this Word helps me in any such respect.

            I *could* always leave encrypted instructions from which the Word could be deduced in my will, along with some plan to give those instructions to people who are already terminally ill. In this manner (after my death) the Word can be used in a way that minimises the damage it causes. But it still *does* cause damage, and I'm still not seeing any possible advantage that could be worth it.

      I believe your interpretation is correct. Honestly, this feels like a phenomenon similar to the Atomic bomb. That is to say, the obvious sane response to discovery is to say "well *that's* an interesting facet of reality", put it in your back pocket on the off chance that it will somehow be necessary, and then **never touch it again.** I say this because the loss of human life seems inevitable, and reversal of that loss is unlikely.

  I was reading some erotica the other day and there was this intriguing device that I would like people here to munchkin. It's called the Normality App and any rule you type into it becomes a rule that everyone follows. Sexual abuse is obvious and the stories around it pretty much end up with the main character living in a hyper\-sexualized culture that revolves around some fetish or ideal body type. Assuming a moral individual gets the device instead, how can one use the app to improve society? What rules should be in place that best benefits humanity in a way that causes the development of a utopian society?

  Limitations on the app:

  * All rules are cultural, no rule can change any aspect of physics or biology. For example, 'Anyone over 6 feet get $5,000 a month' works, but 'Anyone over 6 feet can fly' or 'Anyone over 6 feet are extremely muscular' won't work.
  * The rules aren't retroactive. Nothing in the past will change.
  * No one will notice or realize that people are following new rules or no longer following certain rules.
  * The rules aren't iron\-clad. Most people will follow them, but just like murder is taboo, there exist people \(serial\-killers\) who can and will break the rules. The rule are meant to be taboo to break, but extreme personalities or circumstances can lead to people breaking them.
  * All rules are universal. The rules can't be directed at a specific individual. 'All redheads are to be treated with respect' works, but 'Samuel is god\-king' doesn't work. The rules can be specified to be about a specific group of people, but it must be a group that most people know of. So any common ethnicity is permitted, but some obscure cult or religion that few people have heard of wouldn't be allowed.

  Build a utopia!

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    We could start by eliminating many of the obviously stupid and counterproductive things people do which have no positive attributes. "People don't text or use the internet while driving" is an obvious behavior to eliminate with probably zero downsides.

    From there, I would start making incredibly minor changes one at a time and see what kinds of effects those have. "People are 1% more likely to seek independent confirmation of information not relating directly to their personal lives obtained from sources that aren't peer-reviewed scientific journals" seems fairly safe. If we ramp that up by even 10% without causing any major unforseen disasters, it probably shatters the hold of most propaganda efforts everywhere without doing things like shattering relationships through skepticism.

    Unless something else glaringly obvious comes up, I would set the book down after that. I can't think of anything else which might be safe enough to change.

      Be sure to leave exceptions for calling 911, though.

      More broadly - there're a lot of changes you could make that would usually be positives, and probably be positives on net, but would have significant downsides in some situations.  Fortunately, "it's normal to X" leaves the possibility of people making those exceptions on their own... but I'd still be cautious.

    A utopia sounds hard to design, but a set of cultural norms that ensures nuclear peace and alignment research outpacing AI research sounds easy and sufficient.

    Amusingly, social science may suddenly encounter an enigma on the order of the placebo effect and the Fermi paradox: Statistical evaluations done on data sets taken across time intervals that include May 27th, 2018 produce nonsensical results. Some crackpot serial killer out there may go so far as to entertain *hypotheses* on that.

  You have a key edge in labor management  - specifically, you have  personal charisma, a gift of persuasion and an algorithm that is really good at spotting people who are a: Talented, and b: About to find 70 hour weeks utterly untenable.

      Perhaps I am ignorant of the difficulties of running a business, but there are millions of businesses that are making profits off things other than pure investments. Whenever I hear about trying to get money in stories and munchkin scenarios, I hear either: Lottery, gambling or an economics focused plan \(such as investing in the stock market\). I feel like we're just not exploring the solution space in any great depth. YKK earns *billions* off selling zippers to companies who use them in their products.   
      There is negligibly low probability humans have explored all possible products to make or services to offer, and a single well exploited monopoly has far more potential than trying in a field that already has fierce competition. All the low hanging fruit is probably taken and any really good idea we can think of is likely to have been tried, but it seems a bit unenthusiastic to fall back on money \-\> investments.

        More importantly, near as I can tell, investment bankers are really, really fungible. Lot of research demonstrating that past performance is no predictor of future same.

          Even if this were true, they are not your investment bankers.  Your power is to attract unusually productive employees, investment bankers have some of the highest earnings per employee in existence.

          In addition, it is not actually true.  Highly productive investment bankers have a large number of high trust relationships with high net worth individuals, are highly informed about current global business trends, and have excellent bullshit filters.  These qualities are extremely rare, the ability to attract such people to your employ is a license to print money.

        ```
        I think someone with the power to attract unusually productive employees can succeed in any business, so it comes down to earnings per employee.

        Startups are risky and are going to ask bankers for money at some point, so even if you say 'unusually productive cancer researchers' or 'unusually productive longevity researchers', bankers are going to get a piece of the action at minimal risk.

  Here's one that generalizes to lots of mind control world domination scenarios. You have perfect mind control (though it can't make people do something they wouldn't be capable of through any amount of training, and you can't imbue knowledge) however you can only control 13,000 people at a time. In addition you can't simply control vastly more people by changing people's personalities permanently, because once you relinquish control of someone their mind reverts back to how it was prior to your control leaving them with vague memories of what they did under your control and no personality changes.        
  Your control can be exerted very quickly (if you already know what changes to make) on anyone you can see in person or through a live feed with less than a second of delay.

  So with this power how would you take control of the world? and perhaps the more difficult question is, how would you make massive changes to the world particularly its governments very quickly while keeping people from rebelling against your rule? After all you only control a tiny portion of the population and if you are making obvious rapid changes (which in this scenario you are making as many as you can get away with) to how governments and NGO's are structured people will be tipped off.

  Since there are important things in society other than formal power structures I also ask how you would change society as a whole as quickly as possible using this control? Since changing laws and controlling businesses can only accomplish so much.

    13 000 people? That's enough to cover the major decision makers in quite a few governments at once. Sure, not the rank and file clerks, but the people that tell the rank and file clerks what to do.

    The method is simple - I see a politician at some public event. I control him to (a) agree with my goals in practice, and (b) introduce me to the rest of the decision-makers. Of course, I start out by picking politicians who claim to agree with my goals in public, so it's harder to spot the change (and if they used to follow a different agenda in private, then that now becomes the false agenda).

    Now, I'm not making any changes to how any of these governments are structured - except in some cases to cut down on administrative bloat (and thus on the number of people I need to control). After all, it doesn't much matter who is in power or how long they're there - if one person is out of power, I release control and take control of their successor instead.

    Now I have control over the people who write the laws in several countries. Now I can get them to write whatever laws I want...
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    > So with this power how would you take control of the world?

    So we are to be completely and utterly evil? I can do that.

    Step 1: Get the nukes. Mind control the presidents of countries with nukes, get them to tour the facilities with nukes, with a series of cameras set up so you can get the live feed of all the people you need to mind control to launch all the nukes. (P.S. Can you mind control someone through a live feed of a live feed of a live feed? Otherwise this step is somewhat dangerous/difficult.)

    Step 2: Launch the nukes just about everywhere except where you are, drastically reducing the world population. Now you can control 13000 people out of X million people, rather than 13000 people out of 7 billion.

    Step 3: Continue reducing the world population until there are only 13000 people, and now you can mind control them all. You have now achieved total world domination, with no chance of rebellion whatsoever since no one has any free will but you.

    But since a nuclear wasteland probably isn't that ideal to live in, you need Step 0: Mind control a bunch of scientists to research technologies for you. Preferably complete the immortality/anti-aging research before starting nuclear war, so your reign can last for millenia.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      >So we are to be completely and utterly evil? I can do that.

      I mean you can make a pretty good utilitarian case for world domination if you can pull it off right. Since you can obviously prevent conflicts caused by governments, divert military spending into charity and change laws which cause undue suffering.

      I would also argue you're probably doomed to fail with your plans to reduce the population _that_ drastically via nuclear weapons, since fears of nuclear winter are no longer considered likely and many areas would get away relatively unscathed from a nuclear war except for some slightly higher cancer rates. There's be worse effects from the political effects of a war than the actual direct nukes themselves.          
      However wiping out nearly nearly the entire population might be relatively straightforward if you just unleashed a genetically engineered plague with only 13k people getting a vaccine. Though even then since you want to control everybody you'd have to deal with all isolated groups of people who would escape the plague beforehand which would probably require you have already succeeded with massive control over world governments.

  How can you munchkin in the world of Danmachi (aka, How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon)?

  For those unfamiliar with the universe...

  * There is the titular dungeon, which contains monsters and forms the basis of the economy.  ~80% of the GDP revolves around adventurers killing monsters for magic stones/items/materials.  The dungeon is sentient and replenishes monsters and materials automagically.
  * Humans (and other species) have stats and levels.  Each level (from level 0 to 7+) represents becoming roughly twice as strong in every stat (2x stronger, 2x faster, 2x more resilient, etc.).  Monsters follow these rules as well.  
  * Gaining 'stats' smooths out the transition between levels.  A fresh level 2 is maybe 1.3x a max-stat level 1, while a max-stat level 2 is a full 2x.    
  * Gaining levels can be done via killing monsters or (more slowly) training.  It follows the usual RPG trend of monsters weaker than you are worth less XP while monsters more powerful than you are worth much more.  Being in a group is safer but seemingly splits XP.    
  * Time to level so can take anywhere from 1.5 years to 5 years, with the record time being 1 year of obsessive killing (40+ hour weeks).  The super special protagonist smashes the record at 6 weeks by exclusively soloing things stronger than them.  Level distribution roughly follows the power law where 70%+ of the population with levels is level 1, 20% level 2, 5% level 3, ... to there being ~8 level 6s, and one level 7.  
  * Supermaterials exist in this universe.  Mithril, Adamantium, magic resistant, etc..  Stronger materials or materials with more exotic effects require defeating monsters deeper in the dungeon.  
  * Magic exists, and adventurers can get it, but it is poorly defined.  Similarly with potions, magic/enchanted items etc..
  * Magi-tech exists and puts the world at near-earth tech level.  Everything seems to run on the magic stones that adventurers gather from monsters.  Eg streetlights are replaced by magical stones set to emit light at night, stoves and fridges are powered by fire/ice magic, elevators are powered by arrays of stones...
  * The economy is exponential.  A regular meal costs about ~150 coins, a cheap room is 3k a month, the cheapest sword is 3k, and expensive swords are 50,000,000 (and still won't last you forever).  A healing potion is ~500 coins, while a double HP potion is 10k.  A normal adventurer (lvl 1) earns about 30k a month, while skilled non-dungeon labor is 300k a month, minimum wage is about ~30/hr.

  Traditional fanfic in this fandom tends to boil down to 'go into the dungeon and just kill things *better* duh', but that's not actually a strategy.  Everyone in universe is trying to do that.  Mundane methods of 'cheating' in a medieval world (eg invent firearms or the compound bow) fall apart when level 3s are able to swing swords at supersonic speeds.

  The clearest answer to me seems to be to find a way to 'punch up a weight class' so you're killing things that are easy for you, but register as a higher level.  However, I'm not sure how you could actually do that.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    For RPG worlds, the way of the munchkin is always analyze the XP system. What counts as a kill? Can you dig a bunch of spiked pit traps and get a constant flow of XP from monsters falling into them? If you lift up heavy blocks of stone with ropes and pulleys, then drop them on monsters to crush them, do you still get XP? If so, you can probably build a giant XP farm just by repeatedly pulling up the blocks of stone and then dropping them, all from safely outside the dungeon.

    What counts as a party? If there's people in the area do they automatically count as party members? Can you just stalk some high level people to get XP from the monsters they kill? Or do you have to engage the monster in some way? Can you pay some high level adventurer to just lug your body around and move your sword arms or bow arms to kill monsters with skills superior to your own? Since they never directly engage a monster, only indirectly by "puppet"ing you around, would you get the full XP? 

    Search for methods of mass destruction. Can you genetically/magically engineer a lethal virus that infects only monsters, and have it spread throughout the dungeon like a pandemic and get absolute tons of XP from that? Can you dig a tunnel from the dungeon to the ocean, and thus flood it with water and get tons of XP from all the monsters that drown? Can you blow poison gas into the dungeon until the monsters inside die? Carbon monoxide is really easy to create in large quantities. Can you set fire to forest levels of the dungeon and so burn tons of monsters alive?
    ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      Very insightful.  A lot of those run along the lines of what I was already thinking, but it highlights it much more directly than my own fuzzy notions.

      For specific points, the dungeon itself prevents a lot of the really interesting traps and terraforming (it is alive, and will reform and reclaim fixtures like that).  Combat participation is a requirement for XP split, and there's social norms against leaching from other groups (read: they'd probably kill you).  

      However, there's still a lot of room to explore around the edges of the XP system.  If I'm going to show-don't-tell those sort of experiments, then that's enough material for a medium sized story right there.  Thanks!  

      (As an aside, I hope I'm not on a watch list after googling "how to make large amounts of carbon monoxide")

        Unlikely, it's so easy that tons of people do it all the time **by accident** and end up poisoning themselves, often to death. So if anything, you *should* look up how to create carbon monoxide just so you know what actions to avoid.

          The exponential economy naturally impedes this.  A 30 year mortagage for a level 1 is a level 3's spending money.  Although, if that's enough to get you to level 2, maybe it's worth leveraging debt to do it.

          But it does open up powerleveling for different reasons.  The story has a typical light novel harem thing going on with the majority of the strongest characters being really attractive women (and most of the strongest guys also being super attractive).  If we posit that powerleveling (or patronage) is the most reliable way to get to high levels, that means there's some really interesting social implications there.  It's just a genre conceit that the main character's allies are all super attractive ladies, but if we take the book at face value totally seriously then it takes on new meaning.

          And interestingly, the cannon main character benefits from this as well, getting his life saved and items/training/exp like crazy purely because he's a harem-MC level of attractive.  I don't think it was intentional, but it's a strong theme running through the story I hadn't considered until now.

    1: Try to find a magic cure for ageing. The core limit on levels is that people die from old age, or, I suppose, realize they have so much money stashed for their next gear upgrade that they can live for the rest of their life in luxury without ever setting foot in the dungeon again. And if magic does not let you live forever, what is it for, exactly?

    2: Try to figure out what the *dungeon* wants. Its intelligent, so it has goals. The answer to this question is obviously kind of... vital. 

    3: the economic setup is daft, and thus exploitable as all hell. Go into the dungeon in a group big enough to take things one level up safely - the things they drops are worth ten times as much, so being in a party should increase your income dramatically. If you can take things down two levels up by bringing more people... - Key here, tough, is not having casualties, because that is of course unacceptable.

      I suppose I should have mentioned that a lot of the difficulty comes from the fact that the setting is already somewhat rational for a light novel, but the first post was already going overly long.

      1. There's already a solution to immortality, but it's not widely used because there is a real and verifiable heaven.  

      2.  A solid point and decent plan.  The dungeon desires the eradication of gods and sentient races.  Interestingly, some people still take it up on the offer for power and make up the major antagonists of the story, which closes it off for my purposes of fanfiction.  

      3. This is actually the standard.  The vast majority of people go in groups, and the most effective teams join grand expeditions although stay within +/-1 level. Damage resistance and AOE attacks make this problematic though, eg. the boss of the level 2 area could probably kill arbitrarily many level 1s, but is an achievable (but dangerous) foe for a large group of level 2s.

        That case, you set up an organization called "the long haul". 

        Entry requirement: "Willing to sign up for immortality" 

        Org Goal: Containment and exploitation of the dungeon. In that order. 

        Official motto: "The eternal watch".

        Unofficial Motto: "Dying is for quitters and fools" 
        . 
        Train a lot, research tactics and weapons a lot, fight the dungeon conservatively, pay very careful attention to troop morale and sanity. It helps here that you have a goal beyond profit - that is, making sure the dungeon never wins. 

        Give it a few centuries, and your assault teams ought to be invincible.

    > Mundane methods of 'cheating' in a medieval world (eg invent firearms or the compound bow) fall apart when level 3s are able to swing swords at supersonic speeds.

    Just a minute here. Sure, a level three swordsman can swing a sword at supersonic speeds, but surely a level three rifleman can leverage his improved physical stats as well (running faster, dodging better, aiming faster and carrying a much bigger weapon more easily)?

    (Besides, even if a rifle only gets me up to level two quickly, it at least *gets* me up to level two quickly).

      Well. There we have it.

      1. Use effective and efficient weapons, traps and techniques like guns, grenades, landmines, getting level-tutoring plus giving level-tutoring to get the low hanging XP fruits.

      2. As you become stronger, faster and have more dexterity, endurance, stamina and arguably become richer (to afford some low level minions, (read not-party-members, just some porters who carry your equipment for you) there will come a time where you could effectively haul larger anti-tank level weaponry and blockbusting grenades (dynamites) as easily as manhandling a sword at supersonic levels. As you level up, so should your XP Farming tactics and strategies. :)

      ...

      Alternatively. Just invest in plastic surgery or some magical alternative thereof. That's the best way for making your life easier.

    A core goal here should be to establish a system that controls access to the dungeon.  This allows you to charge tolls/taxes for access, but perhaps more importantly allows you to control who has the opportunity to gain access to XP (preferably your allies).

    As a secondary goal, have your alchemists/sorcerers research a method to enable people to pay the tolls/taxes in XP (e.g., to a mystical XP bank controlled by you) - and make XP the new currency instead of gold.  Loan XP at interest.  Set dungeon access fees so that everyone begins in debt.  Drain XP as punishment for counter-revolutionary activities.

  It's a little late on my part, but here's a question that I can't remember being asked in this sphere.

  How would you leverage having control over your whole brain? Meaning, you have conscious control over all functions of your brain, including those normally subconscious, along with commensurate ability to multitask.

    I would immediately run into a dilemma, is it fine to remove parts of my mind that I don't like? At what point does that end? Can I ensure that my future mind won't suddenly decide something that present me wouldn't? Maybe the present me is certainly wrong compared to any less biased future me. Perhaps I'll think that I've *removed all my biases* and start acting really crazy.

      I'm not sure that this isn't a dilemma you are technically *already* facing? In this hypothetical, you aren't granted the ability to make any modifications to your that couldn't (technically) already happen, you're simply given control over which and when.

      You don't have free access to your source code, unless you're convinced that's something a human brain already do to itself under the right conditions. Plus, it's not like rewriting yourself is the only thing you can do with this ability.
