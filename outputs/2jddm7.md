- u/Bowbreaker:
  ```
  For someone completely new to this story, is there an "about" section that goes further than just "Looking back, I suppose my story really begins on the day I died. Of course, I didn't realize that had happened for quite some time..."?

  I normally like to know what I am reading before sinking too much time in to it and "rational and/or rationalist fiction where someone's story starts with him/her dying" is kinda vague.

    Not really.

    It's about a world where a bad singularity happened. But not too bad of a singularity. It spends a lot of time chronicling the protagonists wanderings through that singularity.
