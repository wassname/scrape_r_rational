  [Copy, Paste: The Misadventures of Milo Two](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34945/copy-paste-the-misadventures-of-milo-two) has been really fun. It's rational adjacent, but in a sorta satirical way. The protagonist is a munchkin at heart and tries to find ways to misuse his skills, and discovers some cool stuff for sure. He also thinks he's being logical when he makes impulsive assumptions that are almost definitely wrong, and then when he's proved wrong by his assumptions he's like "Yeah that was pretty stupid."

  It almost feels like a jab at this community haha. Milo is 30, tall but pretty thin. He works out, but he isn't a powerlifter. At the start he's unemployed, and has been jumping from one job to another for most of his life. He's got a very short attention span and gets bored quickly. When he's offered the choice of getting power he impulsively goes the mage route because of the cool spells he'd get, and then tries to munchkin those spells. This almost kills him a few times because he's too busy trying to munchkin his skills instead of paying attention to his surroundings. He sits down and tries to make a focused plan for his future, and then immediately breaks it when he gains options to choose new skills. It's more of a jab at the royalroad community than here, but still, it's been a fun story. I'd recommend, at least as far as it's entertaining. There has been indications that the story and characters are deeper than they appear, and I've been liking the way the author drip feeds Milo's current state of mind chapter by chapter.

    I second this, It's been a rather good read so far. My only criticism is that the protagonists' power level feels a bit "cheated". Yes, he has knowledge that puts him far above the 99th percentile when it comes to average scientific understanding of a medieval world but he unlocks frankly ridiculous abilities (notably Skim which is potentially "gamebreaking" and Fetch Book) within a couple days of arrival and almost instantly becomes far more effective in all classical adventuring roles (scouting, fighting, ranged, utility, etc) than his companion, Backlebutt, who's been living in the world for decades but is seemingly completely combat ineffective because he doesn't have a bow. 

    This falls a bit into one of my pet peeves: Authors (often subconsciously) assuming that people in medieval or primitive settings are stupid when this is just plain wrong--in fact there's a reasonable argument for stating that people used to be more intelligent than they are today because their ability to think correlated more directly to their survival odds. Yes, people in ye' ole' times didn't have as much knowledge as we do today, but it's not like they wouldn't be able to munchkin a system
    ```

    - u/Luck732:
      ```
      I agree with the criticism, at least tentatively. We don't really know where Milo lands on the power scale yet, we only have one person to gauge his strength against, and give the social restrictions that person is apparently under, he is probably on the lower end of the scale. For all we know Milo may be decidedly average, at least for the upper class.

      That said, its my favorite new read from royalroad recently, so I hope it stays good.

      People in medieval or primitive settings are *ignorant* generally speaking. They (serfs only) lack knowledge because of a lack of formal education. This generally means they are dumber. Not because all people were just dumber but because education correlates very well with iq. 

      A average peasants ability to think does not correlate with survival. They never gained any survival skills period. Because all they did was farm or die from preventable diseases. A 14 year old kid from Indiana has a better chance of living on their own. Because peasants stay on a farm for 30 years and then die. They never needed to or were approaching any kind of intelligence. Deliberately. The noble class withheld any form of literacy or education and filled their heads with religion and dogma.

      Peasants are stupid. 1v1 modern people beat peasants in every metric. They are just shitty versions of us.

        Your point is valid, but it's not quite what I'm getting at. Specifically, it's when a protagonist gets isekai'd, lands in a "System" world, and then, first thing, goes "a-duh, why don't you just do X to get super powerful Y. I am the first person in history to think about super obvious Z, now bow before my genius, because there's no way that you rubes would've ever thought about this completely novel idea without me" and then you hear the collective forehead slapping of every native king, archmage, multi-millennia old elf, etc. who somehow missed something so obvious that some random 21st century white dude figured out within days of arriving in a completely alien world with alien rules. Yes, the peasants aren't the sharpest tools on the farmstead but the world isn't 100% peasants.

          Oh a system or litrpg setting provides infinite potential for advancement and education. None of what I said applies there. An average peasant there either has the ability to level stats or there's a convenient explanation for them still being an underclass even with the system.

          Peasants are dumb makes sense. Peasants even existing at all makes 0 sense in a litrpg world. It's one of the cornerstone reasons why I detest that genre. It has almost no internal logic or coherence. It's ideas from an intentionally unrealistic place (video games) placed into a setting with *presumably* some realism. Expecting any amount of world building that doesn't make you want to kill yourself is a recipe for disaster.

          - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
            ```
            It's not impossible to write it so it has some self consistency. E.G. you don't pick a class, the system assigns it to you based on your upbringing when you come of age. The peasant class provides highly limited advancement opportunities, and peasant parents raise peasant children. That would create even less social mobility than reality, since the nobles, or even the yeomanry would be stronger, smarter, etc than the peasantry. 

            However I would still expect levels to have an effect here, a small number of high level peasants should be more effective at running a farm than a large number of low level peasants. Which should have major effects on the worldbuilding.

              That would highly encourage a wildly different way of raising children. It would not lead to more peasants. It would lead to the complete elimination of undesirable classes as people raise children according to a particular class desire.

              This is my main point I guess. Not to rag on you in particular bc it's neither your obligation or job to come up with consistent world building but this is the exact idea/trend of ideas that permeate litrpg.

              A terribly thought out abortion of an idea that has no business being in any story.

              Because every single idea isn't thought out. Nobody thinks of the consequences or reaction to levels. Nobody considers the impact or changes it will make in world building.

              Case in point the above concept.

                Desirable by whose criteria? If a [Yeoman Farmer] is more productive as a [Peasant], but also has a good chance of raising [Blacksmiths], [Merchants], [Monks], various adventurer classes, etc. and thus requires constant incentives, legal rights and privileges, etc in order to induce them to ensure they continue to produce generations of farmers who'll till the [Baron]'s land. Maybe the Baron would rather have the [Peasants]. 

                I think this Barron is making a bad choice, in the same way that any real world ecconomy deciding to not educate the working class is a bad idea. But history shows that bad decision can shape society for a long time. 

                Or take take that other set undesirable classes, criminal classes. If the [Barron] is oppressive the [Peasants] might encourage their kids to perform minor crimes as one of the few ways out. A [Blacksmith] might want payment to take an apprentice, but any kid can try to nab a pheasant in the [Barron]'s forest and unlock [Poacher]. And that's a stepping stone to a real criminal career if they can level up enough to evolve the class. 

                Maybe the reason the [Barron] prefers peasants is because in the right circumstances a [Yeoman] can evolve into [Prince of Thieves] and start turning Peasants and basic outlaw classes into [Merry Men], and before you know it you've got a kingdom scale threat.

                  Those are all wonderful ideas. If the baron existed. If he had the ability or power to hold land. If 90% of the population didn't have the ability to completely override any authority he has given sufficient time.

                  The landed gentry are not capable of holding land in a litrpg society. They shouldn't even be able to be classed into because that assumes they have ever existed in the first place. Second of all the ability for farmers to even function in a litrpg society is also super questionable given the existence of 1000 monsters per each farm and a lack of sufficient manpower to ever cover all the farms needed to feed a country. 

                  A litrpg country would be fed by monster meat, magic, or not fed at all.

                  You have reached the first layer of making a consistent and logical world, the appearance. A litrpg world is incapable of holding up to any scrutiny or basic logic beyond appearing to have some.

                    You're making strong assumptions that are not in any way inherent to the genre. 

                    There's nothing inherent to litRPG that implies the monster density has to be high. Nor is there anything that says 90% of the population can override the gentry's authority given sufficient time. A [Baron] or other Noble class might get better per-level progression than most classes. And as a hybrid of a land manager and feudal fighter he might get the enviable ability to level up his combat abilities without doing dangerous things like raiding dungeons full of monster. That would severely limit the percentage of people who could override his authority. 

                    I'd say there's only two real rules. A RPG style system encourages quality over quantity, and a RPG style system encourages people to specialize in their class' area of competence.

                    Neither of these rules veto the existence of a landed gentry. If anything they make it easier, since the quality over quantity rule makes it easier to run a society based around a small high level elite who're loyal to each other.

                    I am 75% convinced that a completely thought out worldbuilding of litrpg would look a lot like a XanXia world (sects of increasingly powerful people) that is mainly inhabited by the elves in the Azarinth Healer story.  


                    The way the xanxia look would be flavour at this point. For example: monster around the centre of population is made of wood and fast breeding and getting exponentially powerful give a sedentary city of hunters that regulate fire.  
                    another example: beasts in the continent breed slowly and do not grow in power. This lead to either a weak society that look a lot like medieval life, but with the occasional kaiju monster. or a society of nomad that hunt according to the power of the beast and/or organised breeding of beast.  


                    anyway, that my two cents.

                      I could see some similarities, but I think there'd definitely be some differences too. 

                      In Xanxia non-cultivators are usually portrayed as living rather normal lives. But in a litRPG world, even peasant farmers would have a thing going on where a small number of high level peasants would be more productive than lots of low level peasants. And they'd acuminulate levels by farming so you'd expect to see most farmers reach a decent level as they age. That will have a big worldbuilding effect. 

                      More relevantly for a typical adventure story. Typically in Xanxia when you level up you improve in all respects, you're faster, stronger, tougher, etc. In litRPG I'd expect to see a lot more disparities. You'll have tank classes who at high levels could stand their ground against a charging elephant. You'd have wizards who could flatten entire battlefields but might die from one well aimed arrow. So unlike Xanxia you'll see interdependent and synergistic teams as opposed to individual masters.

          A litRPG system world that looks like medieval fantasy feels innately implausible to me since medieval fantasy worlds are defined by the feudal pyramid where most people are farmers, and litRPG systems lead towards quality over quantity. 

          If one high level farmer is worth many low level farmers, what is all that spare manpower doing? [A quick google suggests a level 20 fighter can defeat 80 to 100 level one guards.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/bsaire/how_many_soldiers_would_it_take_to_kill_a_level/). So what would be the consequences on a medieval society where the food supply was fulfilled by 100th of the manpower?

          (Note, a story that explores what a society with this kind of system would actually be like would be catnip to me)

            ```
            If you only rely on the high level farmers (who are inevitably older) then when they die you're shit out of luck. You have to have the lower levels doing their part because otherwise within a generation you won't *have* any high levels.

            And then there's the unique timesinks of such settings: magic items and rare ingredients. A high-level farmer could farm faster than a low level one, sure, but maybe his expertise is needed to farm the finicky magic crops the city's alchemists need to brew potions? Perhaps going up levels only lets you farm regular crops twice as quickly, and the reward is being able to handle superior crops at all?

        This isn't remotely correct and is especially not correct for what we would think of as primitive societies.  Serfs in particular were more tied down and had less skills than an average peasant but even they would have much more knowledge when it comes to survival skills.  We're talking about shit like building a house, starting a fire, how to effectively farm the land they have, how to identify edible plants in a particular region from non edible ones, and so on.  None of these skills would be remotely present in your 14 year old from Indiana.  This isn't to say that a modern person isn't smarter or stronger than your average peasant or serf but that's mostly orthogonal to their survival skills.  This is of course without getting into how educated or socially mobile peasants actually were.  The idea that a random 21st century teenager or adult in the US or another western country would have even close to the survival skills of a random peasant or serf is just completely laughable.
        ```

      - u/Freevoulous:

        I have to disagree with you on several points here. Peasants usually lacked formal education in the medieval world, but not always. There were Church run schools for peasant children, and it was normal for peasant teens to go to medieval universities.  
        The nobles did not withheld the education from the peasants. Usually they did not give a damn either way, but occasionally it was the nobles who ORDERED peasants to go to schools, usually to become clerks for the benefit of the manor. Nobles also did not fill their heads with religion or dogma; for one, it was the nobles who were most often lapsed parishioners, and had conflicts with the Church. Religiosity of the serf spread mostly via word of mouth and cultural osmosis.  


        Peasants in medieval age did not "  stay on a farm for 30 years and then die ". For one, almost every young person would be expected to marry outside of their hamlet, and thus lived most of their adult life not where they were born. Two, every craft except for farming required the kids to quite literally travel to find a craft Master, become Apprentice, and then a Journeyman (named so because they were travelling craftsmen). Whole groups of peasants, like lumberjacks, seasonal workers, masons (hence, "free mason") were required to travel the land looking for work, getting experience along the way.  


        It was not uncommon, for example for a dig-digger peasant from France to travel the whole Europe back and forth and end up in say, Norway, digging moats, foundations and graves along the way from Iberia to Trondheim.  


        And ATOP of that peasant levies were supposed to form and join armies, often being recruited for 2-3 years in a row, if not more. And they were not just the memetic "peasant in a grain sack with a stick" but scrupulously trained, armed and armoured infantry, archers and siege engineers, who might have seen battlefields from Scotland to Rome in a single season.  


        So, your average peasant was actually someone who traveled a bit, met various people, held several different jobs, possibly fought in several battles, and probably licked some formal and informal education along the way. He would very likely be a "jack of all trades" who could do simple accounting, stitch a wound, dig a grave, ride  a horse, shoot a bow, repair a cart, fight in a pike formation, sail a simple boat, survive for weeks in the wilderness, recite a dozen prayers and a hundred folk songs, play a simple instrument, and haggle. All of those skills would require maybe not intelligence, not precisely, but a kind of hardcore cunning, practicality and people skills that combined together would be indistinguishable from being smart.

        Modern first-world people have a terrible tendency to be hyperspecialised domesticated animals.

        Peasants knew how to live off the land, and a single village of them contained far more of the knowledge and expertise needed to propagate the technologies they used in their lives than would be the case for moderns.  In other words, medieval societies were far less *fragile* over time than moderns.  

        Cut off a modern american farming from the outside world for 50 years, and do the same to a medieval european one- the modern town will eventually just be a less developed version of the medieval one, where the people don't understand their tools as well.

        You vastly overestimate the quality of the average modern person.  The process of civilization is to take men and turns them into insects.

And then look at the people in there- frontend webdevs, baristas, hair stylists...  A lot of people who'd have to learn a lot of things, quickly.

            >Each man lives as the most indolent ruler did 500 years ago.
            Indolent.  How fares a king if you take him out of his castle, and put him in the woods?  Worse than a woodsman, I suspect.

            (Also, this isn't true.  A major part of the value of being an ancient king would be that you're *high-status*.  There's a legion of people beneath you.  Modernity can't give that to every man; likely nothing can.)

        Education and intelligence are correlated, but causation is a lot less clear than might be intuitive. Hard to establish this kind of causation with a study, but I think the smart money is on intelligent people deciding to spend more time in school and/or wealth being a third factor that influences both. IQ is 40-80% heritable (ranges depending on age, apparently), so that puts a ceiling on how  much education can even affect it. Other biological factors like diet are much more likely to contribute to IQ than education, iodine deficiency alone can account for up to 15 IQ points, but there would almost certainly be non-deficient populations and individuals. There's some other research that kind of suggests higher modern IQ (Flynn effect, some suggestion of modern superiority in abstract thinking, which is less useful in most circumstances than people on here might think), but I think the correct framing is to think of the archetypical medival peasant (honestly that generalization is so broad as to be pretty ridiculous) as being basically similar to us, but in quite different circumstances.

        I think the right frame here is to think of useful cognition as being instantiated in three ways (a generalization): hardware, software, and infrastructure. We moderns have the same hardware, alien software, and better infrastructure. That is, we are biologically largely similar in IQ, we operate on different but not really dramatically superior memoplexes, and our infrastructure is dramatically better. To the extent that we can do more and better, it's because we have discovered specific theories that we can look up, or we have better tools for thoughts available to us such as programming, easier to contact experts, and so on.

        This is really why uplift is a BS genre, as fun as it is. A modern would be worse than useless in a premodern setting without a ton of handwaving. Maybe if someone was able to go back with a carefully chosen skill set, reference books, and equipment, and then got lucky, but that's really just acknowledging how critical the infrastructural component is. Moderns have an overinflated opinion of themselves, and the more you go back and read the (alien but intelligent) writings of the early moderns (~late medieval) the more obvious this is.

          I agree mostly about the intelligence difference having a multitude of factors and being a lot more complicated than more education equals more smart. I was kinda just using that fact to snowball into the education difference impact.

          I don't agree that a modern person would be useless in a premodern setting. We as a people are incredibly educated and capable when compared to the average serf. Just taking highschool would give any person an incredible amount of advantages in practical knowledge.
          You probably have 1000 random factoids that would make you far more capable than anyone else in a medieval society. Basic econ 101 would make you a decently successful merchant. Taking meds school or any degree would make you rich as hell. Can you imagine an architect going back? Lucrative life just ready for the taking.

          I don't actually know what the uplift genre is but if what it sounds like (modern culture inserted into a premodern setting) then it sounds like boring political thriller at best and a pretty stupid and ill though out fantasy book at worst. There is no practical way to *uplift* a society without boring gradual reform (which fails 9/10 times) or violent destructive revolution (which often backslides to a less functional world).

            The problem is that actually applying that knowledge is very tricky and depends on a ton of details that aren't included in our education. Modern education is a fantastic base to build from, but includes relatively little that can be directly applied, especially outside the context of modern society.

            Most scientifically minded people are going to have a general knowledge of, say, how a steam engine works, but will fall far short of the essential related knowledge you'd need to fashion one, or even just get metal with the right qualities to have it not fall apart.

            The ideal situation, if we're talking about a pure single person with no extra reference material, would be to wind up getting dropped in as the ruler of a stable, well to do realm. If you had the ability to command craftsmen and laborers, you could easily make up for your lack of details with their own prebuilt knowledge and focus on just the differences that are needed to improve their methods.

            Trying to do so yourself without something like a deep, practical knowledge base of metallurgy or other materials would leave you hopelessly behind if trying on your own. Alternately, a deep historical understanding would help if you knew in great detail what the *next* step is from their current tech base, since you'd know that it was something achievable from what they can already do.

              Yes. That's a good way to phrase it. It gives an extra head start to whoever goes back and then they can add to that with real practical know-how of the premodern setting. Just going back and using advanced knowledge has tons of logistical and practical issues that would be worked through but in the end any modern person would be able to find successful use out of modern knowledge. 

              There are so many things we take for granted. So many incredibly original ideas that haven't been invented.

              French fries. Hamburgers. Snowboards. Tennis. Chess. Music.

              All of those have logistical and practical issues but it's a limitless supply of cool ideas to implement and profit from.

                  We have many forms of new music since medieval times.

                  French fries were made in ww2

                  Snowboards are pretty recent iirc.

                  But none of that matters bc it's not the point. The point is that there are infinite ideas to exploit that haven't happened yet in a premodern society.

                    I think the point that the things you mentioned are not new inventions is actually pretty valid. Really what you're describing are cultural shifts. People ate fried potatoes, skiied, and yeah, they had chess. Early moderns would almost certainly hate modern music, old people from a generation before tended to hate rock and early moderns would be like 7-15 generations before. If you went back in time with a guitar and a knowledge of mdoern pop people would be as likely to laugh at you as to enjoy the music. It's certainly not a slam dunk

                    French fries wouldn't be possible in a medieval setting.  Potatoes are from South America.  Also, the types of instruments used has changed dramatically, not just with electrification, but also with the decreasing price of brass in the industrial revolution.

                      the potato was only introduced in 1536 from a quick Google search. Does that count as middle ages?

                      Also this is so fucking weird because it's not even remotely my point. The point is that there are a multitude of ideas that can be implemented from modern times with just a little work. Take your pick from many types of music, foods, clothing, books, and many more. Why be so critical of a single point it makes no sense.

            Basic econ 101 would be close to useless in a medieval period because the fundamentals of how markets and economies in general functioned was completely different.  Even something like a medical degree would be close to useless because so much of modern medicine is entirely reliant on modern infrastructure in order to function.  This problem is basically repeated again and again for most things of that sort - a modern architect would be much less useful than you would think because modern architecture relies on modern tools and infrastructure and materials.

              I talk about this in a later comment.

              It's a base of knowledge that was be built on with practical education in the given setting.

              Of course you won't just show up and know everything about everything in medicine or architectural stuff that would be dumb. 

              Also the idea that modern medical practice wouldn't be a sharp improvement if unreal. *Sanitation* wasn't even an idea back then. Just that would rock their world. Plus of course architects wouldn't just start doing their thing out of nowhere. They would apprentice with a current one and assimilate their knowledge base into a cohesive whole.

                Ignatz Semmelweiss, the guy who discovered modern sanitation, was beaten to death by guards in an insane asylum.

                Neither the necessity of city sanitation or the use of anti septics for sanitization were unknown during the middle ages homie.  This is part of the thing.  A large part of the knowledge base you might add would be questions of why things are the case - and those aren't particularly beneficial except over the long term.

                  To the extent they are now yes they were very very different. We have much more knowledge about sanitation. It boggles the mind that you think sanitation was even remotely similar. They didn't even know what bacteria was.

                  >A large part of the knowledge base you might add would be questions of why things are the case - and those aren't particularly beneficial except over the long term.

                  Wtf does this mean????? Of course there will be useful and useless knowledge gained from modern times. That doesn't eliminate the benefits.

              I've never seen any torture-porn but I can deduce from what others say that I wouldn't like it.

              I have never been to Disneyland but from others I can guess that I might like the experience.

              I have never flown on a plane but from description of it it sounds kinda boring 

              I have never done/seen/read many things. I can still derive opinion on them by comparing them with previous experiences and the opinions of others.

              I have heard enough opinions and read enough writing *about* uplift stories to be confident that I wouldn't like them. In the same way that reading the description on the back of a book might give me a clue on whether or not I might like it.

                Sure, but according to your original comment about them, you hadn’t heard enough about uplift stories. You flat out said you didn’t know what they were.

    Tell you what I really don't enjoy, the author's constant inane commentary about their ranking. Who cares about that other than them?

    It's also so transparently manipulative that it's irritating, it reads like a company's marketing department. 

    Complaining that people leave half star ratings while begging for five stars so that they can be the top rated story so they can get more views so they can get more money. Obviously the story is not a half star but it's not remotely perfect. 

    At the end of the day it's not a super big deal but after every chapter here is another sentence just to ruin your immersion

    Also it seems likely that anyone else who had his class would try those things unless they can't see the game interface

  - u/lsparrish:

    I have been enjoying this one. Sure, he stumbles on a cheat power early per genre convention, but it's sort of plausible given that he does it by leveraging a reasonable world difference (scientific knowledge one can get at any community college / bookstore / high school), so it feels less cheap than the usual convention of being granted special powers due to simply being a transplant / because the Powers Above thought it would be "interesting". And it's kind of hilarious the way he ends up bonking monsters with books, using a skill that apparently wasn't designed for combat.

    Do low level peasants serve a useful function in a litrpg fantasy world? Well, for all we know at this point, peasants are encouraged to be ignorant and low level to allow easier powerleveling by the nobility, given that the system considers it relevant that 99% of the world doesn't know something. Perverse incentives and all that.

  Unfortunately all of these are short and quite incomplete, which makes it tough to get a good feel for them. 

  -----------------------
  Primal hunter https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36049/the-primal-hunter

  Decently written. MC gets lots of super cool awesome stuff for no reason, but still has threats and other people get pretty cool stuff as well. Minimal other character development. >!The psychopath literally gets the most character development. Really don't like how MC decides he no longer has a crush out of the blue right when his crush does something bad in a flashaway. Also the recent ambush is pretty bad idiot ball / power incontinence !< 

  ----------------------

  Cadence Lee https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35925/the-many-lives-of-cadence-lee

  Pretty interesting. The many lives seem pretty pointless without something else tying into them. It is good enough that I get interested in the people in each life, but there's no closure, and all the character development other than MC is lost each life. >!Maybe necromancers will actually be part of the story? It also really seems to cut away right when the story is getting interesting. Generally seems like it might need to be a lot longer to judge, since there doesn't seem to be a real drive or goal. !<

  The system is really stingy. This could be good or bad. 

  ---------------------

  Copy Paste: the misadventures of Milo Two https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34945/copy-paste-the-misadventures-of-milo-two

  Pretty Enjoyable. Competent writing. Hints at an interesting world with nobles monopolizing dungeons, and odd survival scenarios. The MC trivially finds a way to become very powerful in a way that lots of people ought to be able to figure out. >!I love using "non combat" powers cleverly to be relevant in combat, but scribe is hardly an impossible class to get, and telekinesis and slow time are obviously incredibly powerful and don't make that much sense for their supposed scribe use (slow time for a few seconds to read a book fast?). !< Personally I'm not a huge fan of the cheeky meta monster themes.

  ---------------------

  Apocalypse: Generic System https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35669/apocalypse-generic-system

  Fun. Characters have some actual character, if kinda cliche. Interesting magic system with strong light analogy (lenses, filters, etc). MC does have a bit too much of an easy time making awesome toys, but given the context and current info its plausible enough. Also, quite importantly the other characters also get pretty cool classes and abilities too.

  ---------------------

  System Change https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35372/system-change

  Junk food. super OP MC accidentally migrate to a new "System" Decently written, but needs some actual motivation and risk.

  --------------------

  [The Weirkey Chronicles Reborn Across Nine Worlds](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35660/the-weirkey-chronicles-reborn-across-nine-worlds)

  By Sarah Lin of Street Cultivation fame. Quite competent writing. Cultivation means building a house in your soul, which explains why all the special materials are valuable and provides a nice analogy. The actual mechanics seem pretty vague and wibbly wobbly, so its difficult to predict what is possible.
  Huge scale threats and mysteries are hinted at in the beginning, but it looks like it will take a really long time to learn more or actually engage with those threats. Very slow growth for MC -- he just got his first ability. >!The demon enemies we do see are boring and generic. They just spawn out of nowhere and attack. Frankly the "Oh no, there are even higher tier demons!" is pretty meh anyway. !<

  -------------

  Artificial Jelly https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34030/artificial-jelly

  Okay. Pretty decent premise. Kinda slow start. >!Considering how long MC was stuck in dungeon, doing... nothing really. The initial premise of an intern made a seed AI and snuck it into an MMO is fine as far as my suspension of disbelief is concerned, but the resource requirement / awakening other NPC's is definitely a strain in that regards. !<

  -------------

  Prophecy Approved Companion https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion

  Okay. NPC becomes conscious. Some quite funny bits. Seems a bit rudderless. >!Not really sure where this is going, as it seems stuck in the Hero and NPC both having suspicions, but never quite have any realizations.!<

  --------------

  My Servant Is An Elf-Knight From Another World https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36796/my-servant-is-an-elf-knight-from-another-world

  Okayish reverse isekai. 
  >!Hmm, I feel like the continuous frenetic action and immediate threat of the last two thirds kinda wasted the stranger in a strange land / mystery / romance build up. One fantasy elf appearing in the real world was interesting, but a bunch of other fantasy creatures appearing at the same time all centered around the MC is just a bit much. !<

  ----------

  New Life of a Summoned Demoness https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36308/new-life-of-a-summoned-demoness

  Surprisingly Decent so far. >!Tropy kill things to consume their essense and take their powers.  !<

  ----------

  Yashima Chronicles https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35875/yashima-chronicles

  By JacobK, an author I usually love. Unfortunately I haven't been as taken by his recent original works. This is clearly a Yojou Senki analogue, which he wrote excellently in A Young Woman's Political Record. It's enjoyable enough, but kinda... bland so far. >!MC gets a gamer/litrpg system gifted from a goddess, but then pisses the goddess off so much they lock the system away. Pretty amusing premise so far. They train magic and fighting on their own, and become vastly more powerful than anyone else with ease. In fact it was so easy they assume that everyone else is still much more powerful than them. There's very little tension, and the MC's strange mindset feels a bit out of nowhere, likely because its a carbon copy of Tanya's -- Tanya's ability was high, but felt much closer to what skilled enemies were capable of (with the exception of the cursed divine orb that had serious downsides). Her ability to win fights, but not the war also made things have consequences.!< The characters here are barely developed, making it seem much less meaningful. 

  --------------

  Genesis Wave https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35943/genesis-wave

  Losing interest, but decently interesting premise.

  ----------------

  Sylver Seeker https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36065/sylver-seeker

  I'm definitely enjoying it. Gore seems a bit over the top, but its on brand for necromancer. Frankly the flashbacks seem pointless so far. Plot is clever, and MC is a pretty good level of OP, but still threatened. Kinda suffers from a common syndrome where MC is supposedly super selfish and mercenary, but then doesn't really act like it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as a unsympathetic MC is usually a very bad thing.

  ------------------

  Shade Touched https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched

  Cute monster child is too smart. Needs more world exposition. Decent read, but a bit lacking in drive.

  ---------------

  Soul Power 9999 https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36249/soul-power-9999

  Kinda silly/dumb story about a soul that accidentally consumed all the other souls in Hades when the system took over and mulched the previous supernatural world. They go around accidentally head exploding everything they try to possess. Skipping the system taking over seems like kinda a shame, since the one flashback we saw was frankly more interesting than the MC's adventures so far. MC is way OP, but needs to protect their golem body, so there's some tension. 

  -----------------


  Fluff https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35958/fluff

  Cute and pretty competent. Superhero fic about an accidental Villain who summons younger sisters / minions who want to help her be evil. Seems like it is headed towards being pretty dark, as the world is not fiat nice / comedic. This does have an interesting interaction with the cuddly premise.

  -------------------------

  Dead Tired https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37251/dead-tired

  Very short. OP Lich wakes up to a Cultivation based world instead of a DnD fantasy. Wonders what went wrong. Pretty funny so far, but the humor is the type that (I suspect) will soon grow rather ... tired.

    I was thinking about how Yashima Chronicles doesn't measure up to A Young Girl's Political Record the other day. My current hypothesis is that where AYGPR was focused on politics, Yashima is following a comparatively simple (so far) set of circumstances, and this leads to the protagonist's actions being really... obvious, maybe?

  [The Dragon King’s Temple](https://fanfiction.net/s/7679074/1/The-Dragon-King-s-Temple) is an excellent *Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *Stargate: SG-1* crossover in which Zuko and Toph have to work with the SG-1 team to get home (and defeat a nasty spirit  on the way). You can tell that the author has put *a lot* of thought into how to make two different series mesh, and it works really well. The characters are mostly rational, and when they’re not, the author is doing it on purpose and has a good reason for it. This is one of those stories where instead of you saying “Why didn’t the author think of that?”, the author makes you go “Why didn’t *I* think of that?”

    Just sprinted through that one, I've gotta give it a second recommendation. 

    It's two universes I'd not even have thought of blending and it turns out fantastic, it's a bit on the short side for my taste but it's better to be wanting more I suppose. 

    I've gotta give the author credit for the language barrier, and the reasons for it here and why there isn't one in SG1 as a show. Sticking with getting characters to interact while only being able to communicate singular concepts is difficult and it's pulled off well here. 

    Toph is also sassy as fuck. As she should be.

    Currently reading this based on your recommendation. I’m about halfway through.

    If you don’t like stories that kind of... praise themselves on how amazing and quirky and whatever their characters are? this might not be a story for you. (I think this is a common fanfic thing where the author write about characters they think are awesome and get stuck talking about it a lot instead of just having them continue to do awesome things like in the source material). There have also been some displays of headcannon/lore changes/attitude changes that don’t seem necessary and kind of grate. But maybe they will pay off in the latter half?

  Since I asked too late in last week's thread, here's a reprisal:

  I'm  looking for stories (specifically things I can read online for free but  other media is fine too) where the protagonist is (or protagonists are)  from a modern day setting and then get isekai-style randomly  transported into the past. How far into the past isn't particularly  important but definitely preindustrial so maybe between 10000 BC and  1600 AD. Magic is \*okay\* but if it's included, it should be rather soft  (no gamer-esque 'system' or cyoa-esque stuff please). Specifically, I'm  looking for stories...

  * ...that portray the historical era and culture realistically (research backed or strong worldbuilding)
  * ...where the protagonist's primary tool is their intelligence, not magic or whatever
  * ...that  portrays the problems the protagonist faces realistically (eg. learning  a whole new language and interacting with an almost alien culture)

    [The Red Lands](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14278/the-red-lands)  

    A random salary man gets thrown into a dog eat dog world as a slum kid. Its pretty much upto his wits to eek out a place in this world. While the language barrier is easily taken care of, the first arc basically consists of the mc getting his basic survival needs taken care of and a base ,both literal and power, established

          When the author describes the local area and power structure, even with magic Deus ex, you begin to realize there is no way the infrastructure around the town is able to support the amount of 'abandoned' people.  You start to question 'how big is the town', 'how big is the inn' because for plot reasons the described surroundings are just not sufficient to support the population and town building the MC is doing.  

          Also early on, when they described wood-gathering and whatnot, the amount of physical labor starving kids are doing isn't in line with the limitations or abilities of a low-stated kid.  I got around that one, but basically, it set the tone for 'think too hard about it and the story doesn't make sense'.

          ```

          - u/Revlar:
            ```
            I'd speculate that's partly because Washington's time doesn't map as perfectly to medieval fantasy as Japan's warring states period. But also because, say, the Confederacy can't be separated from the immorality of its goals. Meanwhile, Nobunaga's was simply total conquest, and that's much more palatable.

            There are quite a few stories where the US remains a colony, though, but it's true its historical characters don't show up as much.

  I started reading [The Many Lives of Cadence Lee](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35925/the-many-lives-of-cadence-lee), and it's been pretty good so far.

  There's your typical "reincarnation with skills in another world" that define so many LitRPGs, but with a catch - every time the MC dies, she's reborn in another world that she hasn't been to before. And she's "graded" on her past life, which in turn influences her next life.

  Also, mild spoiler, >!the MC isn't always reincarnated in medieval European setting. Her third life is as the princess of the equivalent of ancient Egypt during the Bronze age.!<
  ```

  - u/GlimmervoidG:

      - u/GlimmervoidG:
        ```
        >!Yep. I would say tin and copper seldom being found in the same place is one of the defining aspects of the bronze age. It fosters those complex international trade networks I mentioned and it's why you can find tin from Britain half the world away !<

        - u/SvalbardCaretaker:

          I once saw an exhibition on ancient mining and it seems that the regional availability of flintstone already had caused europe-wide trade networks going. So the bronze age trade had shoulders to stand on.
          ```

        - u/Freevoulous:
          ```
          exactly. The only reason early iron production made any sense was due to the fact that bog iron is fairly common, and once you know how to smelt it, it makes no sense to purchase bronze. Early Iron age tools and weapons were mostly crap (you could bend an iron sword over a knee), but it could be made locally, without the need to import tin, copper or bronze from across the continent.

        Which, honestly, is a flaw of the story - if the price of failure is something equivalent to "the story ends", you know _a priori_ that the MC will never fail.

        Your suggestion would also render everything that happened in the story up until that point filler, if her previous lives really mattered the author could give us all her background lives as a preface or recurring flashbacks / side chapters.

  Still on the hunt for Crafting/Merchant/Trade based stuff.   

  I finally took a shot at Forge of Destiny on RoyalRoad and it was pretty well written. I enjoyed how fresh the xianxia take felt even though it felt like these were tropes that I should be getting tired of. The MC did not have some kind of magic star break down or find memories of a 9 million year old saint or anything. She comes from nothing and works her way up the ladder. Plot points are extrapolated and built on to world build properly. There's a wide cast of characters and each are portrayed uniquely. I would recommend it to anyone looking to indulge in some progression fantasy or wants to have a xianxia flavor of the week craving satisfied.
  ```

  - u/TheTruthVeritas:
    ```
    I really like Forge of Destiny, it does some pretty clever and unique things and the character development and focus is phenomenal. You really get a feel for all the characters, I don't think any other xianxias go into the individual characters as much as Forge of Destiny, which I really appreciate.

    It takes a different direction than a lot of other xianxias too. The MC isn't some solo traveling murderhobo cultivating their way to the heavens faster than a rocket ship, she's more grounded in her speed and ability but is still what you'd call a "heaven-defying" genius in comparison to most other cultivators. And she's attached to CRX and her family as a vassal, which I thought was really cool and opens up to a lot of possibilities.

    I also really like how female characters aren't just meant to be sexualized with no personalities as is common in xianxias and web novels in general. More than half the cast are ladies, all with their own backstories, personalities, and motivations, and I love how they're all developed. And they're all major badasses too, from snake girl to CRX to our humble MC herself. The MC is especially great, she's a support-type Cultivator who's taller than almost every male character introduced, badass, and intimidating as fuck.

    Absolutely phenomenal xianxia, I put it up there with Forty Milleniums of Cultivation and Cradle as my favorites.

    For merchant/trade based stuff, try Spice and Wolf. It's not particularly rational, but it's a wonderful romance with some econ 101 lessons thrown into the mix.

    Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey maybe? The whole world has a different view on sexuality and religion, which the author infuses wonderfully into the daily lives of the main character and those around her. There's a lot of kinky sex, but it never feels gratuitous, and there's a lot of skinship as well between characters as well (not always romantic either!). Highly recommend because it's a great book and series, not just because of the romance and sex.


    *Maybe* Spice and Wolf by Isuna Hasekura. It's primarily a romance series between wolf goddess Holo and traveling merchant Lawrence. There's intimacy and skinship between the two that slowly progresses. However, it being a Japanese Romance, the development is slow as fuck and takes forever. However, the banter between the two is great, and the exploration part of it is also satisfying. YMMV
    ```

    Definitely look at [Twig](https://www.twigserial.wordpress.com/), Wildbow's third webserial. The POV character is Sylvester, but the other members of the Lambs, a group of Academy-created experiments, are equally important main characters. In the beginning, they're children, even if they're somewhat monstrous in their actions. They're roughhousing a lot, but also casually sharing space - usually leaning against each other, having their arm slung around the others' shoulder, sewing each other's wounds shut... Later on, Sylvester actually >!starts sleeping in a literal cuddle pile of his friends to keep his mind from falling apart.!<

    If the setting doesn't appeal (very dark alt-1920ies with lots of biopunk, think Frankenstein), the main characters of his latest novel [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/) are also very close and often hug each other to show support or offer comfort.

        So glowfic is text roleplay, usually between two authors and written in a format meant to be read by other people. While it's an offshoot of rationalfic, it's inherently about interplay between characters due to its coauthorship, so there is equal focus on relationships.

        People in the glowfic community have lower boundaries, being tightly-knit poly Bay Area people, and so in their fiction, it is normal for friends to pet each other's hair and cuddle. (Excepting Silmarillion elves, who see hairplay as sexual and instead cuddle and sing.)

        my biggest problem with this is that he *doesn't* actually go about this in a way that's "learning about magic and how it works" - he just arbitrarily pulls a bad rhyme out of his ass and is granted free power

    The second Commonweal book by Graydon Saunders is very this

    www.archives.Erfworld.com  For the best webcomic and story out there (probably on indefinite hiatus, several "books" into the plot, due to author's personal tragedies.  Still very worth the read though).  Main character is a tabletop gamer geek thrown into a gameworld, and figuring out the mechanics and magic system is core to every step of the story - with much of it discoverable/guessable by the reader as you go, so every page adds intriguing depth and worldbuilding mechanics, compelling you to think of the implications.   Good luck to your productivity this month.

    P.S. if you make it through the main story, read the Backer Stories, which are canon and are sometimes even better than the main plot.  Fascinating stuff 

    P.S.S. "Signamancy" as a concept needs to be a core teaching of all fiction.  Ungodly useful concept.

  Does anyone have any more Harry Potter stories like [Blood Crest](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest)? I'm looking for things I enjoyed in this fiction such as: More rational-ish characters that deal with complications like a normal person would, more Harry-Voldemort pairing up, more exploration of the magics of the world, anything with Harry being more morally grey, anything with a more rational Voldemort

    I recommended some rational!Voldemort fics a while back in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/fjmd7a/comment/fkvl4cr). I also have many rational adjacent fics focused on interaction between Harry and Voldemort in my public bookmarks list on Ao3. Feel free to check it out if you like: [link](https://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&include_bookmark_search%5Bcharacter_ids%5D%5B%5D=478518&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bother_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmark_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&user_id=Chiruochiba)

  Anyone know of any vegan-friendly xianxia novels?

  Most I've gotten into go into great depth exalting the consumption of corpses, and while I can ignore it for a while, it does get a little grating, especially since it spoils the escapism (I deal with this enough from real humans already)

  - u/zorianteron:
    ```
    Are you fine with killing in stories, or just not eating corpses?

    Is it fine if the main character's an exclusive cannibal?  No animals harmed.
    ```

    - u/aponty:
      ```
      I am fine with both killing in stories and the eating of corpses under certain circumstances

      I just would like to read a few stories of this genre that aren't so abrasive to me, after having read and enjoyed several that were honestly a bit much in this regard

      I am getting downvoted bigtime on this on r/noveltranslations, but in this case I feel that reflects more poorly on the downvoters than on my comments or request
      ```

        It's no skin off my back if you have specific tastes, I was just interested.  Good luck!

    ```
    None come to mind that really make a point of it, sorry. As for stories that I'm pretty sure don't involve gaining power by eating things, if you haven't read them already you might try the first half of Way of Choices (by Mao Ni), or Forge of Destiny (currently getting rewritten from sufficientvelocity over onto RR).

      alright, thanks!
