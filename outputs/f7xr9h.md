## Grand Design—“It turns out that it is rather easy to make a superintelligent being, past a certain level of technology. Making one that isn’t suicidal or homicidal is apparently much harder.”

    The premise sounds fantastic, thank you for the recommendation.

  Oh man, this is a really great book. The author perfectly captures the feel of Big Adventure sci-fi, but without ever resorting to the tropes that made that genre so eye-rollingly dumb.  Also it's got a dog in it!

  Related to that, he's actually writing a new story now called Inheritors of Eschaton, which is like what would happen if Stargate hadn't abandoned the importance of language.  Keeps the importance of assault rifles, though.

    Thank you for this. I'm reading Inheritors of Eschaton, and hadn't thought to go digging through his completed works.

  I like the premise, but I feel inter-character familiarity and trust are rushed.  Like the author wanted to bootstrap to a place where the crew could banter ASAP.

    I'm on chapter 23, and I'd say that the whole thing feels rushed. Maybe I'm just used to longer-form fiction nowadays, but it feels like the author had a really cool premise and a bunch of ideas they wanted to get to, and so the whole thing feels very abrupt.

      I haven't read this, but I do find it funny that a common refrain from webfiction readers exposes to traditional length novels these days is that they feel rushed. It's almost diverged into a different sort of thing entirely, like TV vs. Movies.

  I'm really liking this, although it's got two distinct tones and the combination is kind of... weird. There's the tone that's "dust and remnants", and then there's the "recruiting for roflstomp". Both are done well, but the combo is weird.

  But beside all that, it's got at least one twist that's absolutely inspired. Seriously it's amazing.

  Is there a way to get an epub version from royal road?

    The author made one:

    See other comments for the general case.

    From the website itself, I don't think so.  
    Use fanficfare instead, royalroad is a supported site.
