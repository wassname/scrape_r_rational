  The last-ditch effort of Good has failed, as expected. Does Cat get these kind of redemption chances (2nd one now!) because she's a Squire and hence can transition into Good? Or is it related to the continuous fight for Callow's soul, which has never been on the side of Evil?

  The real question is this: was this the temptation to lure the protagonist from her rightful path or a last chance at redemption before a tragedy? It very much felt like an inverse of a scene where the main character is tempted by some great evil only to fully commit to the side of the good.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    It seems to be the temptation scene, yes. My headcannon is that in this hero journey arc, Ultimate Boon would be a new Name (either Black Queen or Black Knight)
    ```

  - u/TheEngineer923:
    ```
    Yeah, hope that doesn't come to pass. Cat going turncoat at this stage would feel like a massive cop out.
    ```

    - u/space_fountain:
      ```
      I could see her trying to push for a rule outside of the good evil dichotomy.
      ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  You see, [Graham Mcneil?](https://1d4chan.org/wiki/The_Last_Church) That's how you write a fucking religion vs. atheism argument in a world with gods!
  ```

- u/Ibbot:
  ```
  And there's a bit of a callback to Skirmish II.  Abigail is the captain who was all like "kill them all" when she raised the drafted soldiers as undead.
  ```

- u/TideofKhatanga:
  ```
  Let's hope that Akua really needed those spies now, because crippling your force by removing twenty-something officers (including one senior officer) just before the battle can't be good. At least, neither Catherine nor Hakram said "no way that could possibly go wrong" when discussing their move.

  As for that talk with the Sister, I don't know what to make of it. Said like this, Cat's way of thinking sounds like "IDGAF, YOLO". Never been a winning argument. Unless the point was to make it extra clear that Cat is Evil, so deep into that path that she can't even understand why people would want to be Good?
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    *Ubua

    Jeez people, names aren't that hard to remember.
    ```

  - u/Nihilvin:
    ```
    Because Cat's binary thinking has rephrased Good and Evil as Passive vs Active in a bloody, violent way. So now she calls herself evil, but has rationalised it as being able to decide the course of her own fate.

    'If we all cross the same finish line the only thing that matters, the only thing that can matter, is how we get there.'

    'So what if we all cross the same finish line? Down here in the mud is what really matters. What we make of it. And if I only have so much time kicking around Creation, then I’m the one who’s going to decide how it’s spent.'

    So close, yet so far Cat. That was the point the priestess was trying to make.
    ```

    ```
    >  Unless the point was to make it extra clear that Cat is Evil

    The point I'm assuming is to make it extra clear that Cat is a dumb child. The sister literally says as much.
    ```

- u/MoralRelativity:
  ```
  And in her final refusal of the heavens above, Cat crosses another line.
  ```

  - u/nick012000:
    ```
    It's not her final refusal. It's only the second time this has happened, see? ;)
    ```

    - u/MoralRelativity:
      ```
      Ah.... interesting. :)
      ```

- u/-main:
  ```
  Over the past few chapters, Cat seems to be going significantly more evil than she has in the past... Leading up to a conflict where she's fighting someone who's more evil than she is. Feels like it's framing for Cat to make a mistake, to me.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  > If you solve all your problems with swords, swords are the only reply you will ever get.

  This is the biggest problem with Cat's approach. There's always a bigger fish.
  ```

- u/werafdsaew:
  ```
  "Do you know why the House of Light does not preach rebellion against the Empire? Because it doesn’t really matter"

  But heroes do rebel against the Empire, and they're agents of Heaven aren't they?
  ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  Calling it right now, this won't help much, because they already infected the army with zombie water.  That's what they were used for, and it's already done.
  ```

  - u/melmonella:
    ```
    Zombie water has to be taken over a long time and consists of a lot of expensive alchemical reagents. Logistics of that don't work out-officers can't be receiving large shipments of unidentified stuff from the outside and not be noticed.
    ```

    - u/inscrutablescooter:
      ```
      That's a good point, but I don't think that is nearly enough evidence to rule out that the official shipments from the Wasteland did not contain the necessary reagents. Malicia herself managed to ensure that Ubua got what she needed, after all...
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        Cat controls supply within her own legion. I really really doubt that a lot of magical stuff slipped past her and Ratface and Masego and Juniper and Aisha. Just Cat, sure, but all of them at the same time? Plus every other high-ranked Cat loyalist?

        Then there are distribution problems. Suppose traitors somehow got the materials. Now they gotta distribute them to all soldiers so that they would drink them, and insure they keep doing that for a while. I doubt food is cooked in a single place for the whole legion (seems to make more sense to have one kitchen for 2-3 hundred people instead), and each such place probably has dozens of cooking pots, so this means they have to consistently put poison into dozens of pots all over camp without getting caught. How many traitors do you think there are, several hundreds? How do they insure nobody defects and sells the scheme to Cat? How do they insure they never get caught? They can't very much kill anyone who notices, because that would *definitely* be noticed.

        It just isn't plausible.
        ```
