  I don't understand why people always paint Culture minds as so violent in fanfic.

    ```
    To be fair, combat-focused Minds and Drones are heavily overrepresented in the books compared to their actual numbers, due to the focus on SC. And they tend to be rather ... memorable.

  By the way, you can read the first seven Culture books [here][link]. In 1997, the year when this story takes place, the first five (through *Excession*, as I hint at in the story) have been published. Willow has read all of them, Xander some, and Buffy none.
