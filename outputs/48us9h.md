  Seems strange to suggest these factors are hidden, when in reality it is obvious that external factors effect our enjoyment of things, including art.

  But getting from there to suggest that this is the main aspect which makes many different forms of art great is a big leap, which was not proven in the video.

  So until actual research supports the claim this the video is  nothing more than a hypothesis.
