## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Where is everyone from? I've been wondering about the ethnic and geographic diversity of the people on this subreddit. Age bracket would be nice to know too.

  I'm from New York of USA, Caucasian, and 23 years old.

  EDIT: Forgot to add that I'm Ashkenazi.

      I think the writers here skew on the older side: I'm 30 too, and that seems on the lower bound compared to most of the others I know. So maybe we're just the parents rather than the grandparents :)

      That's a self selecting group. Would you really want to talk about your fitness if you were a slob?

      >(I also wonder what people here and adjacent communities look like -- selection bias aside, it feels like half the responses to questions about physical fitness feature off-season competitive bodybuilders, going by the stats)

      I'm willing to bet that if we surveyed the fitness level of /r/rational and plotted it on a histogram, we'd have two distinct peaks:

      1. Average pudgy academic/white-collar-worker
      2. Bodybuilders


      Group one for obvious reasons (we're jam-packed with white collar workers and academics), but group two's presence would be magnified (compared to the population as a whole) because, /r/rational's primary userbase is males in their twenties (disproportionately likely to work out), and because we're more sensitive about health concerns as no doubt many of us hope to live to see immortality and/or the singularity (I certainly do). You can check /r/transhuman for corroboration; they're similarly concerned about health because they plan to be immortal.

        Reddit's pretty young still. A lot of people joined in their teens I think and that made it so reddit's culture revolved around what young males are interested in. I imagine in 20 years, if reddit's still around, it'll mostly be used by mid-40s people.

  [The last slatestarcodex article](http://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/08/varieties-of-argumentative-experience/) is a pretty good survey of internet arguments, and their common problems. I'm wondering what you thought about it. (especially if you happen to be u/trekie140, wink wink)
  ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    That was an interesting read, but it is no longer relevant to me because I have regained the privilege of not feeling constant anxiety over the constant suffering that morals, cultural norms, and biases are causing. 

    I have decided that I am better off simply not participating in arguments with people, regardless of how important I consider the disagreement to be, and restrict myself to associating with people who share my morals. It makes me feel more secure and self confident.

    Having the privilege to not think about all the evil things that hurt people who lack my social support, economic standing, and cultural inertia of being born white has made me much happier at the expense of others who lack my privileges.

    I have reduced the amount of news I consume to the bare minimum that I require to stay informed because I have chosen not to be worried about whether fascists and narcissists will kill and abuse people who I don’t know personally.

    Edit: I may not have made it clear enough that I do not think that I am being morally virtuous by doing this, as I have decided the best thing I can do about evil in myself and the world is “don’t think about it”.

      I *think* that, *theoretically*, someone reading the rest of your message might have inferred that. You weren't exactly being subtle. Or even coy. :P

      Also, you totally learned the wrong lesson from all this, but... I'm... glad you're not making yourself depressed anymore?
