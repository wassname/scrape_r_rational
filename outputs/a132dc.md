      The closest person to a friend she had was that one girl Cat murdered.

      Cat and Black went around killing or tearing the souls out of everyone Akua either liked, loved, or found the most useful to her.

      Then Cat tore her heart out of her chest with her bare hand.

    ```
    >"Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!"

    I laughed, but thinking about it, this really is probably exactly how Praesi think of friendships. In Ubua's eyes, her (likely) killing Cat here is exactly what a friend would do, especially since it will likely empower her and deprive their mutual enemy, Sve Noc, of said power. Praesi friendship really is about how you can use your friends to get ahead and stick it to your enemies.
    ```

    - u/Locoleos:
      ```
      Yeah, but then again, the Calamities pretty much played the "power of friendship" thing straight, and proceeded to use it to wipe the floor with all of Praes.
      Why, there's even a chance that Ubua is trying to help Catherine here.
      ```

  - u/notagiantdolphin:
    ```
    Hey, she might be going for that weird heart construction that the King (and later Masego) stuffed into her chest to rework it and limit Sve Noc's powers!

    Okay, who am I kidding, she's totally betraying her.
    ```

    - u/Malek_Deneith:
      ```
      My money is on Akua shoving that shard of Winter she stole back into Cat. Doesn't seem like a right junction to betray Cat right now. Even if that succeeded, and she managed to put down both Cat and Sve, she'd still be stuck in Everdark, without support (given that mantle seems to decide the titles of people endowed with Winter it's unlikely Akua would inherit title of Sovereign of Moonless Nights, and that'd mean no obedience from Peerage and rest of Cat's army), with Archer likely still out there and pissed off, and with exit closed off by dwarven army. The odds of this working out in her favor are terrible, and Akua is too smart to take a gamble like that, especially given that her current long term goal is just to survive.

      Helping Cat however looks better. Cat has been consistently hitting above her weight, so betting on her beating Sve in a second round is not that dangerous. And if they win, even if she had to sacrifice that bit of Winter she had, well... Collar Fair was useful, Collar Fairy would be less useful without Winter powers, yes? So maybe grant back some Winter. Hell, I'd imagine she'd try angling for full Winter title in this scenario.

  A lot of webfiction stories throw banter in at inappropriate times (namely moments of high tension which acts to diffuse said tension) and as i was reading this chapter i was ready to say how, regardless of how humorous the banter was, it was detracting from the impending climax...but honestly it ended up so fucking hilarious and entertaining that EE brute forced his way through whatever narrative heuristics would normally apply.

      Honestly, I think it's pretty common to guide-verse villains, with their inevitable loss being a cultural thing.

      Black gave it a go too, although he was much less blasé about it than Catherine.

    - u/Valdrax:
      ```
      Eh, the heroes of this setting are on average *much* less snarky than the villains.  Some heroes get to be boisterous or easy-going, but sarcasm and mockery seem to be mostly outside their wheelhouse.

      Also, many people have pointed out that Callowan spite has fit better with Below than Above.
      ```

      - u/Rice_22:
        ```
        >*Eh, the heroes of this setting are on average much less snarky than the villains.*

        Well, I suppose. I feel that's more because Catherine's the protagonist though and we don't get too much focus on interaction between heroes themselves.

        Also, William is too grim and White Knight too serious to joke. All the "Lovable Rogue" characters that would normally be heroes in other stories are now under Catherine's banner, except maybe Bard?
        ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I thought it got irritating after a while, and was extremely satisfied when Rumena told Cat exactly how stupid her plans were, and even more when he got Cat to shut up by bumping her around.

    Like, I get that sounding low-class and unsophisticated is Cat's style, but that gets repetitive *fast*, especially when against someone with absolutely zero charisma or depth like Sve Noc.
    ```

    - u/sparkc:
      ```
      I can sympathise and i certainly had the same attitude at the beginning of the chapter. I also agree that the shtick gets overused at times. From the moment Cat was dropped off near Sve Noc though it was just pure entertainment for me.

- u/swaskowi:
  ```
  Err, so that was awesome and all... but I can’t parse whether Ubua is actually trying to help or just murdering Cat, like friends do. Though murdering Cat is probably helpful in that it will throw a wrench in whatever plans Sve Noc has to perpetuate her usurpation of Cat’s mantle.

  Also, is there any chance there’s tatters of Squire hanging about, now that she’s all mortal again? I wasn’t clear on the exact mechanics of her losing it in the first place.
  ```

  - u/Agnoman:
    ```
    >Also, is there any chance there’s tatters of Squire hanging about, now that she’s all mortal again? I wasn’t clear on the exact mechanics of her losing it in the first place.

    Her mantle basically subsumed the Name of Squire. She still had it, technically, but we've had a lot of lines like:

    > My mantle and my Name woke, intertwined beyond separation

    and

    >It would have been a lie, though, to still call myself the Squire. No one did anymore. I could still feel the bare bones of that Name, some days, but the flesh and muscle over them was Winter’s. Whatever I’d done in Liesse, when I had broken Masego’s scaffolding, it had ended my tenure. I had no aspects anymore, only the power that my mantle lent me.

    Combine that with how she's spoken about having lost any and all power, and no mention of anything like a Name or Name abilities, and she's almost certainly just a plain old human at this point.
    ```

    - u/BlackKnightG93M:
      ```
      Now I wonder, can a normal pleb also use stories to come out on top? 

      I really wouldn't mind if Cat no longer had access to her mantle and was just a plain old sassy, squishy mortal picking fights with things several orders of magnitude above her weight class. 

      Everybody loves the scrappy underdog after all...
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        Yep, I think they can, how do you think new names are made? Some names are foreign or twisted, like Heirophant, or Black Queen, names that share roots with other names, but are also Parallels. 

        Heirophant v. Warlock; a Heirophant being a sage of miracles and learning, while a warlock is of curses and hoarding power. Black Queen v. Queen of Callow; an even clearer parallel, Queen of Callow is a name for the queen of Callow of the gods above, Black Queen is for the Gods Bellow.

        But what if someone wanted to craft a new name out of neutral power? I have said many times that there are no Neutral names, and that even 'neutral' named have a clear allegiance, like Ranger to Bellow, as a name has too draw power from somewhere.

        However, what if a particularly ambitious mortal killed a couple of fairly neutral Godlike entities, say a highly ranked fae noble and the source of the Drows power, in a feat of such dastardly heroics that it makes an a new name from that power? One that is not reliant on above or below for its aspects?

        God I hope this comes true, it would be so rediculously badass.

  >“Since murder doesn’t seem to be working out for me, I’ll try bribery,” I continued. “Betray… who is it you’re working for at the moment?”

  Cat, you are laughably bad at this at whole situation. 

  >“You are a surprisingly terrible liar,” Mighty Rumena said

  Like, every part of this situation.

  >“You warred against an entity older than the civilization that birthed you,” the Mighty said. “Wielding weapons in which it holds superior mastery, following a plan laughably straightforward and fielding armies which owed you no true loyalty. All this, and somehow you believed you would win.”

  Rumena calling it how it is. Cat really did not think any of this through. She had a half-hearted plan to deal with the Longstrides, which was fairly terrible and failed immediately, and *no* plan to deal with Sve, who she knew would be making her play at the battle of Great Strycht. This is the logical outcome.

  >“I believe you might be the single most aggressively ignorant creature I’ve ever encountered.”

  Look, I know Mighty Rumena is kind of a huge dick, but I can't help but find myself agreeing with a lot of what it's saying.

  >Ah, and there it was. The reason it hadn’t just nonchalantly torn off my head back when it’d first found me choking on my death in the middle of a broken wreck. I was still of use somehow. A sacrifice to cement Sve Noc’s hold on my domain?

  Oh, I was wondering why Rumena hadn't immediately killed her last chapter. But this is still not good for Cat's long-term survival.

  > I’d earned the mantle through murder, back in the old days of about two years ago.

  How time flies. I really need to go back at some point and look at all the timeskips, maybe make a bit of a timeline.

  > The droplet that tipped the cup was that even as I began spewing out clear water and bile the Mantle of Woe fell down over my face, smothering it all over my face.

  Right, Cat still has the mantle of Woe. I wonder if this will become relevant.

  More seriously, taking magic items from prisoners seems like it should be basic protocol. Whether the prisoner is basically powerless or not, I don't think anyone would want to have to deal without whatever shenanigans their artifacts might potentially be able to get up to. Case probably in point - the rest of this book.

  >It glanced at Sve and found no answer there – she seemed a little miffed by my refusal to take this seriously 

  I'm vaguely surprised that Sve gave up trying to humble Cat after a single failure. She went from inflicting unspeakable terror onto Cat for her backchat, to engaging Cat in a little back-and-forth, standing around while Cat enjoys a smoke and gets her digs in. Why's Sve even dragging this out? You'd figure she'd be keen to complete her apotheosis now that she finally has the opportunity.

  >In the absence of an actual scheme, it seemed like I was going to have to bluff a living goddess. 

  Well, there goes the idea that Cat planned for this outcome. And Cat, you just had an object lesson in how bad you are at lying.

  >“Why so many warriors, Sve?” I asked, opening my eyes. “Witnesses, honour guard? Nah, this is best left quiet. Not the kind of knowledge you want floating out there. I think it’s a statement of power. A reminder of hopelessness, to break me down. But if that’s the case, why these warriors?”

  This seems like a weird idea.

  First off, all these Drow are nothing compared to Sve's own power, as she proves a moment later, so bringing them as a statement of power is weird. Secondly they're the wrong Drow to bring, as Cat herself mentions a moment later, and so bringing them doesn't prove anything except that she can't bring Cat's army. Thirdly, why would Sve care about breaking Cat? Sve's literally about to kill her, as of which moment Cat's opinions will matter to nobody, and she literally just gave up on tormenting Cat and instead stood there while Cat asked for a smoke and wiped vomit on one of the Mighty, which is about as far from "breaking her down" as she can get.

  >Sure, I would have made you servants.

  Slaves, Cat. The word you're looking for is slaves. If, that is, slaves were forced to obey any and all orders in the spirt they were given or face instant death. So a word worse than slaves? Either way, if you're going to go down this road,Cat,  at least own it.

  >the same happened all around me, every Longstride messily collapsing. 

  Did Rumena die? That could be important. It's in Sve's interests to keep this quiet so you'd think she'd kill it too, but Sve's handling of this execution thus far has been pretty sloppy. Which it has to be, I know: Sve holds all the cards here and wants to kill Cat, but if she's allowed to kill Cat then the serial ends.

  >“Then fear me, drow,” Akua Sahelian announced, “for I wield the power of friendship.”

  Okay, that's a great line.

  No clue how Akua is going to help out here. Sve can kill Cat casually at any moment she chooses, gaining control of both the mantle and Akua with it, and Akua doesn't hae anything close to the power needed to stop that from happening.

  Maybe Akua is planning on killing Cat herself, before Sve can get to it? I wouldn't rate that as likely, but she needs some sort of creative solution to the problem at hand.
  ```

  - u/IgnatiusFlamel:
    ```
    Narrative Logic applies here:

     * Cat has been stripped of nearly anything that marks her identity. The readers can ignore that because she is the viewpoint character, but in-universe, the Mantle of Woe is one of the last things clearly pointing at Cat and signifying "This is Catherine Foundling, the Queen of Winter".
    So her Mantle remaining may be necessary to the Sacrifice thing Sve Noc is trying to achieve.

     * Sve's behavior isn't rational - her long use of her domain has warped her mind into certain habits and perspectives that offer her little flexibility and even less lateral thinking. **This is even called out in the current chapter concerning the mismatch of "Drow madness" and "Winter madness"**

     * Cat aims to "tell a story" in front of an audience. The bluff of a plan in front of witnesses inclined for treason is merely a first brush at painting something.

    The Archer - Cat dialogue earlier highlighted this rare trait of Catherine: Her true superpower is being a literal main character:

    She always acts as if the universe is an audience, paying attention to her. Inside an universe running heavily on narrative logic, this offers her incredible agency. Why?

    Because by "entertaining" the readers, she gains plot armor and the entire story itself will bend to ensure her continued existence (through whatever setbacks and "penultimate" failures) there might be.

    Catherine seems like a surprisingly talented "brawler" at story-fu:
    She intuits certain narrative laws & trends, then outplays her opponents on a meta-level that is often one or several tiers higher than they can imagine.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      >So her Mantle remaining may be necessary to the Sacrifice thing Sve Noc is trying to achieve.

      This is speculation with nothing to back it up, and requires another few layers of assumption to be added in for it to make sense.

      I think it's much more likley that Rumena just made a mistake.

      >Sve's behavior isn't rational

      I'll say it isn't. She has two goals here, apparently, kill Cat and to "break [her] down"and she's very bad at following through on either of those tasks. She's making no progress on the murder front - which, fair enough, monologuing is a time-old tradition - but her actions on the breaking Cat front don't add up to anything after a single, failed attempt at torture and gathering up minions who are counterproductive to the actual goal.

      >This is even called out in the current chapter concerning the mismatch of "Drow madness" and "Winter madness"

      You quotes "Drow madness" and "Winter madness", but those words never actually appeared in the chapter. Hell, I don't think they've ever appeared in the *series*.

      What the chapter *did* say was that Winter alienation means nothing to Sve, because she's so far gone into whatever it is the Night has done to her. What this means for her mental state, there's no way to know. 

      But none of this explains what Sve is doing. She's not just *sub optimal*, she's *inconsistent*. Which is weird when she was called out as "static". Again, she tortures Cat for backchat, then stands around while she  snarkily requests a smoke and wipes vomit on the Mighty.

      EDIT: The closet I can come to an explanation here is that Sve gave up on this goal of breaking Cat after her failed attempt.

      >Cat aims to "tell a story" in front of an audience. The bluff of a plan in front of witnesses inclined for treason is merely a first brush at painting something.

      >The Archer - Cat dialogue earlier highlighted this rare trait of Catherine: Her true superpower is being a literal main character:

      >She always acts as if the universe is an audience, paying attention to her. Inside an universe running heavily on narrative logic, this offers her incredible agency. Why?

      >Because by "entertaining" the readers, she gains plot armor and the entire story itself will bend to ensure her continued existence (through whatever setbacks and "penultimate" failures) there might be.

      Sorry, but I'm not sure what this point is meant to address. I take it that you raised this up in response to something specific I said, but I can't tell what that was.

      I don't dispute that Cat tries to focus on the narrative (Even if she's made some questionable decisions as of late - see also, the entire Sve-Cat conflict thus far), but I also don't see how it ties what's happening here or my comment?

      In general, though, I think there's a couple of thing to keep in mind here:

      One is Cat seemingly no longer has a Name - it got ripped out with her soul and the mantle. She's an ordinary human without a Role to fulfil, at the moment. This makes it kind of hard for her to leverage her Role for story purposes.

      The second is that there's a limit to what stories can do: we had the example of Will vs Urulan, and the sort of story it would take for Will to have even a chance in a fight, given to us earlier and the gap between Cat and Sve right now is exponentially larger.

      >Catherine seems like a surprisingly talented "brawler" at story-fu: She intuits certain narrative laws & trends

      Reminder that Cat apparently didn't realise that there were any stories going on in the Everdark at all, until Archer pointed out all the obvious coincidences to her. It doesn't help that she's quite unfamiliar with Drow stories, unless she's been having Ivah tell them to her offscreen. And Black just recently showed us all the danger of that.

    >Why's Sve even dragging this out? You'd figure she'd be keen to complete her apotheosis now that she finally has the opportunity.

    It seems fairly clear, Sve Noc is waiting for the right moment in whatever metaphysical process she's going through to sacrifice Catherine and complete her apotheosis. Doing it before she's ready would probably result in botching it.

     'Whatever she was doing, it wasn’t finished. Considering the altar in front of me, the shape of the conclusion was rather obvious'

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    > Why's Sve even dragging this out?

    This is not complicated.  Sve is the very opposite of practical evil; she's classic Villainy further warped by millenniums of exposer to Night.  She has no agency to interfere when her opponent is monologuing.  Cat even compared her to Fae in terms of how static she is.
    ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      > She has no agency to interfere when her opponent is monologuing.

      Well, she does. Hence the drowning Cat in terror after she makes her first snarky comment. Sve just seems to give up on responding to sarcasm or flagrant disrepect afterwards. I thought this was weird in part *because* of her static nature.

      But we'll have to see whether Sve keeps dragging things out with Akua making a play.
      ```

      - u/Thrown42694269:
        ```
        But that interference, essentially yelling "Silence!" is totally within the classic evil wheelhouse. 

        If she'd just stabbed cat,  it wouldn't fit.
        ```

  - u/Mountebank:
    ```
    Maybe Cat did plan for this but she erased her memories of the plan to stop herself from leaking the plan to Sve after losing her powers and becoming vulnerable. We've already had an arc with memory shenanigans, so we know it's possible, and there's still the "folly" keyword thing that still hasn't been explained yet.

    - u/vimefer:
      ```
      She needed Masego's assistance to seal away memories, though. Folly is a clear reference to ~~Akua~~ Ubua. We'll see soon enough whether her reciprocating Cat's hand-to-heart is part of the plan or mere treachery.

      Sure you can. "Your homeland is about to go bye-bye, I'll let you get on this boat and sail to safety as long as you swear eternal servitude without wages afterwards" is still slavery by any reasonable definition.
      ```

    - u/Agnoman:
      ```
      A few definitions of slave for you:

      From the oxford dictionary:

      >1 a person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them.

      >1.1 A person who works very hard without proper remuneration or appreciation.

      >1.2 A person who is excessively dependent upon or controlled by something.

      From the Collins dictionary:

      >1 countable noun A slave is someone who is the property of another person and has to work for that person.

      >2 countable noun You can describe someone as a slave when they are completely under the control of another person or of a powerful influence.

      From the Merrian-Webster dictionary:

      >1 : a person held in servitude as the chattel of another

      >2 : one that is completely subservient to a dominating influence



      Whereas servant is defined as:

      >1 A person who performs duties for others, especially a person employed in a house on domestic duties or as a personal attendant.

      ,

      >1 countable noun A servant is someone who is employed to work at another person's home, for example as a cleaner or a gardener.

      >2 countable noun You can use servant to refer to someone or something that provides a service for people or can be used by them.

      or 

      >one that serves others

      respectively.

      The definitions for slave are much more fitting. The Drow are controlled absolutely by Cat, and are allowed only as much freedom as she gives them. Remember, one of the oaths is:

      >you will follow the orders of the Sovereign of Moonless Nights without intent to subvert or pervert the spirit in which they were given

      and breaking it means instant death. There's an argument to be made that they are an extension of her will, which is far more than property. They recieve no wages, and Cat is happy to have them die for the sake of tactical advantage (impressing Soln with her ruthlessness).


      As for the definition of servant... none of it really fits? I guess they perform duties for Cat, but not domestic duties, and they *do* serve her, but to a degree that's far outside the boundaries of what a servant would usually do.

      I really have no clue how you could argue for "servant" over "slave" here, but if you've got a different perspective I'm happy to listen to it.

      > Nobody forced the drow to swear oaths in exchange for Night

      Except for the part where it was join or die, right?
      ```

      - u/Azzazeal:
        ```
        >Except for the part where it was join or die, right?

        Did she make every drow take oaths though? I thought only those that bid at her auction were made to take them. And the Sigil leaders.

        &#x200B;

        You could probably argue that the Peerage are slaves(except Ivah). But all the others were not forced to bid in the auctions.
        ```

      - u/tavitavarus:
        ```
        To be fair as Cat points out in this chapter the drow, particularly the nisi, were essentially slaves already: bound to the Night, the Sve Noc and the Gods Below. They were doomed to endlessly slaughter each while living in ruins, with no real hope of release or a better future. And with the invasion of the dwarves; genocide was inevitable.

        She could have evacuated them without requiring oaths or service, but that would just have unleashed a nation worth of treacherous, homicidal maniacs on the surface. The oaths are the only real way to reform a society obsessed with betrayal up to the point where they can function as part of wider Calernia.

  > “You warred against an entity older than the civilization that birthed you,” the Mighty said. “Wielding weapons in which it holds superior mastery, following a plan laughably straightforward and fielding armies which owed you no true loyalty. All this, and somehow you believed you would win.”

  I mean, that's a good summary. What's the point of this arc again?

    It's like a training arc in a shounen anime. Cat's going to learn the secret to apotheosis and become even stronger just in time to match the crusaders who have started calling down the Gods Above to fight for them.

      ```
      ... yeah, and these training arcs are often really lame.

      How many people do you know who think "Wow, I sure am glad Daenerys spent two books/seasons messing around, destroying cities we don't care about and making dumb decision after dumb decision that will be completely irrelevant once she gets back to the main plot!" ?

        I very much enjoyed Daenerys' rise to power arc. My second favorite arc in the show by far.

    Character development!

      That has to be sarcas... oh, wait.

    Yeah, this whole arc feels like a side-quest that’s just retreading a lot of the same ground.  Another chapter of Cat wondering about how her relationship with Akua.  Another chapter of Cat wondering if she’s doing the right thing.  Another Chapter where Cat very nearly gets killed by some low-tier enemy and realizes she needs to take these fights seriously.  

    How short a lot of these updates feel certainly doesn’t help matters.  How many updates lately have consisted of Cat having a single conversation with someone?  It’s like the in-between missions phase in an RPG where you go talk to all the companions until their dialogue is exhausted.

    I don't know if this is considered the worst arc of this story yet, but I think it probably should be for this reason alone.

  I'm glad I was mostly incorrect about Oath Shenanigans being the solution here. Cat does not seem to be very competent though, what the heck was her plan in the first place?

    Same as always cause chaos,drag them down to her lvl and beat them with experience.

      Yeah, you seem to be right. I don't know why I expected anything more, despite the whole Akua's Folly unknown.

  So... The Queen of Lost and Found... It certainly looks like she just Lost Winter, so I wonder what it is that she's going to Find
  ```

  ```
  Interesting to note that whatever Sve Noc wants Cat for, she doesn't have to be sane/coherent. Otherwise, Rumena wouldn't have risked Cat looking at the raw Winter.
