## [WIP][D][BS] National Novel Writing Month: Week 3

### Post:

This is a general purpose thread for anything you'd like to talk about for National Novel Writing Month, which is currently in progress.

* Want to check in your some progress?
* Want to talk about what you're writing?
* Out of ideas and want some help?

Feel free to make posts to the subreddit if you crank out a chapter you want to share, have a meaty question you want some help with, or something like that; this is more a place for things that aren't quite substantial enough to warrant their own posts.

  36,778 so far. Plot is picking up. Having a lot of fun with some exploratory scenes and such, after I realized that just sticking to my pre-made outline is pretty limiting in terms of the material I'll have in my first draft.

  If I told you that someone lost their 'sense of existence' what would you think the ramifications/symptoms would be?

    I guess I would associate "sense of existence" with some level of self-awareness, though I'm not sure that's what you mean by it. Like, maybe you'd get someone who's incapable of introspection and continues on with a sort of mechanical inertia, unable to think about their own internal processes anymore. I wouldn't think that a loss of a sense of existence would come with a loss of senses, which is part of what makes it difficult. So ... someone who can't say, "I think therefore I am" because the first part of that is now unintelligible to them.
    ```

    - u/brandalizing:

      That's definitely a part of it. The person in question is not aware of his own existence. Everything he does now is by reaction or habit. He won't even respond when addressed, because he doesn't recognize that he is being addressed. I would say that he can't even think the term "I", but he might be able to by habit of thought. He just won't *hear* himself think that, because he no longer hears his own thoughts.

      Beyond that, though, he has no instinct for self-preservation, either. If the building he is in bursts into flames, he'll just sit there, because he doesn't recognize he is in danger, because he doesn't recognize any "he".

      â€¦I feel like the more I try to explain it, the less clear my explanation becomes.

  Approaching 200 pages now, three more chapters to go before Act 1 and Act 2 are more or less complete. Getting a little concerned about length, as this is only about 1/3rd of the story. I'm caught between thinking "I have to write this scene so the rest of the story is meaningful, can't rush it" and "I just want to get this done so I can get to the awesome parts". Not sure if there's a solution other than just keep writing and edit later.

  Another week, another chapter.  Still on track for 10k words.

  I had this brilliant plan:  finish "The Change Storms: Induction" in October, then write a new novel, "Autumn's Acceptance" for NaNoWriMo.

  Wow, talk about about the planning fallacy.

  I'm most of the way through NaNoWriMo and I'm not done with TCS:I yet.  Furthermore, I've only written 16,240 words on it as of 10:46am 2015-11-21.  There are two reasons for this: first, I do a lot of research.  I spent hours poring over Google Maps trying to figure out what my characters will see when they go into the town of Vermillion, Ohio.  (Which is a real place, obviously.)  Second, I'm publishing it a chapter at a time over on my Patreon, so I spend a lot of time editing, which is time I'm not spending writing. 

  I haven't been entering my word counts because I was thinking "no, I can't because I'm not working on the novel I was intending to work on."  Feh.  Okay, forget that.  I'm going to list my wordcounts for TCS:I, not counting the 63,480 words that were already written before November.  I can, in theory, still win NaNoWriMo if I can produce 3,370 words per day.  It seems unlikely, but I've been telling myself I need to step up my game and get more efficient.  So.  No more researching -- I'm past the part where I need to do that anyway, so that's good.  Editing still needs to happen, but I'll try to be more efficient about that as well; I'm going to publish this thing after it's complete, so there will be another editing pass then.

  Onwards!

  I'm not a hundred percent sure that I'm going to make it. I'm not *horribly* behind, but I am behind. Today is the day of the big D&D thing I've been planning, so hopefully I can make my targets a little better once it's done.

    ```
    I've recently read through your story and I wanted to know if you have thought of how mentalists relate to recursion? Mentalists can access nearly any of their own memories through their mind palace, but they also have memories of their experience in their mindscape examining their memories. Can they interact or do anything to those meta-memories? I'll also point out the possibilities of meta-meta-memories and so on.
