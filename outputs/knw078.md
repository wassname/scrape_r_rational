        Morphing tech is a relatively new invention, remember.

        According to r!Animorphs canon, when the meteor hit in Ventura, the "gate" that brings Cassie's original body back from the pocket dimension (the nanotechnology that swims around in the Animorphs' bloodstreams) was fully destroyed.  Like, if you shoot the morph body, the nanotechnology is still fine.  But if you *vaporize* the body, the nanotechnology is gone, too.
        ```

    - u/philh:
      ```
      Does anyone (especially Jake) still have a Cassie morph? That seems like the obvious way for her to come back, but I don't think anyone's survived that long.

      Another possibility is that it's a flashback chapter, but I don't think that's very likely either.
      ```

        Jake was resurrected from a backup after he acquired Cassie, and nobody else had her pattern either.

  "*Hmm, the smooth, dangerous ships pouring across the bridge, it almost feels like*-"

  Thousand-yard stare, flashback to the Rachel chapter

  "...*it would be really, really bad if these were Howlers*."

  Grisly, shocking, nightmarish. This is the most horrifying chapter I've read - probably of anything - in memory.

  Incredibly compelling stuff, as always. Couldn't tear myself away, as always. Great way to ring in the new year.

  Completely did not even consider that the Howler icon V3 downloaded from the big sky computer came complete with, like, brains and guts and stuff. Here I assumed it was just a hollow 3D model like you'd see in a video game - just a statue of a Howler. Hmm, knowing now that the model was a little more detailed, I wonder why the Visser didn't already have notes on Howler strengths and weaknesses - not even in like an "oh yeah I remember now, the anuses are behind the knees" type of way. I guess he just never thought he'd encounter one in battle, so it didn't hook his curiosity beyond the obvious 5G brain stuff.

  Also, MAN was that ever satisfying to read. Like, unholy amounts of terrifying, seeing how vast and powerful the Visser has become, but so much fun to experience. It really, really captured what (I assume) it would actually be like to have 200k instances of yourself, and grand, sweeping control over all of them. Is there anything left that can and would take him out besides a quantum virus or the literal Care Bears convincing him to be friends with everyone?

  I'm so pumped that we might actually, really, for realziez be in the actual for-real home stretch now.

  P.S. I've been toying with the idea of doing a sort of "Annotated r!Animorphs" - like, a chapter-by-chapter document with little footnotes and highlights and things, like a spoilery guide for people going back through, drawing specific attention to puzzles that got solved later or spelling out things that only got implied in the text. I feel like it would help me personally to keep the trillion threads organized in my head, and could be useful as a refresher or reference material or whatever. Definitely not for first-time readers. Obviously it would take some time to produce and could use other eyes for input as well. Would anyone be interested in this?

    Also, in the Rachel dream, Cassie showed up from nowhere for some reason. Seeing the future chapter titles, I guess we're still on track for that.

  ```
  Didn't follow that last part. So, the howlers are herding folks into a stadium, and Marco decides to nuke them all, to spare them the pain of being toyed with by howlers? I feel like I'm misreading.
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    I think you have the idea right, but not the motive.

    For some reason, the Howlers regard this group of people as valuable.  We don't know why, and Marco doesn't know why, but if something is valuable to an enemy, there may be tactical benefit in denying it to them.

    They may be holding these people for ransom, or for interrogation, or to preserve a breeding population, or maybe just for sport.  Rescue would obviously be the preferable option, but if that's not possible (and it doesn't currently seem to be), then Marco's action is his only way of denying the Howlers whatever benefit they're planning to get from the people.

    If it turns out they were hosting a peace accord between Howlers and humans in that stadium, then I'm sure that Marco will feel horrible about that decision.  That, or anything similarly benign, seems like a low-probability guess, though.
    ```

    - u/Quibbloboy:
      ```
      There's also the fact that he gets to take out a meaty handful of ships in the fireball

      Edit: But if I personally had to guess, I'd assume the people are about to be hellishly massacred and Marco's mostly just trying to give them a quicker death
      ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Yeah, it felt like the Howlers were setting up a large scale Battle Royale or something similar. Either way it as going to be gruesome.
    ```

- u/Meykem:
  ```
  *I had thought-speak.*

  *I held the image of the alien invaders in my mind—the cracked skin, the pinched torso, the unearthly howl—*

  *‹EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE—›*

  I'm really glad this happened even though it didn't work, and serves them right.



  *Jake looked up as I entered the bridge, and I swear I actually stumbled.*

  *He looked—*

  *Old.* 

  *Weathered.  Cold.  Like—like Stonehenge, or dinosaur bones, or  something—old enough that all the soft parts had eroded away, and what  was left would last for ten thousand years.*

  Spoiler for Animorphs canon that is possibly relevant to The Reckoning's next chapters:

  >!I have a bit more appreciation now for Crayak's fear and rage toward Jake for being able to tap into the howlers' collective memory and already being too calloused to really be affected by it, while his own capacity for love causes significant shift in them. And he doesn't just give them a desire to kiss either, since Edriss is arguably the most loathsome mortal character in the series and she loves being in love. !<Sorry if I'm digressing too much, I just found the description of the howlers' rampage and the Marclones' frustration impactful.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Honestly the canon resolution of the Howler fight was kind of a copout, and only really works in a children's book.

    I really don't think morphing a Howler is gonna solve anything here.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I dunno, I mean it's one thing to be like "the power of love overwhelmed them," but of all creatures that might be maximally distractible by hedonistic pleasure seeking through kissing instead of killing, it kind of makes sense for them.

      Of course the real (horrifying) outcome is likely to just be that they start mixing killing *and* kissing, but yeah.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        First off, yeah, it's not like sexual awakening is going to make their war crimes *less* horrifying.

        Second, people only change if they have incentive to. For the yeerks, both in this fic and in canon, that incentive took the form of "we just killed thousands of you motherfuckers and we'll do it again if we have to".

        The canon resolution for Howlers didn't really have anything stopping them from going to back to murderhoboing once they got bored of love and frienship.

  I think you should remove the mention of COVID-19 and keep the timeline vaguely specified.
  It takes away from the story by how COVID was never mentioned before, and still has unforeseeable consequences in the real world, so it might diverge from in-universe.

  The timeline can not be before 2020, and it can not be during 2020 or 2021, so it must be much later - but then if it plays out differently in real life you just have a weird alternative timeline trivia thing for no useful reason. 

  The line just felt jarring and broke my immersion completely.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Upvoted, but I've had this concern raised before, and I disagree.

    Five years from now, COVID-19 will be part of the fabric of history in *exactly* the same fashion as 9/11; people would have objected (in 2002) to a 9/11 mention but today take it completely in stride, and indeed today would consider it weird if a vaguely-present-or-near-future story did *not* have 9/11 sort of baked into its past.

    I get that this is a cost I'll be paying in the moment (I am not dismissing your loss of immersion), but I strongly believe it's the right cost to pay, and that this will be the better way to go in the long run, esp. since the fic has been roughly pinned down to the late 2020's by a few little bits of data here and there (a day of the week given a specific date, Mattis referred to as the former Secretary of Defense, etc).  This universe's Marco lived through it as a small child, and was hearing about it all throughout elementary and middle school; it's absolutely "the sort of thing he would think of when trying to put a weight on a large number of deaths."
    ```

    - u/GreenSatyr:
      ```
      I love where you are going with this line of thinking, but on the other hand if you're going for posterity, no one says "one month of spanish flu" right? They say "the spanish flu" and the total dead.

      It makes sense to say "one month of covid" to us right now, but pandemics after they are over are viewed as discrete events, with a kill count. (Granted, your average readership might not be *that* far in the future that covid will be like the spanish flu)
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        I'm willing to bet "a thousand deaths a day for most of the pandemic" will remain a common phrase in America for a good while to come, but yeah, it is a bit of a risk.

        ```
        Unless the Covid pandemic becomes (bi)annual.
        ```

    - u/Meriipu:
      ```
      I think a distinction here is ongoing vs done. Much can still change with COVID, and there may yet be be events up until the late 2020s which diverge from the background history of the story.

      At that point I see it coming down to either updating previous chapters or declaring the divergence to be an AU-quirk.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        I agree I'm gambling.  But ... I *am* actually gambling.  Like, I do indeed bet that we're halfway through the COVID-19 crisis, and that even if things are significantly fucked up this-time-next-year, it won't be because of COVID-19 specifically (or if it is, it'll be aftershocks/lingering societal effects).
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          Also, it's a pretty easy thing to go back and find/edit if needed. For what it's worth I think it works fine.
          ```

    - u/Meriipu:
      ```
      you are right in that I maybe would have felt differently about it had it been after it is a part of history.

      I am less sure that people in the future will think of it in terms of "one month of COVID", though. That feels a bit more heavy-handed or shoe-horned.
      ```

      - u/callmesalticidae:
        ```
        I'm not so sure. I regularly hear things in terms of "9/11s", so for a prolonged catastrophe like COVID I think it would be natural to chunk it.
        ```

    - u/FenrirW0lf:
      ```
      Wouldn't hurt to backport some covid-19 references into some of the older chapters if/when you ever get the time for it too. I was doing some rereading and definitely saw some spots where it would be prudent.

  ```
  Helllll yes, it's back! Now taking bets as to whether this fic will actually finish before 2022! (Just kidding, we love you TK17... but yeah)

  Love the worldwide Marco POVs - makes everything very epic.

  The beast from the off-world excursion has finally made its reappearance - and it's not enough!

  The howlers are terrifying villains, and I love how the Animorphs are being forced into a scenario in which they have the option of teaming up with Visser 3 (probably still a terrible idea, though). Also love how Visser 3 is getting a chance to go all-out with his fighting. He's burning through all his tricks, which may even the playing field for later on and give the Animorphs a decent shot at taking him out (especially when Tobias shows up again from wherever he is with the Puppyship. Hopefully he's watching the Mars base and seeing how V3 makes the quantum virus so he can replicate it somehow).

  Okay, so given that Cassie is listed as one of the future chapters, I suspect she might have survived the Ventura explosion. It would have taken out her morph body, leaving her awake in the morph emulation, where she could demorph after a delay. I suspected this a long time ago, in fact, but I wasn't sure whether this was plausible (she might have been rendered unconscious in the morph emulation and died as the Z-space machinery collapsed, or might have been forced to demorph into an ongoing fireball where she would have died in her body). It still might not be plausible - maybe the chapter is a Cassie clone from somewhere, or something else.

  Oh yeah, and I never commented on the last chapter because I was busy, but that was great too! Still don't know what's up with Rachel or the whole time-travel thing.

  Very excited for the ending!

  Happy New Years everyone!
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Cassie couldn't demorph after the explosion because the nanotech in the construct body was destroyed too, so she presumably stayed in the Z-space until [something].

    Happy New Year to you too!
    ```

    - u/LieGroupE8:
      ```
      Ah, yeah, I saw another comment that said as much. That makes sense, so Cassie probably survived some other way (assuming the chapter title isn't a red herring).

    In terms of what separates Rachel from the others, the main thing I can think of is that she was in a hypersight moment with Erek and the rest of the Chee. As to why that would make them *more* willing and able to hand weapons to her than Tobias ????

    Checking chapters with Chee stuff to see if I missed anything. Nothing directly relevant to this but...

    >“Yes. It had been the Howlers’ first move, as it turned out—they’d seeded the atmosphere with a plague that took weeks to incubate.

    Ah, beans.

    >The refresh cycle sweeps past once more, and we yield to it like grass beneath a mower’s blade, handing ourselves to the Chee two-forward and receiving ourselves back a moment later.

    I've missed this until now. The refresh cycle goes through the Chee one at a time and presumably wipes them, and the Chee are bypassing that by ~~passing a copy of themselves two ahead then taking themselves back once the cycle has passed them~~ bipassing. Are the refresh cycle and censor two different things? And why would the Chee need to be wiped that often? And who makes friends and also sets them up to have their memories wiped frequently?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Can’t go through to find citations now but my general sense from the story is that the Chee are probably exploiting the heck out of everything they see fit to munchkin in their programming. Cf the Rachel thing and the cycle thing you mention and the bit where Erek dances around what one of the Chee did to commit violence against the Howlers, as far as stuff I can think of without rereading the story.

        - u/None:
          ```
          I would say that I do also expect that it would be very hard to exploit a lot of their programming, since we don't see them e.g. commit violence very often, but to stick with violence as the example, we have at least one example of a Chee seeming to do it (during the Howler attack on the Pemalites.) Basically I would expect that even if the Pemalites are significantly better programmers than we are, a computer bug which is relevant once in a million years is going to be noticed by sentient robots who have million year life spans and can engage in the sort of analysis we see them do in four seconds.

          I may be wrong and maybe the Pemalites were more nuanced in how they chose to design the Chee. The story isn't over yet and I may be misremembering some bits.

  - u/daytodave:
    ```
    > why the Chee can't model Rachel?

    I wonder if we're overthinking this. The two bits of evidence for this are that they call her "the female" instead of her name in the first interlude, and that they give her the weapons despite Erek seeing her kill V3's remote body at the high school. (And I guess indirectly the fact that she's "not suppose to be there".) Both can be explained by Erek deliberately thinking a violent thought right after the hypersight event, so the Censor would wipe his mind before information about Rachel could be shared with the group.

    Are there other examples of the Chee not understanding Rachel besides those two?

      I interpret it as seeing someone else morph back. Even then, they wouldn't necessarily wait two hours for it to happen unless they know more about the morphing tech than they'd get just from that. I dunno though, maybe a few of them were just patient.

      > It sounds not so clever to morph an acquired one.

      Do you have a specific worry here, or just general paranoia? (Which is well-justified, of course.)

      Seems like it could also be really useful. In canon it was basically an instant win against them. I'm not sure TK would make things that easy, but even just being able to read their collective memory would be good, and I think you could do that without giving the host any sensory or other input that would be useful to them. Maybe feed them false info? And of course a howler body would be great in a fight, though that's not necessarily the animorphs' most pressing concern these days.
      ```

      - u/Meriipu:
        ```
        My main concern was whether the collective memory is part of their brain or part of their other biology so that e.g. a yeerk would not be able to stop the sharing.

  I got the impression that Marco Prime was going to do a noble sacrifice and die in the blast on my first read, but on a second run through it’s a bit more ambiguous. It says the bomb will destroy everything in the stadium, and ‘wreck’ a half-mile radius. Is the goose fast enough to get to a point where the explosion will ‘only’ kill and not vaporise the bird body? In any other work of fiction, I’d say this is a textbook heroic sacrifice, but if there’s a character that would mercy kill a stadium with a mini nuke and try to outrun the blast, it’s r!Marco, who is not in the habit of needless sacrifice, especially when this Marco is also 25% of Visser 1. On the other hand, the narration doesn’t give hints that he’s trying to survive, which is why I missed it the first time, and he might not have thought out the possibility of survival, seeing as it didn’t occur to the other 2 that died this chapter.

    The intended interpretation is that he's high up enough and a fast enough flier that he will escape the blast, and if he's not *quite* far enough away and gets knocked out of the sky, he would demorph out of the body and remorph and be fine.

    (Geese can fly 40-50mph in level flight, and faster if they're angling downward, and Marco had twenty seconds to book it as far as possible, so he would make it at least 40% of a mile before the strike actually occurred.)

  So I've been scouring the fic for clues about what time of year it is, and everything seems indicate that this chapter takes place pretty close to Halloween/day of the dead.

  (Than's warning in chapter 30, timestamped by Esplin's chapter immediately prior and Marco's claim a few chapters later that late June was a few weeks away, along the fact that the pool ship was blown up on the 7th of October.)

  That's a nice touch if true, but with that in mind, Thule air force base in Greenland is just about the worst possible place to headquarter the human resistance during a Howler invasion. [Time and Date](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/greenland/thule-air-base)'s sunlight chart tells us that the sun sets on October 30th in Thule, and doesn't rise again until February 10th. They have 24 hours of night. If I were President Tyagi, I'd relocate to the South pole. No doubt they already have significant infrastructure in place left over from building the true ark.

  It's always great to see the Big Bad face off against an Even Bigger Bad, and V3 vs the Howlers is no exception. Fantastic chapter, gave very real "well we're all fucked" vibes to ride off of the horror and hopelessness.

  Well this was a ride. Very compelling story telling as always.

  Also cameo time, which I think I'll just transcribe the thoughts I had about that directly.

  "Yay, I'm in the story."

  Keeps reading and remembers what kind of story it is.

  "Oh no, I'm in the story."

  Thank you though.

    My headcanon is that you got out alive, and kept the others safe, too.

    At least, for that first night.

      Ouch at the caveat, fair though.

      The good news, survival wise, is that I know what genre this is. This is Dragon Ball Z; Feeza's army is invading a new planet, and I am one of the nameless background characters that gets blown up to show how evil the villains are. I think I'd know the only goal I can pursue here is run and hide. Hopefully story!me and Marco set up some hidey holes as a fallback. If not find a cave. Right now what I would really want is a place that's too small for humans to actually enter. Air flow would be an issue, but if I take the other people into a morph with me, we could hide in places the invaders might not even bother to look. 

      I've actually been thinking about story!me's survival chances a bit, though much of that is somewhat tainted by the fact IRL!me has read the story. I can't forget facts I already know and then figure out how I would react with that lesser knowledge; at least not easily. One mistake I think I'd make early one is wanting to be more active at night, darkness is after all good for hiding and even though I'll notice the aliens all leave during the day I'd probably assume they were still watching from orbit or something.

      One thing I noticed though, fully stepping back into the reader role. This whole story, with it's chess match between the gods and their simulated worlds. In a way it makes things like expected value a much more intuitive thing. There are some worlds where story!me lives and some where he dies, and the gods simulations mean that many of these worlds are real to a degree. Only one is instantiated based on the moves that the players make, and those moves are probably independent of an action story!me might choose to make (well there was that chapter where Ellimist does things like altering wind speed to send someone back for their coat, but most people don't get even that level of interest). Instead of saying things like, "I'll do this and then the result will be that and I get to live." One would have to think in terms of general strategies. If I behave in certain ways then the share of worlds where I survive will increase or decrease. The goal then is to find the strategy that would increase the survival chances the most and then the only thing to do is hope the gods pick one of those worlds as the one to actually happen.

  I just noticed the Chee think in sixes, like the humans, yeerks, and andalites with 10, 13, and 7.

  How much of Visser 3's mind did the Chee manage to download during their two hypersight encounters?

  Good Idea or Bad Idea: Hypersight with a howler?

  ...Am I missing something or does this chapter, with the revelation that one can survive a morph body's death, offer an explanation for how Cassie might have survived Ventura?
