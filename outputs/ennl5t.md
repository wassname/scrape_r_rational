## Pyrebound 11.4

### Post:

To jog your memory,>!the last line of 11.3 was "Strange spirits were approaching from the southwest."  Shimrun has just revealed that the ensis inherit the memories of their predecessors, along with his belief that pyres inevitably become tyrannies of the ensis over the common folk or the lugals over the ensis.  We also learned more about Shimrun's upbringing and what went wrong with his plan.!<  Don't know if that helps people who just don't recall where exactly we left off, and always need to hop back and reread last week's installment.

  Ram can't catch a break, but he sure seems to be adapting well to the mess he's in.
