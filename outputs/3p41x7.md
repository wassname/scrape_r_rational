  Minor Nitpick:

  I was rereading the first chapter and the font's off in this sentence,

  > “Yes. **Meta-', Greek prefix, means about or after, so** metacognition’ is to think about thinking. Self-awareness.”

  If you meant to only use it for part of the sentence where part of it is bolded, then I think you shouldn't include 'so' in it as well. It broke my immersion in the story very abruptly.

    I'm terribly sorry, that technical mixup has been remedied accordingly.

    It turns out my migration from a custom markup language to markdown had a kink right there. Thanks for spotting it.

  Welp, I guess I finally have a reason to watch the show

    Another reason would be massive foreshadowing/lore solving. There are plenty of secrets revealed in the show by plot, and many of them have foreshadowing in previous episodes. 

    It's sort of like a mystery to be solved. Sort of.

    Well there's also the fact that it's goddam brilliant.
