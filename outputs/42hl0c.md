  I feel like this is super-extra-ultra-levels ill-advised. Why not record a waveform of himself saying the divine name that grants the Divine Spark, and then play it back, to see what happens on the Windows PC, first of all, before jumping straight to "let's wake up this laptop while it's saying unknown Names"? I appreciate that this character is not super cautious or conservative or properly paranoid, but I really think his actions this chapter will *explode* in his face really soon.

  The software Llull seems like a giant POTENTIAL TRAP to me. I mean, if software and nonliving/unsouled things can't invoke Names of God, then that should have been discovered with tape recorders and playing back digitalized recordings of human voices and so forth approximately as soon as the first names of God were discovered. Initial feasibility tests would discover it's impossible, and then the high-speed ultra-optimized version that could compete with the entire world off of an aging laptop would be spectacularly pointless / useless to actually write. And then, writing Llull at all to be as functional as it apparantly is would be a gigantic, colossal waste of time because everyone would know it wouldn't work before they really started. However, if I was a totalitarian organization (*cough* UNSONG *cough*) worried someone would come up with the Divine Name that gives souls to things and not tell me, as people have already predicted that name's length apparantly(?), I might put out a lot of effort to create a bunch of software that would be a singer's dream if they ever come up with the name to awaken souls... and I'd set it up to seem to work perfectly *except* it would *also* repeat a known name of God that I'd be monitoring for every ten minutes or so, so my agents could quickly home in on the computer as soon as it was granted a soul and running Llull.

  PS: Do parrots repeating names of God have noticeable effects?

    I thought it would be a mild, hobbyist's waste of time, myself.  All it is is a speech synthesizer plugged into a word list and given odd parameters for speed.

    I don't know how the discovered Name logging works, so that may be a lot of effort.

  So now he has a button that casts a random name and records its incantation. Does he really want to match the rest of the world's sweatshop explosion rate?

    He just needs to make sure he's not at the computer at the time.

      As noted [here](http://unsongbook.com/chapter-4-tools-were-made-and-born-were-hands/#comment-571) saying a name the first time isn't dangerous, so discovering it should be OK. 

      It's not explained *how* Llull knows a divine name from random syllables, so that's another problem.

  I predict that the laptop will become a character now.

  Prediction:  The number four will be prominent in this chapter.  Chapter 3 had many threes, including being set 40 * 3^5 days before the discovery of the Vital Name in Chapter 1.  Chapter 2 had many twos, including references to duality.  Chapter 1 had many ones, though that's hard to separate out from the high base rate that I would expect (but that isn't a coincidence!)

  Off to read the chapter...

  EDIT:

  "...he were to buy a second computer? What about a third computer? What about ~~a giant Cray supercomputer...~~ **A fourth computer**"

  "Knowledge brings discord (1), knowledge ripens (2), knowledge is poisoned (3). Men greedily devour the exterior of knowledge,  but the core they do not reach (**4**). "

  "Knowledge was first domesticated in southern Turkey (1) or northern Mesopotamia (2), from which it spread to the rest of the world, although some scholars claim its modern genome owes more to various European ancestors (3). Most historians believe it was first brought to the New World by colonists, but this ignores the existence of native American varieties (**4**)..."

  "I stood up...I placed my hand above it...I started...and I ended"

  This is four sets of four, but that is *probably* a coincidence, as I think I missed at least one thing.

  EDIT2:

  Llull ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull)) has four "l"s
