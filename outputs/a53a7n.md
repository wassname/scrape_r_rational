    I'll take a look.  I strongly disagree with you on Echopraxia, he took the Cthulu of Blindsight and implemented it in small obvious steps along my favored primrose path of transhumanity, and even after reminding me why I only want third generation tech I can explain and build myself, he still hit me with an eldritch horror that is the type of logical conclusion I'd build if I decided to be less sporting or forgot to value lesser intelligences across deep time, but still remembered some of my manners.

        What happened was that he went far in one direction with Blindsight, and some people complained, so he tried to move in the other direction, and...well, there you have it.

        He's hoping that the third book will strike the right balance.

  Something I found after I ran out of new things to listen to on audible and went digging.  Watts, our eminent lord of evolution as Cthulhu, has a series of short stories about spam in a can human spawning wormholes for humanity's progeny/successors through deep time.  It is very in line with both Accelerando and Blindsight/Echopraxia, just taken from the original assumption that a sufficiently paranoid NASA planner having read the aforementioned, and the Bobiverse, went about designing a black-hole powered von-neumann wormhole generator, with  the desire for it to survive until heat death, and chose primates in a can as a fallback intelligence to boost to a generally sub-human but narrowly focused mission AI.

  Edit: I found this thought provoking, and as existentially terrifying as you would expect from Watts.  Feel free to comment on the series, or recommend things similar ( In addition to the above I've read Glasshouse, Saturn's Children, Neptune's Brood, Aurora, Diaspora, Methuselah's Children, Orphans of the Sky, Seven Eves, Passages through the void and the Prime Intelligence Series; and find them similar  enough to not want them as recommendations, but   do suggest them as points of comparison)

  I really enjoyed the freeze frame revolution, so few books are willing to give deep time all the weight and existential force it can have.

  As a standalone story though, I found it had a really bland resolution, even if it was a good example of an uncommon ending type.

  The book would have been stronger it it had been published with the other three stories bundled into it, but even then the part that really holds me is the teaser for the next story in the universe, where there's homes of actual answers and real resolutions outside of "the crew are slaves to an insane ai doing a pointless job for eternity".
