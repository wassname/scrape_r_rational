  Excellent story. 

  It's a bit hard to swallow, but it seems that if you are TDT agent, and (maybe, mistakenly) believe that you a person who is going to accomplish something very important, you should disregard any doubts and act on assumptions that you are sane.

    I don't see how the old maxim to *Believe in the you who believes in yourself* actually applies here.

    The basic reasoning problem here is to consider hypothesis P(Am Jesus | Evidence).  Note that your belief that you're Jesus is not *a priori* evidence of psychosis, except insofar as psychotics are likely to believe they're Jesus Christ.  P(Believe I'm Jesus | Psychotic) * P(Psychotic) = P(Psychotic | Believe I'm Jesus) * P(Believe I'm Jesus).

    So actually, we want P(Psychotic | Believe I'm Jesus) / P(Believe in Jesus | Psychotic).  If the former is 99,999/100,000, then what's the latter?  What fraction of psychotics believe they're Jesus?  We could thus calculate a low probability of being psychotic and have to evaluate the Jesus Hypothesis at the object level, consider P(I'm Jesus | Available Evidence), which would then involve considering the mountain and the Devil *in favor*, considering the quality of my knowledge of what constitutes being Jesus (the strongest argument available for my being Jesus is that I *don't know his story because I'm still living it*), and considering the medication as evidence against.

      I'm not sure I understand what are you trying to show. My argument was more about expected utility: if you decide for all people who believe they are Jesus, *including real Jesus*, then you should continue saving mankind instead of taking medication. 

      (assuming that taking medication is harmful to real Jesus and that there is a non-negligible probability of Jesus existing. I don't believe in both of them, but willing to assume those for the sake of argument).

      I think his point was "Proceed under the assumption that you're Jesus", because if you are, you can bring salvation to all mankind, but if you're just a psychiatric patient, pretty much the worst thing you can do is kill yourself. 1 death * 100,000 psychatric patients < salvation of all mankind; thus, the TDT set of {jesus, 100,000 insane people} acts as if it's Jesus. Assuming, of course, that salvation of mankind is on the table with a reasonably high p.
