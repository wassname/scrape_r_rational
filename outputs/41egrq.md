  I think that one verse is really the only "rational" part of this. Otherwise it's just "boo modernization, yay primitivism"

    Nah, I'm headcanoning that this is how the Old Ones creating the Krork and the Brainboyz.  If anything could ever be said to have spread across the galaxy in the long run, it's Da Boyz.

      Warhammer 40k features many races which want to win against all others. But you never realize that one of them already won. For the endgame condition for Ork is the eternal war!

  Couple of thoughts:

  Is it really the last one of its species? Other than systematic elimination of all others before this one was lifted, the poisoning of the planet would probably not be enough to just eliminate them that fast.

  Could it then not also lift another elements of his species, seeing as it seemed to have obtained a similar level of mental manipulation?

  And even if not, other than the planet being completely devoid of natural resources, could it not find a way off planet for it or its kind?

  In other words, it's a nice enough comic, but it would gain a lot with the removal of the last two pages, the rushed try to get a book-start-book-end concept and to decry "evolution" as "defeated" end up dragging it down. Specially because the great advantage of the mind as an evolutionary element is increasing the possibilities of adaptation, and that concept passes right by this comic.

    Indeed. I've seen this comic before, and I've always wondered why so many people seem to see the ending as the creature making the right choice. Surely even if he's the last of his kind it would have been better if he retained his powers and used it to help other creatures in need? It's not like getting off the planet is the issue either, with his precognitive abilities he could just pretend to join the alien and betray him once he's own board.

    I think it's probably 'Bad man gave him powers  artificially => those powers are bad => choosing to give them up = good'

    We can assume that if the whole species becomes extinct at time *t*, then time *t-sigma* there is one member of the species left. If it's intentional by the alien to wait until there's only one left so it's less likely to betray him, this would make sense.

    That's not to say that it's necessarily the most likely situation, just that it's plausible within the setting.

  I'm a little uncertain, but was the reason for him getting so smart so quickly is because his species' adaptive abilities ended up magnifying his intellect?

    ```
    The telepath started enhancing his mind to make him intelligent and as soon as the creature was self aware his adaptive abilities started working on his brain and continuing his improvements.
