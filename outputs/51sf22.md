## Speculation Regarding Pokemon: The Origin of Species (Spoilers Chapter 35)

### Post:

Recently /u/DaystarEld said that we have seen a lot of the setup for the story, and that relatively soon we will see larger skips in the passage of time.  We've seen Red perform his first experiment, Blue win his first badge, and Leaf publish her first article (though we may not have seen all of the fallout from the first and last of these).

Using what we've seen so far, statements made by the author, general genre-savvy, and the knowledge that the work draws inspiration from HPMOR and Worm, we have a decent basis for Wild Mass Guessing.  I'm also drawing intuitions from my really spotty recollection of the games, show, and movies.  I might not even be right once in the below, but I thought it would be fun to brainstorm a bit.  Please add your own thoughts and predictions :).

*****

######Protagonists

Ok, so first we have our three main characters:

**Red**

It seems pretty likely that Red will become more ambitious, or at least he will find some particular ambition that he is driven to achieve, setting him on some path more direct than his current plan of "1. see a lot of stuff," "2. come up with ideas," and "3. attempt to run a study and publish a paper".  

The "obvious" directions for this seem to be the following:

1. He'll decide to catch 'em all. (More on why I think this is likely later.)
2. He'll join or fight against Giovanni's faction.

He could also stick around with Bill and learn about how container/pokeball tech works (I think this is what Bill studies, largely?), or follow his Psychic studies in some interesting direction.  The former doesn't quite seem in line with the Red's (and the story's) focus on evolution and pokemon biology, and I can't think of exactly what the latter would look like, though it looks likely it will be a component of whatever is coming.

**Blue**

Like [the last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4vopj3/thoughts_on_coolness_and_pacing_in_pokemon_origin/) I made a post about this story, I feel like I have the least to say about Blue.  He'll keep walking the path towards being a Champion.  Depending on what kind of story this is, we could see some interesting things regarding what exactly it means to be "Dark," in this world, and whether there is some correlation with morality.  He's done some things that look pretty cruel, and while these were defensible on utilitarian grounds iirc, it wasn't clear to me to what extent he really cared about whether or not this was the case.  His "Darkness" and relatively low empathy towards pokemon (am I reading him correctly?) set him up for possible conflicts with Red, Leaf, or both.  In any event I expect we'll see him dealing with a public perception of immorality at some point.

Judging by the most recent chapter though, Blue's development seems to be headed in a healthy direction.

**Leaf** 

[Extratextual information](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4vopj3/thoughts_on_coolness_and_pacing_in_pokemon_origin/d60c1wj) suggests that she will increase in popularity, and do something resembling what Valentine did in Ender's Game (though without the false personalities, I expect).  She has strong views, and already sees herself as a public figure.  There was a line from Red's mother in the most recent chapter about how Leaf is a journalist and not a politician, and how this means that she needs to keep moving to the next story -- that ideological stands are for those in politics.  Whether she "enters politics" or not, it seems likely she'll make a stand eventually.  I'm not sure what the narrative will look like though, as I haven't read many stories about people doing public opinion campaigns.  

*****
######Other Players

We've been introduced to several other factions:

**Giovanni and the Renegades**

Giovanni is in some ways the Quirrell to Red's Harry, as he is someone Red looks up to and whose thinking Red greatly respects.  Along with his crew of Renegades, it looks like he's trying to be Cauldron but is having even less success than they had.  Giovanni would totally work as a final boss, but I can also see Red joining him (as mentioned, he thinks similarly, and he was recently wondering about the justice of his society's Renegade policies) or even Blue, if he goes "Dark" or people think he does.  Either could be really interesting.  We still don't know much about Giovanni's overall goals, I don't think, but I imagine his driving motivation to be something like "do what I think will make the world better for humans, disregarding the cost to pokemon, or silly ideas like deontology."

**Mewtwo**

Mewtwo could also be a really good end boss (or perhaps there will be three factions in the end).  He's the most powerful psychic in existence, which makes him a good opponent for Red, who will be studying psychics, and/or Blue, who is Dark.  On top of that, Mewtwo may end up being actually kind of right.  A rational version of what he was up to in the first Pokemon movie would probably be something like a massive slave-revolt among pokemon, or a concerted effort by wilds against humanity.  I can even imagine scenarios in which Red or Leaf end up joining his cause, which -- well, I don't know what that would look like but it would be awesome and satisfyingly weird.  Mewtwo as a Big Bad probably also makes it more likely that we'll see some or all of the protagonists working alongside Giovanni.

**Gym Leaders, Rangers, Etc.**

These guys are basically fighting for the Status Quo.  They'll be an obvious enemy of Giovanni's Renegade faction should it be discovered as an organized network.  They'll fight against natural disasters and attacks by the Legendary Birds, but probably won't do anything too interesting or decisive.  Brock and Misty have received quite a bit of characterization though, so maybe they (along with other Leaders?) will end up doing something noteworthy later on.  We'll also meet the Elite Four eventually, but I don't know what role they'd play, beside being really strong enemies that Blue will have to overcome.

**The Legendary Birds**

The Legendary Birds are a chaos factor pretty explicitly playing the role the Endbringers played in Worm.  An encounter with one of these could easily be the sort of thing that forces Red to start growing more quickly.  He and Blue have sworn to "do whatever [they] could against the trio," and fighting forces of nature like the Legendary Birds is an ambition worthy of a Rational Fic protagonist.  Or, even better, he could try to catch one.  This would tie in to the "catch 'em all" mentality Red/Ash canonically has, is a natural progression of the innovations in pokemon-capturing methodologies that Red has been devising, as well as Bill's research (I think), and would just be super interesting and awesome.  This is a Rational Fic, and the Legendary Birds aren't an intelligent enemy.  While they'll surely play some role in the story, their importance will be limited by the extent to which they can be turned into an intellectual challenge.  I don't think we'll see a bunch of straightforward Enbringer-like battles.

*****

######Final Thoughts

Thinking about the future of the story, I find myself wondering whether the three protagonists will stay together.  It seems to me that the most interesting plots involve the characters joining competing factions, even if the three themselves remain allies.  And even if not, it seems like Red would be better off settling somewhere for a while rather than travelling from Gym to Gym with Blue; likewise with Leaf.  Or maybe Blue will need to take a break at some point and train for a bit.  I don't know.  In any case I think we'll see the three split up eventually, at least temporarily, seeking mentorship opportunities or going on interesting individual journeys or something.  At least, I hope this happens.  It doesn't seem likely that the three will ever have neatly aligned short-term or long-term goals, and if they are all going to be taking part in slightly different stories, it'll be easier for them to start or become involved in interesting plots if they don't need to always be in the same city.

Also, what kind of story is this, exactly?  I actually don't have a good read at all on what the stakes are.  Do you guys think anyone cool will die?  Will everyone awesome be friends forever?

And lastly, does anyone remember anything interesting about that chapter that took place in Unova or something? (EDIT: There is no such chapter, but [DaystarEld somehow managed to figure out what I was talking about anyway](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/51sf22/speculation_regarding_pokemon_the_origin_of/d7ejjsx).)

And /u/DaystarEld: willing to offer any public or private hints?

### Comments:

- u/InfernoVulpix:
  ```
  Looking broad-scale here, you can look at the major events of Origin of Species and, when you compare them to the Kanto games, there isn't much divergence if you reduce the events to a single sentence.  Sure, we haven't had many so far, but 'Team Rocket tries to steal fossils at Mt. Moon' is what happened in the games and this story.  The difference is that in the games the Rockets basically burst into the place and drove off everyone else (except for the protagonist, of course) while here they worked off of a legitimate operation in a much subtler and nuanced plot.

  Given that it very much looks like this story was inspired by the idea of a rational Pokemon world, and not necessarily on a specific rational plot line like HPMOR was, it makes sense that DaystarEld would adapt the events into his setting, fitting them together into a coherent whole instead of establishing something entirely new.

  So, I predict that Team Rocket will become focal points of the story again at Celadon, Lavender, and Saffron.  Those are all locations where the protagonist of the games fought his way through grunts doing evil things, so if we accept the idea of 'adapting game events' then something will happen at or around Celadon Game Corner, Pokemon Tower, and Silph Co.

  The easy one here is Pokemon Tower, oddly enough.  Celadon and Saffron are both places where you find a base of theirs, barge in and beat up everyone, which is not something that would happen in Origin of Species.  To figure out what might happen there, we would have to guess at what sort of events might provoke Red and co. into action against them, even if unknowingly at first like at Mt. Moon.  With Pokemon Tower, though, we have a historical landmark with lots of cultural significance (and, given the way towns appear to be in Origin of Species, lots of religious significance).  There are two things I could guess happens at Pokemon Tower.  1) Team Rocket wants to get at Mr. Fuji for some reason.  Maybe the same sort of thing they did with Dr. Fuji and others, maybe the fan theory of the two being one and the same is truth in Origin of Species and that's the connection, or maybe simply getting his help for something about Ghost types.  2) They want to tear it down.  Between the events of RBY and GS the Pokemon Tower is replaced with a Radio Tower for all of Kanto (don't ask me why they put it in a small town on the edge of the region).  It's entirely possible that Team Rocket is behind an attempt of some sort to tear down the tower and even maybe put up a new Radio Tower.  I rather like this second one, actually, since it gives a nice opportunity to delve more into the culture and religions of Kanto as Leaf weighs in on the topic.

  With Celadon, all I really have is that the Game Corner is relevant.  Maybe Team Rocket has been illegally biasing the machines to turn a greater profit?  It's certainly possible, likely even, but I can't think of how that matters any for Red, Blue, and Leaf.  None of them are the sort to go gambling in a shady place like that, especially with how the others would restrain any one person who for some reason is interested.  I don't even know if it's legal for them to gamble in Kanto at their age.  It's entirely up in the air, anything from kidnapped Pokemon to a kerfuffle about the biased machines to something about Erika herself, though I wouldn't have the slightest clue what.

  Even more so with Silph, in the games you just walk in, see the red 'R', and bring out your Charizard.  If Team Rocket really is in control of Silph, there's little to go off of to guess how that would come to light.  My best idea is that the three go for a tour, and one of them notices something amiss.  It sounds pretty cliche to me, but I don't even have any idea of what Team Rocket would do if they had control over Silph, let alone how much they'd fail to clean up their tracks.

  And all of that stuff above is based on the premise that this is going to stay a rational retelling of the Pokemon world, and not transition into a rational original story in the Pokemon world.  If this next chapter with Bill has him really mixed up with Clefairy then that's another point on the 'retelling' side, and if Bill's just playing a trick using Clefiary then that's a point on the 'original story' side.

  Now, Mewtwo.  From the interlude on him, I see some parallels to the AI in a box concept.  Not that many, since communication is actively avoided and Mewtwo has influence beyond mere communication, but the idea holds true in the sense that Mewtwo is an entity head and shoulders above humanity which humanity created but is attempting to keep sequestered and harmless.  Oh sure, they'll want to use him as a tool someday, and this wasting disease puts a different light on things, but I can't shake the idea of Mewtwo being the AI, ostensibly trapped by the humans but either on a path to getting them to free him (through mind control) or circumventing his shackles (through mind control).  His Psychic powers are so much stronger than anything Team Rocket can hope to account for that, in effect, what Mewtwo wants, Mewtwo gets.  Mewtwo as an 'end-boss' is all but a guarantee, unless DaystarEld really wants to throw a curve ball somewhere and have him fall under someone else's influence, but I even this early I put 85% probability to Mewtwo being a key figure in the climax of this story.

  At the same time, though, the Legendary Birds are too interesting an innovation to really pass up.  While their presence changes the tone of the world an amount, they could easily have been portrayed as reclusive beings, too strong by orders of magnitude to challenge but easily verified to exist, and the story would not have been *that* much different for it.  There are really only two ways this can play out.  The first is that the activity of a Legendary Bird acts as a special event of the story in and of itself, much like how an Endbringer attacks every few months but Leviathan is a pivotal point of Worm's story, more than almost anything else.  The other way this could go is to have a special event regarding a Legendary Bird.  First thing that comes to mind is someone, somewhere, finally gets past the challenge of how to catch a Legendary Bird, and that sends Kanto into celebrations.  Second thing that comes to mind is someone, somewhere, finds out a way to kill a Legendary Bird.  More mixed reactions, serious questions exchanged, but hey, next best thing to catching one, right?  Assuming they aren't keystones of the climate or anything like that, of course.  The third and last thing that comes to mind is Mewtwo and the birds.  Maybe he strikes them down, maybe he enslaves them, maybe he recruits them, maybe even *they* strike *him* down.  The opportunity for interplay between the Legendaries is a tantalizing concept, and I hope we see it to at least some extent in Origin of Species.

  One last thing: a thought on Blue, and other Champions.  Blue once said that all of the great trainers he really looks up to won every Gym Battle on their first try, and so it was frustrating for him to lose his first, but when I hear that I get the mental image of Cynthia and the like breezing through their journey with deceptive ease, while Blue is faced with roadblock after roadblock.  What's interesting about this mental image is it lends itself to Blue clawing his way past those obstacles and being sturdier for it, when others like Cynthia feel like they've never truly been tested before, giving an advantage to Blue by dint of the struggle he goes through to reach their level.

  As for Red, well, I'm sort of waiting for when his intellect finally fails him in a big way.  Stakes haven't been high that much, so we've seen the establishing of his intellect more than his failures, but a part of me is just waiting for when he outsmarts himself or isn't at the top of his game, and others suffer for it.  A moment where his attempts to be intelligent and rational arguably make the situation worse, and he has to deal with that.

  I'm looking forward to see what kernels of wisdom you have in response to this, DaystarEld.  You did, after all, mention that you had popcorn.

    Wow, awesome comment!  I didn't realize how closely the story so far has stuck to that of the games.  I'm hoping we'll see something "original," but given that I didn't notice the similarities up to this point, it's unlikely I'd mind them in the future.  Still, it'll be pretty disappointing if the introduction of a bunch of smart players somehow manages *not* to lead to some really interesting outcomes, and instead we see the same old plans and plots, only *rationalized* (in the sense of having been justified "rationally" after the fact).  I would expect the changes to magnify as we progress through the story, and the changes to the characters have time to compound.  

    I agree with everything you've written about Mewtwo and the Legendaries, but I maintain that the prospect of capturing them strikes me as more interesting.  At the very least I'm expecting some investigation of how there can be species of pokemon that apparently have *only a single member*.
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      It's not really that the events are rationalized after the fact as much as they're reinterpretations of the events that fits a more rational world.  Back at Mt. Moon, it honestly took me a while to recognize the Team Rocket connection, even after the Witnessing.  The whole series of events was so radically departed from how they were executed in canon that they might as well have not been the same event, even if the same sentence 'Team Rocket tries to steal fossils at Mt. Moon' describes them both.

      The reason I'm not confident at all about Celadon and Saffron is that even though there's the sentence of 'Team Rocket base in Game Corner', that's about where the similarities will end, even if the conflict takes place there at all.  Mt. Moon in canon and OoS aren't the same plan and plot, they're the same headline.
      ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    >If Team Rocket really is in control of Silph

    Quick note, Team Rocket does not control Silph in the games. It's an independent company: they attack it in order to steal the Masterball.
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      Right, right.  In that case, it's more like the Pokemon Tower in that Team Rocket could be operating behind a more corporate facade in their ambitions, attempting to steal designs or other such secrets.  It could also nicely segue into discussions of the Master Ball and Legendaries.  After all, you've already established that Pokeballs don't care about Pokemon strength or vitality, so a type of Pokeball efficient enough to store a Legendary should be able to do the job.

      And now I just realized no one has ever captured a Wailord.  Not that it'd be useful outside of the water in tournaments, but like in the Ranger series capturing it would just be a flat 'no.'
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        I never played the Ranger series, why was it a "no" there? Because of the mass too?
        ```

        - u/InfernoVulpix:
          ```
          There's a small underwater segment in Shadows of Almia where you have to stop the evil team from trapping a Wailord.  The Wailord is large enough to span multiple screens, to the point where its width is taller than the screen and one screen will only show its head and the other only shows its tail.

          After the mission, once Wailord is rescued you interact with it and it automatically registers itself in your Browser, not even entertaining the idea that your styler could encircle the whole thing.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Ha! That's pretty neat.

            I would love it if the mainstream pokemon games treated the pokemon sizes and habitats a bit more relevantly.  Summoning wailord in a building or cave is ridiculous, but non-amphibian water pokemon should only be able to be used in or near water.

            I guess technically wailord is a mammal so it could survive out of water, but since it's basically a beached whale at that point, no moves should ever miss it.  Hell, no moves should miss it in the water either, considering its size!
            ```

            - u/InfernoVulpix:
              ```
              Honestly, I'd rather hear something official about what we always see with fish Pokemon in land battles: spontaneous flight.  Pokemon like Gyarados and Kingdra, it's more easily understood to be their typing or dragon-powers at work, but even Basculin can apparently produce quantities of water orders of magnitude larger than itself, so I really wouldn't mind if someone from Game Freak casually says that fish Pokemon have also developed the ability to swim through the air so that they can make friends with beach Pokemon or something.

              The stuff about buildings and caves, as well as moves missing, can also be chalked up as abstraction and simplification.  If there's a large cavern where a Wailord might be able to battle freely, maybe all cave fights take place in such a space, and if the building's too small for the fight (or, as BW showed us, the fight's too heavy on the collateral), then the two take the fight outside, where there's room.  As for accuracy, well, I'd agree with you if I wouldn't have to memorize size-accuracy modifiers for every Pokemon.
              ```

              - u/DaystarEld:
                ```
                >Honestly, I'd rather hear something official about what we always see with fish Pokemon in land battles: spontaneous flight. 

                I always just figured that was laziness on their part: animate them as if they're swimming because they're aquatic, and then just use that animation even if they're not in water.  There's no other indication that they're actually floating (with the possible exception of gyarados being Flying type, despite that he can't actually fly), since they're still susceptible to Ground attacks.

                > I'd agree with you if I wouldn't have to memorize size-accuracy modifiers for every Pokemon.

                Yeah that would be annoying, though this data could be easily displayed in battle. The new games are adding stat up/down modifications as a permanent visual, but they could do a lot more with the battle UI.

                Mostly though I'm just spitballing ideas for a realistic pokemon tabletop RPG.
                ```

  Just popping in for a quick clarification:

  >And lastly, does anyone remember anything interesting about that chapter that took place in Unova or something?

  I believe you mean the second interlude, [Chapter 12, Shadows.](http://www.daystareld.com/pokemon-chapter-12/) It took place in Fuschia, which is a city in Kanto, not Unova.

  >And /u/DaystarEld : willing to offer any public or private hints?

  - u/4t0m:
    ```
    Ah, that's right.  And wow, I was way off.  I suppose I should reread that eventually, since it takes place closer to the action than I had thought.

    >Nope! *popcorn*

    Evil.  Well, hopefully others will show up and help me out.

      I'll probably answer questions about how the world works or clarify characterizations if it doesn't spoil stuff though.

      Probably :)
