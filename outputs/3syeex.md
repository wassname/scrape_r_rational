  I would have used dreams instead of television if I were the Architect. After all, people already forget most of their dreams, and the ones we remember often make no sense from *within* the Matrix. Maybe they make sense in the real world.

    Dreams are poorly understood, with dozens of competing explanations for the phenomenon and little evidence to privilege one above the others. Maybe humans don't even dream outside the Matrix.
    ```

  - u/gwern:
    ```
    The problem with dreams is that while they don't make sense (not that TV makes all that much sense either, between the dumbed down plots and large fraction of gibberish called 'advertisements'), we don't spend much time dreaming. Total REM sleep makes up only a fraction of the 8 hours asleep, and dreams only make up a fraction of that. I think the estimate is that people spend maybe an hour total dreaming? (It may feel like longer but that's because perception of time and coherence are part of what shuts down in a dream as well; we've all had dreams that seemed to last for hours or years, but recordings and the lucid dream research show that most dreams last something ridiculously short like 10 minutes.) In contrast, the average American spends something gross like 5+ hours watching TV.

    So creepy as it may seem, the Architect would get easily 5x more productivity out of hijacking TV rather than dreams.

  I still believe that Zion and what is believed to be the real world, is another simulation from the same AI that run the Matrix.
  Basically, when they escape the Matrix, they just go to another simulation to make they feel like they outsmarted the AI and that they are free.

  That would be a way for the machines to handle the few human outliers who might unravel the truth.
  This explain quite well why Neo has powers in the "real world" and why he can find himself in Mobil Ave (the train station)even though he is not plugged to anything (he would just have been switched to a third simulation).

  Considering this hypothesis, the motive of the AI to use humans in a simulation is unknowable. Basically, my view is that everything that we see in the movie is a lie. The characters might not even exist at all in a real world, or might exist in a non human form, or might be human used by the machines for whatever purpose.

    Makes sense. The rational for the Matrix was that people were not happy with the perfect world simulation that was originally created. The matrix was then a slightly grim simulation, and it would make sense that the world of Zion was a more grim simulation, for those who were not content with the amount of grimness in the Matrix.

    Supporting evidence: the harvesting power from people theory is bollocks, and Neo can still use his powers in the world of Zion.

    I really hate that theory. IMO it would be terrible writing to just reuse the premise of the first movie like that. At least they tried something new.
    ```

    - u/ben_sphynx:
      ```
      That said, the first movie seemed quite a lot better than the next two combined. Reusing it's premise might have been better than what they actually made.

  *tl;dr:*

  > One of the most common geek criticisms of *The Matrix* is that the supposed value of the humans to the machine overlords is as an *energy source*--but, by any comparison to alternatives like burning coal, solar power, fusion plants, etc., human flesh is a terrible way of generating electricity and feeding dead humans to other humans makes no sense.

  > There’s a quick way to rescue the Matrix-verse from this objection: that was simply a dumbing-down for the general movie audience. To take an existing SF trope, the real purpose of humans is to reuse their brains as a very energy-efficient highly-parallel supercomputer, which would justify the burden of running a Matrix.

  > But this raises additional questions: how do you make use of intact humans' brains? With existing machine learning/AI approaches to neural networks, each neural network is trained from scratch for a specific task, it’s not part of a whole personality or mind on its own. What do you do with an entire brain with a personality and memories and busy with its own simulated life? If the AIs want the humans for image-recognition tasks (very handy for robots), how do they extract this image recognition data in a useful manner from people that are spending 24h in a computer simulation?

  > Insert the tasks into the simulated environment in a naturalistic way, of course. You have an image which might be a bat? Insert it and see if people think “a bat!” You need to recognize street numbers? hijack someone walking down a “street”, replace the real house number with the unrecognized image, and see what they think. Ditto for facial recognition.

  > Of course, to do that on all topics of interest and not just bats, you would have to feed human brains a great deal of imagery which could make no sense as part of their ordinary daily life. Ideally, they would be raptly focused on a rapidly changing sequence of images, and as much as you can feed them, so the equivalent of a full-time job, perhaps 5+ hours a day or 24-33 hours a week. You’d want to start programming human brains as early as possible in life, perhaps starting around 2 years of age, so as to minimize how much food & energy they use before they can start computationally-useful tasks. And given how strange and alien as this all sounds to any normal healthy human lifestyle, you would need to make the test-set uploading as addictive as possible to ensure all this - it’d be no good if a lot of humans opted out & wasted your investment.

  > In other words, *television is how the Matrix operators exploit us.*
