## [D] Genre Savviness in Rational Fiction

### Post:

This is a companion to the [biweekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3m4s4n/biweekly_challenge_dangerously_genre_savvy/), mostly as a place for people to talk about ideas, share applicable stories, and things like that.

If you have an idea that you're excited about, *I highly recommend that you write it out instead of discussing it* because discussion satisfies some of the same hedonic urges that actual writing does, while at the same time only producing discussion and not actual fiction (and in my opinion, fiction has higher value than discussion).

  Let me start. First off, I think it's useful to divide "genre savvy" into two different categories:

  1. Characters who avoid mistakes which other characters in fiction makes, usually by virtue of having read the same stories that the reader has. The villain recognizes the urge to gloat as destructive, having seen it over and over again in movies, and decides that he's going to be better than that.
  2. Characters who have some knowledge of the genre they're in and try to use that to their advantage. The virgin knows that she's in a horror movie and avoids having sex because she knows that this will increase her chances of survival.

  The distinction is mostly about whether there's an element of going meta involved. These get mixed pretty freely when people talk about "genre savvy" though, especially in things like ["The Evil Overlord's List"](http://www.eviloverlord.com/lists/overlord.html). I personally think that the first type tends to work a lot better in fiction than the second type, but that's because I tend to get tired of winks and nods.
  ```

    I like that distinction. The second kind can definitely get annoying.

    It's funny how people make fun of horror characters for doing 'stupid' things, when usually they're behaving pretty normally, but just don't realize they're in a horror movie and thus that splitting off from the main group or what have you is a death sentence. I split off from groups all the time!
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      But do you split off from groups in the woods when the power goes out in the cabin, and you all have no cell reception? The sexing people I can almost agree with. You NEED to split off if you want to have sex, making you an easy narrative target. But otherwise, I don't really get it.
      ```

  - u/pizzahotdoglover:
    ```
    I think you're doing a magnificent job of incorporating the second type in [Shadows of the Limelight](http://alexanderwales.com/shadows/). The characters are all genre savvy, and go a step further by intentionally acting in ways that create compelling and archetypal stories in their genre. This also provides an in-universe explanation for why characters may act in a way that might not be optimal in real life but creates a compelling story that follows certain archetypes. It basically preempts any potential plot holes by having the characters themselves intending to create a story, essentially lampshading the fact that they are already in a story. It almost appears meta at first glance, but it is actually wholly self-contained. 

    Worm by Wildbow does something similar by providing in-universe explanations for why people with super powers dress in costumes and knock each other out, but don't try to kill each other.
    ```

    - u/psychothumbs:
      ```
      Is that really genre savviness though? If the universe actually has those rules then it's just the characters doing the smart thing in their own world, not demonstrating any sort of awareness of what 'genre' they're in.
      ```

      - u/pizzahotdoglover:
        ```
        Yes it is. The only "rule" in their universe is that more fame = greater superpowers. Fame is more easily garnered through compelling stories just by virtue of human nature. Characters then change their actions based on their knowledge of what makes a compelling story in order to garner more fame and power. What I appreciate about this story is that /u/alexanderwales has created a world where the smart thing for the character to do is to realize what "genre" the story of their fame is and actively try to create it. The characters in this story don't necessarily have awareness of the genre of this specific story; instead, they are savvy to all the story genres and intentionally act out their own dramas to fit them. This results in more fame for them and an enjoyable experience for the reader.
        ```

        - u/psychothumbs:
          ```
          I get what the deal is in the story, but is that any more genre savvy than in any other fictional universe where the characters use the physical laws of their universe to their advantage?
          ```

          - u/pizzahotdoglover:
            ```
            I think it is. It's a subtle difference but it's there in 2 ways.

            First, characters in most stories simply act like themselves, reacting how anyone normally would, or doing things to further the plot simply because the author needs them to. Here, the characters intentionally modify their actions to fit within a specific genre so that their stories are more compelling. Yes, they're indirectly exploiting a rule of their universe, but to do so, they must be genre savvy. In contrast, most characters in other stories are genre blind.

            Second, and this is only a minor point, being genre savvy has nothing to do with the physical laws of their universe. Only fame does. Characters who exploit their knowledge of story archetypes in order to appeal to a wider group of people are not directly exploiting a physical law, because there is no physical law that says archetypal stories have more appeal. Instead, they are using their understanding of human culture to realize what will be popular. Perhaps on another planet in their universe, people become famous for entirely different reasons. This could easily be true without changing the physical laws of the universe because it is a cultural phenomenon.
            ```

          - u/redrach:
            ```
            I think it's less that they're more genre savvy than characters in other stories, and more that their chosen means of munchkining the universe they're in happens to revolve around generating fantastical and memorable stories, and the story they _actually_ inhabit also fits that genre. Which is pretty neat.
            ```

- u/None:
  ```
  For me the benefit of "genre savvy" characters or in general characters who don't do the things you associate with that genre is that it signals the author's intention to tell a fresh story. If I'm watching a horror movie and the characters say, "Let's split up," I know what's going to happen next. But if another character answers, "No, let's stick together," and they *do*, then I'm paying attention, because what I'm about to see isn't something I've seen before a hundred times.

  Splitting up isn't *stupid*, it's *stale*. When Harry says to Hermione that he's not going to make her talk about her trauma like people  normally would do because his books say that's dumb, it forces me to wake up and engage with what's happening on the page. That same freshness also makes the characters seem more real since. When Quirrell says, "Nah, just AK everything," it sends a message that this character isn't going to do anything convenient for the plot or the world. He's going to be as hard to beat as possible because that's what he wants to do, ease-of-storywriting be damned. The character feels like he exists for himself, not for the author.

  I suppose it also plays into writing intelligent characters. At some point the smart guy has to *do things differently*, otherwise what's the point of being smart?
  ```

    This plays into the cycle of deconstruction and reconstruction.

    Deconstruction starts to pop up when people get tired of the same old tropes, when they want to see the pretensions and assumptions stripped away because they've seen them so many times before. When Batman goes from the grinning Caped Crusader to a tortured soul who beats the shit out of villains because of his severe psychological problems, when instead of ***Wham!*** and ***Pow!*** we get broken bones and bloodied knuckles ... well, that *starts out fresh*. But then a decade later, all the new superheroes (and most of the old ones) have had this deconstructionist approach applied to them, they've been torn apart and laid bare, and the audience expects it -- and because they expect it, they start to care a lot less. (Deconstruction doesn't always mean dark and gritty, but I think there's a strong tendency for it to be that, just because most tropes make the world a lighter and fluffier place.)

    So deconstruction gets you halfway there. But it's not the whole story, because, well, there was a reason that authors did things the way they were doing them in the first place, and it wasn't just about convenience. The slasher movie protagonist got driven into the basement because *that's an exciting place*. It's the most abandoned and unfinished part of the house, with forgotten bits of junk and power tools, poorly lit and slightly off-kilter. But just because it's been done before doesn't mean that you can't do it. You just need to make sure that it's the smart thing to do, that it *makes sense* for the intelligent protagonist to head into the basement *anyway*. Deconstruction takes something old and makes it fresh by destroying it. Reconstruction takes something old and makes it fresh by improving it.

    I really believe that you can have a genre savvy character who still keeps falling into the tropes of his genre, all the while thinking, "I know this is what they do in books, but it actually makes sense this time", and that this could be a good book. (The biggest problem being that the author would seem self-congratulatory.)

      > Deconstruction doesn't always mean dark and gritty, but I think there's a strong tendency for it to be that, just because most tropes make the world a lighter and fluffier place.

      Hmmm... I disagree slightly with the latter statement.  Tropes mostly make the world a place that's easier to tell narratively-satisfying stories in.  A good example is how [Only a Flesh Wound](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyAFleshWound) allows for *being shot* to be reasonably survivable, thus ensuring the character can go on to spend time avenging their having gotten shot instead of just dying all of a sudden.

      Getting shot is not exactly Lighter and Softer in the first place, and in fact, moving further up the Grimdark axis *still* tends to leave the author in the situation that while maybe the main characters get shot *more often*, they still have to bloody well survive it somehow because otherwise *there's no story left*.

      So I'd tend to say that Decon/Recon Cycles work based on whatever your genre's tropes actually were in the first place, and if the Decon part always seems to come out "Darker and Edgier", that's probably just because Hollywood and certain paperback fantasy authors these days have a bit of a fetish for making things Dark and Edgy *in replacement for* making them genuinely realistic.  So now, Batman's as much a psychopath as the Joker, but still, nobody ever [*just shoots* the Batman](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim?from=Main.WhyDontYaJustShootHim).

      I'm also specifically thinking that, for instance, if you wanted to deconstruct *A Song of Ice and Fire*, or *Warhammer 40K*, or some other work known for being "grimdark" in its conventions, your deconstruction would inevitably have to include such notions as "Game theory says sometimes diplomacy is the most effective thing."

      Or, to give a counterexample, *Neon Genesis Evangelion* famously went so far into deconstructing Humongous Mecha tropes by trying to make the whole thing Very Psychological and Philosophical that many viewers have long-since lost sympathy for the characters by the end.  Hence, "Get in the fucking robot, Shinji."
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        *A Song of Ice and Fire* is [already a deconstruction](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DeconstructedTrope/ASongOfIceAndFire). Deconstructing a deconstruction seems like it's going to do something weird that's not really going to be part of our Decon/Recon cycle. If you deconstruct *Scream*, what do you get? Probably not a standard deconstruction, because you're down a layer. And then if you deconstruct the deconstruction of the deconstruction ... you're just moving closer to reality, I guess.

        I suppose I think the reason that I see tropes as (generally) making the world a lighter and fluffier place is that most stories are structured around pleasing the audience. So sure, the hero gets his village burned down in the opening act, but he rarely suffers from PTSD. People get shot, but it's just a flesh wound. The hero has to suffer, but he also has to triumph, and in most genres, there's still an expectation of a happy ending (or at least a pleasing resolution to whatever the central conflict is).

        Obviously that doesn't apply to torture porn, tragedy, etc.

  A tangential question, based on what I *thought* this post was going to be about before clicking it: presuming that "rational fiction" *is itself* a genre... then there would be "rational fiction tropes." Could there, therefore, be a character who is *savvy to the fact that they are a character in a ratfic*? If so, would that mean doing anything differently, if they were already planning on being a rational, motivated consequentialist as their naive level-zero strategy?

  One thing that leaps to mind is that the naive "shounen rationalist" usually attempts to bootstrap themselves into a force capable of saving the world or somesuch. From the rational fiction I've read so far, genre-savvy in this case would involve realizing that there's probably going to be at least one agent already capable of doing what you want to do (because there has to be something to serve as an entertaining final challenge for the hero)—and it's likely much easier to take control of/backdoor/charm that agent than to grind yourself up to its level first. To use a metaphor, it is much more effective to "sequence-break" the narrative than to do all the harrowing skin-of-your-teeth engaging stuff involved with doing a "100% speedrun" of the narrative. You could very easily "win" *HPMOR* or *Worm* or most other original rational stories right at the beginning by just befriending exactly one character left originally ignored until the late-game. (This comes, a bit, from the relationship between rational fiction and detective fiction: in both, it is bad form for an author to "solve" the story using a character or item that was only introduced near the end. Because of this, the solution to the story is usually *accessible* in the story-setting from fairly early on.)

  Any others?

    In a typical piece of rational fiction, science and engineering will be rewarded more than in the real world. If you know that you're in a piece of rational fiction, then you know that your science experiments are much more likely to produce results, that your clever thinking is much more likely to be correct, and that random pieces of knowledge from the past are likely to be relevant at some crucial moment. This partly comes down to the need for structuring a narrative; no one wants to see the failures pile up over and over.

      That's true if you're one of the protagonists, or working based on a design drafted by one of the protagonists. I notice that there's almost a "conservation of intelligence" effect in rational fiction: the protagonists and antagonists get all the brains. There are no unallied factions; no Tom Bombadil characters, wandering around with all the mental firepower but no desire to use it; and no paperclipper-agents doing powerful works at *orthogonal* purposes, heroes of their own stories, but potentially allies *or* enemies in the protagonist's.

      I think a big "hole" in the current selection of rational fiction is that every character is forced to either have everything in the set of {intelligent, rational, well-read, consequentialist, motivated, heavily-empathetic-to-in-group} or none of it. There are no brilliant lazy people, no motivated idiots, no deontological rationalists, no selfish do-gooders, etc. In other words, the stories so far are very bare-bones demonstrations of what it's like to be a complete rationalist, instead of making any attempt at highlighting particular *aspects* of optimal thinking.

      This might be the reason a lot of rational fiction feels so "same-y"; everyone is trying to write the same poem about an entire tree, rather than focusing on a particular branch or leaf or bit of bark. And there are no ensemble stories, either—anthologies of poems to cover the tree in combination.

    Every rationalist in the real world is in fact genre-savvy to the fact that the real world behaves as the *gold standard* of rational fiction.

    Every rationalist preacher is further savvy to being in a rational*ist* story.

    Appeal to the writer by stroking their ego and doing things that they like characters to do. In a ratfic the way to do that is to act rationally in obvious ways and avoiding cliches. It would be a caricature of a story though.

  It seems to me that the main problem in realizing you're in a world that works by the conventions of a genre could be the fact that so much of those conventions are embedded in what's shown, rather than what actually happens. Ie heroes usually end a story triumphant, but that would be hard to tell because their story wouldn't be cut off then in reality—a year later they're down and out. Also, because stories abridge reality, the Genre Conventions would be obscured by all the noise surrounding actual Scenes.

  Basically, to the extent a genre is interpretive rather than interpolative of reality, its influence is meaningless to the characters.

  You could have a world where glowing sigils appear randomly on people's foreheads, and stay for a random while, which make the person's life proceed according to the conventions of a certain genre (probably different colors of sigil). Naturally, as fashions go in and out in the spirit world new sigils appear and old ones become rarer. 

  Another way to do this would be to have people be genre-touched, though they might have a way of changing their genre. Maybe not everyone has a genre, new ones probably emerge. It could be at birth, or maybe random rune-covered milestones appear that can if touched Link you to a certain genre until a story in that genre has run its course, which if you resist it could be a long time. Maybe you can find Villain Stones, Hero Stones, the more common Extra Stones, etc. Maybe you are paid with magic power (a resource used to invoke tropes from the respective genre?) or another reward on completion of your part in the story. Or perhaps just a resource to be used for something else, like little runic poker chips that magic casinos that appear only on certain holidays accept.

  Another route you could take is that because of all the noise, identifying the world's genre would call for real science, not just observation—you'd have to replicate specific situations, like a villain confrontation, and see what was more likely to happen even if highly improbable, exactly what the probabilistic lean was, etc. The problem would be an Observer Effect where if you're replicating these situations, they may no longer be in a story where the conventions apply! Also, what happens if the conventions of two genres conflict?

  If you think about it, Genre Saviness often isn't a good idea in real life.

  The problem is that fiction has many constraints such as the need to have a plot, maintain tension, be entertaining, have few enough characters for the reader to keep straight etc. Fiction is never a plausible simulation, it's just supposed to feel like one.

  So in many cases the things which it makes sense to do in fiction are not things which it makes sense to do in real life and vice versa.

    Wouldn't genre saviness in real life just be a person understanding that they're in real life, and acting accordingly? 

    I can see how *fiction* genre saviness isn't highly useful ([obligatory link to Generalization from fictional evidence](http://lesswrong.com/lw/k9/the_logical_fallacy_of_generalization_from/)), but being genre savy normally means knowing about the genre *that you're in,* not just knowing about other somewhat similar genres.

      But fictional characters don't know that they're in a work of fiction. Except for fourth wall breaking comedy fics, in which case, it doesn't really matter what you do because the world doesn't have any real consistency and you're at the whims of the author.

        >But fictional characters don't know that they're in a work of fiction.

        First I'd like to point out that some do exactly that, that's one form of genre saviness.

        Secondly, in the other form, they don't *need* to know that they're in a work of fiction. All they need to know is the rules by which their universe works.

        There is little *practical* difference between the rule "When someone says 'what else could go wrong,' usually, something worse goes wrong." in fiction... and the rule "When a person is insulted, they will usually get angry" in real life.

        There is, however, a logical difference. In the first rule, the universe is being influenced by words (literally, the act of saying "what else could go wrong," can physically force the clouds to gather above you and cause a thunderstorm). In the second rule, the words are being processed by the brain, causing mental pain, causing an anger response.

        But the logical difference doesn't matter. Whether you are in the weird universe, or in ours, you should still be able to observe patterns and be able to predict future outcomes.

        - u/Uncaffeinated:
          ```
          The problem though is that most fiction doesn't have characters that are genre savvy to that degree. Which means that being genre savvy automatically puts you inside a smaller subclass of fiction.

          Plus being a fictional character is one of the few cases where a malicious god controlling your thoughts is literally true, which makes epistemology difficult.

          Modeling the world to better predict it and take advantage is of course a good idea, but the sophistication of the model is obviously limited by your own resources. When you are a fictional character, it is literally impossible to fully model the relevant factors because that would require modeling the authors mind, which would in turn require modeling the authors model of your own mind and then you get the halting problem and so on.


          It's almost like asking whether faced with overwhelming proof that 1+1=3, whether you would believe it and start acting to take advantage of it.
