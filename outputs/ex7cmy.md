## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  In our own world, money is the most common superpower.  Suppose that in the natural course of exploiting any other power, a previously poor character obtains a million dollars and wants to become happy.  They're at least as smart as the protagonist of Jumper, which is basically the only example I can recall of fiction that focuses on this question seriously.  What do they do?

    It depends on why they're unhappy and where they live, but:

    * Get stable housing, spend a bunch on a new bed and a good pillow, go to sleep around the same time every night, get up at the same time every morning.
    * Exercise routinely, using the money for a gym and/or equipment. This goes to health, but also to helping regulation of hormones and some other things. If you're poor, it's not *impossible* to work out, just harder, with some inconveniences. Get a personal trainer to show you *how* to work out.
    * Fix diet to include more whole foods, less added sugar, less carbs. Diet is notoriously bad among poor people, for a few reasons. Get a dietician, but maybe wait until after you've been following all the common sense advice you would get from the internet.
    * Get a medical checkup to address any ongoing health problems.
    * Obtain friends. Hard to do, but easier with money. The best method is probably to buy into a hobby or activity of some kind, maybe more than one, ideally one that has a consistent group that meets on a weekly (or more) basis. That at least gets the foot in the door, and can be helpful if you're not naturally charismatic or social. Most of my friends that I didn't make through high school, I made through D&D or Magic: the Gathering. Most of my wife's friends were through ballroom dancing or rock climbing. Much easier with money, because money buys time, and you also don't have to worry so much about costs.
    * Get a partner. Easier with money, by virtue of the labor you can save and the stuff you can do, the likely lack of scheduling conflicts, but finding the *right* partner is a bit of a crapshoot. Still worth pursuing (along the usual paths, especially hobbies/activities, see above).
    * Get a therapist. This isn't really for therapy, though you might need that too, but to have someone who is paid to listen to you talk about your life and problems, who is in your strict confidence, and who will be there if you have some personal thing you need someone to talk to. Friends or a partner can fill this role, but if those aren't available, pay someone.
    * Focus on experiences, not on things. Travel, see the world, try new things, ideally with friends or your partner, but if not, then alone.
    * Avoid things that suck up your time while delivering little in return, whether they're obligations, things that feel like obligations, or vices. Internet, television, social media, etc. are common vices, especially if you're poor. If your obligations are things that can be solved with money, try to do that.

      What's funny is that this answer really points out just *how little* a million dollars is. 

      If you stuck a million dollars in a decent asset mix and got a rate of return of about 5% per year, you could pay yourself an annual salary of $60k for 30 years, or ride the low income threshold at $45k per year indefinitely. 

      Although that's great, you're not *truly* wealthy, because that would solve a ton of the problems in these bullet points. Half of them explicitly cost money, and the other half are made significantly easier if you have money: 

      * Exercise: sure you can do this on your own, but you're likely to hurt yourself or just plain give up. Hiring a personal trainer to come to your house for an hour per weekday will cost on the order of $25,000 per year, more if you need them to keep quiet about super abilities. 
      * Fix diet: hire a personal chef to buy and cook food. Will cost something on the order of $60k, plus the cost of the food.
      * Focus on experiences: traveling safely costs money. Figuring out your travel plans costs spoons. The wealthy still use travel agents; you just buy a package from an agent and you're good to go. If you're super rich, you'll have a private jet.

    Other than what Alexander already said..

    &#x200B;

    * They might find reading  [Lost Connections](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections) helpful.. It's basically a scientific guide to fighting depression and being happier.
    * They'd want to research a good investment method for that money so it can last indefinitely. 
    * They'd want to find a job / project / artistic endeavor to occupy themselves with, these can change and morph overtime, maybe even consciously on a seasonal basis. IMHO humans need to work in some form to be happy, be it an actual job, school, or dailies in a game.
    * Also they'd want to do some research into philosophy, be it eastern or western, to help them cope with the realization that even after they get everything they could possibly want nothing changes, and now even that hope of "being happy when ..." is gone. This fucks up a lot of high performers and lottery winners.
    * If their brain is used to the "I'll be happy when ..." paradigm they should start working on changing it for something else.
    * They should do the things they know they should do but find it difficult, be it writing, painting, starting a restaurant, learning a language, making a move of that person, cooking, moving somewhere... 
    * Reading [The War of Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art) may help, the author calls this difficulty Resistance and claims it's one of the main causes of human suffering, to paraphrase an example he gives: "imagine how many lives would have been spared if Hitler had the courage to face a blank canvas." It's likely a book worth re-reading once a year.

    Do they have $1 million through some "legitimate" method, having already paid taxes on it and otherwise satisfied the IRS?  Or are we talking about someone who has somehow "acquired" $1 million cash that they now have to launder?

    (For a cautionary tale of what *not* to do if they are in the latter position, see [Finders Keepers: The Story of a Man Who Found $1 Million](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008RZKB2M), the riveting true story of a 28-year unemployed old drug addict who stumbled upon $1.2 million in unmarked bills in casino money that had fallen off an armored truck.)

    This is kinda bad question because it mostly depends on the protagonist personality. We all like slightly different things. Different things makes us happy.

    Also... wouldn't just obtaining the money make the poor character happy instantly? I think in most cases yes, so it's a self-solving question.

  Fuck it here I go, low level metallokinesis, 2 meter radius, cant trasmute the metal into another metal, cant hold more than 100kg of metal per object.
   instant deceleration but not acceleration of the material.
  Can shape the material in simple ways.
  What he can controll has to either be a metal as established by the periodic table, or an alloy containing more than 50% of metal.

  Let's see what you guys can do

    > Instant deceleration but not acceleration of the material.

    What reference frame does this apply to?  Do you receive an equal and opposite force?  If I stop a cannon ball of equal mass, do I go flying out the other direction?

    If there is no If it is decelerating material relative to the user, this can be used for infinite propulsion in space.  Stand on a metal table, kick off of it, then stop it relative to yourself, increasing net momentum in the direction you chose.

    What degree of fine control is there?  Can be used to create cryogenics by decelerating individual atoms relative to each other.  Condense out [liquid oxygen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUKcHe0-m_I) from the air for use as an accelerant.

    How many objects can be controlled at once?  If the metal is in liquid form, does the 100kg apply to the entire mass of liquid, or only to the portion being actively controlled?  If the latter, separate out blobs of liquid metal to fill the entire 2m volume.

    Combine liquid+cryogenic control to travel through the earth's mantle.  Would need to constantly reinforce shell of metal to prevent collapse.  Would need to take additional source of oxygen for journey.  Ascent would require breaking through rocks, may need creatively chosen exit points.

    Does the alloy need to be metallic?  Hematite (Fe2O3) is 70% iron by mass, but can have a rocky appearance.

      Ah there goes the munchkinery I want.
      Ok let's update the rules shall we? No, he doesnt have that amount of precision, we are talking about macro here not micro, the smallest he can go is about the size of a grain of sand, he doesnt have enough controll to let's say, split water into oxygen and hydrogen, but he has the controll necessary to split, let's say about 300 kg of  mercury into 3 spheres of 100kg of mass, thereby controlling all of it.

      Now as for the movement issue, there I go fucking with the third law of motion again, no there is no equal and opposite force, if he say it stops it stops, period, he could theoretically use it to fly in space, but he would fry his brain well before getting to any good fraction of C, the faster the object goes, the harder it is to control, so what he likes to do is use it as a slingshot.
      He spins the object to gain velocity and momentum and when it has enough he let's go of it.

      The alloy doesnt need to be metallic, it just needs to contain more metal than not, let's say an alloy of Iron+tungsten+alluminium(I don't think it exist but fuck it) is about 55~60% of the mass of the alloy, if it's any less than that then no dice sugar, and even with this the movement speed he can give it and the precision with which he can controll it is less, so by rule of thumb Pure Metal>Metal alloy>(metal+nonmetal)Alloy.

      He doesn't have a limit to how many things he can controll, only on how much they can weight, the radius is static, it cant change with training, the same goes for the weight, the only thing he can train is his control.
      ```

  - u/Kuiper:

    > instant deceleration but not acceleration of the material

    Here's the case for not having different rules for acceleration and deceleration: it's really just all relative.  An object that experiences an acceleration of 100 m/s^2 will experience the same magnitude of force as an object that decelerates at a rate of 100 m/s^2, it's just that the force will be acting in the opposite direction.  Acceleration and deceleration is just a matter of perspective; the only thing that makes one "numbers going up" and the other "numbers going down" is your relative frame.

    In the same way that orbiting satellites "fall toward the earth," the earth is constantly "falling toward the sun," accelerating due to gravity to travel in a circular orbit.  (If earth's acceleration were 0, it would just be traveling in a straight line.)  So if I reduce your acceleration (relative to the sun) to zero, you will no longer orbit the sun along with the rest of the earth, and be hurled off into space.

    So, maybe it makes more sense to say that the metalomancer can only cause things to instantly decelerate *relative to their own frame*, which makes more sense.  But it also means that the metalomancer can mix things up by changing their own frame.  e.g. suppose I'm a metalomancer in a car traveling 30 m/s west, that means that *relative to my frame*, a stationary object is speeding away from me at 30 m/s eastward, and decelerating that object to a speed that is "0 m/s (relative to me)" will cause it to accelerate to a speed of "30 m/s westward (relative to the ground)."

    Instant deceleration (or really, "instant anything") seems ripe for exploitation.  (Maybe we should just assume that by "instant" you mean something like, "comes to a complete stop in 1 millisecond or some other extremely small time frame that's basically imperceptible to humans", because you kind of break the laws of physics any time you try to say that something happens in 0 seconds.  When thinking about that time frame, realize that the difference between 1 millisecond and 2 milliseconds is also quite large in terms of the g-forces that would be experienced by whatever object you were decelerating.)

    As they say, "it's the instant deceleration that kills you."  (The reason that crashing a car into a brick wall is more fatal than crashing your car into a wall made of jello is that the deceleration is more rapid.)  So if I can cause your car to instantly decelerate from 60 mph to 0 mph, your body will be flung "forward" relative to the car's frame and have a decent chance of instantly killing you, just like if you had driven into a wall.  Of course, I can't cause the whole car to instantly decelerate, because it's more than 100kg and has non-metal parts, so I guess I'll just freeze your engine block in place and cause the rest of the vehicle (including your body, which is seated behind the engine block) to "collide" with the stationary engine block.  Or, if the engine block exceeds the 100 kg limit, I'll just freeze the pistons in place (while the rest of the engine continues traveling forward, "colliding" with the pistons), so you get to unleash whatever explosions were happening in the piston chamber as well as your body colliding with the stationary pistons.  (When the kinetic force of the pistons colliding with the rest of the engines causes the pistons to start accelerating forward, I'll just activate my power again to once again decelerate them to zero.)

    * Since none said it yet. Make metal frame for wings and have a low tech flight method if that's what the setting calls for..
    * Can he attach loads to the metal and still manipulate it after the weight limit ? Either way he can use momentum to accelerate and throw objects he holds with the metal, turning him into a catapult or cannon anecdote.
    * If the object only has to be partially contained into the 2m radius he technically can have increased range.
    * Personally I think it'd be cooler if instead of stopping metal nearly instantly his power subconsciously redirected the projectile into an orbit around him, which he then could send back with little to no loss in force or momentum.
    * If you ask some engineers they could easily come up with a better shield / impact absorption system using different metals in combination and not having construction limitations. For instance liquid mercury layered with steel, or some form of metal fur, or simple layering of very thin metal sheets etc.
    * Very thin steel wires, they cut animals very easily..
    * He can technically fly at very high speeds with a metal ball attached to a rope which he grabs when he (mentally) throws the ball and releases when the ball starts falling / decelerating. He can technically do this continuously afaik and go as fast as he wants. As long as the mass of the metal and it's momentum don't magically get transferred to him without physical contact, and he can keep it in his power range.
    * Depending on how much force he can exert, power armor is a thing. And he can use levers and pistons / whatever (ask engineers) to increase his strength without having to worry about a power source, heat or many other obstacles that make it difficult for us to make power armors.

    > alloy containing more than 50% of metal.

    ~~I'd like to point out that that alloys are, by definition, 100% metal.~~

    One major aspect of any materialbending is the fact that they can bend the material without any of the usually necessary equipment. In this case, you can bend metal to mass produce sculptures, or create intricate normally-impossible works, or easily wield metal together.

    Destruction in a city would be absurdly easy. Anything electronic or mechanical could be bricked in an instant. Powerlines, pipelines, wires, cables, easily severed. You could bring buildings down by strategically weakening the metal supports.

    Depending on how the power works, mining could be a good use of your time. Just walk around in a cave, or even just in a soily area, and rip out all the residual metal in range. This could also apply to humans, making for rather bloody deaths of a thousand punctures.
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      How does that definition of alloy work with steel, an "alloy" of iron and carbon?

      Depending on the definition of alloy this power could let you manipulate 49kg of nonmetal in an object. This may be useful for purifying metals.
      ```
