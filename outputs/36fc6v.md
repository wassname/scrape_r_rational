## Divine Grail - A Fate/Zero Fanfic

### Post:

I originally wrote this in response to a [competition](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/353kr3/challengeprompt_you_find_an_oracle_that_will/) posted by /u/alexanderwales about oracles, but didn't finish in time. Gradually scope creep brought me to writing more. 

I recently watched Fate/Zero and enjoyed the anime quite a bit, so I thought I'd tinker around with some ideas. This is my first crack at writing anything longer than a very short story, so let me know what I can do to improve. I'm hoping to crank out 3 or 4 more chapters to reach the end of Fate/Zero in this fanfic and call it complete in the next month.
