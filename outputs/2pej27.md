  As I know a few of us here try our hand at writing from time to time, I wanted to share this podcast. It's short and pretty dense. Part handy information, and part inspiration/motivation. I generally want to go and write whenever I'm done listening to an episode. It's hosted by Brandon Sanderson, author of the Mistborn trilogy (among a number of others).

  Definitely a good podcast (and handy for me on the rather long drives I have to make semi-often; there's just so much there!). Brandon Sanderson has three laws of magic, the first of which you can find [here](http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/) (and he first originated them in the podcast), that I find very helpful when creating a magic system.
