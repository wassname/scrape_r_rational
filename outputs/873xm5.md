## Rational fiction podcast recommendations like Worm and Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality?

### Post:

I just finished the Worm podcast and loved it.  I recently started HPMOR and am very much enjoying that as well.  I am also currently subscribed to Wildbow's other works, Ward and Twig, though I am not listening to them yet until all episodes have been released and I can binge the entire series.

Are there any others I can subscribe to?  My main concern is that between listening to Worm and HPMOR, I finished three other short audio drama podcasts (all under 30 episodes) in a little over a week, and wasn't impressed with any.  So preferably, I'm looking for long, completed rational fiction podcasts, but I'll take all suggestions.  Thanks!

  The Metropolitan Man is a popular rational fiction story with audio, on hpmorpodcast.com

  Friendship is Optimal looks to have audio for it on YouTube that you could download.

    those two are awesome stories, as well.

  You could try "We Are Legion (We Are Bob)"

  It's about a programmer who signs up for cryonics, dies, and is woken up as an AI candidate for a von Neumann probe. Apart from the science used to provide the necessary acceleration and a bit of have waving to get things started, the science is all legit. It's a ton of engineering competence porn, and definitely a blast to read when it gets good.
