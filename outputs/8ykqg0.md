## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I made [an updated inventory](http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2018/07/state-of-writing-2018.html) of writing projects, which was more depressing than helpful or enlightening. Reading some of the old, semi-abandoned projects is really frustrating, because it's often when I'm at the point where I'm actually invested in what's going to happen that the story just comes to a screeching halt - and unlike when I'm reading something that's hit the in-progress point, there's no more coming unless I write it, and no one to blame but myself.

  When rereading things that I've mostly forgotten, I tend to make a bunch of notes when I get to the end, comments on the middle, minor edits for things that make no sense, or I add to the notes that are already there, if I'm not in the mood to actually add on more prose. There are some projects that have seen steady progress made on them over the years, because I add bits and pieces to them every now and then. That's my primary reason for keeping those things around, in addition to the fact that I'm a hoarder.

      Oh, I *do* like it, don't get me wrong. There have been some projects I've completed and I get to the end thinking "the structural problems with this are so severe that I'm going to have to rewrite from scratch". For DWoD, it's more like ... I don't know, looking at a pile of work which will result in it becoming the thing I meant it to be? I was reading through it the other day, and happy enough with it, but it *does* need to get to a second draft state.

    My recommendation: Do not read your unfinished work until you're ready to start working on it again. The repetition and familiarity always makes me feel exhausted, even when I love what I've got, because it reminds me of how intricate things were getting and how much more I have left to do. When I'm motivated that can be the push I need, but when I'm just fishing around and feeling guilty it's super discouraging.

    Worse yet, rereading can crystallize that sense of hopelessness by locking me in the parts of the story that already exist rather than inspiring me to brainstorm its future. I feel, with reasonable evidence, that the more I reread something I've abandoned the less likely I am to return to it.

    If I'm genuinely looking for forward momentum on something old, my most successful trick is to write crappy stream-of-consciousness fanfiction of it:

     * Some interaction between minor characters that happened offscreen, or might in the future!
     * Unnecessary flashbacks!
     * Alternate versions of existing scenes with somebody making different decisions!
     * A wild character from some other story (my own and the greater canon) appears!
     * Gratuitous shipping!

    It's terrible stuff. No focus on crafting efficient language, consistent worldbuilding, or plot legibility. It also makes me fall in love with the original ideas, people, and environments I'd invented all over again. Really chips away at the inertia and, better yet, adds depth to my understanding of what I want for the work.

    Nothing irritates the oyster like a bad example.

    The hardest part is letting the fanfiction be genuinely terrible. It's also the thing that melts the crystals.

    I’ve loosely followed some of your world building and plot ideas for the battle school story on here and discord (the idea of a meta in fighting compositions really caught my fancy as someone who likes to watch esports) and I’d be very interested to read it if it’s ever released to an audience.

  So what are some non-fiction books that you guys enjoyed? This sub has tons of recommendations for stories where the characters use the power of science/their own intelligence to further their own interests, but not as much about the books that teach those concepts directly. Or just, whatever nonfiction books you like and want to talk about.

  ----------------------------------------------

  I'm almost done reading The Demon Haunted World by Carl Sagan, and it's good. It's essentially a book that espouses the value of reasonable skepticism, giving examples of the pitfalls for the people who have never learned how science is done or why science has created the world we enjoy today. Faith healers, new age mystics, evangelicals, UFOologists, etc. It also talks about how important it is to spread rationality and science without being condescending, because it just cements scientists and science enthusiats as ivory tower elites who don't want to bother with the people they consider lesser. Overall very good book, and I recommend it. Bit slow for the first half, but it picks up.

  One small error I noticed was when the book briefly mentions the Higgs-Boson, and its nickname as "the God particle", named so by physicist Leon Lederman. Sagan sounds disappointed in this name, as he puts it "I think they should all be named the God particle", conveying his disappointment in using mysticism to explain physics. But Leon Lederman didn't name it the God particle for religious intentions, he named it the "God Damn particle" because it was so difficult to find, which I think his publisher shortened for the media attention. They had to build the Large Hadron Collider just to confirm the particle's existence, so the full name is rather appropriate. Kind of sad to see such an error from someone I generally expect to do the proper research. It was only a line or two, but still.

    I'm a fan of Oliver Sacks, and have been slowly making my way through his bibliography. There's a lot of explaining neurological concepts, but it's all done through fascinating case studies, which makes it feel sort of like if House M.D. were trying to teach you medicine along the way. *The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat* is probably his most famous. I'm running into what I call the Greatest Hits problem with him, though, in that I'm delving into the stuff that he's not as well known for, and predictably, it's of a somewhat lower quality. This happens whenever I start a deep dive on an author, and it's sort of a question of what the bailing out point is.

      I usually think of this situation by noting that there is no inherent virtue in finishing things -- it's entirely a function of how the payoff changes as you get closer to completion. 

      For something like this, it's probably subject to pretty normal diminishing marginal returns, so maybe you're better off reading all the greatest hits first, and only then hitting the less famous ones.  You gain more value at a faster rate, and lose less when you eventually get tired of it.

    Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari. It's a book about the origins and development of humanity. I've heard some people complaining about it's scientific rigorousness, but I liked it. I found the science couched in a narrative was a good way to keep things interesting.

    On a similar note, I'd also be curious to hear book recommendations for baby's first intro to the philosophy of science. I haven't engaged with the field much since ugrad (in a few elective epistemology classes and occasional forays on my own) and am curious to get back into it (specifically, this morning I saw [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/8ykq66/cambridge_university_embedded_three_philosophy/) and recalled an observation an old friend of mine made regarding how naive and mistaken most practicing scientists were with respect to their views on PoS). Was thinking I'd start up a reading group this upcoming quarter since I can imagine a few peers might be interested, too.

    Currently leaning towards Okasha's *Very Short Introduction* followed by Hacking's *Representing and Intervening*, but am curious what people here think.

    As for OP's question -- I think popsci serves as a great springboard (and enjoyed Sagan, Dawkins, Hawking, etc. when I read them in secondary) but it's hard to beat a good textbook + review papers for learning about a field's fundamentals. I've only read a few of the former these last years but have found them a bit lacking when it comes to robustness and detail of argument.

  Today’s surprising yet wholesome internet discovery is the fan theory that the protagonist of Danny Phantom is a trans boy because the clone Vlad made was female with no explanation besides the trope of “weird cartoon science”. That theory.....actually makes some sense....and adds an interesting layer to Danny’s character that kind of ties into the underlying themes of the show. Hear me out. 

  Danny Phantom is a fairly typical superhero fantasy about a dorky teenage boy who gets bullied at school, but transforms into the archetypal knight in shining armor he’s always wanted to be. Reoccurring plot points include Danny’s insecurity over his masculinity, dealing with social stigma at school, and learning to reciprocate the unconditional support he gets from his friends and family.

  Doesn’t all of that become way more interesting, and less of an example of normalized patriarchal culture, if the hero is trans? I always found Danny to be kind of a boring male archetype who, for some reason, everyone was either irrationally forgiving of or irrationally rude to, but this fan theory turns that into a social satire of the (sometimes cartoonish) challenges of living the life you want and being accepted for who you are.

    I remember a one-season cartoon from the 90s that featured a genderfluid superhero.

    Their secret identity was a guy, their costume persona was a woman, and it was never established if either one of them was the "real" one. The cartoon itself was kind of forgettable and poorly-written.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I’d love to see some decent genderfluid and non-binary representation, though comic!Loki is pretty awesome. There was a recent Disney cartoon that lasted a single season called SheZow about a boy who turns into a female superhero, but it was even less progressive or representative of LGBT people than the one you describe.

      The beauty I find in the Danny Phantom idea is that it is related to the themes of the show, but isn’t the focus of the plot. The question of Danny’s gender is settled and all his loved ones support him unconditionally, the only thing that matters is his life from now on and how he interacts with other people. This is just as compelling, if not more so, if he’s a trans boy.

      His superhero persona isn’t any different from him, it just gives him the chance to do things and earn respect he’s always wanted but never been able to without the same social stigma he usually faces. Its a narrative that can apply universally, particularly for teenagers, but is especially empowering for people who aren’t the “default protagonist”.

      There are theories like this for other characters like Jimmy Neutron, but this is the one that I think fits with what the show was actually about. That’s on top of how well it fits into the canon, like how Danny was the only guy at a pool party in a tank top and is sometimes drawn with a chest that sticks out slightly.

      There is one episode where he is depicted shirtless with a flat chest, but trans men have pointed out that’s not unusual *at all* and the episode is about him trying to build up muscle because he’s insecure. I can totally see this character as a well written trans man, which is a big deal to me because I always found the character to be a generic male hero doing generic male hero things, but this theory makes that the whole point.

  Protip: If you've already used up all of your 100 slots for filtering subreddits out of your r/all, you can filter EVEN MORE subreddits by using custom CSS (through, *e. g.*, [the Stylus browser extension](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)). You also can use this method to eliminate all links that use Reddit's atrocious video hosting. For example:

      div[data-subreddit="boottoobig"],div[data-subreddit="DadReflexes"]{display:none;}/*This is case-sensitive*/
      div[data-domain="v.redd.it"]{display:none;}

  Submissions that are hidden in this fashion still will take up spots in your r/all ([example](https://i.imgur.com/fcNj24p.png)), but they'll be invisible as long as you keep the custom CSS rule active, so you can just go to your Reddit preferences and increase the number of submissions shown per page. If your *entire* r/all is hidden, just disable your custom CSS, click the "hide" button on each objectionable submission, re&euml;nable your custom CSS, and refresh the page.

    Honestly, if someone needs to filter out more than 100 subreddits from /r/all, they're probably using it incorrectly. Only a limited number of subreddits break into the first 500 slots or so, and many do so only very infrequently. If you're searching down below that very frequently, you're just drowing in the noise of mediocre or highly specialized content, and should probably figure out something else to do with your time other than browse reddit.

If instead "plucky girls camping out in a cold environment" was the best aspect of SoraYori for you XD, check out "Yuru Camp", which came out the same season and it's chill and comfy as fuck.

  Came up with yet another cool premise I'm not sure I'll be able to do justice.

  >It is the Second Age, and while God still takes an interest in his world, he no longer takes an interest in his people. His hand passes over the flat earth, and grandiose mountains and forests rise in its wake, unique natural wonders conjured from a divine architect. But divinity does not feed hungry bellies, and to the fragmentary, upstart civilizations that inhabit the world, mountains are no replacement for farmland.

  (I know, this is worldbuilding thread stuff, but I only came up with it today and I don't want to wait.)

  What kinds of plots would you like to see in this world? I actually have a pretty good idea of what the "main" plot is, but I like having peripheral plots happening offscreen to give stories a sense of scale and grandeur that the main plot doesn't need to carry alone.

    Antitheists, railing against a god that has abandoned them in favor of geography.

    Ferverently devout cartographers, for their god ensuring them perpetual employment and relevance. The Cartographer's guild would actually be really powerful, because up to date maps would be worth their weight in gold.

    Various cities would be abandoned as the local geography changes. If you have a port city that suddenly can't access the ocean, or if a major trade route gets cut off by new mountains, then it can't persist at its current size.

    Plucky adventurors would be liable to go looking for said newly created natural wonders in search of profit. Not if it's just pretty scenery, but something like caverns of rare gems and ore would be profitable.

    Border skirmishes between neighboring factions would be super common, because the geography changing could alter the balance of power occasionally. If there's a new river 10 miles into your neighbor's territory, that's a good reason to attempt to expand to the next choke point.

    Logging would be easy if trees are continually being created.

    I think raising animals would be a safer choice than farming, if the landscape changes so much. The animals would be happy to move to newly created land and eat the grass there, while you can't move fields of wheat. This would create more incentives to steal farm animals, ranchers would be aggressive to outsiders and rather territorial, high crime...

    Are new animal species being created? Could have more domesticated species than we do IRL if so.

    Weather patterns would be all over the place, if mountains can just spring up whenever. Last year's climate wouldn't be very indicative of the current year's climate, and deserts and forests would be popping up and disappearing all over the place as rainfall patterns change.

  Random thought solicited by the end of the Soccer World Cup that I had already some time ago (even wrote a joke paper about it): soccer definitely is *not* a rational sport. Scores is too low, random fluctuations and refereeing mistakes can seriously offset the outcome of a match, when paired with a direct elimination tournament format it's basically only marginally better than simply giving the Cup to one random team out of 16. Unless a team is consistently, significantly superior to the opponent, pretty much everything can happen, regardless of individual merit.

  What would you consider a more rational sport, where by that I mean, one that truly follows the spirit, "may the best one win"? I'd say basketball or volleyball are probably pretty good in that respect as they have such high scores you can't simply win because of a blunder, you need to keep up a consistent level of play throughout the match. I'm not much of an expert though so I may be missing something (for example, cricket looks awfully boring - but is it more *fair*?).
  ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    I don't think most people want rational sport. They want *competitive* sport. Not knowing who will win is more exciting than watching the best triumph over and over again, so many sports favor increased randomness in order to allow for the sort of underdog victories and lucky breaks that sell tickets and put butts in seats.

    A great player is kept in line by crappier teammates. Chaotic interactions with the angle of the sun, the speed of the wind, irregularities of the ground defy attempts at perfect play. Randomized competition schedules shuffle who faces who at which point in the season, in what weather, on which field, at which level of preparedness.

    "Pretty much anything can happen, regardless of individual merit" is a selling point.

    EDIT: Kind of a jackass move not to answer your question. Most (non-team, non-projectile) olympic sports are relatively fair. The competitive tension there is usually that an extraordinary athlete might come from anywhere, rather than that the best might not win. It's still a lot less popular than the world cup.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Mmm, good point. But you'd expect that from a narrative standpoint, since ultimately even sport is a *story* (bolstered by the belief/knowledge that it's all real!), having only controlled randomness would favour a more coherent development, where people can form educated guesses about who would win between any two given teams. Of course that touches on another completely different subject - more randomness is good for the betting business.

      Still, I think a sport that relies too much on randomness becomes frustrating to watch. Soccer feels like that to me more often than not (and this came back to my mind after seeing a friend expressing the same feeling on FB). There's a balance - it's fine for random occurrences to spice up the story, but you don't want it to turn into a senseless mess in which some nobody without any merit wins because of pure luck either. That's part of why national championships use round-robin tournaments - a much more consistent way of grading teams - the rest being of course that more matches = more ads = more money.

      Guess there's a lot in play. Reminds me of that time some years ago when Ferrari dominated the F1 championship so completely (with Schumacher & Barrichello driving) they basically started changing the rules just to oust them from their top place. F1 being a sport that relies heavily on technological know-how and money, once Ferrari had gained a competitive edge, it was very hard for it to lose it again.
      ```

      - u/Sparkwitch:
        ```
        I figure randomness is balanced by the fact that skilled players performing skillfully are a lot more fun to watch than less capable folks. In entertainment terms, it really is less important who wins or loses than how they play the game. People remember great moments at least as often as they remember great games, and they're more likely to be fans of great players than they are of great teams.

        Mostly, I think, sport satisfies a visceral need to choose a side and root for it and against its opponents... and I prefer a focus on sport over violence in that regard.

    This is like the second time this week I've seen rational-adjacent community members jump to killing idiots as a solution.

    Like, I get it, maybe you're all just venting. But normalizing that sentiment is *dangerous*. Complain about it in a foul mood today, and it starts to sound a little more realistic tomorrow.

    Bad methodology and bad argument gets met with good methodology and good argument. Does not get bullet. Never ever never for*ever*.

    It's an obstacle, nothing more. Stop treating other people like a cancer and start treating the ideas as cancer and find a way to treat them, instead of sitting here masturbating your monkey brains by thinking how good it would feel to do a national violent purge. It's a crutch, not an actual viable alternative. 

    Focus your brain on how to educate the masses, accept that you will never ever do it in one fell swoop or dramatic anime moment, and channel that anger and frustration into actually solving the problem instead of simmering in dangerous wishful thinking.

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, I guess I should know better and include a bunch of disclaimers by now.

      If you're curious, what got me into this mood was a colleague of mine acting in a way that showed they had paid zero attention to what I'd been doing, what I'd been telling them, and the impact their own words had.

      It got me thinking about how people behave socially, and... it's complicated to describe, but the idea I often come back to is that people are often completely, thoroughly unwilling to learn from their mistakes or open themselves to new perspectives if they have no immediate incentive to do so.

      I have trouble articulating it... which means it's probably not that coherent, I guess, but it's that sense that people are going to make the same dumb mistakes again and again and again, because they don't care if they hurt you, they have no incentive to listen if you point it out to them, and they're not introspective enough to realize they're hurting themselves in the long run. It's frustrating.

      Anyway, I'm better now. Thanks for everyone who had kind words.

    It sounds like you had an interaction with humans who suck -- that sucks!

    In my experience, you can't change other people, apart from a very slight effect of serving as a role model. And killing is illegal (besides which, well you know, bad). The person you can work on the most effectively is yourself. It is hard, but less close to impossible, to improve yourself. There are even some steps that aren't too hard, and can be considered low hanging fruit.

    Here are a few suggestions that you can take or leave, to whatever degree makes sense to you:

    1. Steer clear of subreddits/communities where complaints/politics/fights are the norm. At least consider taking a break if it gets to be too much of a thing for you. Go to the light and fluffy ones instead, even if they seem a bit boring. Better yet, find light and fluffy ones that are well moderated and suit your aesthetic preferences in some way that prevents boredom. Rationalist communities are good, but bear in mind that the neutral-to-critical tone we often prefer won't necessarily be the best therapy if you are going through an intense emotional event and need more positivity as an antidote. You may need to give your brain a temporary break from focused criticism style thinking if you have been pushing it too hard. It happens. On the other hand, rationality is a great voice for structure/control/sanity, so don't abandon it.
    2. Keep a [gratitude journal](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal). I haven't tried this yet but there's some evidence it works well. Write down three things per week that you are grateful for. If you can't think of any due to being in a weird mental state, one thing to try might be to think for five minutes about what you "should" or "could" be grateful for and write those down as a placeholder. Of course, no deity needs to be referenced to be grateful to, it can (and likely should, unless a specific person was involved) just be general gladness about the thing.
    3. The Pareto Principle says 20% of relationships cause 80% of your (relationship related) stress. One way to take action on this is to identify the 2/10 people in your life that are worst for you and interact with them less, or find ways to interrupt their reward loop so they will bother you less. In extreme cases, you may need to cut them out of your life entirely. Alternatively/additionally, find the 20% of people who cause 80% of the good effects on your psyche and find ways to reward and spend more time with them. Familial bonds can be an intensifier here, so be sure to build up any family relationships you find to be positive.
    4. Lower your expectations for anonymous strangers. People who don't have a specific relationship to you are frequently not incentivized to push your positive buttons, and are incentivized to test or throw you off balance to that they can outperform or even take advantage of you. This often happens for game theoretic reasons that are hard to fix at the broad societal level. Some pseudonymous groups (say positively toned subreddits like this one where people are regulars with reputations to build/uphold) are much better than others (usually the high volume political ones, for example) when it comes to being able to expect that a stranger will treat you well. In any case, bear in mind that happiness is often the result of [lower expectations](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ambigamy/201408/the-secret-happiness-and-compassion-low-expectations) in life.
    5. Obligatory plug for standard therapy if you have a mental health condition ([around 1 in 5 people do](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness.shtml), and wanting to kill people even in jest is a strong indicator that you might), as well as taking any prescribed medications on a regular schedule as precisely and consistently as possible. If you have trouble with taking meds on time, an alarm on your phone can work wonders. Don't trust your brain to remind you unless you are already getting 100% success with that method. Chances are the alarm method will make it less stressful even so because of the reduced cognitive burden. If you find yourself ignoring the alarm, finding a reliable person willing to call or text you and remind you to take the meds (or check that you have taken them) for a month or so can be a good option. What they can do to make this simple is set an alarm on their phone for 15 minutes later than your alarm.

    Best of luck. Even if this has zero value to you personally, I hope other frustrated individuals will get some use out of it.
