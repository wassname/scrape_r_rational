## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  How would power dynamics and power structures be impacted by Dungeons and Leveling?

  * Classes for all humans exist, and you level in your class by killing things or performing a class' action (eg, a baker baking), spells and magic items exist.  Assume it's basically a standard 'dungeon fic' ruleset.  
  * Your class is a product of what you practice and what you have aptitude for (kinda like real life, anyone could be a musician, but lots of practice helps and being born with perfect pitch helps more).  It can change eventually with effort.  Assume skill is distributed on a bell-curve.  
  * Classes specialize as you level up.  More combat classes are known because you get more exp by killing things.  So any warrior that works hard will eventually become a sword saint that can pierce the heavens as long as they don't die and consistently dive the dungeon.  Nearly all Bakers would die of old age before they could naturally rank-up into an Arch-Pâtisserie, unless they were an Einstien tier baking savant or bankrolled by someone able to provide them with crafting materials.
  * All classes scale Geometrically with level, and exponentially if you count gear/support/rank-ups/tactics.  So an Arch-Pâtisserie cooks faster, cooks better, and has a lower failure rate than a normal chef to make him 20x better than, but during his years he's also has also accumulated contacts with Sous-Chefs, a stock of better ingredients, and an enchanted Gastronomicon to make him 400x better.


  * Dungeons have levels with monsters inside of them.  Monsters drop loot.  Loot gets better and monsters get stronger (exponentially) as you progress.
  * Dungeons get stronger over time, and spawn monsters outside periodically, making any area around an uncontested dungeon uninhabitable eventually.
  * Economically assume a new adventurer earns enough to survive just above poverty level, while the highest level of adventurers would earn the equivalent of CEO/Sports Superstar/Movie Star level pay, if money even changed hands at these tiers.  
  * I'm ballparking that 50% of adventurers die in the first year, and ~20% die each year thereafter.  To reach the peak of skill normally takes 30 years, so 0.05% of adventurers reach.
  * Everyone is actively trying to minmax the system, from raising children they think would be good support/healers by having them constantly pray, to the wealthy hiring adventurers to powerlevel them, to nobles passing down 'A-Tier' equipment to their adolescent children, to investors fronting the resources to powerlevel crafting classes.

  --------------------------

  My brainstorming starts here.

  My first thought is that in such a situation, fuedalism would be the natural political structure.  You've got a (necessary) warrior culture, who are able to create a stranglehold on power by passing down equipment and powerleveling kids.  

  However my second thought was that a 'free market' society would work out too.  If you toss all your country's of boys into the dungeon at random, whoever survives a couple of years is much more likely to be on the higher end of the 'killing things' bell-curve.  Assuming it's heritable, after even a handful of generations you end up with a whole civilization of  amazing adventurers.  Also polygamous, since 80% of your men would be dead before 20y/o.  Although the setting runs into the problem of why such a civilization isn't overwhelmingly dominant due to 'bene gesserit breeding program' style power growth, since 80% seems like really heavy selective pressure.  

  In either situation, I assume whoever is the supreme ruler would have to be the strongest.  With exponential power growth, if you are stronger than a given noble, then you're likely *way* stronger, so you can just go in and kill them and take their stuff with little risk.  The natural response to me would be to kill people (or marry them into the family) before they can become a threat, but the endgame result would be just a single noble house that reigns supreme.  Unfortunately, that doesn't seem very 'medieval fanstasy' to me.

  If I want to keep Game of Thrones style noble houses, I could maybe have each noble house specialize in a different class.  They know all the secret skill synergies, best enchants, training regimens, and have gear to powerlevel their children. If the result of a fight is highly variable based on matchup, then that could keep things stable if there are alliances working together to shore up weaknesses.  However, that's still an unstable equilibrium.  

  No matter what, I assume the common person gets shit on.  Law seems hard to enforce when an adventurer could just kill as they please.  You could have the law backed up by nobles (who are strong enough to take you out), but that doesn't explain what incentive the nobles would have to care about common people enough to make laws for commoners in the first place.  Afterall, IRL, they barely did so even when they weren't walking demigods, so I don't see them doing it when they're 400x more powerful.  Also, Fuedalism requires you to *want* something from your feif.  If the only things of real value to you are what you and your nearest servants can farm from the dungeon, then there's no reason not to rule over corpses while you and your retainers (and a handful of servants) only concern yourselves with dungeons.

  How would priests and merchants work?  I suppose priests could have some actual divine intervention to keep the church independent, but I'd prefer to keep the supernatural as constrained as possible.  For merchants though I can't think of any good reason why unstoppable God-Nobles to bother with allowing them independence instead of just owning everything within their realm.

    I'd imagine the [legal system would look very different](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Course_Pages/legal_systems_very_different_12/LegalSystemsDraft.html). In particular, I think the main source of enforcement would be the threat of someone swearing revenge, which becomes more of a threat as the vengeful party is likely willing to take risks to power-level themselves and they can choose a build that counters their aggressor.

    One option would be for it to work like [pre-Norman Ireland](http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Course_Pages/legal_systems_very_different_12/Book_Draft/Systems/IrishLawChapter.html), where your social rank (level?) determines your honour-price, a measure of your value to your kinsmen. Killings incur a blood-debt which depends on the honour-price of both the victim and their kinsmen. In your setting, this honour-price would likely be similarly exponential, and would protect the families of high-level adventurers. 

    I'd really recommend reading the book, or at least the [SlateStarCodex summary](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/13/book-review-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/), it's a great resource for worldbuilding.

    Another factor that's worth considering is motivation: what drives people to seek more? When you've reached a level where you can live comfortably at a subsistence level, why go further? This might be one of the limiting factors of the Lord of the Flies-style dumping kids in the dungeon - once they're strong enough to survive, why would they risk their lives further?

    I mentioned revenge already as a powerful motivator, and I'd imagine the state that can first develop a viable propaganda machine or magic with similar effects would have a significant advantage with or without unethical childcare practices.

    > In either situation, I assume whoever is the supreme ruler would have to be the strongest.

    Not necessarily.

    There pretty much has to be a King or a Noble class, and this could very well give benefits to the people under the ruler's rule. For example, imagine Freddy the fiftieth-level fighter, who can kill just about anything - and Karl the second-level King, who automatically gives all his subjects a +2 to their attack rolls (+4 when fulfilling a Royal Decree).

    While Freddy *could* easily squash Karl, it's actually more to Freddy's benefit for Karl to rule, because then Freddy gets to hit harder when he goes to the dungeon. Sure, Freddy might dictate to Karl what his Royal decrees should be, and Karl might be the ruler in name only (at least until he's gained a few more levels in King)... but Karl doesn't need to be the strongest in order to rule.

    > you level in your class by killing things

    Does this apply to *all* classes? Can a Baker get better at Baking by killing monsters? (Does it help if he then bakes using the monsters he killed as ingredients?)

    --------------

    Is it possible for a high-level adventurer to help a low-level adventurer level up through those difficult early levels (kindof babysitting in areas of the dungeon that are easy for the high-level guy)? That sort of behaviour can dramatically improve early-level survivability.

    --------------

    > For merchants though I can't think of any good reason why unstoppable God-Nobles to bother with allowing them independence instead of just owning everything within their realm.

    Perhaps a Merchant class gets skills that can affect things that the merchant (and only the merchant) owns - like turning them into other items of similar value, or merging many weak items to create a stronger item. Then Freddy the fiftieth-level fighter has plenty of reason to keep Manny the Merchant around - not even Freddy can wield twenty +1 swords at once, but he would love to have the single +10 sword that Manny can make from them.

      >King or Noble Class

      Interesting.  That might help.  Although, my goal is to make classes an outgrowth of what you do instead of what you are, so I'm not sure how I could translate to being a king. 

      I need to decide on how classes are gained.  Eg, would Robert Baratheon be an extremely skilled warrior who hasn't used it in ages?  Or would he be supernaturally good at drinking wine and banging wenches after decades of practice?  Or would he be a king, because he's the king, so obviously he's been king-ing all this time?  I've seen all 3 styles in stories.

      I suppose I should also mention that nobody (except the main character) would know exactly what a class was.  Normal people would do the ritual to feel a person's soul and see that someone's spirit felt warm and fluffy like baked bread and that it feels so big it's about to burst.  Then if they ever met another baker they could identify it easily.  But only the MC would be able to look at someone and see "lvl 25 baker(ready for rank up promotion)".


      >Does this apply to all classes?

      Yes.  Although a baker who spends 90% of his time killing instead of baking will probably not stay a baker for long.  

      > high-level adventurer to help a low-level adventurer

      Absolutely.  There would probably still be a minor bump in risk whenever they're finally on their own unsupervised, but it'd be mitigated significantly.  The numbers I threw out are for traditional 'find a sword, go make your fortune!' kinda stories.

      > Merchant Class

      It makes sense.  Real life merchants do provide value-add.  Heck, even keeping it to low magic level, having a merchant as someone who can accurately asses the value of goods and connect you to people means that Freddy could be sure the sword he's buying from another adventurer Carl is a +10, if Manny acts as the assessor, instead of needing to go kill 1000 slimes to figure out if it's a +9 or +10.  (Side note: I just realized what kind of a D&D/MMO sensibilities I have when I'm fine if a wizard teleports, but a merchant turning 20x +1 swords into a +10 sword being too Imbalanced.)

        > Interesting. That might help. Although, my goal is to make classes an outgrowth of what you do instead of what you are, so I'm not sure how I could translate to being a king.

        So, in order to level up as a King, you need to spend time actually running a Kingdom? Handling Kingly decisions, that sort of thing?

        Makes sense - and importantly, means that a puppet king or king-in-name-only controlled by higher-level Warriors won't level up (because he's not the one doing the kinging).

        > I need to decide on how classes are gained. Eg, would Robert Baratheon be an extremely skilled warrior who hasn't used it in ages?

I've seen all 3 styles in stories.

        Maybe he's multi-classed. Level 15 Warrior, level 2 King, level 30 Hedonist. Something like that.

        > Yes. Although a baker who spends 90% of his time killing instead of baking will probably not stay a baker for long.

        Hmmm. But would he keep his Baking-related Skills? Because this sounds like a situation which would lead to multiclassing.

        >  There would probably still be a minor bump in risk whenever they're finally on their own unsupervised, but it'd be mitigated significantly.

        It seems likely, then, that most successful families would raise their children through a level or two in the Dungeon; because families that do that would survive better. Note that this doesn't prevent orphans or imports from other worlds from being just dumped in the Dungeon with nothing more than clothes, a sword, and hope...

        > even keeping it to low magic level, having a merchant as someone who can accurately asses the value of goods

        Another example of the use of a Merchant class. I think it's important that every last Class needs to have something that's useful to others; such that, if the Class is suddenly absent (e.g. the last Baker in the village dies), then people feel that loss and there's social pressure to find (or raise) a replacement. It might even make sense for high-level Bakers (or whatever) to train up apprentices - partially because training up an Apprentice is probably a great way to level up *any* class, partially because the Apprentice is a son or daughter or cousin and the Baker wants to give him a good start in life, and partially because the village will still need a Baker after this one dies...

        I doubt that King would be a class then. Instead, you would have Politician or Legislator or Manager or Coordinator, which describe what a person does, and beyond that, allow them to be held by a much wider range of people. After all, a feudal system has a whole bunch of different levels, if you're going that route, you probably want a class that can handle a baron, duke, count, king, etc. If you don't want the system to implicitly/explicitly back feudalism, then you can keep the class as generic as possible, capable of being adapted by different forms of government.

    Toss the girls and enbies in, too! Nothing beats hatefucking your nemesis in the guts of the dragon you just killed together.

    But you're forgetting your own lore: the adventuring classes are not the only ones; the economy needs people to level in Baking and Weaving and Masonry and Elder Care as much as it needs dungeon-delvers.

    A solution to the self-sovereign tyrant warrior-nobles you describe is a peasantry that cultivates a middle class in order to ensure there's enough wealth in town to hire a ronin or five to deal with uppity nobles. 

    If an unstoppable god-noble wishes to be more than a mendicant or peregrine knight, that noble must find someone who consents to be ruled by the noble. Declaring that everything within sight belongs to the noble is a good way for the noble to convince someone in town to quietly kill the noble, or have the town shun the noble. The noble would run up against the sort of problem frequently discussed in policing-by-consent and anarchist circles: if you use violence against your community, your community will quickly cease to be yours.
    ```

  - u/alphanumericsprawl:
    ```
    You need merchants to exchange goods. Presumably some dungeons have different monsters, so there're incentives to trade. The nobles can't possibly do it all by themselves. They can't be in multiple places at once. It makes sense to have a cordial relationship with traders, they can help fund your missions to better dungeons and sell the stuff you don't need, want, or have too much of. Seize their wares and they'll find out and blacklist you.

    Likewise with peasants. Can you really get everything you need from a dungeon? Every kind of food? Alchohol? Textiles? Furniture? Labour for building a fort/mansion? 

    How can a supreme ruler project power? He can enforce the grovelling submission of whoever's in the same county but what about beyond that? How does he know who's loyal and who's rebelling? Communication is slow and suspect. How can he find and hunt down anyone who opposes him, assuming they can hide? I could see a supreme ruler sitting in place, enjoying the luxuries of a great trading city on a crucial river location. Ruling a global empire is impossible with medieval technology.

    Just make communication and transport slow and you get a fractured world. Rome was nothing without the Med, China depended upon its rivers.

  thursday is halloween, and the horror stories are on TV again. so lets think rational supernatural horror. 

  If we assume that supernatural horror exists (and please list sources for ideas you want to use, not everyone saw the same movies), what can we thus rationally deduce about the world? how do we then use that to our own benefit? 

  ghosts, demons, and magic are the most common unexplained elements, such as Chucky being able to move his soul into a doll that can then keep coming back from the dead. if you skip the psycho murder part, that sounds like a very advantageous transhuman solution to death if you have properly sophisticated vessels for people to move their souls into as they die. bonus points if we save your DNA so we can eventually clone you, and get you back into your own body again.
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    The protagonists/victims of a horror movie usually don't know that they're in a supernatural horror setting. This is despite some of the things that happen being quite blatant (any slasher movie is going to kill enough people in a short enough span that there ought to be some sort of investigation). So my first assumption is that one of the easier, more common, and/or stronger supernatural powers helps keep secrets. Some sort of antimemes or magical counter-espionage. This means that every mystic secret society I've ever heard of (illuminati and such) is a fraud, and any real organizations that experiment on the supernatural are much better hidden.

    So if I was trying to do something like using Chucky dolls for transhumanist life extension, my first steps would be to try to figure out what's maintaining supernatural secrecy and whether it can be counteracted, because once I pierce the veil I might find other people who are already further along in their research.

    Also I'd check what the conditions for being a vampire are; sounds much more fun than being a doll. I assume they need to drink fresh human blood in some way that's defined more mystically than chemically, but I'd want to figure out what the minimal amount of humanness is according to the magic (a la the smiley face maximizer), and see if mass producing that is ethical.
    ```

    - u/Teulisch:
      ```
      easiest assumption, is that there are a large number of vampire variants.

      i remember [Ghoulies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoulies_(film_series)), a series built around summoning these small monsters. horror-comedy, and some idiot has to let them into the world first. 

      if we allow for ghosts, then we assume the soul exists after death. so, avoiding death is no longer the primary goal- how do we instead maximize for the best immortal existance? this depends on availible afterlives. the existance of demons raises a lot of cause for concern overall.
