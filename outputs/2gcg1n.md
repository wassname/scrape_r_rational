    My thoughts exactly. A rationalist giver maximising good and would give to, for example, [the SCI](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative) where that small amount of money could change lives a whole lot more than just a meal or two for that homeless person would.

  I like Tim Minchin as a comic, but as a rationalist, from what I've seen, his material only uses the minimum amount of rationality needed to take combatorial shots at people who are religious, believe in alternative medicine, or live under some other illusion that's easy to spot from the outside.

  I'd like his work better if he educated more and went after easy targets less.

  If only it was that easy to change oneself.
