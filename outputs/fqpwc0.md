    It looks like you're approaching Jack Vance's magic from the side of science.
    ```

  For some reason I've been picturing this kid somewhere in the 18-22 range. Looks like he's way younger than I thought. Good on him to stick it to the man! Or men in this case. That poor star must be so confused at having a squirt stick probes and scales in all sorts of places.

  ```
  Yeah, that Archmage has totally been stealing knowledge. That's what forced retirement is, and is why he's so powerful.
