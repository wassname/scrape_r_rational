## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

      I really wanted to like it, but it's got pacing problems and no real payoff in the >100k words until I dropped it.

      If you were bored by then, that doesn't change.  I think I ended up liking the characters less by then.

    *The Last Angel* is fantastic, Proximal Flame's stuff in general I'd highly recommend. *Names of the Demon* is one of my favourites series of theirs, though it's really short (only 5 chapters).

  There are some reservations, but I'll recommend the anime [Moriarty the Patriot](https://www.funimation.com/shows/moriarty-the-patriot/). As the title suggests, Professor Moriarty becomes a patriotic Lord of Crime, punishing nobles who abuse weak and helpless members of the lower classes.

  The first 5 episodes are repetitive and frankly a little tasteless (dark and gory revenge stories), but with Holmes' unexpected entry things pick up. The intellectual level of the show is not as high as one would hope, but something keeps drawing me back into it. Perhaps it is the feeling that it at least *has* an intellectual level. Despite the pretty-boy designs there's something grand and cultured in the aesthetic that shows itself enough to keep me watching. And Holmes is very engaging.

  It sometimes feels like a cross between *Psycho-Pass* (blonde Makishima) and the BBC *Sherlock* (risk-loving Sherlock), though not as accomplished, and with a strong subtext of inequality added in. Despite its faults its become a favourite.
  ```

  - u/jaghataikhan:
    ```
    I just finished it this past weekend, and tbh I thought it was bland. The inequality theme could have been interesting were it not so heavy handed, and the typical Holmesian deductions felt increasingly out of nowhere (e.g. the scene on the not titanic where Holmes figures out Moriarty is a math professor due to stopping to admire the Fibonacci esque spiral staircase made me laugh at how ridiculous it was).

    That said, the vibe of the show changed for the better with the introduction of Holmes as a deuteragonist, and a buddy said season 2 was an improvement. I may watch it at some point, but I give S1 a meh 6/10 rating

    I'm a coder, and I like fantasy, so I've kept an eye on this space. Unfortunately, I can't say there's a ton here.

    Rick Cook's Wizardy Compiled series is this, though, honestly, I think it's kind of weak. Been awhile since I read it. I think I remember him summoning a demon called Emacs to help him, which is a little much in a published novel :/ Though I do love Emacs. I also kind of feel like the coding was a bit hand-wavy.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Cook

    The Magic 2.0 Series is a bit more tolerable, as I recall. A programmer finds a text file that, apparently, allows him to edit the universe. Turns out if you (this part is kind of contribed) edit this file a lot, you wind up in a fantasy world. (Mostly because of the IRS? Yeah, sorry, if you can edit money into bank accounts and you can't figure out how to avoid the IRS, you're an idiot.) I remember it being a bit more fun, and there are some entertaining shenanigans that are more like real coding. Still not exactly 5 stars, but worth checking out.

    https://www.goodreads.com/series/131379-magic-2-0

    There's a (very) unfinished web fiction, Break Them All, that has some really entertaining programming magic stuff. The MC gets turned into a kid at the beginning, which is weird and kind of pointless, but w/e. The real issue is that it's more of a side project to a side project for the author and is likely dead. 

    https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/

    Kind of a hail mary, but the Worm fanfiction The Paragamer has some coding vibes. The MC exploits his game interface and does some coding here and there. Also incompletely complete, or dead, or something.

    Unfortunately, this seems like a pretty unexplored space. Maybe real programmers are too busy programming to write? Or they all write hard sci-fi. I'd also be interested in more recommendations.

    There's some of this in Delve, but it takes a while to crop up (I want to say like 80-90 chapters?). The tl;dr: is that the Isekai LitRPG system can be interacted with through code-like commands, but its not a widely known fact (or even a secretly known fact until the protag discovers it maybe?) since the world is kind of narratively implied to be rebuilt in the aftermath of the apocalypse of the society that built the system (as an interface/tool to use already present magic) with the descendants not fully understanding this due to the loss of history and knowledge. The protag starts using the code to gain a better understanding of the system, implement simple computer functionality like a notepad, tables, spreadsheets, and a WIP calculator, but also makes himself macros to automate the usage of his magic and adjust parameters and settings all at once. That said, its very much a useful tool and part of the overarching plot/world rather than a main focus of the story right now, so it may not be what you want. 

    Also going to mention that Delve is a divisive story. The writing is a bit eclectic and scattered as an amateur's first novel, which is exacerbated in that the protagonist spends about three dozen chapters slowly frying his own brain on accident by overuse of magic before he realises, and the pacing is a bit off, which is in turn exacerbated by only having a weekly update schedule so that some weeks feel like nothing but a filler episode as the protagonist chases up a minor character moment or two, or sits down to work out his build, stats, or code, to update or optimise them. So probably read it only if you've got time to burn through it in chunks, rather than drip feed yourself here and there.

    I will add to the recommendation, and specifically recommend the audiobook performance. Top notch production all around, the material is great and the vocal / musical performance enhances it in every way.

    In terms of stories about saving the world, I don't think this one rates very high in realism... but the idea of the global community putting absolutely every drop of effort and authority possible into the survival of the planet is fun to see. And it has a good amount of scientific problem solving applied to its various problems.

  Does anyone else enjoy Journey of Black and Red here? At the minimum it’s very competent, if not rational. The MC never makes ridiculous decisions and does some things I find quite interesting in the setting, like being the sole vampire to use and enjoy guns, artillery, and explosives. The writing quality and prose itself is incredible and definitely among the best, if not the definitive best, on RoyalRoad.

  What I’m getting at is that the author, Mechanimus, has started uploading a new novel as well, The Calamitous Bob. It’s a ...more(relatively, it’s Mechanimus after all) comedic novel that’s litrpg and follows a black mage MC. There’s only 7 chapter thus far but they’ve all been exceedingly rich, vivid, and high quality, as expected of the writer. The System seems interesting and has potential too, and I definitely feel like this novel will also rise to the top of Best Rated too. Any opinions on either of these?
  ```

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    Journey's pretty good all around, especially considering how many Vampire novels like to ignore so many of the typical mythological weaknesses. A story that actually drives home near instant death to sunlight, inability to stay awake during the day, fear of religious iconography, bloodthirst and blood starvation, strict adherence to oaths, and inability to enter uninvited all together is rare. I think there might have been something about running water, but I don't remember, and I can forgive skipping garlic as a weakness given how weird a weakness that is and how its so frequently used in other vampire media.

    Also props to the author for their absurd writing pace. Journey is 115 chapters at its weekly public update pace, but the Patreon is 30 chapters ahead and the author has been doing a second novel, currently around 35 chapters (on Patreon, RR release only started the other day), over the past 6 months or so where they previously just built up more of a Patreon backlog the whole time.

  Finally went back and read up on [The Paragamer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-paragamer-book-i-worm-the-gamer-w-ocs-complete.496126/reader/). Book I was decent, and the plot was kept interesting enough to keep entertainment going, and gave the feeling that no arc was standalone.  

  On that note, what are some of the Gamer fics (don't neccessarily have to be Worm crossovers)that you recommend ? I'm considering going back to check how Greg Veder vs the World turned out.

      One thing to keep in mind is that [the author chose](https://www.reddit.com/r/WormFanfic/comments/m674oa/tips_for_writing_greg/gr4o7c8/) to write Greg Veder as an OC:

      > ... [the canon] Greg is a boring person ... The Greg I wrote doesn't have a lot to do with Greg, I put a cringey memelord in his place because it would resonate more with a modern audience and be funnier.

  Re-reccing a few things from previous threads:

  [A Subtle Knife](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-subtle-knife-worm-yj-si.342043/) is a great Young Justice SI in the vein of With This Ring, with a Jack Slash power and a focus more on relationship building that Uplift. It does a really great job of showing the uses of the manipulation aspect of the power. The author also did a great job putting himself into this world, flaws and all, and and both the SI and the other characters feel well-rounded and three dimensional. 

  [Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that) is great alternate telling of the traditional isekai formula, with the MC being unwillingly brought in to be the Dark Lord under threat of Torture. The MC manages to straddle the line between being a huge misanthrope who still manages to evoke sympathy from recognizing exactly how messed up the world he's been dropped into is. (Some content Warnings for abuse, violence, etc) >!A really interesting part is the fact that the goddess of Evil has clearly been stacking the deck for him as much as possible without being caught. Its highly implied that many of the conveniently evil antagonists he's felt fine about killing have been purposefully set up to make him feel ok with his position, and that's a delightful existential horror!<

  [Daybreak on Hyperion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42771/daybreak-on-hyperion) has been getting a rewrite recently, and I think it's rational, or at the very least rational-adjacent. To partially describe it (but not giving it justice), it's a deconstruction of the power-fantasy component of Isekai, with more focus on geopolitics than individual power.

  From the author note

  >Daybreak on Hyperion is NOT written as one of those 'feel-good' or power fantasy stories. If you're bothered by protagonists who lack agency (especially in early story) or having to make compromises due to difficult circumstances, then this fiction is probably not for you. Similarly, if you're the type who is easily bothered by discussion of real-life issues such as geopolitics, cultural differences, gender roles, etc., then the contents of this story may also bother you. I wrote this story to reflect upon real-world issues, not to detach myself from reality.
  ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    I read this (book 1 and a bit of 2) despite the author's warnings, and my feelings are mixed.

    First off, the lack of protagonist agency is really bad. Now, sure, this *is* in the disclaimer, but I didn't take it very seriously because I couldn't imagine an author writing "if you're bothered by bad writing and storytelling, remember that you've been warned" and thought that this disclaimer was just to scare away easily offended readers. It's not. The whole story is just a "slavery arc" except the protagonist is weirdly totally cool with it. Like, I get it's supposed to be a reconstruction or a realistic take on Isekai, but for a self-avowed democracy-loving Pastafarian to be yoink'd into a religious zealotry medieval feudal hellscape should result in more culture clash. Back to the agency thing though, it just doesn't make for a good story when people walk all over the protagonist, repeatedly abusing them physically, emotionally/mentally, and sexually and the protagonist is just like, "well, this is fine". 

    Then there's the forced feminization which is... just a little weird. I mean, the majority of female characters the protagonist interacts with just happen to have the demeanor of a sadistic dominatrix who gets off on torture and the majority of the male characters are some degree of sexual predator. Like, I get it, nobles be crazy, but this *combined* with the lack of agency just leaves me slightly uncomfortable and bored. 

    The worldbuilding and politics is probably well done, but I'm off the "blah blah politics" school of thought and personally think that priority in a story should lie with characters, followed closely by plot with worldbuilding trailing somewhere behind. It's important sure, but ultimately I care more about the human experience and not the intricacies if a made up feudal system. 

    All that said though, I *did* read a lot of it. Moment to moment, it can be engaging and the writing is technically competent.
    ```

  - u/TridentTine:
    ```
    Thanks for the rec.

    There are a lot of problems with this story. The number of dialogue sentences beginning "As you know, ...[exposition dump]" is far too high, for one. Despite the issues though, it was an enjoyable read. Will be following the rewrite.

    However, there is a lot of information that needs to be conveyed, and although the method is inelegant, it's at least efficient. I think the worldbuilding is of a level to be called "rational," possibly because it mostly pulls together elements from real history. Regardless the setting is interesting and fairly thought-through.

    Although the story is ostensibly from Kaede's viewpoint, after reading Vols 1 & 2 I wouldn't consider her the "protagonist," she's kinda just along for the ride. Pascal & Sylviane are a lot more interesting, and thankfully as the story goes on it also focuses on them more. And there are also other interesting characters.

    Strengths:

    * Fleshed out world, factions, history, system of magic
    * Characters have depth. The author mentions they wrote the story in consultation with a psychologist, and I can believe it.
    * Due to the extensive exposition, you have plenty of context to make the action meaningful, and so I didn't gloss over it as I often do in some stories.
    * Faithful depiction of geopolitics that I think is neither too cynical nor too idealistic.

    Weaknesses:

    * Kaede. She's just...not that interesting. The gender-bender thing seems unnecessary as it doesn't add anything to the story, and is largely glossed over except in internal dialogue. Maybe this was edgy when the story was originally written, but now it's just an unnecessary element. As to her passivity... I'm sure there are ways to do the supporting, scholar/scribe character well, even as a main character, but this isn't it. Gives me Mary Sue vibes somehow.
    * Heavy-handed exposition & frequent infodumps. This is just a writing failure, I'm sure with more effort this could be woven into the story. However it does drag the story down.

    A general comment: you may have a better time with this story if you are somewhat familiar with late medieval to industrial world history. I don't exactly fall into this category, but it reminds me a lot of EU4 (the video game). The story seems to be set roughly about that time period, except elements from 1500-WWI ish are present all at once rather than sticking to a particular time, with the occasional addition from mythology or Greek/Roman times.

    Despite focusing a lot on the problems, I would recommend trying this story. But maybe try at a time when you're not just looking for mindless entertainment, as the exposition can take some effort to get through. Hardly the driest or densest story I've read though.

  So I've been reading [Ar'Kendrihyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) recently, and have a quibble with the Script (the System) that runs the world's magic.  What, exactly is the point of having levels to the skills, when they cap out at 10 (Roman Numeral X), and are relatively easy to level?  With just a very few exceptions, all the characters have skills capped.  It isn't uncommon for a character to buy a skill, and reach the cap later that day.

  Sure, the MC was walking around for about a month without all skills capped, but that was due to a lack of dedication and distractions, as much as anything.

  I'd rather see a system where progress occurs over a much longer time period. Maybe there should be a bonus / penalty when using the skill in an active combat / in the practice field.  I don't know.

  I just felt it was an overall strange choice.

If you really wanna be spoiled though (heavy heavy  spoilers) >!The reason the ranks exist is to facilitate better meshing between the soul and the spell. When someone gets a spell it is sorta imprinted in their soul, which stresses it. At level 10 that imprint is settled, and so you can use the max rank spell into spell combinations. !<

    The only one I can think of is Dune by Frank Herbert, which is fortunate as it's exceptional. On the off chance you've never read it, give it a try. It's actually the go to example for well executed 3rd person omni, I believe.

    Now that I think of it, a lot of hard sci-fi tends to be 3rd person omni, though not to the standards of Dune. Usually it creates a distance from the characters which I don't like.

  I finished Twin Peaks last week.  I don't know how much the good people of r/rational will enjoy it - unanswered questions and bizarre narrative direction abound at every turn.  The show treads more ground than even seems reasonable, and David Lynch gets off on not giving closure.

  So why am I recommending it?  Because despite the "finale" leaving me almost fuming, it was one of the most entertaining shows I've ever seen; and I generally hate unanswered questions.  Lynch might be a dick as a storyteller, but damn if he isn't a genius.  The characters, the patient payoffs, the weird humour, even the atmosphere - I never thought I'd spend two full minutes watching a woman put her shoes on with my eyes wide open.

  All this said, I expect heavy YMMV.  And it starts fairly slow, so don't judge it off of that.

    If you liked twin peaks you might like the anime [Paranoia Agent](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0433722/) by Satoshi Kun (Paprika, Perfect Blue). 13 Episodes with 20 minutes a piece. 

    It has similar vibes as Twin Peaks imo, both being somewhat absurd but feeling like they follow some sort of twisted logic, but Paranoia Agent has a (semi) clear resolution at the end.

    In general, everything by Satoshi Kun does a really amazing job of mixing metaphors and ideas into the story in interactable ways and lots of amazing movies take inspiration from his work. (Black Swan is basically a western version of Perfect Blue, Inception is heavily inspired by Paprika)

    Do you mean the original 2 seasons or the entire thing? And did you also watch Fire Walk with Me? (Which is certainly different from the show, a horror film in the classic sense that a horrifying atmosphere pervades, rather than having individual scary scenes)

  So... Any recs for audio books? For work related reasons I am listening to 9 hours of them per day, so could really use some good recs. Strong performance as important as strong story, or nearly

    If you really want to be blown away, listen to Brandon Sanderson's *Stormlight Archive* series as an audio drama (graphicaudio). It's insanely long (each book is like 40+ hours) and the production quality and voice acting combined with the sound effects and music is fantastic.

    Not sure if this will be helpful but if you lower your standards (a lot) you can use Text-To-Speech tools on any good e-reader app. Don't recommend if performance is what you're looking for, do recommend if easy story consumption is.

    Backstory: I used to consume unhealthy amounts of translated Chinese webnovels (of wildly varying quality) and got used to TTS through that.

      Recommending Dream Reader if on IOS. Many nice customization features.

    Everything on [The Methods of Rationality podcast](https://hpmorpodcast.com/) website is great, while the audio quality on What Lies Dreaming could be better, in general the audio quality and performance is good as well. 

    Matt Arnold's reading of [Unsong](https://www.audible.com/pd/UNSONG-Audiobook-Version-Podcast/B08JJPNB2N) has passable performance. It is in need of a round of editing. But it does exist, and Unsong is pretty great, and many jokes which are hard to understand in text become clearer when read aloud.

    Not rational, but James Marsters' narration of the Dresden Files is absolutely fantastic if you like the series.

  Strong recommendation for the anime OddTaxi, which is going to have its finale next week but I’m now 99.9% sure will stick the landing. One of the most compelling, well plotted, and occasionally funny thrillers I’ve ever seen. Starts very slow and has a large cast that slowly converges to a common resolution, all centred around the taxi driver Odokawa. Also, all characters are anthropomorphic animals >!though it’s strongly hinted that this is just a weird sort of synesthesia that Odokawa is experiencing!<.
