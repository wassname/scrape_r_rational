## The Standard Accepted Rational Fictions

### Post:

Can we have a compiled list of the fictions that obviously, definitely meet the standard for being considered rational/rationalist?  And maybe put it in a sidebar, or in a wiki (and then sidebar-link to the wiki)?

Here are some old masters' non-fanfictions that should surely be on the list:

* [The World of Null-A](http://m.friendfeed-media.com/3570919004ec89f17b6978a4bf1d5a8d46e2d804)
* [The Players of Null-A](http://www.e-reading.co.uk/bookreader.php/133624/The_Players_of_Null-A.pdf)
* [David's Sling](http://www.amazon.com/Davids-Sling-Marc-Stiegler/dp/0671653695)
* [Earthweb](http://www.amazon.com/Earthweb-Marc-Stiegler/dp/067157809X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1391297844&sr=1-1&keywords=earthweb)

  Sounds like a fine idea.  Unless /u/seraphnb wants to do this tonight as a last modding act, I'll get on it tomorrow evening.

  (Sorry, but it's late at night for me and I have an exam in the morning.)

  ```
  Annoying nitpick: This should be called "works of Rationalist Fiction." "Rationalist Fictions" would, in current vernacular, mean "lies told by Rationalists", usually with the connotation of politics.
