  The reversal of "escapism" is an interesting one that I think I'll need some time to process. The argument that the Amish live *further* from reality than I do is ... I don't know. I grew up around the Amish, and the Hutterites, and was raised in a somewhat similar (if more technologically progressive) ethno-religious group. I would definitely agree that they have a more socially and physically focused reality. "More real" is much harder to pin down. I spend the majority of my waking life in front of a screen, either on the internet, writing code, or writing prose fiction. The zen state of computer programming, in all its mathematical/platonic glory, does not seem particularly real to me, in part because it's almost exclusively several layers of abstraction on top of the actual computational processes themselves. I write something like `rdrOrders.Read`, and that's an abbreviation for whole processes and meanings that I'm allowed to remain ignorant of.

  I enjoyed the article, but the conclusions are so counter-intuitive that I think they might just be wrong.

    I think it depends what level of understanding you have about the exact process mediating your experience?  I always feel that computer screens are *very* real, because I have a fairly solid understanding of what the abstractions are built out of.  Of course, I also feel that trees and bricks are real, but I would certainly say that tribal rain gods are far less real than *any* of the above-mentioned things.

    It could be a matter of understanding and also *control*.  Computers can be turned off, and don't demand that you think of them as comprising the overarching truth of reality.  Tribal rain dances, on the other hand, *do* claim to be the Overarching Truth of Reality, or at least to be part of it.  Yet there's nothing physically going-on *underneath* the abstraction, and the abstraction demands control over your thoughts and your life.

    I'm not sure I agree with the article, but it is interesting.  I think it could be right sometimes and wrong other times.
