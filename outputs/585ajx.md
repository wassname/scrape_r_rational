## The opposite of RatFic - RurFic (Ruritanian SF)

### Post:

Just came across [this brief article](https://iansales.com/2016/10/17/when-i-read-a-story-i-skip-the-explanations/) that explains one of the reasons I enjoy RatFic so much - it is the opposite of what you see in a LOT of middlin' SF, which this article calls "Ruritanian SF"

> Everything is an analogue of something in the real world with which the reader is familiar. There’s no need to explain the workings of the VanGriff Mk 29 Magnum Blaster because it works, in effect, in story terms, just like a Colt .45. There’s no need to describe the layout of a spaceship, because it uses the familiar terminology of ships that sail the oceans – bridge, cabin, engine room… (Of course, it goes without saying that real-world spacecraft are nothing like this.)

>The end result is a setting built up from well-understood and commonly-accepted tropes that need no explanation, or scaffolding, in the text itself. There’s no need to explain how FTL works because it’s so prevalent in sf its effects in story terms are more important than its (invented) workings. It gets characters from A to B, where A and B are interstellar distances apart. Far too many sf tropes have become “black boxes” in this fashion. And a story which uses them uncritically, which simply slots them together like Lego, is Ruritanian sf. It’s telling a present-day story in an invented setting, but a setting that is as familiar as the reader’s world. It’s only science fiction because of the furniture and vocabulary.

  Of course that's one of the big advantages of fanfiction. They can skip a whole lot of world-building and characterization, and focus on just what matter most to their story. Not having to re-invent the wheel, as it were.

  (And for the record, I think the opposite of rational fiction (That's still somewhat enjoyable) is [this](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Wastelands_of_Time))

    I really think the best non-ratfic (irrational fic?) has gotta be [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux).

    It isn't really an irrational world (any more irrational than Potterworld already is), but everybody mostly goes along with Harry's insane logic and incredible fast-talk, mostly because the people he tries to convince are children. He mostly gets through the plot by saying things very confidently and then barging ahead so that everybody has to rush forward to keep up with him. Though, that eventually stops working as well.

      I enjoyed the somewhat subtle joke where characters would sometimes respond to his internal monologue. They slip it in there so you almost don't notice it.

      Seventh Horcrux is *the* irrational fic. It's literally HPMOR, only if everyone was stupid instead of smart.

    What specifically about that fanfiction makes it the opposite of rational fiction?

      Heavily dominated by the rule of cool, an unwritten plan guarantee. The protagonist largely going by gut-instinct and half-remembered plans from previous loops instead of thinking things through. *Constant* deus/diabolus ex machina.

      Rule of cool dominates.

      It's kind of like what I imagine a combination of [captain challenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Challenger) and superman would be like.

      With a heavy-dose of "badass" thrown in.

      In sort, it's a Marty Stu story, the most egregious one I've found that isn't crap and that takes itself seriously.

      I don't think it meets a single one of the sidebar requirements, and often does the exact opposite.

        I’ve previously dropped that at a point where a goddess(?) was introduced to the story to have an inane dialogue with the protagonist. You’ve just killed all of my lingering thoughts of giving it a second try.

          It only becomes less coherent from there.

  I disagree. "Rational fiction" is subjective, but if we use the sidebar definition (characters make thoughtful decisions based on their motivations, the world is sane and consistent), you don't need to explain how the plot-relevant things work to make a good rational fic. You don't even need to describe their precise effects.

  You could make a Stargate fic without explaining how the stun guns (or even the gate) work, and it could still be rational, as long as the characters don't forget about the stun gun when they need to capture someone alive, or even worse, invent a new purpose for the gun just in time to solve their problem of the week (I'm looking at you, Harry "Also I can scare away dementors now!" JPEV).

  Aslo: we really really need a long running Stargate rational fic.

    I would love that. It's really a world ripe for the picking, rather similar to Naruto and Harry Potter. The world-building is awesome and compelling and the characters are at the very least interesting, but it very much lacks internal consistency and thoughtfulness - just like the two fanfiction giants.

    I've been watching Stargate recently (having never watched it properly before), and it's been such a strange experience. On the one hand I really enjoy the characters and the overall plot, on the other hand just about every episode makes me want to bang my head against the wall at the ridiculously obvious solutions that are missed or ignored for the sake of manufactured drama.

    Thor's Hammer in Season 1 was the one I watched the most recently. There was *no reason* to destroy the McGuffin that allowed for the removal of Goa'uld. There was no time constraint - Teal'c could've stayed inside the cave while SG made another way through, by drilling through the damn walls if need be. But no! Drama must be created! Bah humbug.

    [Space Overlord Tactics](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/space-overlord-tactics-stargate-si.433811/) gets an honorable mention here. It's an in-progress Stargate fic that tries to make sense of things a bit. Sadly, it only tangentially touches upon any of the main plot, and is unlikely to change that anytime soon. 

    (I also recommend all the other works of Belial666 - I found them all to be very enjoyable.)

      You might check out [City On The Edge Of Forever](http://archiveofourown.org/works/6338365?view_adult=true). It's a "what should have happened" of Stargate Atlantis. Unfortunately it's only one chapter, but still worth a read.

    That's a little unfair to HPMOR - that ability was foreshadowed, and it is at least a *logical* conclusion to come to. It's like partial transfiguration: it relies on the alternate universe of the story, but it is still *internally* self-consistent.

    I mean, if dementors are "death" and they can be killed by the weird transhumanist patronus thing, then I think it makes sense for them to be scared of it. (especially since HJPEV is currently the only one who can cast it)
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Fair enough. I'd say the problem with MoR is more that you have no way to guess which ability is going to pop up next: Dementors being unable to be afraid would have made sense too, or maybe Harry could have figured out that accepting Death as an obstacle to be dealt with would have made him immune to dementor's effects. But yeah, MoR is far from the worst offender.
      ```
