  Not sure how I got started on Delve but thinking of putting it on hiatus till the chapters build up. Story updates once a week and the pacing is so slow, it is as if the author is racing alongside the Chinese wuxia writers who take chapters to make a point that one could make in a couple of sentences. Less said about the constant Math tutorial the better, though the author seems to have toned it down off late. 

  That said there are occasional flashes of brilliance in the writing, which is the only reason I haven’t dropped the novel as yet.

    Me too. I binged it up until chapter ~105 (which happily coincided with the end of a big arc), and enjoyed the story a lot. The story is just slow-paced, but not necessarily in a bad way, although it makes it a bad thing to read as a webnovel. I'm planning to forget about it for at least a year.

    Same. I unsubbed 2 month ago, so now i am back on normal schedule and let the chapters pile up, gonna start reading again when he starts leveling.
    ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Doesn't sound like he's going to start leveling any time soon. More like collecting accolades.
      ```

      ```
      Same for me too. I think I'll finally get new content in another 3 weeks.
      ```

      - u/_The_Bomb:
        ```
        That was my plan too. Have his patreons indicate that he’s going to start leveling up then?
        ```

        - u/EsquilaxM:
          ```
          We don't reasonably expect him to for half a year as he'll likely need to delve to do so, which he plans to do in the badlands, which he won't reach until at least after vestval, but he also said he might take vestval survivors to the smuggler city first. And he'll need a party capable of taking down a 25 monster, I don't know if ameliah and tallhearts will be sufficient when his other highest companions are lower than him.
          So yeah, that sounds like around 25 chapters, maybe 50 for the actual blue, no?
          ```

          - u/_The_Bomb:
            ```
            Well damn. I guess I’m stuck waiting for a while. Guess he really should have bargained for a high level blue when he gave the city away, no?
            ```

              Lol that’s a great idea. If only ....
              ```

            - u/EsquilaxM:
              ```
              Nah, if he became antagonistic the watch would've been trigger-happy or simply reneged and mind controlled him.
              ```

  Yo I'm gonna be honest this was a horrible let down lmao.

  It's like Rain's from another planet or something. :)

    Handling each others' Accolades is already [past 3rd base](https://xkcd.com/540/) though.

  >Mlem  snorted and shifted his gaze back to Rain. “Here, at least let me help you before you hurt yourself. I understand acting quickly to seize an opportunity, but this is ridiculous. No one is just going to run into it or something.”  
  >  
  >“Oi! Dibs!” Kettel’s voice came from over Rain’s shoulder. He turned to see the teenage idiot sprinting toward the barrier at full speed.  
  >  
  >Rain glanced at Mlem. “You were saying?”

  This is the best bit in the chapter, and no one can convince me otherwise.
  ```

    ```
    > As they neared the camp, Carten’s voice boomed through the twilight. “Oi! There’s somethin’—oh.”

    > Rain stumbled out of the trees a moment after Ameliah, spotting Carten waiting for them.

    > The bearded man relaxed as he recognized them. “It’s jus’ you two,” he said, lowering his shields, his face splitting into a grin. “Done kissin’?”

    >Ameliah sighed and glanced at Rain. “Do you want to hit him, or should I?”

    I enjoyed that more.

    Damn it Kettel!
