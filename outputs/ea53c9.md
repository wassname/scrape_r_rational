## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  A couple people mentioned reading the canon Animorphs books in the most recent Reckoning thread, so I figured I'd share this again here:

  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-MrWavvGxyyHQaX1slnuuUfHBnW2bE08MYPXOGN0wlU/edit?usp=drivesdk

  This is a chronological reading order and a recommendation list for what is worth the re-read, as someone who's gone through the series a number of times. The only thing I might change about this order for a brand new experience would be to skip the first entry The Andalite Chronicles and read that in published order after #13, which is noted in the notes column for those two books.

  I've been wondering what the demographic split is like within this subreddit in regards to omivorism/vegetarianism/veganism.

  It's a population that is significantly more likely than the average to believe that humans lack anything analogous to a soul, and that our conscious minds are the result of chemical and electrical events within our nervous and endocrine systems, which animals (notably animals such as cattle or pigs) also experience.

   Thoughts? Personal stories?

    ```

  - u/alphanumericsprawl:
    ```
    I don't think there's a way to grapple with these kinds of ethics consistently without going full-Singer. Obviously I choose to buy stupid, pointless wasteful things instead of giving to charity, animal or otherwise. I recognise that animals feel pain and that many are fairly intelligent/emotional. It's not impossible that their experience of life has qualia 'just like us' but trapped in a body that prevents tool use and language. Yet I'm still happy to eat them.

    I think most people, myself included, work off what's popular and acceptable in society. Meat is common and the centrepiece of dinner. It's difficult to replace and tastes good. Why let the suffering of non-humans get in our way?
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      I don't know how to phrase this in a less aggressive sounding way, I don't mean to be rude or offensive I'm just genuinely interested about your thinking.

      "It's not impossible that their experience of life has qualia 'just like us' but trapped in a body that prevents tool use and language."

      If you believe that livestock could be essentially a human mind trapped in a animal body how do you justify eating them?
      ```

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        >If you believe that livestock could be essentially a human mind trapped in a animal body how do you justify eating them?

        Unless you believe in objective morality, then the act of assigning moral value to something you're not inherently wired to care about is special. That is, there's nothing inherently wrong with the suffering of others, but you can choose specific types of life (most commonly, ingroup humans, pets) to reduce suffering for.

        Incidentally, any argument for veganism based on ethical self-consistency is essentially also an argument for cannibalism, as you're weighing "the suffering of the life you're consuming" versus "the tastiness of the life you're consuming," so it would be perfectly self consistent to decide that if cows are tasty enough to eat no matter how much they suffer in a human-like fashion, non-ingroup-humans could potentially also be justifiably eaten if their flavor outweighs their suffering.
        ```

      - u/alphanumericsprawl:
        ```
        I think our sense of morality is ultimately based on pragmatics. Don't hurt or steal from other people because they'll hurt and steal from you. The same doesn't go for animals because they can't fight back. 

        Vegetarianism is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to minimizing animal harm. Do we have to stop land clearance and slash-and-burn since it kills animals? Do we have to account for the suffering of birds when we build wind turbines? Modern civilization is mutually exclusive with large mammals in the wild. Ultimately, we have to choose between their utility and ours. Pure game theory dictates that we take 100% for ourselves.

        I admit this system doesn't work quite so well if Hypothetical All-Powerful Aliens have an insatiable desire for human flesh and/or suffering.

      >Well meat is rather unsustainable, it takes like 20 pounds of feed to make one pound of beef, and we're already straining the environment.

      Not only does meat production consume more resources (land, energy, water, etc.) per calorie, it also generates more pollution per calorie (greenhouse gasses, nitrate runoff, etc.). Beef production is the worst offender in every metric, so the people who don't want to go vegetarian but still want to make a utilitarian choice could stop eating beef.

      A research article on the topic for those who want to learn more:

  I've been idly toying around with the idea of someone who is ridiculously good at something, better than a person could realistically be IRL. Say that the thing they're good at is swordfighting, and they aren't just the foremost expert on the subject anywhere, they haven't just spent decades of study on the subject, but they've spent a significant amount of time on incredibly niche things simply because at their level it's the only avenue to improve. They've spent at least a year on learning how to fight after their sword has been broken, how to fight when low on blood, their workout routine is calculated down to the second in order to maximize effectiveness, etc.

  I think this was inspired by some stories that include people who are just ludicrously old, far past what is possible for humans, and thinking of what they would do with their time if they were trying to advance their skills. They aren't practicing the basics anymore, because they haven't just hit steep diminishing returns, but they ran out of returns on the basics millennia ago. So at this point, they're spending significant time on super minor things, tiny improvements that anyone starting out wouldn't even consider something worth studying.

  Another source is the Factorio development logs, and how much work they spend on optimizing things. Even really minor things have had significant thought put to them in terms of optimizing their memory layout, improving the performance of edge cases, parallelizing aspects of the game that don't interact too heavily with other parts, stuff like that. Applying lots of hours of time from people who are really good at what they do in order to improve something in a way that most people won't even notice. From that thought, applying it to a person improving their own abilities far past what anyone else would consider reasonable is a natural leap, even if IRL people are constrained by things like resources, return on investment, how much they can actually remember about a subject, and all those pesky real life things.
  ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    Wouldn't it be more rational for them to practice a different skill? You don't have to be the best ever, just better than everyone else around you. Besides higher skill doesn't guarantee victory, it increases the chances of winning. You could never be an invincible swordsman unless you have super powers and nobody else does, you just win in fair fights more than you would if your skills were lower. 

    &#x200B;

    Skill at higher levels tends to turn into decision making. 

    * Risk analysis: How many opponents there are? Should you use high risk moves to remove some opponents faster so you don't get overwhelmed? Or just go low risk stay defensive and hope nothing gets through?
    * Cost analysis. Is this move that tires me more than others but has a higher chance to hit worth using in this circumstance? How long can I afford to spend on each opponent individually?
    * Yomi. What's my opponent going to to? How is he likely to respond to X move? How to I counter that?

    Skill is the base, at higher levels it's just a minimum requirement, the entry fee , other things are more important..
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      Swordfighting wasn't necessarily the best example, because I wasn't thinking of skills that are necessarily adversarial. Another example I was thinking of was woodworking, but I don't actually know much about it. The goal wouldn't be maximizing outcome, because then the correct action would be using the skill for something practical rather than chasing the absurdly minor marginal returns on investment for getting better. The goal would be getting better at something for its own sake, a way of spending large spans of time improving on this one specific thing.

      And even if you're the best around, if the fighting isn't restricted to 1v1 fighting then it could be worth pursuing increased skill. Even if it is, you could minimize your chance of injury by becoming more skilled.

      In regards to your other points, I would consider them a part of becoming a better swordsman, in the same way that improving your exercise improves your ability as a swordsman. It isn't part of the mechanical skill of wielding a blade, but it is part of the skill of winning a swordfight. And naturally, those things would be something that this hypothetical swordsman has mastered to as great an extent as possible long ago, at least so far as those abilities relate to swordfighting.
      ```

      - u/CreationBlues:
        ```
        I think that the idea you're trying to grasp is that they're essentially pursuing a dao. One example of the kind of dedication you're thinking about is demonstrated by Metti in Kill Six Billion Demons. [Here](https://killsixbilliondemons.fandom.com/wiki/Meti%27s_Sword_Manual) is the exploration of someone that is exactly what you're talking about, plus some metaphysical  mechanics and minus the more ancillary skills your swordsman would have. However, the core of their philosophy would, I think, be nearly identical.

        For an illustrative example of how Meti's philosophy plays out, look [here.](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/king-of-swords-6-58/) The lesson Maya should have learned is that it is not sufficient to merely understand swordsmanship on a technical level, but that she must also possess the judgement and will to use it. 

        Your character is, essentially, practicing the use of the sword at all times. When looked at like this, any skill, from social to political to physical to artistic, plays into his skill with the sword.
        ```

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          Thank you, this is what I'm thinking of. I wasn't thinking of any particular philosophy behind someone pursuing a skill for decades or centuries, but now that you mention it, it would be downright weird to have a character who "casually" becomes the best at whatever skill they happened to choose and without any real philosophical investment.

        A lot of the masters or grandmasters I've seen or heard of in real life do it for pure love of the craft, more than any real utility (or rather, the learning and being good is part of the utility that they get).
        ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Sounds interesting, I think your example of swordfighting brings up some of the crazy things you would end up doing after you've mastered technical skills and physical ability in normal circumstances. Once the diminishing returns of normal practice are so bad there's more utility in practicing the edge cases even with the low chance they occur.

    The only good in story explanation I can see though is an immortal that has utterly lost their mind obsessing over a topic, or a AI with a utility function of skill in that topic. Maybe a society of immortal hobby groups would progress this far, "The Player of Games" by Iain Banks comes to mind. Otherwise people are going to branch out once they get to a point, even if they love their skill they will get bored by diminishing returns eventually.

    As far as I know, neither author has plans to published a book of their story. I'm not sure how you printing a copy results in the author getting money. If you want to support them, I know MoL has a patreon or PayPal you can send money to.

    You can check out grad thesis printing/binding services. If there's a university around where you live there's bound to be one. Or you can order it online. You might want to check with the author if this is okay. I know some have plans to publish their own work.

  I'm attempting to write a rational superpower-academy setting - essentially, a school that takes in certain individuals with a set of powers and attempts to train them to use those powers effectively. I want to make this setting as rational as possible, and I think I've done so in terms of the potential 'powersets' so to speak - there is a system of analysing people's powers, and this broadly fits into the academic timetable. What I'm struggling with is a specific reason for those individuals to go to this academy.

  Currently I have two ideas: 

  * The individuals trained can become part of some additional military system/covert operational institution that allows/requires them to make use of their abilities in order to succeed
  * There is some greater external threat to society in general that necessitates the use of their abilities, and becoming a part of the defense against this external threat requires significant training in their abilities.

  These two potential reasons seem like they each require very specific systems of education - in the prior, they are trained for precision usage of their abilities, in the latter they are trained to use their abilities in a more destructive capacity, in order to combat this external threat as much as possible.

  I'm wondering if there is a middle ground/other potential reason for them to be trained within the framework of their abilities?

  Apologies if this should go in the worldbuilding thread - I will happily cut and paste it into there when it is posted.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    It really depends on what the powersets are like, how much they overlap with each other, and how much they benefit from training. Absent other factors, superhero academy might exist for much the same reasons that normal academies are supposed to exist: the government or the supers themselves are paying in time and money for facilities and instructors in order to get a return on investment. In the case of supers paying their own way, it might be because the cost of education, paid via loans, is expected to be paid off in ten years time with increased earnings, and you can do some numbers there to see what would make it essentially a no-brainer for the supers, and for the banks that are giving them loans. In the case of the government paying for the supers to attend the academy, it's a similar calculation, but it can be a bit more nebulous depending on how the government is determining what pricing is worth, whether that's military value, economic value, or sociocultural stuff (e.g. propoganda, the arts, etc.).

    Generally speaking, I'd think that if there were supers of a certain power level and rarity, then any sane government would be running the numbers and then doing their best to make sure that the supers were happy and well-fed, in the same way that governments often do with their militaries. The cost of a rogue super might be pretty high, so it's just plucking the low-hanging fruit to make sure that the supers learn some basic life skills that they might not otherwise get in their normal lives. In that way, super academy might serve as a way of taking people out of bad home environments, away from corrupting influences, and in a place where they can learn skills necessary to live a comfortable life. There's a commonly cited study that happiness increases with income up to $60,000 a year, at which point it plateaus, and part of what super academy should be doing is to give supers a $60,000-a-year lifestyle for 3-5 years, and ensure that they're capable of supporting themselves at that level when they "graduate", all as a method of ensuring that there are virtually no criminal supers, at least on the scale that would be a major problem for civilization. So a fair bit of the coursework, in this scenario, would be in terms of "general studies" where the supers are properly socialized and every effort is spent making sure that they won't slip through the cracks. This almost certainly provides dividends to the government (again, depending on the parameters).

    Of course, such a scheme would also mean that you're putting every super from all walks of life into the academy, and assuming that powers don't care about who you are or where you come from, you're going to get people are both ends of the bell curve (as well as in the middle), which means that your super academy would probably benefit from stratification, if not having multiple tiers of super academies. Maybe there's a scheme to test out of the life skills classes, or maybe there are tests prior to entrance into the academy, but if you have the top 25% and the bottom 25% in the same class, you're either wasting time and resources being redundant for the top of the class, or flunking out the bottom of the class.

    I guess the thing I would want to stress is how much effort I would put into things that aren't strictly related to powers at all, the sorts of classes that would essentially just get transplanted into the academy from more mundane places of learning because they would be very helpful for the supers to know, even if they didn't have as much direct utility for whatever the supers are expected to do as their future line of work.

    It could be the same reason why people go to university in real life - refining their skills so that they can get jobs and contribute to the country's economy in adult life.

    Or, it could be a system to instill values and code of conduct into superpowered individuals, PGtE style. Basically teaching them how to properly use their powers in society so that they won't try to disrupt the order.

    Or, if it's combat-focused, then it could be the training ground for some conventional fighting-oriented jobs, such as the military (as you've said), the police, bodyguards, or the like. 

    Or, it could be for something specific like there being an international fighting tournament held every however many years where the countries who place highly will gain a great amount of prestige and/or other rewards. 

    Or, there could be something that increases demand for combat skills. Not an external threat, per se, but maybe something like the existence of combat-oriented dungeons where great amounts of resources can be obtained, or valuable monsters that can be hunted. 

    Or, there could be some fundamental aspect of society that demands it. An idea brought up in the Rationally Writing podcast is if the justice system were to be based on trial by combat or duels. Then, instead of lawyers, people would be hiring these super-people to fight their cases for them.

    Or, you could cheat a little and have it be an ingrained tradition, or the will of some billionaire, or the order of the alien overlords, where the base intent is unknown.

    Maybe employers won't hire them until they have some proof that these people's power are either safe, or that the people controlling the powers can be trusted to use their powers safely? For some powers, you'd want some sort of guarantee that the person won't, A, accidentally hurt someone, or B, intentionally hurt someone, because some powers are like having a loaded grenade launcher that is unable to be separated from the person wielding it.  For more mundane powers, say biomanipulation, a hospital is going to want their employee to understand their power and anatomy well enough that they can be trusted to fix issues without generating significant side effects like cancer or medical malpractice suits.

    Maybe mention a few spectacular failures that cause insurance companies to all but demand that the super powered people have some form of training.

    Alternatively, if the powers fall into narrow enough categories that you can find two people with nearly identical powers, you could have academies that train people well enough to make hiring non-graduates impractical. Say a category of power can generate metal ex nihilo. A non-trained person can make kind of crude shapes out of iron that varies between wrought iron and cast iron. Neat, but not too useful. A graduate can make decently complex shapes out of any steel you could pick out of a catalogue, precise enough to not need a CNC machine most of the time, and with a few more years of training they can start making the same shapes out of metals like titanium or tungsten. All kinds of uses, and the difference is large enough that hiring the first guy isn't even a consideration.

    Simplest: people who dont train have a terrifyingly high rate of accidential death or manslaughter by power mishap. Therefore, training is damn well mandatory. You can fly?
