## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  How about we switch this around. You are a god and you are designing a new world with a magic system. You have been warned of heroes being called into worlds and advancing the world technology level through the scientific method and you will not have it. Your challenge is to design way to make a magic system incompatible with not our version of technology or our laws of physics but to oppose the scientific method itself. Its inner workings are to be rendered inscrutable. If it would merely be inordinately difficult it counts. One example I came up with was for a veil of secretary surrounding magic with the guardians of Lethe enforcing it. They would come to attempts to breach the veil in a unpredictable manner and eat the information associated with it. It was unknown what exactly called them and data couldn't be shared between attempts as they would eat any data on the veil and their weaknesses as well as eat some people's memories entirely to deter further attempts and replenish their numbers.  So, any ideas

    I think that's pretty much the limit of it. It'd have to be something where the cornerstone of the world would run on amnesia, randomness or a mix thereof. I think any consistent system where data is allowed to accumulate would be figured out so it either needs to be inconsistent or data needs to not be allowed to accumulate. 

    The former can be accomplished through randomness, the latter through either memory wipes or memory limits (e.g restrictions on book permanency).

    Or you can just brute force it by giving the bad guys superpowers--make an anti scientific method sect and give them superpowers and favors based on how much global scientific literacy there is. Then give anyone who uses the scientific method leprosy, with burning letters in the sky that point to them and say "I'm a terrible god who forbids doing things like this, so don't".

    I'd remove the ability to share experiences between people.  

    Most people would agree that a rose and a stop sign are similar colors, and that grass is different.  A red-green colorblind person wouldn't, though.  My idea is to give each person a *unique* form of magical-color-blindness across all axes of analysis so that communicating the properties of the phenomena becomes impossible beyond "the beam that Bob creates".

    Your standard "divine magic" setup works. Agents are imbued with certain supernatural powers, and will perform miracles when doing so aligns with their values (i.e., an adherent prays to them), but they don't have any requirement to fulfil any specific request beyond their own word.
    ```

  - u/pldl:
    ```
    As in Worth the Candle's Druidic magic, the more you understand the magic the less effective it becomes. 

    If the magic's source of power is in its uncertainty and mystery, then you can scientific method all you want, but the only result is that your ability to cast the magic worsens.

  **Edit:** I've declared winners in [another top-level comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7rqv2m/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/dt0u80c/?st=jcp714il&sh=fba47f48).

  Alright, let's have some fun! You have 10 characters in which to express the largest finite number you can think of, and 100 characters to explain your notation. The winner is the person who writes the largest number. [Here is a website](https://www.lettercount.com/) that counts characters, for your convenience.

  Rules:

  * Put your number and explanation in spoiler tags.

  * Do not read other peoples' answers until you have answered, unless you are not participating. No retroactively changing your answers. Do not discuss people's answers unless you enclose the discussion in spoiler tags.

  * Your number must be expressed via a computable function (or a composition of computable functions, which is a computable function). So Busy Beaver function is cheating. For non-mathematicians, if you're scared by "computable function," note that almost any well-defined function you are likely to think of will be a computable function. This includes the standard multiplication operator, exponentiation operator, etc. The wikipedia page will probably tell you if something is not computable.

  * **Edit:** ASCII character strings only

  * You may use any pre-existing notation, constant, operator, or computable function, as long as it has a wikipedia page. In your 100-character explanation, link to the wikipedia pages of all pre-existing functions/notations/constants used. Links do not count towards character count. If you devise your own notation/function/whatever, it must be fully explained in your 100-character explanation.

  * No max/min/inf/sup or other optimization operators, unless these things are embedded in a known computable function with a wikipedia page. No self-reference or meta-level tomfoolery; e.g., no saying things like "Consider the set of all 10-character ASCII strings which express computable functions..." No referencing other people's numbers and saying "That person's number plus 1."

  * There is no explicit constraint on the format of your 10-character string or your explanation. You can write something like "F(G(4))" in your string, and in your explanation, write, "F is the sine function, G is the cosine function." The implicit constraint is that your function/number must be well-defined, and a reasonably competent English-speaking mathematician who is already familiar with the concepts you are referencing should be able to figure out precisely what you mean from your string and your explanation, *without* having to follow the wikipedia links (to rule out explanations made out of single-character links that only make sense after looking at the link). You can save characters by removing parentheses and spaces, for example. 

  * Full example: [Number](#s "gf4"), Character count: 3, [Explanation](#s "g=[sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine),f=[cosin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions#cosine),[prefixnotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation)"), character count: 29. Since I have no idea how to put working links in spoiler tags, I guess just make links as you would normally, but the '[](...)' part doesn't count toward character count? Also, if the functions are obvious like sin/cosin, I guess it is okay to omit the link. Please list your character count separately somewhere, for convenience.

  * Since there may be specific cases I missed, I will judge by the spirit, not the letter, of the law. If you have found an extremely clever way to munchkin these rules, I may let it pass, but do this at your own risk.

  * [Optional but strongly encouraged]: Please record your level of mathematical education, so that it is possible later to give separate accolades to the mathematicians vs. non-mathematicians, if this seems necessary. Mathematicians will have a significant advantage.

  The window to respond closes within 24 hours of when this comment was posted. I will edit this comment with the winner(s). This post is kind of an experiment to see if this works. It could just turn out that whoever has the most obscure knowledge of mathematical operators will win. To be honest, for some of the larger numbers I have no idea whether judging which one is larger will even be possible.  I will probably need assistance (feel free to post comments with spoiler-tagged commentary; just mark the commentary clearly as such).

  If this is popular, we can do it again in the future (presumably after ironing out the bugs discovered in this run).

  ((I would post this as its own discussion thread, but I am not sure if the moderators would consider it topical enough to rational fiction.))

    [number](#s " ttttttttt9")

    [explanation](#s " 
    t(0) = 9
    t(x) is TREE(t(x-1)) repetitions of the TREE function on t(x-1) 
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem")

    [some notes](#s " - FYI: TREE(3) is already larger than Graham's number. If people actually start using these large numbers, it wiill be nearly impossible to figure out which numbers are bigger.
    - I also have plenty of characters left to describe even more recursion, e.g. 'x = t9 repetitions of TREE on t9' but this was complicated enough.
    - Also, words which are used multiple times could be coded. e.g. T=TREE, which would save characters in the explanation.")

      10 is the correct character count for your explanation, yes.

      Also, being an American, I have no idea what those educational qualifications mean. Could you explain them further?

        GCSEs are prepared for from the ages of 14-16, done at the end of the summer of the last of the two years. AS level is in the 16-17 school year, the exam done in the summer. There is one more year of school in which you do A-levels, which are just an extension of AS-levels.

        This system is used in the UK, although I think that AS-levels are being phased out everywhere except Northern Ireland.

          I don't even particularly care for Harry Potter but I believe a Harry Potter analogy might be the most helpful to people reading this. 

          I believe - not being English or a Harry Potter person - that GCSEs are equivalent to the OWLs and A-levels are equivalent to the NEWTs?

    I suggest adding a restriction on the characters you can use.

    Otherwise I could write an x with arbitrarily many bar accents above it, which is one character, and has value equal to the number of bar accents.
    ```

    - u/LieGroupE8:
      ```
      In an earlier edit I specified ASCII characters only, which rules out arbitrary bar modifications. Maybe I should bold that edit.

    Without reading any of the answers, [this](#s "A(G,G)") will probably show up, so I'm tempted to say  [this](#s "A(G,A(G,G)"). All using standard mathematical notation i.e.  [](#s "http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AckermannFunction.html and http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GrahamsNumber.html")

    For overkill's sake, I think my actual answer and explanation will be as below:

    [Answer](#s "A.(G^^^G!)")

    [Explanation](#s "f.(x):binary tree, x layers, with x at each leaf,inner nodes eval f(a,b) at children.

")

    Explanation w/o links for character number checking:

    So I'm actually ineligible for this because I glanced through a few of the spoiler tags, but I think I've figured out the way to win. [spoilers](#s "Namely, to make all of your characters the same character (but one, if necessary) (e.g., xxxxxxxxx9), then using your 100 characters, and exploiting the fact that (as far as I understand) unicode is only barred in the actual character string and not the explanation to as succinctly as possible define the most broken possible operation. (e.g. xa=x[→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a→a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_chained_arrow_notation))")

    [spoilers](#s "And this is just a preliminary representation. You could add a➡=a→a, which at the cost of 6 characters lets you almost double the amount of chained arrows. Though there's probably some point such that you can't just keep replicating that, but you can still get to inane amounts of operands. And if someone can figure out a quick way to turn that last number in the character string into another version of the operand, then you can multiply the final number by an incredible factor.")

    [spoilers](#s "(technically this doesn't even require unicode, but it saves some explanation characters and makes the explanation way neater.)")

    My own odd little approach, which produces values higher than anything else here. It seemed like a cool idea, although it's an odd approach.

    [Number](#s "f(1)") 4 characters

    [Explanation](#s "f(n)=f(n+1) or n with 50% chance on a [turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_Turing_machine) that runs all paths eventually.")

    [Extra notes](#s "So, technically what I've defined there is a probabilistic turing machine that must encounter all instructions via the 'runs all paths eventually bit' as opposed to a normal one which can technically never halt. However all that does is prevent the infinitely unlikely never halting thing, which might not be a problem anyway? Whatever. The key here is in the probabilistic nature, so the output of the function cannot be known until the turing machine to run it on is created and it's computed, and it can produce any non negative integer as output. So in theory once you run it you'll know, but it is a computable procedure that gives you numbers in excess of any other answer here?")

    [More notes](#s "So that 'well-defined' thing, technically this sort of counts? It's tricky, it is well defined for any given deterministic turing machine running it, but it doesn't define what turing machine is running it so technically it's got the whole multiple possible outputs thing. So I think technically it might be a well defined function without a well defined output? I dunno, this was created because it sounded interesting and produces high values.")

    And the one reference I used, clickable [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_Turing_machine). So yes, my odd approach, which does technically produce higher values than any other answer here.

    Education is in IT.
    ```

    - u/LieGroupE8:
      ```
      [Commentary](#s "So this isn't well-defined. You have not specified a single function, but rather a class of functions. The actual function depends on the specific run of the probabilistic Turing machine. There are functions in this class where f(1) indeed exceeds any other answer, but you have not given enough information to pick out a specific number.")
