  "Harm" is ill-defined, and something which causes an equal amount of improvement and harm by one person's standard may not by another's.

  An interesting thought I had. Assuming 'harm' and 'help' are arbitrarily predefined at some point in time before this world develops instead of changing over time to match society's definitions of these two terms, then wouldn't society eventually adjust to see 'harm' as not really being harmful?

  Or in simpler words, if an early society sets 'harm' to mean death, unnecessary suffering, and hunting animals, would a later society come to believe that death is good, enduring pain for no good reason is linked to beauty, intelligence, and kindness, and animals need to be eaten alive? Would societies adapt to constant pain by twisting their morals to perceive the 'harm' as a good thing?

    My thought exactly. The interesting question is what would determine which of karma's "harms" people come to accept as good and which "helps" they would accept as bad?

    Part of it is that ideas which are good at spreading themselves would take over - memetic evolution, you know the drill. But the incentives are different in this setting than in reality, because helping other people would cause an equal and opposite amount of harm somewhere else - most likely, on a different continent or a different planet or something. You might not even notice the karmic balance phenomenon until nearly the entire world was colonised.

      Yeah, unless the supernatural karmic effect directly impacts the 'helper', then I expect society to be very similar to our own. The closer the effect is to you and more immediate the consequences, the more strongly affected society will be.

  As you've commented elsewhere, it's not remotely possible to balance good and evil for all of seven billion humans' divergent notions of good and evil. The least exploitable solution is that there is an objective notion of good - in the story, not in reality - and that is what is being kept in balance. A Black And White morality, like next week's story prompt.

  I suppose the way forward would be to find places where society's judgement of good and evil differs from the universe's / the author's. For example, in *A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero*, lust is a deadly sin and the protagonist is considered evil verging on demonic from the amount of porn she's watched. Perhaps there is some similar "evil" that society would consider an acceptable cost.
