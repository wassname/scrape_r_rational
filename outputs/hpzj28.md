Yes, you do have to suffer my Greek god fixation for most of a chapter. Also: party! party!  


Next update, *The New Humans proper* resumes with our fourth and final volume: *The Utopians*. 

So, me and William will be relaunching our patreon once the fourth volume is complete. It was initially focused more on the comedy reviews I did on Spacebattles, but I've drifted away from that path as of late, and I want to offer more rewards and content relating to *The New Humans*, and its planned sequels. Weâ€™d very much like to hear what you might like to see as backer rewards or stretch goals. I personally would like to be able to get to a point where we could afford to comission chapter illustrations, or maybe release a big old guide to the world of the story with extra details. 

Also, please wish William a very happy birthday.
