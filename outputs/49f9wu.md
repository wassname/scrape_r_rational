  The game does not reward changing your mind based on new evidence. If you suddenly learn that you have an immortal soul, isn't it expected that you make different decisions than before, when you assumed that you did not?

  (Incidentally, I still *prefer* the Freezing outcome to the Reincarnation outcome. But I think my reasoning is less "my memories are the thing that's really me" and more "I care more about keeping my memories and personality alive than about keeping me alive", suggesting that by the rules of the game, I should ignore that reasoning and go with reincarnation.)

  Also, obviously my soul survived teleportation in question 1, if it's still around to get reincarnated in question 3. But maybe, if we allow that reasoning, we also have to allow "I take the spaceship, because the game has three parts, so I know I'm not going to die in part 1."
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    That's fair, but it's an immortal soul that has no impact on your personality, can't form memories, hold emotions, have skills, or make decisions, but exists. Question 3 is mostly there for people who already think an immortal soul exists. I'm not a soul, though-- I'm a pattern of memories, thoughts, and actions. If a soul has no impact on that, it's not important to who I am.  I suspect the question is in part there to make me admit that.

            It was a thing to suspect off of the bat. Tophet was a temple where children were sacrificed to the gods Moloch and Baal by burning them alive. It became synonymous with devil or demon worship.

            I only know it because of the Kipling poem "[Buddha at Kamakura](http://themargins.net/anth/19thc/kipling.html)", one of his lesser known works but one whose rhythm I find very beautiful.

        To me the idea of a soul sounds more like a horror movie monster than a necessary element for identity. Like a more subtle version of pod people, somehow meant to be comforting because the soul supposedly contorts your thoughts from birth.

    - u/SpeakKindly:

      I mostly agree with that, but the answer that would make me pause is "your soul is what makes you experience what's going on with you and not what's going on with anyone else". If that were really the case, I'd find it hard to argue with the claim that my soul is me.

      I don't *think* that's how it can work; I'm not even sure that this is a coherent claim about souls. But I'm not 100% sure how personal identity works, so I should be willing to assume this kind of soul for the sake of the thought experiment. 

      Then again, I also can't imagine how we'd establish that that's how the soul works. So even if that's what a soul is, hypothetical me wouldn't be convinced of it.

        Answer? Was that in the game for you? I wasn't shown that.

        If not, I'm confused. There was *no* evidence to suggest this in the scenario. For all we knew these soul things could have been some kind of extra-dimensional parasite that goes from brain to brain, feeding on excess voltage.

        It's actually kind of amazing that anyone would assume that the strange ghosty thing that was described here was The Real You, with so little to go on.
        ```

        - u/SpeakKindly:
          ```
          I guess I wanted to make something reasonable of the scenario. If what we get is all there is, then of course trying to protect the soul is unjustified. But if what we get is all there is, then there is no reason for the question to have come up in the first place.
          ```

    - u/Ozimandius:
      ```
      Well, we don't have a lot of information about this supposed soul.  Knowing it has just been discovered and we can be almost sure there is still a lot unknown about it (considering it must be very difficult to study) and we would be silly to assume something which such a strange mechanism of action definitely has so little use/meaning.  It could well be that whatever they have managed to study is just one piece of the puzzle and the soul actually does retain memory somehow, just not in a way that can be expressed in the body it is reborn into.  

      It may, then, be possible in the future a soul that survives its many reincarnations could be somehow freed from the restrictions of body and remember all of its instances.  In that case avoiding freezing is not just about saving myself it is about saving a near infinite multitude (all of which could be considered myself and are linked inextricably to it in some way).

      - u/IWantUsToMerge:
        ```
        Say I told you there was a being in a higher plane, reading your memories, and that you couldn't stop it from doing so even if you wanted to. When your heart gives out, it moves onto another human and starts copying their memories as well. Eventually, it will take all of those memories and do something with them. Let's say it decides what the truth of the world is, and generates some kind of goal function by combining approximations of all of the goal functions of the humans it has known, and it lives according to the result.

        This is equivalent to the ghosty thing you've just described. Or, even closer to being an immortal soul than the ghostly thing you've described.

        It is almost certain that the goal function it compiles is going to end up to some extent in conflict with the goal function you currently operate under, it is not going to be exactly the same, it will want different things, however subtle, it will disagree with you. You do not know what that being is going to be like, or how it's going to desire to live.

        You say.

        >all of which could be considered myself

        I suppose they could be. But do you really have much of a reason to consider that being to be you?

          This objection already applies to future versions of yourself not being "you" if they change their mind about anything. Unless I'm a sociopath, presumably that's a result of my soul-self having more information.

  - u/ishaan123:
    ```
    Yup...a proof that the universe has souls *should* cause massive re-evaluations. The psychological-reductionist view is *premised* on no souls. What if the soul has some unknown purpose? Which traits, exactly, are soul related? Am i messing up a delicate balance involving a finite number of souls by taking mine out of the cycle? What happens to the person who would otherwise get my soul? You can't just drop the "there are magical souls" bomb on me so casually!

     Also, even though I did choose the same one we probably all chose for conceit of the philosophy game, it occurs to me that when  probabilities are not held constant between options it *should* distort consistency. If i value the soul component at n = (n-1)*chance_of_cryo_revival_success it becomes even.

    Also come to think of it the game is kind of inconsistent - if souls existed wouldnt we have noticed amid all that teleporting and silicon-ing? They already said the teleported version was identical, which given their claims that souls have real effects and apparently arent teleprted is false.

    Well, the question is what COUNTS as 'staying alive'. If the last bit was they discovered your liver had an odd mutation and if they fatally extracted it they could keep it biologically alive for millions of years, then I don't think the rule 'try to stay alive' says I need to choose liver extraction.

  - u/WizardsOfZenith:

    I'm not convinced that you suddenly learn you have an immortal soul in any meaningful sense. The "soul" as described in the example seems to be devoid of ontological content. The "soul" they talk about, which might slightly influence personality but basically does nothing, sounds essentially like persistent qualia, a metaphysical epiphenomenal dead-end.

    Once you come back from being frozen, you're literally soulless, but as far as we can tell this has no actual consequences. You yourself are unable to determine that you are now a p-zombie. Based on the information given, there's seems to be no justification for labeling whatever psychic effluvia flows from dying people(?) to embryos "the soul".
    ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      What justification for labeling it the soul *would* be acceptable?

      I can't actually think of scientific experiments that could have been listed on that page that would convince me of souls. If angels trumpeted from the heavens "souls exist and here is how they work", then that would be moderately convincing, but less in an "oh, now I understand" way and more in a "well, all these theologians have a philosophy that explains what just happened way better than I can, so maybe they're onto something" way.

      - u/GaBeRockKing:
        ```
        What if your mind was exactly mirrored somewhere else, but if your mind would be destroyed in this world, your soul (that is, the mirror image of your mind) stops being mirrored and is separated. So since your mind and the exact replica are indistinguishable, you retain continuity of consciousness even past death.
        ```

    - u/SoundLogic2236:
      ```
      Exactly. Contrast with the following: We have developed a procedure by which we can extract one of your kidneys and implant it in a womb so that the fetus winds up using it as one of its kidneys (growing only one). The procedure is perfectly safe for the fetus, but carries a 5% chance of death for you. You have cancer and have a 70% chance of dying in the next year (of cancer). The procedure must be done before you learn if the cancer will kill you-do you want the procedure done?

    Yeah the other questions are a bit tricky in light of the last one, after all whether or not a soul transfers with transport isn't established, neither is whether it can survive on silicon.
    ```

- u/blazinghand:
  ```
  I was reminded of this by some recent posts on this sub. This is a classic little web-game that tests your concepts of identity and consciousness. 

  I remember "playing" this game as a kid and making choices similar to what I made this time around. I went for Teletransport, Silicon, and Freezing. It seems I still primarily identify with having a consistent pattern of memories, preferences, and personality that changes in a contiguous way, rather than a particular body, physical brain, or immortal soul.

  Good to share with friends. You may be surprised what choices they make!
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    I did precisely the same choices. I suspect much of the subreddit would.

    I think it's a bit of a cop out though, as at the end it suggests that the vast majority of people had choices that corresponded to one of three thoughts on consciousness survival.
    ```

    - u/blazinghand:
      ```
      Yeah, this subreddit has an unusual number of people who think a certain way. When I was younger, I was somewhat uncertain about the Silicon decision. I thought that even if the output of a pattern was the same, the internals are more important, and felt there was no good answer to "keep the meatbrain and be replaced by someone else" and "cyborgize your brain and potentially be no longer the same". 

      Basically, it's like, imagine if my brain is `f(x) = 2x` , and if I cyborgize my brain it becomes `f(x) = x^2`, and the only test I have to run to see if things are the same is evaluating `f(2)` to check that it is `4`. Sure, the cyborgized brain has a similar output, but who knows if it is actually the same on the inside? Still, better to take a risk there than to 100% die by keeping the meatbrain and becoming not-me. 

      I'm less concerned about that now, since I think a pattern basically IS DEFINED BY the outputs it produces, and I imagine any such technology has a lot of data points, but it was something that made me hesitate.

        Hmm, probably? I assume that there are a lot of people here who are [transhumanists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) and are interested in things like mind uploads. Turning your mind into a computer seems more extreme to using destructive teleportation. Although I am not personally a transhumanist, I assume that those who are would find destructive teleportation much less invasive than uploading themselves into a computer.

                I always find myself torn on that question - I'm pretty sure I would be psychologically comforted by the gradual approach to neuron replacement, especially since it doesn't leave any copies of me (which might be the *actual* me) hanging around dying of natural causes or being blatantly destroyed in the process of uploading, but I'm not convinced it actually changes the truth about what's happened compared to a one-time 100% replacement.

                That feels like treating consciousness as a "magical fluid" that has to be very carefully and slowly poured between vessels, lest it be spilled and not transfer properly. If you ask my intellect I don't believe I'm made of anything other than atoms so a process that arrives at the same arrangement of atoms (just *faster*) should be effectively the same ... but still my gut says there's a difference between the two.

                So then I go back and forth between "There's no difference; clearly if a gradual replacement is fine then so is a one-off", "There's no difference; clearly if a one-off replacement means death then a gradual replacement means a gradual death, it's just that gradual deaths didn't exist before so I don't have good intuitions about where to draw the line" and "Maybe gut is right after all and there's a magical fluid involved".

            Nothing about the timescale of the operation--it could've taken hundreds of years and then a few years after that a way to get you your squishy organic stuff was discovered. Further, there was a piece of your original brain left so assuming stem cell magic to get one one's organic brain back, I think consciousness was preserved through organic matter even if replacing one's brain entirely with silicone would've been death.

            Depends on the odds.

            In almost all cases not involving physical laws, there is going to be at least some uncertainty in the odds of anything. 

            You can't ever really do more than estimating the odds of something, and you can only estimate based on the information you have.

            In my mind, the basic premise of consequentialist utilitarianism is that if your estimate, based on all of your information, leads you to think one thing has better odds multiplied by expected utility than something else, then you should choose the option that maximizes that value.

            This is the lesson behind the phrase 'shut up and multiply'.

  The soul question tripped me up. If we discovered souls, like other have mentioned, I'd be a fool not to take that into consideration. Yes, I want to go into deep freeze and 'continue living', but shit, if my suddenly-important soul dies? I dunno. It's a weird question. It basically says 'hey you have this really important thing that does nothing'.

  I chose tele->silicon->death the first time, then back-tracked to see what tele->silicon->freeze had to say.

    I feel like the choice to call it 'a soul' makes it difficult for people to follow the directive 'Consider the situation at face value' that it gives you before you start, just based on how some people are responding.

    Following it, you should stop considering what-if scenarios, such as positing that 'the soul' is of unstated but great importance.

    I can't really blame anyone for that though, since I know it can be hard to divorce the word 'soul' from familiar concepts and marry it to new ones.

  I don't like the silicon-brain question, honestly. For me, it's not a binary alive/dead choice, but rather a spectrum. Depending on how he brain transfer procedure and the virus work, each one could fall on different places on that spectrum, and my choice would hinge on which one keeps me most-alive.

  The freezing problem would be similar, but it doesn't sound like the "soul" has anything to do with what I define as "me" in this case, so freezing is the clear option regardless of how it's implemented.

  One of the frustrating things about this is that since it establishes the existence of a soul, but you still don't *know* that before the last question so if you did it again you would *maybe* give different answers. 
  For the record I chose spaceship, silicon, death. If I knew about the last question before the fact, I don't actually think I would have answered differently, since I don't think there is actually good reason to think the transporter necessarily means you reincarnate into your new body, as opposed to it creating a clone. The second question is also tricky in light of the last question as well since the silicon might force you to be reincarnated whereas that seems less likely with the virus. I think that because if the soul can't survive a bit of cold I suspect it wouldn't survive me turning to silicon. If I somehow knew the silicon would force reincarnation I would pick the virus since I would retain more identity than if I was wiped and shoved in a new baby body. But as it stands I don't know enough.

  The second question is somewhat problematic because wouldn't actually think *either* result would mean death(assuming I don't know the soul thing before the fact), I generally care more about continuity of experience than about retaining personal identity but since I think neither would result in death I would take the option that keeps me with more of my identity. Of course whether I would pick that option in reality would depend on the details of the silicon replacement tech, also once I was replaced with silicon I probably wouldn't have chose to change back to a biological brain, so that it *assumes* I would that bugs me.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    I picked the same choices for similar reasons, and I was similarly frustrated by getting shoved back into an organic body. 

    The game claimed I was being inconsistent by choosing spaceship, then silicon. But I'm *certain* that teleportation would mean the end of my "experience." With the silicon, I'm not so sure.

    The last choice is broken, once you have already chosen teleportation.

    If your soul follows you via teleportation, then it seems odd that freezing really destroys it. If it doesn't, then you don't need it anyway - you have already reincarnated elsewhere.
    ```

- u/KerbalFactorioLeague:
  ```
  I'm not sure about the first choice, I don't really see that as continuity of your mind. They copy you and transmit that data, then you don't exist for 3 minutes, then they recreate it.
  ```

  - u/bassicallyboss:
    ```
    I also picked the spaceship.  If you are destroyed and perfectly reconstituted on Mars, that is destruction.  Sure, the entity that wakes up on Mars has memories similar to falling asleep for a short time.  However, the entity that enters the transporter on Earth experiences total and permanent cessation of mental activity.*

    If I die to be replaced by a perfect copy, that's only "surviving" from everyone else's point of view.  The me that experiences dying is still dead.

    *Unless it's a perfect quantum teleportation; I'm not sure about all the implications of the No-Cloning theorem, but it suggests the result might be more like relocation, rather than deconstruction and reconstitution.  Knowing what I know, though, I still think I'd pick the spaceship.
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      So here's my question: how do you know you aren't already a clone?

      Imagine that every night an alien force disassembles you in your bed to analyse your brain and body. Then it puts you back with some nebulous memories of dreams.

      For the purposes of the hypothetical, assume that any people who might be able to contradict that version of events are *also* abducted and disassembled.

      How could you possibly know? By definition, it is impossible for you to experience a discontinuity of consciousness.

      If the universe had been created wholesale 5 seconds ago with your exact pattern of thoughts and memories in progress, you would never know. If time was travelling "two seconds forward, one second back" at all times, you would never know.

      Continuity of identity and consciousness is an assumption. A reasonable one, certainly; even if my hypotheticals *were* true, they have no practical consequences, so there is no reason to dispute it.

      The point, however, is that it only makes a difference to your decision-making because you were given the word of god that it's happening. If you were told that it wasn't a "disassemble -> reassemble" teleporter but a genuine "wormholes or whatever" teleporter, you would have absolutely no way of telling the difference from your own experience.

      You would probably assume, in the absence of external evidence, that you *weren't* being disassembled and reassembled when teleporting.

      You cannot experience a discontinuity of consciousness, only be told about it. So if that continuity is what determines your identity, you must be *told* whether you are the original you or not. You would have literally no way of working it out for yourself.

      This isn't an argument to convince you or anything, merely more food for thought.

        >f you were told that it wasn't a "disassemble -> reassemble" teleporter but a genuine "wormholes or whatever" teleporter, you would have absolutely no way of telling the difference from your own experience.

        I respectfully disagree. A traditional zap-zap teleporter specifically destroys you down to the atomic level, and creates a new you at the target point. A wormhole teleporter creates a tear in space-time, and you step through the tear. That's just stepping through a really, really long door.

          For the sake of argument, assume that either the "wormhole or whatever" teleportation method is not innately obvious (e.g. you step into a capsule and then step out at your destination, with no overt sensation of movement) or that the effects are being faked.

          The purpose of the question is to illustrate that you could never, from your own internal experience, conclude that you had experienced a discontinuity of consciousness. You would have to be told or deduce it from other details.

        It's a good question, but from my point of view, it doesn't matter if I'm a clone, or if I were created wholesale five seconds ago.  Given that I exist, and that I experience the world, I would like to continue experiencing the world.

        So I don't have to be told that I'm the original, because if I'm there to be told, I have an identity that merits preserving.  Post-transporter me is just as real and interested in continued existence as pre-transporter me.

        Suppose aliens had a plan to kill you and replace you with a perfect clone.  That clone would have all your mannerisms and memories, up to and including the moment of your death.  The clone, therefore, would not have experienced a discontinuity of consciousness.

        To my mind, the only difference between using the transporter and agreeing to die and be replaced by the clone is that the transporter spawns the clone on Mars instead of in my living room.

        So it's not about "Was I killed as a result of going through the transporter?"  As you say, the person who arrives at the destination will not remember anything amiss.  It's about "Will I be killed as a result of going through the transporter?"  Because persons who have been molecularly deconstructed are not capable of further experience.

        As Arizth says, a wormhole transporter would not pose any difficulties.  The person who departs can expect their own future to contain the experience of arrival.  The person who takes the deconstructing transporter, meanwhile, expects that experience to be in somebody else's future.  Just somebody else with the same memories.

        Incidentally, this is also why I am not bothered by sleep.  I expect that my own future will contain the experience of waking up tomorrow.  From the inside, there is no way I can distinguish this from the alien disassembly.  But the evidence I have from the world suggests that the alien option is unlikely.

      I don't think the time gap is so much the point as the loss of continuity of consciousness. If I step into the transporter and die, that's the end of my life, even if a perfect copy of me still exists. "My" influence on the world isn't lost, but I'm still dead.

          Maybe "continuity" wasn't the right word. I meant it in the sense of "there's no continuity of my consciousness between my original and newly created selves."

          Disintegration by the teleporter is the end of my experience. Subjectively, it's where my life ends. 

          If I'm unconscious for a while, my experience was only interrupted. It continues when I wake up.

              I guess if your top priority is having your mind pattern continue to exist in the world, whether or not you get to experience *being* that mind pattern, then that approach makes sense. Me, I'd like to continue "being."
              ```

              - u/FeepingCreature:
                ```
                No, the premise is you _are_ the mind pattern. By definition, "you" get to experience being that mind pattern, since the thing that is the mind pattern _is_ "you".

                I think people who fail this mostly _fail to visualize_ themselves as still being alive, and the naive view where only one version of you can exist at the same time of course falls down completely once we permit teleporters. The thing that helped me get past this is "locality"; what happens in one part of the cosmos should have no impact on what happens in another part separated by lightspeed, so if I simultaneously transmit myself in two directions, and each direction admits a valid continuation, then this _forces_ me to conclude that "two versions of myself exist at once" _must_ be a coherent perspective. The thing is, any visualization that fails to admit a teleporter ought to also fail to admit sleep or coma as valid continuations.

                  I don't buy this. The teleporter annihilates your brain. Sleep and coma do not.

                  The premise may be that creating a perfectly identical mind pattern will somehow cause my same consciousness/sense of self to survive as the new "me", but I wouldn't stake my life on it. What happens in the teleporter doesn't have to impact what happens at the destination in order to kill me. It just has to impact my body, in the teleporter, being disintegrated.

                    Yeah but I thought this was about _continuity of consciousness_, not _continuity of physical brain_?

                    > my same consciousness

                    No, the premise is that consciousness is _defined_ by "mind pattern". It's necessarily the same, not coincidentally the same.

                    > What happens in the teleporter doesn't have to impact what happens at the destination in order to kill me.

                    Would you die if we destroyed and recreated every single particle in the universe, from one instant to the next?

    Perhaps continuity of mind is rather vague, but it's certainly "continuity of the algorithm by which your decisions are made". 

    If everything is copied exactly (which in practice we might worry about), then what comes out of the teleporter will still remember the same things you remember, value the same things you value, and make the same decisions you would make.

          Well, yeah, because the one seems like a certainty of death (and replacement with something nearly identical to me, but not me) as opposed to a coin flip of actual survival.
