  Good rec. I think I'd tell the mice that I'd trade a dollar for knowledge about whether I could make a pareto efficient trade with them given perfect information and no coercion. If they accepted the trade, I'd immediatelly find out whether it was worth dealing with the. If they didn't, that would be because one dollar is less than the value they'd get from engaging in trade with me given that I'd know the answer to that question, meaning it wouldn't be worth trading with them.

  Assuming it is possible to make trades for mutual net benefit, I'd trade physical objects for utility positive but economic net value negative items or information.

    Of course you can, it's in their best interest to offer you fair trades if you have perfect information. They can just commit to giving good trades under that specific circumstance, presuming their society has sufficient enforcement mechanisms. It's not a particularly hard spell for a bad actor, even one bound to truth (if the mice are), to get around.

      The question I want answered is about the utility function of the mice. If it's opposed to mine, then for them even a properly executed 'fair' trade always results in some net negative for myself. That is to say, they wouldn't trade me a dollar for a dollar, because me having fun in dealing with the occult would be a net negative to them.

  Skipping ahead a little bit in the hope that it can provide a bit more of a hook. That means there are some light spoilers.

    This is good and I am going to add this to my subscriptions and read from the beginning.

    What type of story is this.

      I'm not sure yet, it's still early. I tried to start this in the most interesting/representative place in the 65 pages that exist so far, because frankly I found it started pretty slow. Or course when I first tried to read it there wasn't very much of it, so it finished slow too.

      There are mice that you can make faustian bargains with, but those bargains take the form of economic trades. Trade a lamp for a donut, trade all the silverware in the orphanage for knowledge of life and death, perhaps trade your soul for deeper knowledge...

      The story follows Benny, as he inherits the family ~~curse~~ contract with the mice, allowing him to be a trading partner.

      >We make a trade of equal value. Whatever you want, if the market fetches an adequate price. We can see about it...

      There's not a lot to go over yet, so I'd recommend giving a few pages a try and if you like what you see it will probably keep up with those expectation. It's by a creator known to this community, "dawn somewhere". This looks like it's shaping up to be a lot more relevant to this community than the [last time their works were recommended](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g5rklw/gym_of_the_romantic_journey/).

      I think like 10 pages should let you know if it's worth following.

        Cool will check it out.
