## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Does anyone know any theories of motivation learning in humans that *aren't* just reinforcement learning or some other re-formulation of utility theory?

  What trekkie13 said made me think of some of my own experiences.  Sometimes I've felt like other people are rejecting me because almost none of them will try any of the things I like. I can almost never talk about anything I like or care about with anyone I know, and that makes me isolated and lonely.

  However, I've also noticed an alternative explanation. Thing is, it seems like almost everyone if not just everyone I've ever met seems to either be more intelligent than me or less intelligent than me. I don't recall having ever met anyone who was even approximately my equal, intellectually.

  And to a large extent, people's likes and dislikes are affected by their intelligence. Someone who's really really smart is going to get bored by a subject or activity that's mind-numbingly meaningless, useless or unchallenging, while that same activity might have a lot of shock value and be very engaging to someone who is less intelligent, even if there isn't much informational content or challenge to it. Most movies I've ever been exposed to seem to fall into this category.

  I suspect that there are probably subjects or activities that people even smarter than me enjoy which I would either find boring or find really difficult to understand, but I don't yet know what they are.

  I'm not sure why I've never met anyone who seemed to be as smart as I am. It seems like it should have been very improbable for everyone I meet to either be smarter than me or dumber than me with no one who is approximately just as smart as me.

  I've been to the rationality meetup in my area a few times, and maybe it's possible that I have met people there who were just as smart as me and I overestimated their intelligence due to the fundamental attribution error or something. But even then my priors for that are kinda low, and it still feels like I'm out of place there because I'm just not smart enough to keep up with them, and no one else I meet seems to be smart enough to keep up with me.

  I'm not trying to sound melodramatic here, but it seems like, practically speaking, that I don't really belong anywhere, and am unlikely to belong anywhere anytime soon. It would be nice if I could significantly increase or decrease my intelligence without becoming a totally different person (preferably increase, obviously). But even if I could do that I'm not entirely certain that would solve this problem anyways, since I'm not entirely certain that being stuck with a level of intelligence that very few people in my geographic area have is what's going on here.

  I mean, given just the evidence available to me it seems more likely to be true than not, but it still seems weird and impossible that out of all the people who live in this huge metropolitan city and surrounding suburbs, that there would be no one or almost no one who is just as smart as I am who I could meet or have met within the past five to ten years or so. That probably means that I'm missing something here, but I don't know what, and I've been trying to figure this out since forever and I still haven't been able to figure it out, and it hurts a lot, and I usually don't think about it because if i do it will just make me upset and i never manage to come up with any good solutions anyway no matter how much i think about it. this is really really frustrating, and I feel like i would be psychologically a lot better off if i didn't have to keep avoiding talking about things that I like or care about so as not to bore other people or commit a social faux paus by making them think more or harder than they feel comfortable thinking. To an extent it seems like I've been told that it's socially not appropriate to be myself around other people because doing that makes people think and they don't like that because it's difficult and stressful for them. I feel so stifled sometimes I just want to scream. I've tried to explain this to my mom, my therapist, my behavioral consultant, my life coach, and my sisters, and I don't think any of them really understand, because they keep talking about how stressful it is for *them* to be around *me* even now that my social skills are a LOT better than they used to be and a lot of the time most people can't even tell that I have aspergers. and yet the amount of difficulty and stress that people have from trying to comprehend what i say has not decreased proportionally to my increase in social skills. realistically speaking, i dont think i can solve this problem on my own. please help?

    Hey, I hope I'm not assuming too much here, but from what I'm seeing in this comment and your other replies, you seem like a person who gets a lot of their self-worth from their intelligence. Like, an unhealthy amount. I get that you value intelligence a lot, and I think a great portion of the people here are the same to some extent, but you can't go through life obsessing about how smart you or the people around you are. That way lies madness. Trust me; I know from experience. 

    Something tells me that if you took a deep breath and just stopped thinking about it so much, you would be a thousand times more happier than you are now. I get what you mean about how people only keep talking about how *you* affect *them*. It's frustrating because it feels like no one really gives a shit. Like they're only bothering to deal with your problems so *they* can be better off. 

    Unfortunately, that's just the human condition. You can't really expect someone to understand you if you're not willing to see what problems they have with your behavior. I know it's hard, and even painful at times, but you have to make an effort to see yourself through the eyes of those around you. Don't make excuses for yourself or downplay the flaws they point out in you. You'll never improve if you're not willing to do this.

    Have you ever stopped to think *why* you value intelligence so much? You do realize it's all pointless when you get to the bottom of it, right? Anything you do in your life will eventually be forgotten. Everything turns to dust, everyone dies, and eventually entropy will get the better of the universe and make it not work anymore. It doesn't matter how intelligent you are, the smartest guy on the planet and the stupidest idiot alive all end up the same in the end.

    You're worrying about something so abstract and relative that it borders on silly when you really think about it. Not that I'm downplaying what you're going through or anything. I can relate to what you're going through, and if you get anything out of this, I hope it's that you're not alone here. Don't give up on forming meaningful connections with people. This suffering is temporary and you'll eventually figure things out yourself.

      I don't think you understand at all. I'm not sure how good a metaphor this is, but imagine what it would feel like if you were a Windows 10 operating system being run on an old IBM computer.

      Also, just because almost everyone has died so far doesn't make it good nor acceptable for human beings to die.  When I talk about how my body and mind are not functioning well and how isolated I am, reminding me that my body and mind will most likely stop functioning altogether at some point is not at all comforting and doesn't help and is blatantly insensitive.

      My cognitive and social problems are not something that I can just learn to cope with. They need to be solved or I will go crazy.

      Also, the reason I get a lot of self worth from my intelligence is because thinking and intellectual activities are what I'm best at. Notice that just because I'm better at thinking than at anything else doesn't mean that I'm good at thinking in general.

  A few days I purchased [Cold Turkey](https://getcoldturkey.com/), a productivity/blocker program that has thus far been helping me out more than similar apps have (among other advantages, it also blocks non-web programs). I recommend it if you have a problem with procrastination.

  I already posted today, but something much more important came up. I think my depression is destroying my ability to think rationally. I keep thinking and doing things that are very out of character for me and I know aren't good, but I can't stop myself. It's hard to even talk to people about this situation, both because I'm autistic and because I keep rejecting their advice even though I know they're right. I know I need to fix things, but even when I know how I can't.

  This would be easier to deal with if I'd faced it before, but I've spent my entire life battling autism and none of my strategies for that work here. I can't even build new strategies because I can't think straight. I could get help from others, but I either focus my effort on something else or I'm too apathetic to do anything. I don't care about doing the work I have to do anymore, which is the antithesis of my entire philosophy of life but none of it seems to matter anymore.

    You need a therapist, now.  Call this number: 1-800-273-8255.  You'll get a person to talk to, and they'll find a therapist for you.

      I am American, but how is that going to help when I have trouble explaining my situation and may not willing to listen to advice? You know, like right now where I'm shooting down your advice that is objectively useful for my situation but am unwilling to follow it.

        "I have high-functioning autism.  I'm depressed.  I live in *x* City, in *x* state.  I need a therapist."

        Do that, meet the therapist, and let them answer your question.  Make the call.

          The suicide prevention hotline was a bit much, I'm not actually contemplating self-harm, but I appreciate the sentiment. Unfortunately, it did me no good. They listened, but all their suggestions were things I had already done that hadn't worked or I wasn't willing to do. They did congratulate me on my self awareness, though.

          I should seek out therapy, but this is the problem I've had with it in the past. Most of the advice I hear are things I've already figured out by myself, since that was how I dealt with my autism and anxiety. I've tried to fix my problems on my own, but all my solutions have proven temporary at best. I don't know what to do anymore.

            They didn't refer you?  That was the whole point.  This one is the treatment referral service, so they'll definitely refer you: 1-800-662-4357

            There are only so many techniques, and eventually you'll learn them all.  Applying them to your own situation is orthogonal to knowing what they are and having tried them a few times.

            If I may be lazy and use a metaphor, imagine trees have muscles, and all humans are thin trees.  We know how to stand up straight, but it's hard and sometimes we're tired.  That's why we tie ourselves to wooden posts.  It's the post's job to make sure we stand tall until we can do so on our own power.  Some of us are really strong or disciplined and can stand tall by themselves without needing a permanent post.  Maybe they know really effective standing techniques and applying those techniques have become habit.  Others of us give up and fall to the ground and become sideways trees, indistinguishable from the dirt.  Stand tall, trekie.  Get yourself a wooden post.  Make the call.

            * Irrelevant to the message but it may irk you: the twine would be the bond of honest communication and good-faith effort binding you to the post, i.e. therapist.

    ***BREATHE***

    Ok, now we need to work out the first thing first: why aren't you able to take your own advice right now?

    That involves a secondary question: do you have family, friends, or other loved ones whom you trust to take care of you, should you feel the need to declare yourself temporarily incompetent for everyday life or major life choices?

    Further questions:

    * Do you think you have a chemical-level depression?  If so, talk therapy won't help all on its own.  You should see a psychiatrist and seek temporary medication.

    * Do you already have a psychiatrist?  If you don't feel that you're going to harm yourself or others, you won't be able to get yourself involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital (which is a tortuous, terrifying, and traumatic experience *anyway*, so avoid it!), so you will need to find a psychiatrist under your own power.

    * Do you have a general practitioner or "home-base" medical clinic?  That should be your first stop if you don't already have a psychiatrist.

    Pretty much everyone on this sub has dealt with some variant of neuro-atypicality, so feel free to keep asking questions.  We're not trained professionals, though.

    Good luck.  Write back.

      Thanks. I've calmed down now that I've come home and once my Mom is done with work we can hash out a plan. I don't have a psychiatrist, I haven't been to therapy since I was a little kid and haven't even needed special assistance with psychological issues for years. Even my anxiety has been manageable up until recently, with today breaking the pattern of a minor attack every 3-6 months. 

      This is actually the first time in years my issues have disrupted my work obligations. Things have gotten worse over the past year when I started having depression episodes, but it wasn't until a few weeks ago that things started to get out of control. Last week I realized how bad it had gotten and resolved to get help, only to do nothing even though I know what I need to do.

        Only if you're actively harmful to yourself or others.  An involuntary commitment rests on the condition of violent behavior.

          Is it "feel you're going to harm yourself or others", or "you're actively harmful to yourself or others"?

    Definitely suggest getting tehrapy. Unfortunately, finding a good therapist is something of a crapshoot. At least a quarter of my colleagues within my current department at work seem to be utterly hopeless at any issue that isn't their particular interest or educational focus, and I don't think half of my graduating class in my Master's Program should have been given degrees.

    If you need help finding a good one, PM me again and I can talk you through some of the options and modalities out there that you can try to look for.

  I've always been a little insecure over what fiction I like or dislike, though I've come to terms with my tastes now that I've accepted the subjectivity of my feelings. However, whenever I think someone is making a statement about the objective quality of a piece of fiction that my opinion conflicts with, I get angry.

  It happened again [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/57gsnp/d_friday_offtopic_thread/d8svf0t) when I got in an argument over whether Worm was a good deconstruction of superheroes, and I was infuriated with with the fact that my comments got fewer upvotes. I felt like people were saying my opinion was wrong and needed to prove them wrong, but that's ridiculous.

  I've decided it's something I should fix about myself, but I'm not sure how. I should just be okay with people having their own opinion, especially about something inconsequential like this, but whenever someone states what I think is just their opinion as fact I can't let it go, especially when it's inconsequential.

    It'd probably be easier (and more profitable) to improve your skills as a demagogue than to remove your impulse to attribute significance to number of upvotes. Your posts got fewer upvotes for two reasons. First, because they contained fewer segments that were fun to read, like work-showing, chains of implication, and Deep Insights. Second, because your argument was negative (Thing A is not a member of category B reasons) while his was positive (Thing A is a member of category B reasons), so his was creating something interesting for the reader to consume, while yours was explaining why an interesting thing was actually not.

    I'd recommend against removing your urge to Show Them All. Pursuit of incrementally higher numbers is a strong motivator for anything that can be measured in terms of upvotes.
    ```

    - u/TennisMaster2:
      ```
      It's also not very mentally healthy.  Upvotes are zero-sum, insofar as exerting the effort to become able to easily rally support for one's opinions among the rational tribe, or any anonymous forum, primarily serves to inflate one's ego.  While fora can be good media through which to practice rhetoric as you suggested, the feedback of upvotes or downvotes don't tell one much about what was or wasn't effective.  If the goal is to improve one's skill at rhetoric methods of practice that give more immediate feedback will help one more in pre-mastery stages than those that rely upon asynchronous and broadly binary feedback mechanisms.

      Of course, an inefficient motivator is better than none at all.  I wrote this to point out that it's easy latch on to the 'why' of actions as having a rational basis, when in fact that 'why' is an ex post facto rationalization that assumes a goal one doesn't actually have.  No matter how instrumentally rational an action may be for someone with that goal, that rationale does not apply if one doesn't consciously share it.

      It's more honest, /u/trekie140, and thus more mentally healthy to address why you need to Show Them All, than to try to twist it into a motivator for pursuing a goal that you decided to pursue solely to continue acting as you were before.

      _________________________________________________

      That said, Red intimates one method that might help: get a book on rhetoric, or find an online source, and only allow yourself to indulge your argumentative urge if you employ a new rhetorical technique or an old one in a new way.  Further, and this is the most important part for purposes of changing your behavior, only start to write or formulate your response ***after*** checking your reference source and using it to help craft your argument.

      Put succinctly: 

      Pause, notice the urge, get up and fetch or open a tab to your reference, formulate, then return to the conversation and write.  If in person, take out a notebook (carry this in your pocket or bag), politely ask the person to state their argument, then put it away while asking if they're okay with you responding to their assertion later.  If they think it's weird, don't, and when you return home to your reference source just use the argument as practice anyway.  Post it online, or something.

      _________________________________________________

      If you'd like to get rid of the urge cold turkey, there are other methods I think others will point out.  Reading the LW posts about arguing for truth rather than to win might help as well.  I'm not an expert on autism so I feel much less comfortable giving you any further advice beyond seeing a therapist immediately.  Please post the links and explanations for me, someone.

      I get what you're saying, but my concern isn't over my skills at persuading people. My concern is the fact that I'm feeling something that is clearly irrational, or at least not worth getting worked up over, but I have repeatedly in spite of that knowledge. I want to figure out how to fix that so I don't care that people have a different perspective than me on the objective quality of works of fiction.
