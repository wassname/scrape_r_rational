  Pretty much. Quicksilver's power, at least in that movie, was both over-powered, and horrendously under-used.
  ```

    Just once I'd like to see someone use a speedster properly. Just one time!
    ```

      You should read The Metropolitan Man by-oh, wait, nevermind.

      But really, if someone like The Flash was actually trying, they'd instantly win forever as soon as they gained their powers. As soon as he understands the Speed Force, Wally West could essentially freeze time and spend as many eons as it takes to read every relevant book on the planet and build up a friendly superintelligence.

      You might have read it already, considering it was this sub that recommended it to me and you're on here more than I am.

      It's still good though.

    ```
    Both of Magneto's children are over-powered. To the point where both of them break the setting entirely.

    Quicksilver is actually much weaker than his sister Scarlet Witch. Who has the ability to control probability, in such a way that it is always beneficial to her. Even if she doesn't consciously think about how to make it beneficial. She can make this effect even more powerful by concentrating, to the point where she can even use it to resurrect the dead by making it unlikely that they're dead.

    Never mind the fact that she re-wrote all of reality to her whims one time. Yes, really.

      ```
      Don't forget that she's also a literal witch -- she studied magic under Agatha Harkness. And she can use her mutant probability powers against others instead of just for her own benefit.
      ```

  ```
  All of the HISHE videos make great /r/rational fodder.
  ```

- u/FlossingThread:
  ```
  One thing that I didn't quite get, why does Prof. Xavier look so happy when wolverine forgets everything that happened for the last 50 years? I think I was quite drunk when I saw the movie, so I don't really remember it.
  ```

  - u/Darth_Hobbes:
    ```
    Because Xavier remembers Logan coming from the future and helping him save the world. So this is the first time he's seeing that Logan, his old friend, since the seventies.
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    .. Because he's a dick? Seriously, one of his teachers just mostly died. I don't think the writers actually gave it much thought, but loosing that much time is pretty bad. That ending really could have a few more minutes added on in which his wife, kids and students all go "Aw, shite".
    ```
