## Looking for an old story

### Post:

I vividly remember reading a story which I believe was by DataPacRat. It was about an open source virtual mind whose name had the word "Bear" in it, it might have been LogBear. It was framed as a terms of service and guide. The new instance of the mind would work for the owner until it could buy freedom, if I'm remembering correctly.  I've searched everywhere I can think of and for the life of me I can't find it, can anyone help me out?

  Edit: To help people develop their Google-fu, the search query that found this was "site:reddit.com/r/rational datapacrat terms of service".
