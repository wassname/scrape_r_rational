  I assume this is a mistake? 

  Overall, it's quite nice. Infodumps feel a bit *too* infodumpy, but the creativeness of *what* is getting dumped at the reader more or less makes up for it.

  If there are indeed more chapters, I'm looking forward to them.

  ~~also, Abzydkcri is my spirit animal; I'm ready to kill for a good time loop story that I haven't yet read~~

  Page deleted.  Well, shame that.

    Weird that. Posted here, got mixed but not really negative feedback, deleted the story in less than half a day.

      The other comments definitely had me interested.  Too bad I was too late for it, apparently.

  Neat setting. I assume that Earth must be an already documented world, if it’s named.  I’m not sure how seeing another Earth represents a time loop, but I’m curious to find out. 

  Hope the Queen kills that hippo.

  My initial reaction was that the hippo thing was too cartoonishly whimsical for my taste, but the rest was so good I immediately wanted the next chapter.
