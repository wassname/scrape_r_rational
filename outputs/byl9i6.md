  So Yamcha is (mostly) bulletproof, but Krillin is not? I would place Krillin as more powerful than Yamcha, but it seems training at Capsule Corp toughened him up more than I thought. 

  Maybe it was a higher caliber? Can't find explicit mention of what the weapons are, other than them being one-handed guns. 

  Or maybe Krillin would have tanked the bullet, and Muten was just showing off.

    Krillin could have tanked it, but there's a few factors. First, a blow taken while you're off guard can hurt more. You need to be "powered up"  to maximise defense (though even relaxed they never get back to regular human levels). Second, it still hurts. Roughly at this point I'd say: handgun => hurts like being hit with a metal bar could for you or me, high speed/caliber ammo from a rifle => stabs but remains superficial, and something like the grenade would have done some serious damage. Muten wasn't about to let his student be hit like that, even if he knew it wouldn't have *killed* him.

    Re: the guns, I'm not an expert nor I know how much the power can vary within handgun models (aside for the legendary 44 Magnum...). I'm thinking of these as something like your basic Beretta M9, or at least, their in-world equivalent.

      Also, much as muten hadn't trained krillin to battle suicide bombers, he may not have focused on bullet resistance, which Bulma presumably would have worked into her training regimen after Goku got shot in the head ressurecting her.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Well, it's not a *specific* training, if Krillin can take a punch from a similarly powered fighter without dying, he can take a bullet; the amount of force involved is more or less the same (and a fighter with good technique could also concentrate it in a similarly small area). The "I haven't trained you for this" bit referred more to psychological preparation, as in, to be steeled to react to something that unexpected and reckless. Like how you could be an Olympic fencer but still lose in a real duel if the opponent will just suddenly kick sand in your face or use some other dirty trick before stabbing you.

  ```
  Baba's first scene opens with her saying divination is a tricky business. Then later she has a vision that seems to imply Mai's master is Kami, but we know her master is actually Piccolo. Piccolo is Kami's split off evil half, so her divination powers might be confused or misleading her? Unless this is implying Mai is going to switch sides later, but that seems really unlikely right now.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    I'll just point out that Yamcha, Giran and Piano also all had dreams of some sort pointing them to the Tournament (chapter 17). So I can add to the confusion.

  - u/LucidityWaver:
    ```
    It’s *clearly* that in-between where pinching isn’t quite good enough, and the officer needed to  consider punching himself instead /sarcasm

  That's a lot of chapter!

  How long will it be, I wonder, before people stop underestimating what ki-users can do, and start designing effective countermeasures? Something like the adhesive expanding blobs that trapped Mr Incredible, maybe, or perhaps a gas-based attack. Or perhaps sonics; tough skin wouldn't stop a powerful vibration from rattling your brain.
  ```

  - u/LordSwedish:
    ```
    Well it's not actually tough skin, it's the ki directly reinforcing them. If this story ever gets to Frieza then the shockwaves of their attacks would kill the person using it if the ki didn't protect them from that.
