  ```
  Last week I read ***The Daily Grind: Book 1***   ^(yes, I know it's a bit late to the party)

  I've got some thoughts. 

  ## Strong Points

  * The worldbuilding: the “backrooms”-dimension is a fascinating and refreshing setting. It manages to capture the imagination, and the entire general scenario is extremely enticing. Specifically, there’s a subgenre here of more Narnia-esque portal fantasy, where the characters can enter the fantastical world through a fixed portal at will, and bring things with them. This means that they can bring tools, weaponry, and basically anything else they are smart enough to think of and can afford with them. As a though exercise, it’s quite fun to think of what I’d bring if I were in this situation, and the "what would I do" is an extremely headspace-capturing thought. 

  * The general “theming” is also great—it makes no “sense” that a magical dungeon would randomly be “generic medieval magical fantasy” and the idea that it somehow reflects human subconsciousness and “office ennui” is neat. The different themes, enemy types, and environment are all lots of fun

  * The Magic System: No “status” menus nor ability modifiers, but rather, far more esoteric magical boons and items. They aren’t leveling up in “+1 Strength!” but rather gaining often esoteric or niche skills among other exotic boons. Items are also refreshing, with unique and often nonsensical abilities—something that I use quite a lot of in my tabletop RPGs because they’re just fun (who doesn’t think a magical pen that only writes cursive is neat?)

  ## Okay Points

  * The characters. So far, there are three primary protagonists, James, Anesh, and Alana but I find none of them to be that compelling. The inter-character dynamics are fun and they have good banter, but none of them really have that "spark" or something that really makes them shine. I can't say exactly what it is, but I can just say there's something missing. 

  * I think James is intended to be something of an Everyman stand-in who’s struggling with depression in a dead-end soul-crushing job working the nightshift, but I really don't jive that well with his character. He is terminally depressed, probably suicidal, and likes to put himself in life-threatening situations because the adrenaline makes him feel alive. Like, okay. Like, there's no rule against depressed characters, but it's just not my thing. 

  ## Weak Points

  * Pacing. Only now, at the end of Book 1, has any hint of overarching plot appeared

  * Lack of real-world consequences. Alana empties a pistol mag into a monster in the real world inside the apartment block and... nobody cares? 

  (warning, bit of a rant incoming)

  The idiot ball and plot armor. I’m beginning to think this is some sort of mind-control or cabin-in-the-woods type scenario that’s making the protagonists significantly stupider than they should be beyond all the other mind-control stuff. Everything from keeping dumb secrets from eachother for no reason, to splitting the party, or otherwise tempting fate. 

  Now, certainly, none of the protagonists are the optimal person for dungeon-delving, but not being optimal isn’t really a fault.

  The problem is that they just make too many mistakes and don’t take anything seriously. Every time they go into the dungeon, they consistently get in over their heads, and it’s always because they’re fucking idiots who don’t treat an extremely dangerous situation with the respect it deserves. They always push further than they should, take dumb risks, or generally drop their guard because they assume it’s safe to do so, and then, accordingly, they get punished… but because they always make it out more-or-less unscathed due to the author’s meddling, they don’t seem to actually learn any lessons. In fact, they seem to be learning the wrong lessons: they’re mostly unfit nerds with not an iota of fighting or general “physicality” experience, but since they win every fight, all the monsters look weak and their first reaction to any enemy is basically a “let me at em, I can take em”. 

  The sad part is that this isn’t necessary. It’s a magical dungeon with unknown rules, and there are plenty of ways to write this in a way where even with extensive prep work and an abundance of caution, they can still lead to the characters in sticky situations—right now, it’s mostly a “Man vs Self” story where they are facing off against their own idiocy in the form of laughing loudly at jokes (forgetting that noise attracts monsters) or telling themselves that the safe area is perfectly safe for… reasons or generally jumping to poorly supported conclusions with the speed of an Olympic hurdler.  

  Further compounding the problem is that all think that they’re genre aware. James specifically points out quite early that the first investment should be in yourself/gear, which is like, a good call… but then he completely forgets about this with the magical skill orbs. Instead of “popping”/absorbing them as soon as possible, they instead opt to save them and then use them at a later period of time for… some reason? It’s just so stupid. 

  Like, sure, it’s unlikely, but what if one of the orb grants you expert first-aid skills or mapmaking or whatever else that’s immediately useful? Sure, 9 times out of 10, the skills are pointless (history of boogieboarding) but it costs literally nothing to “roll”, so why not do it ASAP? It’s even worse with the larger orbs. Not only do they develop the ability to perform at least some sort of scan but then elect to not use it, but they also pop random orbs that they know to be reality-altering in a 24-hour diner for goodness sakes. 

  They also consistently forget to fix easy-to-fix problems. For example, quite often, they get shit in their eyes. Either it's their own blood, ink sprayed out of a machine, or whatever it is, and only now, at the *very end of book 1* has someone even *thought* of taking a helmet with a visor. Eyepro is like PPE #1, even before gloves, but instead I guess it just makes for more dramatic fight sequences if they occasionally get shit in their eyes cause they didn't put on a 1$ pair of safety glasses. 

  Also, there's the whole "gun" issue. I get that they don't want to bring in firearms because they are loud and that's a no-no in the dungeon space--perfectly reasonable--but they seem to have completely forgotten that quieter versions of ranged weapons exist and can be purchased. Putting aside suppressed guns firing subsonic ammunition which can be quieter than footstep, there are plenty of options like compound bows or crossbows that you can just buy and they would've walked past on their sporting-goods store trips. It's just a bit goofy that they all seem to insist on melee combat and weaponry with the odd exception of a potato cannon (not a good combat weapon).

  The whole combat is a bit wonky too, and while I haven't been in many real-world fights, the fight sequences in this are very "fictiony" in nature and don't feel real. There's always time for mid-combat quips and the characters spend a significant amount of their combat time navel-gazing about the optimal attack tactics while their buddy faces the monster alone before the "snap out of it" and reenter the fight. Things that should work are disturbed by stumbles or errors--which, fair--but things which absolutely shouldn't work like loading, priming, aiming, and firing a potato gun mid-combat effectively go flawlessly. 

  Just makes me want to tear out my hair as a /r/rational reader. 

  (/rant over)

  ## Summary

  It's got it's flaws, but it's become significantly better towards the end of book 1. Maybe this is because actual plot is appearing, maybe the writer got better over time. I am intrigued enough that I will keep reading, but still frustrated with the characters, particularly James, and the frequent idiot-balling that's going on.

    ```

- u/AviusAedifex:
  ```
  I figured this would be an interesting question to discuss. I read a lot of trashy webnovels so I've found a set of criteria that worlds really well for them. I'll also show an example of a novel that does each thing well. Note that I mostly read Chinese and Korean webnovels, especially xianxia.

  For me it comes down to three primary criteria of what matters to me the most, and if something fulfils those I'll usually read it. I will also go into some cons that while important, if the primary criteria are all good, I'll read something even if it has things I dislike.
  The first criteria is that the protagonist needs to have goals that are achievable, both in short term and long term. And then actually overcomes those and finds new ones as the story goes on.

  - But not everything works. The key part is 'achievable'. If they have a goal, but it's either too far reaching, or they're not really working towards it, that's a *con*. Something like a shounen protagonist's goal to be the strongest or a pirate king or whatever. Like if it takes 1000 chapters to get there, it doesn't count for me.

  - It doesn't have to be grand. Even something as simple as just wanting to survive is fine, if the protagonist is constantly under threat of dying. 

  - The reason is that I hate it when a protagonist always sticks with whoever they find first. And it never bites them in the back. They never end up getting used, or manipulated, whoever they meet first is always good, and will always help them.  This is a *huge* issue in Japanese web novels, which is also why I generally dislike them. Something like That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime is a perfect example of everything I dislike.

  - That's why I usually really like regression or time loop or isekai into a novel they've read focused stories because they have many clear goals they focus on. Something like [Jackal Among Snakes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48969/jackal-among-snakes) is a good example in western webnovels. For example, he knows there's going to be an invasion, so he goes through multiple different steps in order to prepare for it, it happens, and he stops it. And he moves on to another goal.

  - Now the reason why the protagonist is number 1 here is because they are the story's viewpoint. Multiple povs are pretty rare in, at least eastern web novels. Which means that if the protagonist is boring, it will taint the entire story. I can't think of any at the moment, but I'm sure there are a few stories that I liked that had a bad protagonist, but unless the other criteria is really good, I'll drop if it I don't like the protagonist.

  The second criteria is the world building. The world needs to have other factions that have their goals that both conflict and work together with both each other and with the main character. As well as have a mystery that there is more to the world than what the protagonist sees. One of my favorite parts of these long form webnovels is the fact that you can foreshadow something near the beginning of the story and have it pay off hundreds of chapters later. It hits completely differently than in shorter formats, even if the actual execution might not bas a good.

  - While this is second point, because if the protagonist sucks, while this can carry it, it'll have problems, but as long as the protagonist isn't actively bad, this is the most important point.

  - The best way to showcase this point is the Chinese webnovel, [Lord of the Mysteries](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/lord-of-the-mysteries/ "Lord of the Mysteries"). The world has many factions. From official government institutions, to secret societies and ancient cults, and "good" ancient cults. They all have their own agendas, their own wars. Some are still happening, others have passed and even the aftereffects show up thousands of years later. 

  - Like in LotM in the beginning when he finds hints that these factions exist it's at a point where even knowing of them can be dangerous. And if he actually gets involved his death is certain. But eventually as he get stronger he can start to fight back, and then the dynamics will change even further. 

  - It's something xianxia does extraordinarily well because the sects and their ancient secrets are almost an implicit part of the setting. It's something that even mediocre xianxia webnovels do pretty well, and good xianxia do even better. '[Cultivating in Secret Beside a Demoness](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/cultivating-in-secret-beside-a-demoness/ "Cultivating in Secret Beside a Demoness")' is a good example. I wasn't expecting much from the title, and especially the summary but it actually does all the three things I like very well, especially the second point. LotM getting as popular as it did actually did a ton of good for Chinese webnovels because it meant that this part especially is getting even more focus.

  The third criteria is side characters have their own goals and motivations.  

  - This is pretty simple. In a way it's partly handled in the second point. Side characters need to have their own goals and motivations and either work or conflict with the protagonist's. But at the same time I don't like that there's too much of a focus on it. 

  - I'm fine with simple character motivations like you often see people memeing about the "young master" in xianixa, but I don't think the trope itself is necessarily bad. If you're the son of a regional power in a stable country, there isn't really an issue with acting like it. Like the situations where they encounter the protagonist isn't something that happens occasionally, it's literally a one in a billion type occurrence. Like technically every single homeless person you meet could actually secretly be a uber rich and if you help them they might help you in return, but in practice that's irrelevant.

  - So as long as the tropes are justified within the world, that's fine. At least for the various mooks the protagonist meets. If a character is supposed to be *the* regional power, then I do expect a lot more from them.

  - One last thing I'd add is that you can very easily have too much character development for the side characters. I personally really dislike multiple pov stories because they tend to have atrocious pacing. 


  Minor pros:

  - Cheats. Cheats can be done really well in Chinese web novels. It's an easy way to differentiate the protagonist from others, explain their rapid rise in power, and make the story more interesting. Xianxia isn't a meritocracy. Hard work is meaningless if you don't have connections to truly take advantage of it, and cheats are meant to bridge that gap.
  	- (This doesn't include Japanese webnovels that just make the protagonist OP for no reason.)
  ```

  - u/AviusAedifex:
    ```
    Mixed:

    - I don't care if the translation is bad, unless it's really bad. I've read tons of translated manga and webnovels, and very few of them were truly unreadable. As long as it fits the main criteria well, I'll stomach a bad translation without a problem.

    - Saving sick parent/sibling character motivation. 95% of the time they cure them and the family member becomes irrelevant, which I find a really boring way to do things. It's a basic way to explain why the protagonist risks their life in the beginning, but I would prefer if they had a better reason from the beginning.

    - I prefer white/grey vs black in the [shades of conflict](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShadesOfConflict).  Generally greyish white is my favorite for the protagonists. I prefer black vs grey/white with some black more than pure black vs black, since the later can easily become just about reading to see the whole world burn. And something like Warlock of the Magus World is a good example of the former.
    	- I also really like grey vs blue and orange. 


    Cons:


    - Underdog protagonist. This is a bit of an oxymoron in my opinion. In xianxia and progression webnovels, the protagonist is always the underdog because they're lower level than most of the people they fight against. I can only think of a few stories that don't have super OP characters where the protagonist *isn't* an underdog is something like [History’s Strongest Senior Brother](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/historys-strongest-senior-brother/ "History’s Strongest Senior Brother"). 

    - Also protagonists that are primarily focused on money and status over everything else. This is quite common in Korean webnovels and I find it a super boring motivation. 

    - "Character development". This is a bit of exaggeration. But I've often found novels where the key feature is so called "character development", to be deceiving because what that means. If a character goes from a -5 to a 3, while that *is* technically an 8 point difference, in practice it means you'll end up reading for hundreds of chapters of the most insufferable protagonist imaginable. The best example of this is the Korean webnovel '[Overgeared](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/overgeared/ "Overgeared")'. The protagonist is insanely selfish and obsessed with money where he will throw away any and all long term goals if the can earn money now. I've read around 100 chapters because it was super popular and recommended everywhere, but all it did is convinced me that the opinion of a lot of web novel readers and mine, is completely different, and I never trust scores. 
    	- I would prefer for the protagonist to start as a 1 and develop from there, even if it is extremely slow, and I would always take zero character development over starting as -5.

    - Comedy. Especially when it's based on misunderstandings. This is extremely popular in Korean webnovels and in some Chinese ones. It can be done well, most of the time it's not. In general, if I read that a story's focus is comedy it's an automatic skip for me. English webnovel '[Industrial Strength Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57011/industrial-strength-magic)' is a good example, it's not based on misunderstandings, but the comedy is a big focus. I don't think it's bad, but it's not for me.

    - Parodies. I'll read a story with comedy if it's good. But I despise parodies. This is pretty much the only thing that's either an instant drop or skip in the first place. Especially western attempts at xianxia. In order to create an effective parody you need to actually *know* what you're parodying and most of the time, they have no idea.

    - Romance. I actually really like romance, but it being done well in a web novel is *extremely* rare. Despite how common it is, it's something that requires time and focus to make it work, and in the case it doesn't, it can and will drag down stories faster than nothing else.

    - Harem. What's better than one shitty romance? Dozens of them! Now, I don't think this tag is unredeemable either. [Grasping Evil](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/grasping-evil/ "Grasping Evil") is a good example. The Worm fanfic [A Ruinous Gift](https://archiveofourown.org/works/50209543) is actually pretty good so far as well. I think harem is alright if everyone who joins it is aware they're in a harem, and there isn't really a main spouse, if you will. I will usually still skip harems without even checking though.

    - Nationalism. Surprisingly enough I find Korean webnovels to have the worst nationalism. Maybe it's because most of the Chinese webnovels I read are fantasy, but even the ones set in alternate Earth usually don't have it be a huge deal outside of "China number 1". But in Korean webnovels it's really bad. Especially the VRMMO ones, but even the regular "portal" setting has a ton of it. Japan is almost always a bad guy and Korea is always the goodest boy in the world that's unfairly picked on by everyone else.


    Examples:

    - Worm is an example that does all three things I like perfectly. Taylor is driven, the world is diverse with many different factions clashing with one another, and countless mysteries, and the side characters are are all unique and stand out. I'm sure everyone knows this one.

    - Lord of the Mysteries does all three very well, but does the second one exceptionally well. Not only that, but it has influenced other stories to imitate it which is really good. 

    - [Jackal Among Snakes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48969/jackal-among-snakes) does all three well. 

    - [The Primal Hunter](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36049/the-primal-hunter) Does all three well. It's the closest a western webnovel has come to not only imitating but surpassing xianxia.

    - [The Flower That Bloomed Nowhere](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28806/the-flower-that-bloomed-nowhere) Is a good example of a web novel that doesn't focus on combat that does all three really well. Especially the second with the mystery of the world. It's a really stand out novel in that regard.

    - [A Regressor’s Tale of Cultivation](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/a-regressors-tale-of-cultivation/ "A Regressor’s Tale of Cultivation") This one does all three really well too.

    - [My Longevity Simulation](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/my-longevity-simulation/ "My Longevity Simulation") This is a good example of how a story that focuses on 2. over everything else can still be super fun to read. The side characters are pretty basic, but the world building is super fun to read. 

    Counter examples:

    - [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) I don't think this is bad, but it's a good example, of a story that does 1 and 2 well, it fails at three, because the side characters drag the story down for me because there's too much of a focus given to them, and they're not interesting to warrant it and then the  time spent on them means you're not focusing on the interesting parts.

      Thanks for the effort post. I agree with most of what you have written here. I have similar tastes in original amateur web fiction. The two places I differ, at least on the surface, are that I am more forgiving when it comes to story sprawl and less forgiving when the MC doesn't have a strong personality. I like MCs who stick by an ideal or a philosophy more than ones who have specific sets of goals they are working towards.

      However, while your list is a good indicator of what kind of stories do the best as progression fantasies, it isn't the whole sauce. The best ones, the ones worth reading have something more to them. A personal touch by the author that elevates it all beyond.

      - u/Naitra:
        ```
        It's a pretty decent time waster. But I feel like the overall plot is not that interesting to be honest, and the progression itself is quite boring. I'd put it a level below Jackal Among Snakes.

      > The Primal Hunter

      IMO i'ts not especially bad but not especially good either. Nothing in it done better then in Defiance of the Fall, and Defiance itself is not something spectacular. Definitely not on par with LoM or Reverend Insanity. And it does not imitate xianxia it's an RR brand of litrpg.
      ```

      - u/AviusAedifex:
        ```
        I personally really disliked Defiance of the Fall. Zack is super boring and I dropped it in the first book. 

        And yeah, xuanhuan would've been the right term. But I'd say it's closer to xianxia than litrpgs. I am admittedly pretty new to RR, but I've read a few litrpgs and Primal Hunter is still closer to xianxia. 

        And is it spectacular? No. But it's extremely solid. It knows what it is, it does it well, and that's good enough for me. It ticks all of my criteria really well and does it consistently. Sometimes that's all I want. It's why I'd rather read it than Reverend Insanity which while it has fun world building is also really tedious to read. 

        I don't read any of these novels chapter to chapter, but Primal Hunter is one of the few that I return to and read all the chapters that are out like twice a year.

  I saw *Tucker & Dale vs. Evil* over the weekend. It was a surprisingly fun movie. Basically two hillbillies are on vacation to renovate a (creepy) cabin in the woods one of them bought while a group of college kids on vacation mistake them for a pair of murderers. It takes a bunch of horror movie tropes and makes fun of them.

  It kind of reminded me of *The Final Girl* (which is also worth watching, or reading if you can find the manga), though it came out five years earlier.

  I also saw *My Sister's Keeper*, about a girl who is essentially "spare parts" for her sick sister, and is seeking partial/medical emancipation. I liked it overall, it was an interesting story and the actors (namely Cameron Diaz, Abigail Breslin and Alec Baldwin) did a really good job. The only thing I didn't like was the judge didn't really seem to act like a real judge would. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure if someone with a medical condition (and their service dog) says they need a break then they should get one, not be denied it because the judge wanted to end the case before the day finished.

  There were also a lot of flashbacks, which wasn't terrible but not something I'm a fan of.

  Overall it was a good movie, though it played up the drama in a way the felt forced at times.

    ```
    I think that bit is pretty accurate. Judges are basically god in their own courtrooms, if they do something egregious your main escalation is gonna be asking for a mistrial/vacated sentence in appeals. As far as my layman knowledge/basic googling suggests, it's pretty much entirely up to a judge to decide how seriously they wish to take a party's illness when it comes to breaks and continuances. There's probably some statute you could say was violated in appeals, but that wouldn't be a quick remedy.

  **[Systema Delenda Est](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/83315/systema-delenda-est) - ongoing**

  picked it up and binged the first 10 chapters due to it being recommended here last week. Same author as Paranoid Mage, which infamously started out strong by ratfics standards and then turned into something else entirely, much to the chagrin of many of the readers here. System Delenda Est again starts out strong, gets right into the action and doesn't really slow down thereafter. It's about a postbiological gestalt soldier who starts a solo invasion of a xianxia/system-type world, after said world invaded earth and got beaten back. Now he is on his own and starts building up power, with the ultimate goal of waging war against the system and erasing it.

  Someone mentioned last week that it's basically about the MC playing factorio in space, which I found hilarious, but even more hilariously it's actually pretty accurate. 

  Having a lot of fun with it so far, should be right up this subs alley. I just hope it'll stay that way!
  ```

  - u/Naitra:
    ```
    This author has a pretty bad track record. He can probably win the speedrun award for the fastest author to fuck up a great story. I still can't fathom what went through his mind when writing Paranoid Mage post book 1.

    I'll wait until it's at least 500~ pages long before giving it a chance, and read the most recent reviews to make sure it isn't another stinker.
    ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      That said, I thought his most recent work "Chasing Sunlight" was extremely well done. It felt the whole time that there was a clear end coming and he wrapped it up nicely.

      Not sure how rational I'd call it though.
      ```

  - u/Missing_Minus:
    ```
    The current chapters are pretty good, I like the biotech and such.  
    (It isn't really yet anywhere near 'factorio in space' yet, though)  
    It displays the capabilities an advanced civ could have quite well, though I found some of the implied politics of the Earth solar system to be a bit odd.  
    Also I think the representation of how culture gets morphed by the existence of the System, in a very Xianxia manner, to be good.
    ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    Extreme anti-rec to this. I agree that it's a bit like the main character is playing Factorio in space, but I'd argue that it's not really that fun to hear someone tell you how *they* played Factorio. Beyond that, *a lot* of the word count is of aliens reacting to what he's doing, and the characters are equally one dimensional as the ones in Paranoid Mage.

    Just flat, fillery action without giving me a reason for me to keep reading.

  I was randomly flicking through channels, and this week I watched the movie ***Last Action Hero*** (1993) which I found very enjoyable. 

  It's basically a metafiction action comedy that pokes fun at action movie tropes and notably stars Arnold Schwarzenegger playing both as "Jack Slater", a classic action-movie hero, and himself the actor. It's very self-aware and also unexpectedly funny--we couldn't stop laughing when the "LAPD" location was introduced. 

  Also, interestingly, it got a rather poor reception at the time it was released. Critics really didn't like it (40% on RT) and people really roasted Arnold for it, but I'm pretty sure they all just collectively had bad taste, and couldn't appreciate satire or parody for what it was. Same thing happened to ***Starship Troopers*** (1997) where the viewers at the time just didn't get that it was an obvious satire of fascism, and not actual fascist propaganda. 

  My speculation is that, at the time, finding the right audience for these movies was just very hard. People presumably went into *Last Action Hero* expecting a classic Schwarzenegger action flic romp, fresh off the heels of Terminator 2 and by the same director who directed *Die Hard* but instead they got a somewhat silly movie where all their favorite tropes of the genre are turned to %110 and then treated unseriously and quite bluntly poked fun at. Same thing with *Starship Troopers*; people went in expecting some good ol' fashioned alien killin', and instead they're met by what they interpret as a wonky attack on their values or something.

    I watched it back when it was released. I remember going in fully expecting a genre deconstruction along the lines of other parodies that were moderately popular at the time: *The Naked Gun* (1988-1994), *Hot Shots!* (1991-1993), *Spaceballs* (1987), etc. Action movies, which were mega-popular in the 1980s-early 1990s, seemed like a good target for deconstruction and Schwarzenegger, who had starred not only in SF/action films, but also in popular comedies like *Twins* (1988) and *Kindergarten Cop* (1990), seemed like a good choice.

    Unfortunately, I found the movie to be rather mediocre. I remember watching it and thinking: "I see what you are trying to do here and some of the twists are moderately clever, but the end product is curiously lifeless, almost mechanical."

    I liked Cameron/Schwarzenegger/Jamie Lee Curtis's *True Lies* (1994), also an action comedy, a lot more.
