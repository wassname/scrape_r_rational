  Since you're not the owner of the copyrighted work, stick with reporting the story. Also if you're still posting chapters, get your readers to report it on Wattpad as well.

  > **How to report Published content if you are not the owner:**


  > Clicking the report button on the story description page OR when on web clicking the "..." on any story part and clicking "Report Story"
  >      
  > After you click report story, you will select that you are reporting copyright. After doing so, you will be brought to a separate reporting form and will be required to provide all links since the DMCA form does not track the story link you reported from.
  >      
  > Tip: For the "original source," please include a link to a listing if you are reporting a novel. A link to the Amazon or Goodreads page for the novel is ideal so we can view a free preview and easily investigate.

    It looks to me that OP is the owner of the copyrighted work.

      Merely not the owner of the _trademarks_, nor the _characters_. (I do not understand copyright / trademark / patent law with regards to literature in the slightest.)

        You always own the copyright on something you've created.

        (Even if it's a dubiously-legal derivative work, yes! This is why franchise authors studiously avoid reading fanfic.)

          That's a interesting point. I can see a very entertaining lawsuit where a franchise author was sued for copyright violation for infringing on a fanfic of their own work.

            I don't know of a specific case where it actually happened, but it's been a concern with authors engaging with online fanbases since at least JMS and *Babylon 5* in the '90s.

            This is why so many authors can’t or won’t read fanfiction of their work, lest they have the same idea and things get murky with priority and ownership.

              Sincere question: How does one prove that they didn't read a fanfic? There have been countless times when I've had an idea that I was sure was original, executed on it, and found out quite a while later that someone else had done it first. Had they accused me of stealing their idea, I'm not sure what defense I could have mounted.

                ```
                You don't need to prove that you didn't read a fanfic, because you're innocent until proven guilty. The burden of proof is on the person blaming you, which means that they need to provide clear-cut evidence that it was, indeed, taken from their work.
                ```

              - u/edwardkmett:
                ```
                They have the burden of proof as /u/xland44 mentioned, but that becomes way easier to provide when you have some statement from the author that they liked your work.
                ```

            This actually happened.

          You own the non infringing parts of the derivative work, which is going to be quite difficult convincing a judge that any part of it is original unless you made substantial changes.

           For example,  EY's Harry Potter would be partially owned by EY and JKR. JKR owns the parts that match the character she created (history, appearance, name) while EY owns the parts he created (Modifications to history, behavior). Now if another author decides to make an R!Harry, but just copies EY's Harry to make it happen without doing the work to create a unique character, EY would own this other Harry outright, and since Harry is a defining feature of the work, may even own this other story entirely if the unnamed writer fails to make a case for fair use.

          Here is an example of a case where the author of the original ended up owning the derivative even though the derivative was a whole new story (thanks to ChronoDAS for linking it originally).

      Sorry for being vague: I meant that he/she isn't the owner of the Naruto copyright.

      ~~I don't believe fanfiction authors are entitled to DMCA actions.~~

      Apparently "derivative works" fall under the Copyright Act, but it's still unclear without some lawyering whether derivative work authors are entitled to DMCA action.

      > [**What Copyright Protection is There for Derivative Works?**](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/what-are-derivative-works-under-copyright-law)
      > 
      > The copyright on a derivative work covers only new material, appearing for the first time in the derivative work; it does not cover any preexisting material from the original. So the character of Superman is not covered by the copyright on the film Superman, since the copyright on that character pre-dated the movie; but any elements new to the film received their copyright from the date of Superman II's creation.  What this means are two things: (1) if you license a work from its author so you can make a derivative work based on the original, you do not obtain the copyright on the original—you gain only the right to make the derivative work agreed upon; the owner retains all rights to the original and all its elements, and (2) the copyright on the original is not extended by the creation of the derivative work. This used to mean more than it does today, since copyrights exist for the life of an author plus 70 years, and if an author makes a derivative of his own work, then his copyright won't change regardless. But what it does mean is that if a second author makes a derivative work of the first author's original, the copyright on the elements of the original is measured by the life of the original's author—not the derivative work's.
      > 
      > With “new versions” of work becoming more commonplace, the lines between a new creation, a derivative work and copied work can be blurred. With all these gray areas, it's important to do your homework before you set out to create and publicize something you believe is completely black and white. The take-away: get a license or get a lawyer.

  The disclaimer seems visible enough, it's the first thing people see when they click. You may have the legal right to stop them, but as far as I'm concerned they did nothing wrong, since they credited you clearly. They CERTAINLY didn't "plagiarize" you considering they were very clearly not intending to pass it off as their own work and stated that their intention was to share a story they enjoyed in a way others would find more convenient.

  Like I said though, you are unfortunately legally in the right, since the law does not agree with me that the creator should have no right to limit how people use their work so long as it is properly credited as theirs (things become slightly more complicated morally when money is involved, since we're unfortunately in a capitalist economy where it's necessary to make a profit to survive, but in this case there isn't any money involved anyway). But I certainly don't see how you can pretend to hold the moral high ground when your own work builds off of others copyright, and I doubt you sought permission from the original authors any more than this so-called plagiarizer did.

      >The analogy isn't me writing a fanfic, but me copy and pasting the words of Harry Potter exactly and then saying "credits to JK Rowling!"

      Another thing I think there'd be nothing wrong with (again, a little more complicated when money is involved, but Harry Potter was written long enough ago now that if our copyright lengths were reasonable it would be public domain anyway).

    As a creator (and even as a socialist), I can't help but see this as the asshole take on the issue.
