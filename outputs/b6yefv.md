## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I have been a fan of xianxia genre for a while now and I have noticed I feel an odd sense of r/gatekeeping when ever someone recommends the Cradle Series by Will Wight. In my mind I picture the people who recommend it as normis who aren't True fans  just because they didn't have to force themselves to read unfinished, badly translated garbage to get into the genre. 

  I know that it's a silly thing to get annoyed about especially since a well written western xianxia series is likely good for genre and will lead to more high quality works in the future.

  Also the people who recommend cradle are likely just as big fans of the genre as I am who are just glad that they don't have to read badly translated garbage anymore..

    I feel an odd sense of gatekeeping whenever I encounter badly translated garbage.  Like, who are you to present this series to me as if it were translated when it looks like you just ran it through a machine translator and didn't bother editing it?  Some fans put forth time and effort to translate series that they enjoy so that other people like me who don't speak foreign languages can enjoy them too.  And some people submit awkward garbage that's barely even gramattical and pretend that it's English.  In many cases, it's worse than if they didn't even bother, because if a bad translator claims a series it might dissuade more competent fans from doing a proper translation of that series.  And it also wastes my time that I spent looking through it and makes it take longer to find good series with proper translations.

    Maybe I shouldn't be too harsh on people, given that I haven't put forth the effort to properly learn a foreign language and am just free-riding on the work of other people.  But at least I'm not a negative contributor to a public good.

  I had the recent pleasure of watching a high school performance the [Suessical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seussical) last week. It was cute, but kind of bittersweet. Part of that was my insight into the production - my sisters were on crew, and privy to a lot of the drama going on in the background. Many of the senior actors refused to work in the musical in protest, because it was a step down from the productions they worked on before. There was one backdrop and maybe three or four movable props. This is coming from the school that built a moving car for their production of [*Chitty Chitty Bang Bang*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEzaMe7Lmew). As crew members, my sisters have been consistently disappointed in the new stage-director's insistence on minimalist sets, and this was the embodiment of that.

  Other than that, the Suessical also feels kind of... slimy? The same way Broadway shows always do, in that supporting a performance of a musical means supporting the theater industry, unless the performance wasn't properly licensed. I'm already disheartened by how copyright works in more mainstream media, so I'm not super psyched that Broadway is allowed to clamp down on the distribution of recordings of musicals the way they do, even if that recording isn't even on Broadway.

  I'm nearing the end of my second semester of college, and let me tell you, if you get the opportunity to study Software Engineering at RIT, choose Computer Science instead. I hate that I have to say that, seeing as it's my major, but it's true. Even if RIT has one of the oldest Software Engineering programs around, there are a few really *strange* prerequisites. I have to take University Physics I and II, and pass both with higher than a C. This is a requirement on a technicality - all engineering majors have to take UP I & II, and Software Engineering is still "engineering" even if it's mostly computers. Knowing this subreddit, you might not think that's a big deal. But UP II is one of the more notorious weed-out classes for the *Physics* major. So I have to struggle through this elaborate *70%* fail-rate hazing ritual for physics majors because my degree is tangentially related to the discipline. (To put this in perspective, two of the six people at my table have taken this class and failed before. I'm the only freshman in the room.) If it were enriching *and* difficult, I would be happier about it. But it's mostly a chore.

  The worst thing about it is that, because it's a required course, the college didn't take my AP Physics credits. That's okay in the long-term, because I still had about a semester and a half's worth of credits in AP courses going into college without it, but I'd still appreciate being rewarded for the effort. University Physics I was mostly review of the same material.

  EDIT: And if the degree had the general science requirement that Computer Science had, I wouldn't need to take any classical science classes at all, because I carried over like six credits worth of AP Biology. So not only did they deny my Physics credits, they treated my hard-fought biology credits as *electives*. Ugh.

    I recall doing a physics course in university, which was taught by two separate professors with very different exam styles. The first professor would expect you to memorise the relevant equations and simply (mechanically) apply them to the questions as given - finding a faster but equally correct way to reach the same answer was given only partial credit.

    The second professor would give you a sheet containing the equations in the exam, but then require you to use them in innovative ways to find the answer.

    ...my grades went up *significantly* when the second professor took over.

    Reminds me of my first Computer Science classes at University of Rochester a little bit. Let me share my horror story of badly taught college classes.

    My professor was due to retire literally the next semester so the class that he was teaching was the very last class he would ever teach. Hence he had a bad habit of getting bored with what he was teaching and meandering off into tangents that was barely related to the material he was supposed to cover!

    It was a very frustrating class where we would be doing HW assignments and taking tests on material that were either barely touched on in the class to not at all. The only reason I got a C was because of the amazing TAs who put a lot of time and effort into tutoring the students. I think the only people with Bs or As were people who already knew the material but didn't have AP credits.

    To add another note to this story of woe, the very next semester, I had to take a specific CS requirement course that was only offered in the spring and I was all excited for a better professor......and the same professor came back for one more semester of teaching!!!!!

    I am a student with minimal experience in CS; please explain the basics before jumping off into material that requires the basics to understand!?!?!

    That semester I got a D in his class, and for comparison, an A in an AI Development class which was considered to be harder than the first class.

    Whew, didn't mean to go into that much detail sharing my horror stories, but yeah, bad requirements and bad teachers are in every school.

    Honestly I like that your school has a clear separation between computer science and software engineering. I find a lot of "computer science" programs are just glorified software engineering (if that; sometimes it's just a glorified vocational programming) majors.

  I'm nearing the end of Baba Is You, which I've been liking quite a bit. (It's a block-pushing puzzler where the words that make up the rules can be pushed, which changes the rules.)

  My only real problem with the game is that some of the rules can only be found by discovery, since there's no manual. Normally I like that in a puzzle game, but the game has to teach you the rules in some other way. The Witness was really good about that. Baba Is You ... not so much. Two or three times I've been stumped by some hitherto unknown arcana of how the game works on a programmatic level, with no clear way to arrive at the solution aside from trying stuff until unexpected behavior occurs.

  Other than that, I'm finding it really enjoyable, especially since it does that wonderful puzzle game thing of having two levels which are, on the surface, similar to each other, but vary in just slightly different ways so that different solutions are needed. It's also got some really bizarre/abstract puzzles in it that make me laugh before I get to the actual business of solving them.

  Ah, and one more thing before I leave. Years ago, my birth city of Rochester built a ferry to take people from the shores of Seabreeze to the city of Toronto. When it was built, it was touted as a major way to increase tourism in the area. But it turns out that, while people from Rochester wanted to visit Toronto, nobody in Toronto wanted to visit Rochester. So the ferry was sold, and political humiliation for those involved in the project was left in its wake.

  Where is it now?

  I've been enjoying reading about calvary charges lately. The way the riders hype themselves up to calm their nerves, doing their best to ride as hard as they could while struggling to avoid impaling themselves into a forest of spears, those that decide to abandon all self-preservation instincts and throw themselves and their horses bodily into the enemy formation, opening them up for their comrades following close behind. The mentality and the minute details described by a good writer are so vivid I can imagine the scene as if it was a movie.

  Apart from the Sharpe series, I've been enjoying those parts from the translation for the Chinese webnovel the Amber Sword, and the Japanese light novel Girl Who Ate A Death God. The flag waving, lance shining, horses snorting, sheer energy behind a wedge of heavy cavalry cutting straight through men to save the day at a critical moment is exhilarating.

  It makes me want to take up a pen too. Then put it back down and play some Medieval 2 Total War.

  My husband got offered a job last night (YAY!!!) and... the employment contract says "you'll be working 38 hours a week. you may be required to work additional reasonable hours on evenings, weekends, and public holidays. all additional hours are reasonable"

  And I'm telling him to nope the fuck out of that last sentence and don't sign the damn thing if they don't accept that. They literally say he might have to work "reasonable" extra time on nights, weekends, holidays.... and then in the same breath say that "all time is reasonable"?!?! I think our labour laws say that reasonable additional hours are OK to make someone work, but there's [a definition of what makes something reasonable](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/how-we-will-help/templates-and-guides/fact-sheets/minimum-workplace-entitlements/maximum-weekly-hours) - not a blanket fucking statement that his employer's every whim is reasonable.

  So now I'm going through employment law rabbithole  (thank you union for teaching me enough to know what to google!), and I think I found the award he'll be employed under (or similar): http://awardviewer.fwo.gov.au/award/show/MA000065 so at least I can work out what the minimums are... though of course that document doesn't actually contain any provisions about hours worked/etc so it's actually not that helpful ugh.

  EDIT: they wouldn't remove the ridiculous clause from the contract so fuck 'em, he's turned the job down
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:

    They might mean that sentence to reaffirm that they will only only choose reasonable hours to be additional. Or maybe they just want it to sound that way, though that sounds illegal.

  After enjoying the Love Is War anime so much I decided to read the manga (my first ever, what a milestone!). These were my thoughts, as of the latest issue:

  **The Good:**

  >!- They didn't let the Kaguya/Miyuki 'conflict' grow too stagnant, and even though they were both trying to get each other to confess still after 100+ issues it was still possible to feel the progress in their relationship. They managed to make this changing dynamic work well with the humour too, i.e one of my favourite new gags was Kaguya trying to get Miyuki flustered, such as trying on a cute cosplay, and instead of Miyuki getting flustered he straight out admits what she's after/tells her how amazing she looks and *she* ends up being the one flustered. !<

  >!- The central conflict in general was handled well (up until after the climax) and the climax at the Culture Festival was great. The scene had a lot of feeling and was a great payoff.!<

  >!- Whenever the side characters were featured *in conjunction* with one of the main two, or when the entire student council as a whole as assembled, I thought they were used to great effect. Bonus points if they had their own little character arcs worked into the protagonist's arcs such as Hayasaka's, which was a personal favourite of mine. On the other hand when the side characters functioned as their own protagonists in an issue...!<

  **The Bad:**

  >!- ...When one of the side characters, most notably Ishigami or Miko, were the protagonists of an issue the story turned from this unique take on a rom-com with scheming, mind games, insightful social dynamics and comedic absurdity into...some cookie cutter generic high school angst story. Fujiwara and Hayasaka were great examples of side characters being used to better explore the main two protagonists and in the doing, to have their own hilarious character moments. Ishigami and (very occasionally) Miko were used like this at times but when they went off on their own they couldn't hold my attention without the core cast.!<

  >!- What on earth is going on post-climax? What is the gimmicky garbage filling my once great manga with 'Chiba'(?) Kayuga and then some personality-shifting-ice-princess-contrived-drama bullshit? I was so incredibly disappointed reading the latest issue (142)(though the cold hands gags was genuinely funny)
  and hope it's not a sign of things to come. There still so much they can do with the two characters even after they've all but confessed; there's power dynamics at play in every relationship and there's a bunch of hurdles and milestones, especially in a first time relationship, that would make for great content. There's no need for such suspension of disbelief breaking contrived rubbish.!<

  **The 'Wut?':** 

  >!What's up with how French kissing is treated? Is this a convention of anime/manga that French kissing is almost the equivalent of sex or is this some sort of Japanese social norm?!<

  Overall the good certainly outweighed the bad and I intend to keep reading.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    >!Yeah, I've noticed a lot of people are unsatisfied with how the plot is unfolding after 136, which is pretty understandable.!< 

    >!But, in my opinion, the author has managed to accrue a lot of goodwill with me over +130 chapters, so I'm willing to give Aka the benefit of the doubt and see where it goes. We do know that everything is building up to the Christmas party, and it doesn't look like he's stalling until then, so I'm cautiously optimistic. I'm just hoping that the payoff is good.!<

    >!I actually do like the Ishigami and Miko segments, especially their big climactic moments (election and the sport festival). I do think Miko is a bit underdeveloped, but it looks like that's going to change soon, given the increasing focus on her now.!<

    The french kissing thing is just Hayasaka being an embarrassed idiot, mixed with some jealousy I imagine. 

    Oh, and someone translated a recent volume extra (can't find it for some reason) which basically had the author apologizing in advance for the stupidity readers were about to witness and advising them to come back in three days (Christmas). 

    As the author seemed to be able to prediction people's response to recent chapters, I'm guessing he has a plan, so again, I wouldn't worry too much.
    ```

      > The french kissing thing is just Hayasaka being an embarrassed idiot, mixed with some jealousy I imagine.

      This was my first thought (even though it would be odd given that Hayasaka has been set up as the knowledgeable and level headed one) but then Kaygua double checked over the phone with that side character who’s in a relationship and she backed up Hayasaka.

      > I'm guessing he has a plan, so again, I wouldn't worry too much.

      I’m not sure there is any way to retroactively make the last few issues less awful but I’d mostly be happy if the author just avoided...whatever it is he’s been doing post-climax. I do agree that he’s built up goodwill and I’m willing to persevere for a while.

  Anyone is familiar with the Liber Novus, the Red Book of Jung? I've read a bunch of  reviews about it, and they seem to point to some amusing themes on the work, some kind of spiritual jorney on the exploration of his unconscious mind.

  I dare not call this fully "rational" so I didn't publish it in the main thread, as it's mostly silly and the details don't stand much to scrutiny, but I just wrote [The Cage of Light](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13248803/1/The-cage-of-light), a Star Trek TNG story about what happens when reward systems go... *very* awry. Hope someone finds it fun!

  (also apologies to anyone following The Optimised Wish Project, I know, I've been horribly slow writing and updating recently. I'll try publishing something next week. It's been a stressful time and I've not had much inspiration, or it's been erratic and focused on different things)
