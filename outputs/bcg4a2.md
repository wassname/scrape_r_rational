  I thought the zombie problem was supposed to be a pretty long running thing, but if they self upgrade this fast, why haven't the defenders seen some of the serious upgrades before now?

    This is the first time theyve gone on the offensive, isnt it?

    I think it's not self upgrade, but rather that dormant zombies getting buried will metamorphose into those worms.

    Maybe deeper in zombiezone, there will be the Butterfree version of the zombies.

      Considering the two precursor civilisations which are far in advance of even Minmay's tech level both ultimately lost to these zombies, it's almost guaranteed the zombies have far more tricks up their sleeves.

        Didn't they lose to dust/magic nanites?
        ```
