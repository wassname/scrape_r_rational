## Looking for short story I read

### Post:

There was a world with a stock market that was fully automated and completely incomprehensible to humans, and there were drones that bombed people in patterns incomprehensible to humans, with the stated purpose of eliminating "loomers", the "loom" is treated like a dangerous virus, when really it's just being a normal human being instead of trying to be maximally economically efficient.

  Is that what the Loom is? I've read the story several times and have never really been able to grasp its meaning.

    There is the one line from the immunologist,

    > They still laugh and work and â€” love their daughters. They just care about something different. Reaching other people, instead of reaching that new promotion, that new car.

    but that can't be it. It's too simple. The main character heard that line, yet carried on being so hopelessly confused about what the Loom might be that he's uncertain it exists at all.

    Also, what little we see of the world is far too normal. People behave like normal human beings in a normal human society (besides the AI-run stock market and random drone strikes), not like profit-maximising ants. They love each other, they make art, they rebel. *1984* this isn't.

      I'm actually on the AI's side on this - I assume they have some concept of normal human behavior, and if an expanding subpopulation suddenly stops optimizing for human things and starts optimizing for being in immediate proximity to as many sequential other humans as they can, that's a mite suspicious.

      If a parasite was able to hijack the human brain's reward system, it wouldn't necessarily stop the rest of the brain from doing its best to [rationalize the new behavior.](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/fungus)

      edit: Maybe it's because the drones are really easy to empathize with.

      I think it's more ambiguous. The baselines for what's normal might be skewed. Perhaps they do behave like worker ants, but think that their love for their children is correctly calibrated when really it's much lower than what we'd think of as normal.

      Is it people revolting against the market?

      People going "Hey, why do we let our lives be run by computers? We should do something about it", then realizing that this is the thought that marks them for death by the market.

      I was getting establishment vs anti-establishment vibes for the whole thing.
      ```

        It looks like a big chunk of the protagonist's village is in that category, and unafraid to make it known.

        And again this seems too simple. If drones focused on people who strongly disagree with the AI economy, you'd think their acquaintances would notice. Pretty quickly it'd be common knowledge that Loom = desire for freedom from the AI. It'd be taught in school etc.

        Maybe that *was* true once upon a time, but now the drones have moved on from such low-level thinking and instead kill people whose deaths will ripple into nth-order effects that are good for the market somehow. Or maybe the drones have gone full paperclip-maximiser, optimising for something unintended and worthless.

          a symptom-less memetic threat that justifies immediate and apparently arbitrary eradication seems like great cover for a subtly oppressive system that wants to remove dissidents or inefficiencies.
          ```

    ```
    Mostly the product of my hazy recollection of the story. It's not quite that simple.
    ```
