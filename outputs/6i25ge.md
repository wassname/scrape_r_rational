  Hey all! I'm still getting the next act in order, so in the meantime I tried my hand at writing crack and put up some crossover nonsense on fanfiction.net. Let me know if I should make a career of writing crack instead :P

  Well, I appear to have stumbled on the unholy matrimony of Unsong's weird connections between different things, crackfiction and ecstasy...

    A comparison to Unsong? I'll take it! 

    That reminds me: the sequel to this is called Revenge of the Filler 2: Unsung Crackstacy.

  More random filler nonsense! This time it's a rationalist parody of Worm, which I wasn't sure if I should add to the fanfic website or not since it doesn't actually involve Naruto. 

  Anyway, here it is, enjoy: https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-need-to-become-stronger-naruto-rationalfic.33074/page-6#post-8773524
