    Ha, I just came here to share these links and squee about how happy I am that you're updating again.

    Now I'm going to run away before I'm spoilered, because I could do with rereading from the beginning to remind myself what's going on...

  Eeeeee.

  Also, man. I love the fact that Finale is now getting _spinoffs_.
