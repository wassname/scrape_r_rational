  Look at the error bars! Also, look how the level of the blue column isnâ€™t even the mean of the data.

  Looks like a typical pseudoscience scam to me, especially with the overuse of "frequencies" with no context, "scientifically confirmed" thrown around, and overall style. 

  Could someone link the two studies it's claiming "confirm" it? I couldn't find any citations.

  Edit: In hindsight I'm pretty sure this is a sarcastic post, in which case you got me good
