## [Q][D] Rational definition of "object"

### Post:

Any story that uses magic eventually needs to answer the question 'what is an object?'  As in, 'Shatter destroys an object' and 'Transfiguration turns one object into another'.

I'm running into it a lot in my novel, and I'm tired of trying to patch an answer, so I thought I'd attempt to crowdsource it.  Hopefully, other authors can benefit from the discussion.

Let's start by dealing with the core issue:  yes, the concept of 'object' is an illusion of our perception because quantum mechanics and atoms and physics.  We're looking for a definition that will work to keep story magic consistent, not necessarily one that satisfies Newton, Einstein, and Planck.

Here's some use cases and how I would like them to turn out; can we come up with a definition that works?  If not, which of the cases would need to change?

Example objects:

* An empty cardboard box
* A freestanding wooden door
* A gun
* Some water, cupped in your hand when your hand is in free space
* Anything that you are holding in your hand that is not in contact with anything else

Example not-objects:

* One board in a door
* A door that is mounted in its frame
* Yet another brick in a wall
* Some water, cupped in your hand when your hand is underwater (to the extent that the water is 'in your hand', it's part of the ocean instead of being a discrete object)

The definition I've been using isn't perfect, but it covers most of these cases:

Imagine an infinitely thin sheet of shrinkwrap.  If you want to check whether X is an object, can  the shrinkwrap go completely around X without tearing or penetrating matter?  


If you found the above easy, try the bonus question: define 'wearing'.

  Object-oriented magic needs a definition of object, but not all magic systems are object-oriented. If you're looking for a magic system that stands up to heavy scrutiny, I'd suggest staying away from anything object-oriented.

  With that out of the way, here are a few of the solutions I've used for the "object problem".

  * Objects are defined by what people think constitutes an object. This implies that someone sufficiently psychotic would be capable of affecting different things.
  * Objects are defined by group consensus. If you have the ability to affect "cats", the definition of a cat depends on what everyone in the world would call a cat. Not subject to the lone psychotic problem.
  * Objects are defined by the magic system itself. I've used this for systems where the world itself is an object-oriented simulation; if you break a chair apart into pieces, each piece becomes its own object, but if you go too small they become particle effects instead.
  * Objects are defined by some external agent. Every time you want to check objectness, the external agent takes a look at what you're trying to do and says "yea" or "nay". Indistinguishable from authorial fiat, so isn't great under scrutiny.

    Even better is to make it so that the definition depends on what everyone in the world called a cat at some well-defined point in the past. For example, when a demi-god a thousand years ago first "tamed" magic and made it suitable for human use or something like that.

    This way, magic works as expected even in the event of massive psychosis or near-extinction of sentient beings.

      I mean, not that there's anything inherently *wrong* with a plot that, at some point, involves a widespread plague of madness and/or an extinction event that, incidentally, affects how magic works in ways that are hard for the survivors to predict. Could be interesting.

        You don't have to encode a complete taxonomy into "consensus-based" magic OOP semantics. Just grab all the human brains around at the time, and extract a template neurotypical human from it; and then, when you want to do an OOP identification, simulate a human-instance that was born in that time period and had average learning experiences, and ask that simulated human to create an Interactive Fiction-like object model of the current "scene."

        One of the fun things about this mechanic is that if everyone in some time period believes in the "atomicity" of something like "blood", then you can't ask magic to select out parts of it; but once the compound nature of a thing becomes common knowledge, then magic suddenly gets more scientifically-minded as well.

        An interesting question is how to "pick between" the several multi-level models that co-exist within the human mind: thinking of blood as a liquid, as cells, as proteins, as molecules, as atoms, etc. My suggestion: don't. Instead, presuming the magic system has a "cost" for a spell, present the most "intuitive" model-level of a given phenomenon as the least-costly one to use, and have cost rise exponentially the less intuitive the model-level becomes.

        Also, note that this breaks if transhumans try to use human-derived magic, because they no longer follow the human-template the magic system is using. That's an interesting plot-point. :)

  You're getting too theoretical with the definition of "object". Think about the intuitive, physical sense of the word, and it is about MANIPULATION. We primarily manipulate objects with our HANDS, so naturally, what we consider objects can be easily manipulated with one or both hands. Thus, a car is an object (we could potentially roll it by pushing really hard when it is in neutral) but a building is not an object (unless you're superman.)

  If we alter our method of manipulation from hands to say... multi-tools, or large robot claws, or octopus body-parts, etc. we get at the core issue, in my opinion.

  Screws in a door are objects if you have a screwdriver. A brick in a wall is an object if you have a solvent that dissolves the mortar or a vibratory robot claw. Water underwater is an object if you suck it into your ink pouch and squirt it at your enemy.

  Object-oriented Magic should initially starts off at the "gross motor" level of development in fiction, like a baby able to rake something towards themselves, and then toss it across the room. Then, it can progress to fine motor, like opening up a can of food and shaking it around to make a mess. Then, it can go even further to precision motor skills, like lock-picking or surgery. Or go bigger with progressively heavier object manipulation like weights, cars, buildings, planets, etc.

  Ultimately, individual wave-form/particles can be manipulated if you possess the tenacious mind of HPJEV and his high-fidelity imagination/visualization. (Although in my opinion, he shouldn't be able to do that unless he's scrutinizing it under an electron microscope to even begin getting a handle on it.)

  Consideration from actual physics -

  I remember this demo from physics class, where we took two crystals or glass or something, and you shined a laser through them at an angle, while moving them closer together. At the start, the laser responded as if traveling through both medium changes (air -> glass -> air -> glass -> air), but when you got close enough, the effect the middle air gap disappeared. 

  Similarly, everything's got surface tension. Gas, and solids made up of other solids (dirt) are where it gets interesting.

  Alternative, based entirely on magic -
  Magic uses the user's understanding of "object". Change your understanding, change the effect (although this is difficult). Also does interesting things when the user can't actually properly conceive of the entire thing, like "mountain" or "the earth".

    How would this work in practice when it comes to something like "is this door an object?"

    > surface tension

    Do solids have surface tension? I thought that was only liquids. 

    > user's understanding

    This is certainly the fallback, and it does open up interesting story possibilities. It feels like a copout, though.

      You could say "an object is anything you can separate without breaking atomic bonds". With scale factors to exclude things like van-der-waals forces.

      Then you say "no, THAT door wasn't an object, because it was just nailed together, THIS one is because it's glued" or "of course a conventionally hinged door is an object, but that one isn't because it's rusted shut, whack it a few times THEN teleport it out, dummy".

      That would actually make an interesting magic system that would be well suited to things like mysteries. "Then I realized that the thief couldn't have come through the window because it was painted shut, so it HAD to be the butler...".

        Were the "is" and "isn't" in the rust example supposed to be switched?

        This is interesting. So, that would mean that each board in a door that was nailed together would be a separate object, and a pair of handcuffs would be three or four separate objects. (The jaws of each cuff are held together with pins.) A one-object-target spell couldn't affect "handcuffs", it would have to affect one piece of a handcuff. 

        It would be a consistent definition, although I think it would make for some counterintuitive results until the reader got dialed in. It would also be a power-up for a lot of abilities and a nerf for others. 

        I think I've already locked myself out of this definition in Induction; I wish I'd asked sooner.

          > Were the "is" and "isn't" in the rust example supposed to be switched?

          A hinged door is not part of the frame because the two or three parts of the hinge are separate objects.

          If the door is rusted shut it's not an object, the rust is a bond between the hinge and the frame making the frame (and probably the wall, if it's painted) part of the same object.

          > A one-object-target spell couldn't affect "handcuffs", it would have to affect one piece of a handcuff.

          There's no reason that a spell can't effect multiple objects at a time, you'll just have to understand what the parts are and include them all. Like, those little pins and springs inside a lock.

          > I think it would make for some counterintuitive results until the reader got dialed in.

          That's a bonus. Getting people to figure something like that out helps suck them in to the story.

  (I'd like to remark that the title of this post is not very good. The word "rational" has no business there; a more concrete adjective should be used ("precise" and "useful" come to mind). There is an article by Eliezer somewhere that says something like "every time the word 'rational' is used it loses some of its power". I agree.)

    Read it as "Seeking a definition of 'object' that readers of /r/rational won't find violates their suspension of disbelief" if that works better for you. Since we talk about "rational stories" on here, I think my version is fair, as well as shorter.
