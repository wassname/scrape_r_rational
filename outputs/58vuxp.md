  The pdf and epub versions are now available on [mediafire](https://www.mediafire.com/#og9fdufawqfj7). Apologies for the delay. 

  All feedback is appreciated, as always! This is probably the chapter I edited the most, because it was actually the first one I wrote originally, so things like characterization kept seeming a little off. If you notice anything like that, please do tell me!

  Btw, if anybody could tell me how to make a picture show up next to this post's link on the front page in the same way as some other posts do, I would be much obliged!

    Add this to your page headers ...

    <meta property="og:image" content="[link to image]" />

    Your writing has a very clear voice.  I look forward to seeing how the story progresses.

  Loved what's been written so far. I don't suppose you'd consider making an RSS feed for this? That's how I keep track of stories that aren't on Spacebattles/SV/FF/AO3/etc.
