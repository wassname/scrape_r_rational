## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  The Isle of Talis has long been home to the ancestor-worshipping Celta Tribes, who live in unofficial autonomy under the rule of the Red King across the Eastern Channel. They share the land with the Tuatha, a powerful and cunning magical race kept in check by deals made with humans. The Tuatha usually walk invisible among the humans, but have told stories of how they won the land from the savage Formor and will frequently offer deals to transform humans into beautiful and monstrous shapes. The Tribes have thrived under the protection of the Rangers from monsters and men alike, until invaders came from the north and south to claim it for themselves.

  The Frost Clans hail from the Colossus Archipelago to the north, a chain of islands they believe to be the corpses of ice giants they are descended from, where they are locked in conflict with the Flaming Horde and their Iron Dragons. They came to Talis in search of power left buried by their ancestors, and found the remains of ancient battles in the Celta's sacred sites. The invaders dug up massive skeletons and armories filled with titanic weapons, reanimating them with arcane rituals and riding them into battle. The Celta cried to their distant king for help, only for the refugees to discover he had traded away his life to the Tuatha so his homeland would be kept safe, leaving a son with no schooling in war to lead the kingdom.

  The Frost Clans pushed ever further south, decimating all in their path, and would've continued unabated if not for the Reman Empire. In the name of the Ascended, the man who became a god, they crusade from free humanity from cosmic imprisonment by the Demiurge. They had heard of the Frost Clans campaign and sought to prevent their enemies from surging in strength with their own annexation spearheaded by the Godblood nobility. Despite support from divinity that surrendered to humanity, the Remans did not know the land and could not match the Clans' advance. The two armies finally came to a head at the Battle of Bone Valley, so named for the miracle that happened there.

  The Chief of one of the five Clans led the battle himself, slaughtering hundreds of soldiers with his Crypt Titans and Singer Priests who's words rent the sky itself. The Warchief held a sword of indestructible steel, claimed from a village that had revered it for as long as it's recorded history, but set it down to execute the Reman commander with his bare hands. As the man was brutalized before his wife, she snatched the sword and it suddenly burned with a primordial flame that annihilated the Chief and his guard. The Titans came to retaliate, but fell unlifeless to the ground before the sword. The rest of the army retreated in terror, leaving a fraction of the force that had arrived to claim victory.

  The remaining Chiefs ordered their men and Titans to regroup at the northern fortress of Frost Landing and prepare for a siege, finally giving Talis a reprieve. The land hade been ravaged by war and many villages had sold their humanity to the Tuatha in desperation, the remaining of which had little love for the new Red King and the contingent of Rangers he had finally sent. Under the new leadership of the Lady of the Light, the Remans pulled their remaining forces back to the cities they had claimed while they waiting for reinforcements to take Frost Landing. Among these three powers, the Isle is now torn.

  The child king in the east seeks to preserve his people and restore what they've lost, but he lacks the knowledge or the respect to command them. The warriors in the north seek the glory of uncovering powers long forgotten, but their paranoid leaders think them traitors for not retreating. The lady in the south has had power bestowed upon her not seen since the Ascended himself, but cannot spread the holy word without support from the rival Godbloods and the armies they command. A fragile peace has descended upon Talis, allowing cultures to intermingle and butt heads in the borderlands.

    Did you just mash up Celtic and Scandinavian mythology to background an epic fantasy setting?
    ```

      Yep, that's exactly what I did. I ripped off the Crypt Titans [from an RPG setting](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/137962/Iron-Edda-War-of-Metal-and-Bone) and threw in some [Gnostic](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Gnosticism?from=Main.Gnosticism) Romans with a King Arthur expy. Unfortunately, my creativity has limits so the few names I came up with are *extremely* obvious references.

      - u/None:

        Nice!  So is this meant for storytelling, or for gaming?  The whole thing about all the different races and factions meeting in the borderlands sounds like a perfect setting for a "Your Guys" tabletop game.

  I've been trying to work out some rules for tactile telekinesis (telekinesis, but you need to be touching the thing), namely in how to define it.

  The spell *Mage Hand* allows you to move up to 10 pounds of material up to 30 ft. per 6 seconds, but doesn't have any rules about slowing down as more weight is added, making me think that aside from the weight limit, it's weight invariant. I think that's a sensible way for telekinesis to work in D&D, because it eliminates a lot of math, but in prose fiction or a computer game, I think adding some simplicity that generates complexity might be good.

  For example, "you have the ability to generate 10 newtons of telekinetic force". ```F = ma```, so ```a = F/m```, which means that if mass is ```1 gram``` then acceleration is 10,000 m/s^2 and then I'd have to do some math to figure out how long you could actually apply that force before the mass was out of your reach in order to determine speed.

  I'm having a little trouble making this workable and I'm wondering whether anyone has any bright ideas of how to quantify telekinetic ability in a scalable way, i.e. I want to be able to plug in *x* for telekinetic power and get increasing tiers of power.

  (One of the popular fan theories for Superman is that all of his abilities ultimately descend from tactile telekinesis, and that's sort of what I'm trying to create from base principles, but maybe with some neat unexpected things too. The powers:

  * Superman is invulnerable because he holds his body together with telekinetic power.
  * Superman can catch a plane without punching through its aluminum skin or tearing it apart with mechanical stress because he's applying telekinetic force.
  * Superman can fly because he telekinetically lifts himself.
  * Superman can stop bullets because he uses subconscious telekinesis.
  * Superman can hit people really hard because he puts telekinetic power behind the punch.

  This works less well when you consider things like heat vision, cold breath, etc.)

    Earth acceleration is 9.8 you could round it up to 10 for slightly easier calculation. If object is so heavy that you can't lift it with acceleration faster than 10m/s2 then you can't  lift it. 

    So easiest way to do it is do your a = F/m and for objects with a <10 you can't lift them at all. 

    This could simplify a lot of things. If you have one character with know F you can just created quick excel document and you can just add a mass of any object character tries to move and see if it is more or less than 10. 

    Things will change in situation like under water or moving object horizontally rather than up and down. But should give you some basics from which you can start.
    ```

    The intuition on this is that it should scale similarly to picking things up with your hands (although possibly scaled up if your telekinesis gives you superhuman strength).

    For very small objects like tennis balls or pebbles, the object's mass doesn't really factor into it - you can throw a baseball at about the same speed as a paperclip, even though it's 100 times heavier. With heavy objects, you're limited much more sharply by mass (or possibly weight) - you may be able lift a 40kg weight but not a 45kg one, and "throwing" either of those will probably look more like dropping it.

    With this intuition for telekinesis: very light objects can be thrown at or near a certain maximum speed, and heavy objects are harder and harder to move until you cannot lift them at all (although you can still push them along the ground, if there's not too much friction).

    * You can exert 100 newtons of force, but with an absolute speed cutoff. You can't move anything faster than 10m/s relative to you, except to slow it down.
    * You can exert 100 newtons of force, but with an absolute acceleration cutoff. You can't accelerate anything faster than 100m/s^2 .
    * You can exert 100 newtons of force, but you need to grip the thing you're lifting with an invisible "hand" of TK. This hand masses 1kg, and moves with the thing you're lifting, so you'll need to spend some of your 100 newtons on moving it as well.
    * Same as the above, but your actual physical hand needs to stay touching the thing (tactile telekinesis, remember) so you need to spend some of your 100 newtons, or ordinary muscle power, to move it as well.
    * You can exert 100 newtons of force, but with an absolute power cutoff. You can't transfer kinetic energy into an object faster than 10J, though you may be able to slow it down.
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      Hrm, I think cutoffs for both absolute speed *and* absolute acceleration are probably what I'll end up doing, probably scaling with increases in newtons of force. I'll have to monkey with the numbers a bit to see what gets the sort of "rich" effects that I'm looking for (e.g. raising a hand and stopping a sword that's slicing right toward you, being able to fly, using a stack of quarters like an automatic machine gun).

      The next question would be "speed and acceleration relative to what", but "the ground" or "the user" would probably be the simple answers (that might give weird results).
      ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    You can control 100 spirits which have telekinetic power.  Each one has a (pseudo) mass of 1 kg, and can exert 50N of force.  

    When you attach a spirit to an object, it attempts to move both the object and itself in the direction you want; if you're trying to move a 1g ball bearing, it would require moving the bearing *and the spirit*, resulting in 50 N vs. 1.001 kg.  You can add spirits indefinitely, but that doesn't help much for small objects: 5000 N vs. 100.001 kg isn't much better.

    Spirits also have a very tenuous grasp on the objects.  They do not add any momentum to them from an outside perspective.  

    This also limits you to controlling a maximum of 100 different objects at a time, though that may never come up with normal human multitasking.

    As written, you can shoot something light at ~5g, hover 400 kg, or pull a 25 ton ship at trolling speeds.

    EDIT: as for restricting it to "tactile", the spirits live within you and flow out to any object that you touch, spreading until they find the edges (however they define that) and giving you control over the whole thing.

    Why not just use actual [power][power]? I.e. kinetic energy imparted per unit time. When acceleration is constant:

        telekinetic_power = power
            = kinetic_energy_imparted / application_time
            = affected_mass * velocity_change^2 / 2 / application_time = affected_mass * velocity_change^2 / application_time / 2
            = affected_mass * (applied_acceleration * application_time)^2 / application_time / 2 = affected_mass * applied_acceleration^2 * application_time / 2
            = affected_mass * (applied_force / affected_mass)^2 * application_time / 2 = applied_force^2 * application_time / affected_mass / 2

    [power]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)

    With balance between apllied_force/applied_acceleration and application_time at the user's discretion.

    This, however still allows allows the user to go at full power indefinitely, so you might also want to limit total energy expenditure, possibly via explicit time limit, or energy reservoir size and it's refill rate (which is also power), or vague 'mental fatigue' if you want narrative flexibility.
    ```

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      Unless I'm missing something, the downside of a power limit taken literally is that you can divide by zero or go into the negatives.

      If you have enough power to lift 50 kg at 1 m/s (about the same as a person climbing a ladder), you have enough power to lift 50 000 kg at 0.001 m/s.

      It essentially means that you have a magic brace and gearing/winch system so that you can brace against *any* amount of force.

  So, plenty of media deals with vampire internal politics. (I'm thinking of nWoD in this case.) 

  I'm very interested in some logical and some blue and orange "vampire political factions" for my setting. My vampires are mostly standard, but there are two main differences:

  * c. 1700 CE, vampire population crashed from 20,000 to 800: likely due to a supernatural plague (or targeted genocide?) that was brought on by an unspecified enemy of vampires, who managed to be defeated somehow. (Population in 2000 CE has recovered to 200,000)

  * making a new vampire is an involved process (think battlefield surgery), has a 30-80% success rate depending on circumstances, and an individual vampire can physically only make a new vampire every 10+ years

  Alternatively, ignore the above and put in your own ideas using pulp vampires - it's all good!

  Here's some stolen concepts to give you some ideas, mostly stolen from nWoD - but none are blue and orange:

  * Invictus: Feudal sort of system: importance of seniority, age, rank, and formality

  * Carthian: Democracy, rule for the people

  * Communism of some sort?

  * "Vegetarian" vampires who try not to kill humans

  * Some sort of religious fundamentalists - not sure of what Blue and Orange beliefs we can get from them though

  * Quiverful vampires who want to ensure the vampire population grows / Survivalist vampires who have lots of taboos about doing whatever passed the supernatural plague
  ```

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    What incentive does a vampire have to make another vampire? Companionship? Ideology? Or is there something more concrete to be gained from making one, aside from "because I want to"?

    I wrote a [vampire novelette](http://archiveofourown.org/works/7127255) which has a pretty straightforwardly evil political system, but that comes as a consequence of the rules vampires operate under. As in, given those rules, I think that an evil political system is the natural consequence.

    If you're going for blue/orange morality, I think that you first need a base of "how to be an ethical vampire" to build on, because otherwise you're going to descend too often into blackness.

    I guess to my mind, the big question that you'd want a cleavage along is whether or not it's ethical to make more vampires, given the risks (whatever they are) involved and the lifestyle that a vampire must adopt. So you'd have:

    * a fringe sect which has dedicated themselves to murdering other vampires, because vampires are an evil upon the world and continued existence can only be justified by attempting to dismantle vampirekind, root and stem.
    * a sect that thinks it's ethical for vampires to exist, but that it's totally unethical to create more vampires, even with the consent of whoever is about to be turned.
    * a sect that thinks making new vampires is totally fine, so long as it's done judiciously and humanely.
    * a fringe sect which has dedicated themselves to the promotion of vampirekind and pushing the limits of vampire creation, at least partly motivated by the idea that more vampires in the world puts vampires in a better position.

    But I think first you have to answer the question of what a vampire gets out of making another vampire, which helps define what your vampire population looks like, and thus their politics.
    ```
