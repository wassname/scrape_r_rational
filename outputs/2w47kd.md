  A very nifty feature! Reddit is sadly very bad at being a "depository of stories" due to the way threads work, so its great to have a condensed into one place. Not sure if the community is large enough to sustain such a project (i think others have tried before?) but having a well developed glossary of stories would be very useful.

  Only thing i can say is to maybe have a tagging system? That people can sort between say fanfic and original fic, or rationalist vs. "has rationalist elements", and such.

  looks great. one thing i'm noticing is the large number of singly-rated works in the "highest rated" block, which seems a little sub-optimal; [this guy](http://www.evanmiller.org/how-not-to-sort-by-average-rating.html) suggests using the lower bound of a 95% confidence interval. other than that, everything's working smoothly -- even on my phone, which is apparently an issue for 90% of websites. kudos.

  I have been carefully recording and storing the titles, websites, and whenever possible, offline copies, *the* stories of the best possible genre for a period of several months to just under a year.

  The List is extensive and through. Tomorrow, I am going to sit down in front of my computer and add so many works to your fledgling website.

  This is your last and only chance to make any final requests.

      Okay then, I'll get to it around 8 tonight. Quick question, should I include stories that aren't posted anywhere online, but can be bought through Amazon?

      For example, I have a link to Ted Chiang's stories, but he also has all of the stories in a published book on Amazon, so should I include the website link or only direct people to his Amazon page? The other three works would be Blindsight, Echopraxia, and Accelerando.

      Do you want only fiction for the website, or should I include some good nonfiction books on rationality such as *Thinking, Fast and Slow*?

  A good initiative! I see several favourites on there.

  I'm flattered In Fire Forged made the list, even though I must appear soo dead to people around here by now. I'm sorry about that. It's on a temporary hiatus, which will last at the very most until summer begins, and *hopefully* there will be an update or two before that time.

  If I'd known the future when I started publishing, I might have gone with a much more conservative publishing schedule until everything had been weathered through. Alas, I've proven to be very bad at telling the future.

    Good to hear! I'm really looking forward to it. It's one of those fics I checked for obsessively, like HPMOR and 2YE.

  I now have finished adding all of the stories that I feel belong to RationalReads. The total list of works was at three pages. After I finished, it DOUBLED to six pages. More precisely, 32 books to 60 books. Let's see if people like the stories I included.
