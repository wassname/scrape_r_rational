## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I was wondering what good "Academy" stories are out there not necessarily rational. By academy I mean a group of people join some sort of academy for some amount of years, sometimes with some seasonal events for each year. Examples of the top my head of are [Superpowered](http://www.drewhayesnovels.com/superpowereds) which used to be mostly a web novel and of course, Harry Potter. 

  I had quite liked superpowered and was wondering if what else was out there that has a similar story structure. even a link to a TvTropes page about these kinds of stories with examples would be apriciated.

    [The Name of the Wind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind) is set in a magic academy. It has been years since I read it and the trilogy still isn't complete. The magic system is not rational but it is a fun read.
    ```

    - u/ProfessorPhi:

      As a mild counter, I was not a fan of this book. This book appears to be very divisive, and I have a few complaints, mostly about it's pacing. It's epic in length, but not in scope. It's a single book squeezed into a trilogy, to paraphrase Ebert. Keeps you on the hook about amazing deeds and then spends a whole book on his early teenage years.  
      You'll need a fair bit of patience to enjoy the indulgent story-telling, which I don't think necessarily resonates with this sub. The prose is better than most fics posted here, but not brilliant when compared to most published prose.
      ```

      - u/Dent7777:
        ```
        The KingKilller Chronicle is flawed, I agree. Certain sections remind me a little bit of the Inheritance Cycle, where time passes very slowly in great detail before passing very quickly with significantly less detail.

        You also hit on some of the positives, the quality of the prose and story, the grandiose drama and passionate behavior of each plot point.

        It is the type of story near every fantasy nerd has read, the type people loved in the first reading, recommended to all their friends, then spent the last few years loving to hate online and in person.

        The moment Doors of Stone (putative book 3) is available for pre-order, I think a lot of the hate will dissipate and turn to excitement. The only way you could frame the story as rational would be by claiming Kvothe is really changing the details of the events he is narrating. The high fantasy setting, the complex, powerful, and seemingly unlimited magic shown by various parties, they all make the story both less rational, less believable, and more entertaining.

        I would love to see the world experienced through other perspectives. *The Slow Regard of Silent Things* was so different, so unique, and so rewarding that I would hate to see the universe Rothfuss has created be scrapped after Kvothe finishes his tale.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Sadly, I think the tale will never be finished.  Rothfuss already started another novel set in the universe, but his editor was like "Fuck no.  Finish the damn book."  Rothfuss' response has been to play videogames and sweat over minutia for almost a decade.  I legit think he was too slow, missed out on his most creative 5 years, and now he's not the type of person that can tell that story anymore.  I really, really hope I'm wrong.  But he hasn't published *anything* for five years.
          ```

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        I'll mildly counter that mild counter. On a plot level the books are all over the place and move slowly. Rothfuss is probably the most successful author I know at using beta readers, though, so you'll generally find any given segment to be engaging. I think the prose is actually quite good for the standard of a commercial fantasy novel, the only current fantasy author that I think is a better technical writer is Abercrombie. Agree that it might not be a 100% fit for this sub, but they're worth reading.
        ```

          There's a review linked further down which really expresses my annoyance with the books in a far better way than I could : http://web.archive.org/web/20190422041712/http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-751

          I do think they had the potential to be great, and each section was very engaging. I think for me, it ended up in an uncanny valley, being worse than most literature in terms of prose, while being awfully plodding for a fantasy novel.

        Is it that divisive? You're the first person I've met that didn't like it (or professed to not liking it, at least).
        ```

        - u/ProfessorPhi:
          ```
          I'm definitely not the only one. I remember once looking up reviews after reading it, because I couldn't believe that it was so highly rated and noticed a lot of 1 star ratings. It's not divisive I'm that half loved it and half hated it, it's that you either loved it or hated it, very few lukewarm reviews.
          ```

      - u/Escapement:
        ```
        I liked the first one, but reading the second basically went back and retroactively made any enjoyment negative; not only was it bad, it made my previous experience of liking the first unrepeatable, such that I can't reread it.

        [this review had a lot of the same problems I had with the book](http://web.archive.org/web/20190422041712/http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-751)
        ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        To +1 the dissent's dissent, IMO Rothfuss has probably the best prose out of modern fantasy, or at most is second to Guy Gavriel Kay.

        This is a very YMMV judgement of course.
        ```

        - u/ProfessorPhi:
          ```
          His prose is good, but it feels wasted. It was interesting to see how much we can forgive mediocre writing when the plot keeps our attention, but rothfuss was a great example of how meandering plot and poor pacing can only forgive good writing so much.

          It's no Ulysses, but it's slower moving than east of Eden.

    [Heretical Edge](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HereticalEdge) is superpowers-in-a-school-setting - this one I think could be considered rational

    [Metaworld Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14167/metaworld-chronicles?reviews=2) is magic with a school setting, later university, this one kind of rational-ish
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I'll second Metaworld Chronicles as a tasty junk-food, Isekai story with rational elements. The school setting isn't heavily present—it serves more as a plot device to launch the characters out into the world, the world-building is that of humanity being repressed by a slew of different types of fantasy monsters that control entire swathes of continents, also: alternative history. 

      The first forty chapters have been edited and are being sold on amazon for a paltry price, which I recommend reading instead of the royalroad chapters since there's typos and the author's still learning how to write. 

      The author is well read and references famous literature/films. The author doesn't deconstruct tropes or satirize anything, it's predictable, but it's as good as anything if you're looking for something to binge.
      ```

    - u/Lightwavers:
      ```
      I’ll de-rec both of these. Metaworld is worse even than Randidly Ghosthound, which is saying something. Readable in short doses, but taken as a whole it’s just bad but fun nonsense. Heretical Edge *might* have some sort of big overarching explanation for the multitudes of plot holes looming over the premise, but I dropped it before that point. The protagonist never questions the major plot holes, even to herself. This is offset slightly by the story actually being competently written, but it’s not at all rational.
      ```

      - u/jaghataikhan:
        ```
        yeah, for Metaworld, I'm good with the reincarnation, the isekai, even the super special snowflake power, but it got way too much power fantasy for my taste after a while. I gave it to Ch 50 - 60 ish, so perhaps it gets a lot better down the line, but it hadn't grabbed me by that point

            - u/Amonwilde:
              ```
              Some people like book five. Some people even like the whole series up until the end. But, in my opinion, it gets worse every book after 4.

              The first three books shouldn't really be read as straight fantasy. They're a little more in a fairy tale genre. You're not really intended to think of the Dursleys as abusers any more than you're supposed to think of the evil stepsisters in Cinderella as abusers. I mean, you can use that lens, and it applies, but its not the lens that the stories themselves assume you'll apply. Same with the ridiculously unsafe castle (they get sent to a deathtrap forest for detention, for example) and the somewhat fairy-tale last act to the first book. Starting with book 4 there's a bit of a genre transition to straight fantasy, the books become much longer and they lose the fairy tale quality.

              Also, was just kidding, life is short and there's no shame in choosing not to read something. But good that you started the series!

              I havent read canon in a long time but as a kid i remember thinking books 5-7 were the best. After reading hpmor it opened my eyes to how illogical they were. If i were you id read canon, all of canon, first then hpmor because hpmor builds off and references some characters and plot in canon. 

              It is not essential however and if you are time limited id invest the time reading some other fantastic fanfiction like anything nonjon has written (Yudkowski gets the name david monroe from "a black comedy" which i recommend even higher than hpmor for sheer entertainment value) and "harry the hufflepuff" featuring a harry that had been called lazy more than a freak and tries to live up to his reputation.

          Meh. I wouldn't read HP as an adult, unless you feel like you're missing out on the background for some shared memes or something. Books 1-3 are incredibly predictable and thus boring, and the characters are really not that interesting. Not even because they're children - His Dark Materials pulls it off much better. They're just... very basic archetypes 'brought together' by 'friendship' yada yada.

    [Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game) is about a boy who is groomed from childhood to become Earth's premier general, who will once and for all beat the aliens who almost destroyed humanity. Not strictly rational, but pretty popular around here.

  I posted this just before in last week's recommendations:

  If there was a isekai version of Dungeon Engineer with an intellectual and rational protagonist, check out [Second Life as the Sister of a Goddess](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26977/second-life-as-the-sister-of-a-goddess).

  The MC was a 60-something year old fitness instructor before being reincarnated as a non-human (avoiding spoilers) baby. Instead of engineering and terrariums we get neuroscience and developmental biology, along with magic and mythology.

  The story is extremely well written so far, however the pacing is somewhat slow, with occasionally multiple PoVs of the same events. I do think it's slow because I'm comparing it to other isekai stories that skim through early life, and it would be better enjoyed with an open mind.

      I would just like to point out that it's mentioned that the reason Earth doesn't have any magic at all is because a god managed to gain power beyond all other existing gods and sealed Earth off from access to magic. It's implied that the most well known gods are also the most powerful and what god is more well known than the Christian god?

      There is some weak evidence that her god is real.

          On the other hand, the isolation between dimensions isn’t absolute, since she herself managed to cross from one to another as a mere mortal. So it’d be reasonable for her to assume at least likelyhood of her former god keeping tabs on her and punishing / rewarding her based on her actions in the new dimension. “Commandments jurisdiction outside of the default dimension” sort of thing.

          Though reading a story with such a premise and such a protagonist likely wouldn’t be for me as well.
          ```

  - u/ElGuien:

    Thanks for recommending this. I agree the pacing is slow, but it was still very readable. The refreshing thing for me is that the author has a concept, establishes rules and runs with it, even when that is at the expense of what authors would ordinarily do or "good writing." A story that is well fit for /r/rational I think.

    An example was that at one point [the author] justifies the magic system using some logic which is sort of almost reasonable. This was actually negative to my suspension of disbelief - the argument was not enough to *actually* be reasonable (of course), but enough to engage my instinct to evaluate things rather than just treating it as technobabble like most stories do. That is certainly something I'll forgive though. As light entertainment goes, you could do worse.

    Maybe something for authors to remember: don't try to justify why your built world is the way it is. Just say "them's the rules" and then have the in-world characters introduce their theories (or not) as appropriate. Having an argument as to why your world is a certain way is not necessary: the real world certainly doesn't.

  I'm going to second the rec someone made for [Message In A Bottle](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/continue/368986). (I want to say it was in a monday recommendation thread, but I can't seem to find it to credit whoever gave the recommendation.)

  Excellent first contact/sci-fi fic that just so happens to feature ponies. Though I only found the first 300k words worth reading, as after that the proper plot is concluded and it moves on to side stories.

  Also, as far as current season anime go, I recommend:

  * Vinland saga (reading the manga beforehand just made it even more hype.)
  * Cop Craft. (Fish out of water story that's also a buddy cop show+fantasy.)

  Some old favorites have updated!

  [Changeling Space Program](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/327551/changeling-space-program) is a My Little Pony story about the changelings in a space race against the other species to be the first ones to reach the moon. There is a sequel crossover with the Martian, [The Maretian](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/396744/the-maretian), which is about the Equestrian crew crash landing on Mars and sharing in Mark's challenges and woes. Heavy on the sciencing one's way into space with some political drama/comedy.

  [Break Them All](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/break-them-all-original-precross.12960/) is about exploring what happens when modern science is applied to a magic system which resembles magic used in stories like Harry Potter and similar systems with quirks like gold being hard to conjure, old artifacts/spells are stronger than modern day magic, and other fairy tale like qualities. Fairly slice of life while exploring magical consequences.

  The sixth book in a series I follow, [Nightlord](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074CGH284?ref_=dbs_r_series&storeType=ebooks), has just came out. It's about a guy who gets turned into a vampire and then tossed into another world with magic set in a medieval era where he spends time wandering around as a hero before sorta accidentally-on-purpose becoming the king of a newly founded kingdom.

  Despite the cliche wish fulfillment sounding summary, he acts very much like someone from this community where he spends time investigating his powers as a vampire and as a wizard (plus the magic to cross alternate worlds), puts serious thought into the ethics of a modern person as a king in a dark ages society, and has genuine relationships with one woman at a time instead of the standard harem.

  One issue that might put off readers is that the books are very long and the plot...sort of meanders around a little. Very often the protagonist sets out to do one thing in a subplot and ends up starting another entirely different subplot. The story always gets back to the old plots, but it's evocative of real life where events are messy and don't ever have a neat, self-contained arc or episode. I liked it, but I know it's not to  everyone's taste. The books are also very long. As in each book is as long as a trilogy for any other series. A short one, but still.

  Preorders for [Uncrowned](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8ZH6BS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is now out for anyone who is a fan of the Cradle series.

  I would like to recommend Lazy Dungeon Master. I stumbled upon the [manga](https://mangadex.org/chapter/448527/10) last week, and while there are only ten chapters, I liked it so much I started reading the [light novel](http://zirusmusings.com/ldm-toc/). Manga ends at chapter 32.

  It's about a guy who gets summoned to another world to be a ~~hero~~ dungeon master. Ie, to work for the other side. It's not rationalist, but he does get creative in fun ways with abusing the systems. For one thing he plays around with a "Create Golem" skill to create lots of different kinds of machines nobody else can replicate. When chosen to be Issekai'd he also gets the power to understand all languages, which is only moderately useful... Until he realizes that incantations for spells are just commands issued in a long dead language... Which he can now speak...

  That said, he's not very ambitious, so he mostly uses his powers to protect/upgrade his dungeon and live in luxury. Still, it's entertaining.

    I second this; one of the only translated isekais that isn't dead i am keeping up with. It doesn't take itself seriously but its rational imo, the humor is good and although like all jap isekais there is technically a harem and loli elements, it doesn't impact the story negatively like most do.

    You might enjoy [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/) which somewhat resembles your description. It's a \[Sailor Moon / Dungeon Keeper\] fanfic (what are those? no idea. who cares.), extremely long, and, I think, becomes very good in terms of plot, writing, and novelty (skimming the first \~10% is possible).

    Anyway, thanks for the recommendation.

  Repping a manga I saw trolling the last few weeks' archive: [Battle in 5 Seconds after meeting](https://myanimelist.net/manga/102690/Deatte_5-byou_de_Battle)

   It falls into a genre I've taken to calling "power battler", whose qualities are:

  1. Characters have various special/unique abilities or powers, usually supernatural

  2. Conflict in the plot is solved by the application of powers or their loopholes

  3. Downtime in the plot involves theorycrafting on power strengths and weaknesses, and trying to forge alliances with powers that complement one's own or exploit a weakness in the enemys' powers.

  Examples: [Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors](https://mangakakalot.com/manga/be919195), [Luminosity](http://luminous.elcenia.com/) (and possibly Glowfic, though I haven't gotten much into it), [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) (Superhero stories lend themselves to this)

  If anyone has any manga/story recs in this, please tell.

    Gah, I know some anime/manga for this, but I feel like I'm blanking on at least a few more.

    Wouldn't call any of these rational (or honestly, even normally recommend any but the first). But I'm a fan of battle royale death matches so here we go.

    You've read the other works of Wildbow, right? Pact especially should come pretty close, even though the special abilities are a lot looser here than in Worm.

    [Drifters](https://myanimelist.net/manga/13801/Drifters): By the creator of Hellsing, historical figures isekai-ed to fight off *another* group of isekai-ed historical figures but one with superpower. Manic laughters ensues.

    [World Trigger](https://myanimelist.net/manga/48151/World_Trigger): Pretty well-defined magic system, with the battles being very tactical with emphasis on maneuver, weapon choice and coordination.

  I highly recommend this completed fic [The Scientist](https://archiveofourown.org/series/365588), the first two in the series. It's one of the very few fanfics in Undertale that doesn't follow the protagonist in the game.

  I believe the cover summary describes this far better than I can:

  >Monsters have been sealed underground after the war with humanity. The new Royal Scientist, Dr. W.D. Gaster, thinks he can do something about it.

  >Follows the life and eventual downfall of the man who speaks in hands.

  In other news, holy shit there's so much porn on AoO. I filter out obvious red flags like rape, paedophilia, and sex and tens of thousands of stories gets cut down to a few hundred at most.

  There's a few nuggets of gold like the ones I linked above but the mountain of shit I have to dig through is frightening.

  I'm not looking for a specific book. I'm looking for a better way to search for books to read.

  I have a list of books I like and have rated, both on amazon and on Goodreads. What I want is a good recommendation engine that can take a look at all of those books and spit out similar books that I might like.

  Amazon supposedly does this. But it cheats, and the way it cheats makes the recommendations really shitty. Instead of looking at all my books, it just looks at the most recently read books. And then it only looks at one book at a time. Which is fine as a recommendation engine if I want more stuff in the same series (stupidly easy to find), stuff by the same author (also very easy to find on my own), or some vaguely similar new releases on kindle unlimited (hard to find, but very hit or miss in terms of quality).

  List of things I want from a recommendation engine:

  1. Take into account my past reading.
  2. Allow me to filter down the list and remove items I have decided not to read (Amazon doesn't seem to let me remove recommendations which is frustrating as hell).
  3. Not have any strong biases that I don't care about (amazon will recommend new stuff over old stuff 9 times out of 10, but I have no such preference).

    http://rationalreads.com/ supposedly does this, but the database of works isn’t really big enough to tell.

    https://www.fimfiction.net/ has a ton of extremely useful recommendation features, such as also liked and related boxes if you scroll down from a story, a powerful and easy to use search function, and a clean, intuitive interface. I wish it accepted more than just MLP fics.

    https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/100705.Rational_Fiction has a hundred and twenty-five books recommended by the rational community. If you haven’t checked it out, you should do so.

    https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/best-rated is hit or miss, but if you haven’t at least skimmed the list you might be missing something you like. It has stories like Threadbare, Mother of Learning, and Delve, but the first page of this list also has awful works like Azarinth Healer and Metaworld Chronicles.

    Unfortunately I don't think anything like this exists. Sites which provide recommendations are generally incredibly bad at it. I think this is mainly because they assume "good recommendation == work similar to what the user has read before in some way." I don't see any reason to believe that in general, although you can get some kind of results that way. I suspect those results are worse in practice than uniform random sampling weighted by popularity though [allowing users to pick filters to limit the set of works considered and obviously removing things they have already read + things they have marked as not interested]. Companies who definitely have the technical capability to do better than the current situation typically don't have any incentive to.

    An example of how I might approach attempting to do better than random (not as easy as it sounds!) would be:

    1. Get the entirety of the posts & comments on /r/rational and extract user->recommendation pairs from the posts
    2. Apply something like PageRank to build a map of the works which are most recommended
    3. Recursively add works to the map by seeing what /r/rational users recommend elsewhere and also by finding users who recommend the same works in other subreddits and seeing what else they recommend
    4. You then have a starting point for "works which are likely to be relevant to /r/rational users". It's almost certainly the case that you would have read almost all of the top suggestions; this is good as it allows you to immediately rate them. I personally would probably use 3 options for rating read works: "high quality," "guilty pleasure/readable but nothing special" and "bad." Also as you suggest "won't read" for works you haven't read.
    5. Based on the ratings, weight the contributions of individual users to build a map which is directly relevant to you. Possibly also show which users have a good track record so you can pay attention to future recommendations from them.

    Although I can't prove it without actually doing this, I feel like this would be very obviously better than any other recommendation system currently out there. Conceptually, to sort things based on "generalised word of mouth". I have some confidence that this would work given how huge an improvement google search was over anything else when they first started up and the main thing they did differently was use PageRank.
