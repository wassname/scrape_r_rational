## Classifying Rational Fiction

### Post:

Hey everyone, I had a random thought, kind of curious what you guys think about this.

Say you were in a bookstore and looking for something fun to read. You come across a bunch of rational fiction stories that you've never read and decide to give one a try. Do you think you'd find all these stories on the same bookshelf, under the tag "rational fiction," or scattered around the store in different sections?

Specifically, do you see rational fiction a form of "genre fiction" or as an element present in many genres? 

Wikipedia has a pretty good definition of genre fiction: 

>Genre fiction, also known as popular fiction, is a term used in the book-trade for fictional works written with the intent of fitting into a specific literary genre, in order to appeal to readers and fans already familiar with that genre.

Traditionally published genre fiction tends to have tropes specific to that genre. Murder mysteries usually drop a body in the first chapter. Romance novels end with happily ever after. Fantasy has a significant amount of world building with longer word counts, while young adult fiction must be shorter and feature a protagonist in their teens.

Since genre fiction is written primarily for entertainment purposes, and readers are creatures of habit, writers tend to follow these tropes in their fiction to be more marketable. You can find some stories that bend the rules and some that don't follow them entirely (read: literary fiction) but by and large genre fiction isn't trying to reinvent the wheel.

Genre fiction is different from a story having *elements* of a genre. For example, a story can feature romance as a side plot, but have the characters die in the end. A story can feature fantasy elements (elves, werewolves) but follow the tropes for a young adult fiction novel. I would say most genres can blend with other genres, sometimes to the point they create a new form of genre fiction. "Steampunk" is an example of fantasy and sci-fi blended with historical fiction set in the Victorian era.

So, do you think rational fiction is its own form of genre fiction? Does it have tropes specific to the genre that readers expect when they pick up a story to read it? Could it have its own section in a bookstore that would be distinct and unique from other genres?

Or is rational fiction a quality that lots of stories from many genres can have? Is "rational" a flavoring you could sprinkle into fantasy, sci-fi, crime, romance, historical fiction and horror, blending with their tropes to create something new?

It could be both, of course. But which do you think best describes the work on this sub, or what do you see rational fiction to be?

  I'd say rational fiction is an element you can drop into any genre. As long as your world and characters are as realistic and consistent as possible, it can be an element of any genre of story and doesn't necessarily need to be the main focus of the plot. That being said, i'd say the genre fiction form of rational fiction is **rationalist** fiction, where the focus is much heavier on characters being rational and thinking and reasoning their way forward.

    IMHO rationalist fiction is almost always sci-fi or fantasy.

      Kind of feel that way, too. My pet theory is that it's almost impossible to do the kind of story this sub enjoys without the author being able to scale reality as they see fit.

        its not about this sub, its inherent in the definition of rationalism.

        If a hero/villain is a rationalist he will apply the most optimal way of thinking to a problem (science) and the most practical solution (technology). This destroys most genres, or turn them into sci-fi, in all but name.

        The only way to stop a rationalist protagonist from just wrecking your plot with logic, science and technology, is to make the setting explicitly run on irrational principles...which is the definition of magic, and thus, fantasy.
        ```

          Except magic isn't irrational.  It's just a weird part of the story's natural world, which doesn't happen to exist in our world.

          There's nothing logic or science-defying about 'say the words and a thing happens', even if it's somewhat more opaque by what fundamental mechanism they're happening you can still track how they're happening and in what way and use the information you gained to do other things.

          Magic and science aren't opposites, magic is just strange rules we haven't figured out yet.
          ```

          - u/ramjet_oddity:
            ```
            But in many worlds, magic is explicitly soft and not supposed to be able to turn your run-of-the-mill Medieval European fantasy into an unrecognizable post-scarcity whatever.

  Rational fiction is a standard that can be applied to any genre.

  Rational*ist* fiction is a genre, to me.

  I agree that rational fiction can work well with other genres, and I'd love to read a variety of stories with rational characters. However, let me play devil's advocate. I would say *in this sub* we seem to have enough common themes and tropes to form a basic genre pattern:

  \--Serialized fiction (long word count)

  \--action/adventure

  \--set in the future or a fantasy world

  \--main character has a high IQ, usually male or masculine traits, teen or young adult

  \--uses their intellect to solve problems and drive the plot forward

  \--plot is constructed to reward the reader's thinking (clues, foreshadowing)

  \--MC struggles with anger or feelings of inadequacy

  \--munchkinry and quests for dominance/power are common

  \--hero must succeed on their own power or intellect

  \--when romance, harems

  \--kids show fanfic but smart

  \--common elements: tech, AI, superpowers, video games, transhumanism

  It might be fair to say that rational fiction is a subgenre of the action/adventure story, while still being something distinctly different. The pace of action in the story and its tension is less important than the internal consistency of character actions. If the city is about to be destroyed, it's not just because the Big Bad is being evil, it's because he wants something and destroying the city is the best way to get it. Instead of racing against the clock to stop his plans with an epic car chase that leads to things blowing up, we get a clever use of manipulation to trick the enemy (which might lead to something blowing up).

  Regardless, it's rare to see a rational fic on reddit that follows non action/adventure tropes. You'll find scifi and fantasy, but not historical fiction, romance, horror, urban fantasy, suspense, slice of life or young adult. Rational fic in these categories is great, but it doesn't fit the sub's preferred genre, so it's less popular and not recommended as often.

  I'd love to see anyone provide a counterpoint to this argument, as you might not see the same trends I do. Still, though, it's hard to ignore the patterns in reddit's preferences for rational fiction.

    > --Serialized fiction (long word count)

    That's not really true. We've had plenty of not excessively long rational fiction. Especially if you count fanfic, but even if you don't.

    >--when romance, harems

    This one I've only seen a handful of times personally. I'm pretty sure I've read more monogamous romantic rational fiction on this subreddit than anything that comes to the level of a harem forming around one protagonist.

    All that said, one can write both rational and rationalist fiction while leaving away the majority of the tropes you enumerated. It just so happens that this community (including our talented amateur writers) were often fans of a certain number of genres before they even discovered this whole "rational fiction" thing. But you can do a lot with just points 5, 6, 9, and the first half of 4.

    While true I don't think it's exactly fair for most of the examples. If you make a rational character in a somewhat IRL setting many people will call it a mary sue, self inflating, masturbatory..

    Horror and suspense can't be easily ported over without a lot of changes and work to make it compatible. Rational actors don't put themselves in those situations and if they do they will likely just fix it somehow or die while doing the smart thing which is very unrewarding for the audience.

    &#x200B;

    Controversially urban fantasy is just an unimaginative, lazy version of fantasy. Which is often used in YA and other shorter stories for easier worldbuilding so the author can keep word count low and focus on other things like romance triangles.

    This tickled my funny bone, but I think you meant *transhumanism*.
    ```

- u/ketura:
  ```
  I personally don't think so, no. There's nothing stopping a book from being a rational romance, or a rational mystery, or rational sci-fi or rational fantasy. It's a standard of consistency, that the work basically meets some bare minimum of systemic structure within its worldbuilding and plot.

  Hrm.

  So, I've noticed that most genres will be about certain elements in a story above all others. 

  Milieu: the genres about setting, like Sci-fi and Fantasy. These are about the world the story takes place in and the rules and conventions of this world, more than the characters and what they do.

  Idea: Or thematic genres. This is where the focus of the genre is on the ideas that it tries to convey over anything else. Some sci-fi fits in this (esp. old stories like the Foundation series) but also a lot of stories and books about politics, economics and heavier topics. I think this is where Rationalist fiction would fall, since it's less about the characters and setting and more about exploring the ideas and rational behind the story.

  Character: There are some genres that put most of their focus on the characters and their interactions. This is the autobiography, and the genres that have a narrow focus, like thrillers. 

  Events:  Some genres are driven by the progression of events in the story over the characters, or ideas presented. This is mostly for the Action and Adventure genres, where the character could be anyone as long as they go through the right hoops. 

  &#x200B;

  It's a really rough pattern, and it's also nearly 4am, but... yeah. Genre isn't the most well-defined thing out there, and is usually more for the convenience of the reader (and the marketing team). They're really just a way certain elements within a story are treated.

  I think most genres have one major focus, and the other storytelling elements tend to be weaker for it, which is fine. It means that you could take any story and replace the setting with a fantasy or sci-fi world. Or you could turn any novel into a rationalist one by having the characters and narrative spend more time deconstructing the events happening within it.

    Exactly, stories scratch an itch. Genres are the types of itches people most often like being scratched clumped together.
    ```

  ```
  A parallel question: Aesop's Fables, Wind in the Willows, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and My Little Pony are all 'furry' stories. Is 'furry' a genre? It depends on why you're bothering to split stories into various genres. For example, booksellers or streaming movie providers want to advertise similar stories to entice their customers to buy more, which may or may not match the categories of somebody adding tag-clouds to their downloaded ebooks.
