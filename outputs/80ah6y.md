  Bard wins again

  Fuck

    ```
    The longer the story goes on, the more I look forward to the moment when the Wandering Bard gets her equivalent of the treatment Ubua got at the end of Book 2. When her plans finally fall apart in such a way as to have genuine consequences for her that she can't just laugh off.
    ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      Agreed.

      (Though there's always been a sense that her own existence might be its own form of bitter consequence)
      ```

      - u/IDKWhoitis:
        ```
        Her existence is how she avoids the metaphorical debt she has piled on. If anything, she's been dining and dashing. The scales always get their due.
        ```

        - u/Oaden:
          ```
          Its been suggested her very existence is the forces of good getting their due. A repayment for the time Evil went to far. 

          On a personal level, her life kind of sucks , she is the bard, nothing more than that. She exists only to serve a band of heroes.
          ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    It's like reading the Migration arc of Worm all over again, seeing characters make *just enough* wrong choices instead of thinking things over.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Also, Bard made me realize why people see Simurgh as unnecessarily hammy: she has background music!
      ```

  - u/cyberdsaiyan:
    ```
    I think it was pretty much a win-win situation for bard though.

    If the weapon stays, it's hero bait, just like black said. More heroes = more opportunities for bard to influence the narrative.

    The weapon getting destroyed by Black means he's lost Malicia's trust and could end up with him either getting killed or going rogue or something else unpredictable, but in most cases his power and influence is reduced.

    In terms of overall victory I feel like this is a lesser win for the bard, but in terms of crushing black it's certainly an overwhelming victory.
    ```

- u/IgonnaBe3:
  ```
  I think i agree with black on this one. The mass death weapon hanging there would be too much of a bait for the narrative to not do something with. Its a classic old villains move and i dont think MAD will stop the heavens from going at it.
  ```

  - u/NotACauldronAgent:
    ```
    IMO, it would work for a decade at most, before a plucky hero of the stealth type stabbed it, or a magic type makes a counter, or etc. A super weapon is until it isn’t.

  ```
  >Convince me that Callow shouldn’t open the godsdamned Vales to the Principate

  I am honesty not convinced this isn’t the best strategy here? I mean, I’m biased, as I’m unironically rooting for the Principate, but higher taxes and less genocide seems like a good deal. And the whole ‘a fresh new principate’ bit I feel is weak because the prinicipates are not a homogenous culture. If Callow can have separate cultures to the extent it did, despite decades (centuries?) of the unifying force of a common enemy, I think the principates of new Procer could maintain a lot of their identity.
  ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    Yeah, this was a really good idea shot down for flimsy reasons. You don't really lose that much here. Oh no, you become a vassal state! Well, sure, but the average Callowan isn't going to care about sovereignty over the protection of the Principate, especially given what just happened.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      Wait, we become a voluntary vassal state of a nation we choose after decades of being an *involuntary* vassal state of a nation we didn't?

      Yeah, I don't see the problem here either.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Oh, we may lose our identity to these protector because the invading forces killed our nobility to make it easier to us be lose or identity to them easier ? such a hard decision, Had I been cat I would have to think about it after repeatedly stabbing Malicia surrogate body.
        ```

    - u/haiku_fornification:
      ```
      I mean, this is assuming that Praes won't employ a "burn it all down" policy as soon as Callow breaks away. Praes still has Legions, Warlock and a whole host of potentially devastating rituals. In comparison, Callow has no real army, a lot of Cat's power base has strong ties to the Empire and it's occupied by enemy forces.

      So in theory it might be the right move but in practice Praes would make a graveyard out of Callow before the crusade arrived. That wasn't stated in the text but I assume there is always an undercurrent of "or else" in any deals Cat makes with Malicia. They are the bad guys after all.
      ```

      - u/um_m:
        ```
        Yeah, it is mentioned in the four-way crossing too. Good point, I had forgotten about this.
        ```

      - u/NotACauldronAgent:
        ```
        As I pointed out below, that's not so clear-cut. The Legions, as pointed out in-chapter, may not be so willing to take orders from The Tower, especially if Cat promises the High Lord's heads on a pike. Warlock is a big threat, but Augar, plus Cat's mobility, Hierophant, and Archer mean the threat is reduced somewhat. And rituals are the same deal. 

        This is, of course, dependant on good cooperation with Procer, but Cordelia seems reasonable enough. I'd love a Malicia/Amadeus relationship between Cordelia and Cat, for instance.
        ```

    - u/Anderkent:
      ```
      The main argument is that Principate is not going to protect Callow; it will leverage it as a land buffer in which to have wars with Procer
      ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    Well, you see, the Principate are a bunch of meanies because they're fighting against the people who assassinated their way into causing them a civil war.

    The pricks.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      THE AUDACITY!
      ```

  - u/sickening_sprawl:
    ```
    Yeah. "You will become a vassal of Procer! You will be reduced to little more than a provincial government and weak regional tradition!"

    You mean, uh, exactly what is happening right now under Callow?
    ```

  - u/LordGoldenroot:
    ```
    I think the biggest issue is the fact that doing so would cause callow to have a neigh unfixable war problem. As of now cat thinks she can at least keep callow relatively at peace given enough time but under the procer that would not be possible due to two things. First is that procer is always either in a civil war or on the verge of one which means that callow would almost certainly be drawn into more conflicts. Invasions by praes would also start up again which she really wants to avoid. Combine these with the fact that it has been said that it would take generations for callow to recover from procer invading and you get a future where callow is basically stuck in a hole as a poverty stricken nation unless something really unexpected happens.
    ```

    - u/TheEngineer923:
      ```
      Precisely. Take note Catherine's nature now is one who won't be subjugated. Her Fae title and Name refuses to be ruled (her entire schtick is "we do not kneel").

       Look at the map of Calernia. Everytime Procer takes arms against The Empire they undoubtedly came through the Red Vales and met the Empire on Callowan ground and the large majority of the casualties in that exchange were always Callowans, a population notorious for their grudges. 

      There is no way she or her people can accept Callow being ruled by the First Prince as a vassal state. So peaceful integration is not a viable solution because as you said yourself, the Principate is notorious for it's civil wars.
      ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    Even more than that; it's not as if Procer hasn't occupied Callow in the past.  Once the crusade is over, it stops being about Good vs Evil, and then nothing prevents new heroes like the Lone Swordsmen from rising up and kicking Procer out.  Malicia's only real objection was that there's no longer any nobles left, but that is a temporary state of affairs, especially considering that ruling Callow generally grants you a Name.

  >Swan Song

  >a person's final public performance or professional activity before retirement.

  This is Black's swan song, destroying the array before ceasing to be Malicia's Black Knight. The fallout for this will be... interesting.

  >Queenship would be granted to me by the Tower, by Name and by right. But not like the rulers of the Old Kingdom, no. Mine would not be so pristine a reign. **If I was to be queen, it would be a queen cloaked in black with hands bloodied red.**

  It's almost certain that Cat's new Name will be Black Queen (or similar), here. There's far too many obvious things pointing to it.

    > It's almost certain that Cat's new Name will be Black Queen (or similar), here. There's far too many obvious things pointing to it. 

    It *was* going to be that, before Black just blew it up.

    - u/panchoadrenalina:
      ```
      The naming of cat had little to do with the weapon itself.the tower needs cat to handle callow. The name comes from that and is true still
      ```

      - u/paradoxinclination:
        ```
        Cat did outright state that she would gain her kingdom "by Name and by right," but that can only happen as long as Malicia has a reason to grant her that kingdom. With the weapon destroyed, Cat doesn't have the bargaining chip required to force Malicia to hand over Callow, which likely means no transition for her. More likely in my opinion is that she's going to kill Black and finally become the Black Knight in true villain tradition, stepping over the corpse of her predecessor.
        ```

        - u/werafdsaew:
          ```
          Cat's bargaining chip wasn't the super weapon; it was sticking with the tower and not siding with Procer in the crusades.
          ```

          - u/paradoxinclination:
            ```
            I don't think that was the case. Cat pretty much gave up on that once Malcia convinced her that Procer would essentially destroy Callowan culture even more thoroughly than Praes would. The bargaining only began after Cat tacitly agreed to allow the superweapon to continue existing.

            >“I will require Liesse to be under direct Imperial control,” Malicia said, and it tasted like triumph.

            That was her biggest piece of leverage by far, and it's just gone now.
            ```

            - u/werafdsaew:
              ```
              But loosing the super weapon and the break between the Empress and Black Knight also strengthens Cat's bargaining position, as there's no avoiding the crusade, and the Empress cannot afford to antagonize her.
              ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    She's not fully villainous, and not fully heroic.

    I'm all for ditching "Grey" stuff, but if she is to be a queen...

    ...then she shall be a **Red Queen**.
    ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      I wonder which races (compittition) that will put Cat in.  Most of my guesses are horrifying.
      ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        Holy crap, someone caught the subtle reference.

        She's in a race with *all the other heroes and villains*, as are they.  She's just trying to keep herself and her home in a good position, but she's going to have to struggle as hard as she can.
        ```

- u/HallowedThoughts:
  ```
  It strikes me how appropriate Bard is for Cat's nemesis. Bard is a Hero, possibly one of the greatest, but she's definitely not a hero. She's essentially impervious to direct conflict and instead uses more subtle manipulation, something that has typically been Cat's weakness. Even though Cat's shown herself to be good at twisting narratives, Bard's the master at it. Can't wait to see these two duke it out later on
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Yeah I think she realized it when she told black that Akua was not really her rival.

  Well, on the plus side...... uh?

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    Holding onto the weapon, and by extension the mass of souls powering it probably makes a permanent enemy out of the Deoraithe. With it destroyed and the sould freed they might be a viable alliance moving forward, or it might even draw them closer in.

    Not necessarily a good trade, especially if this interferes with the Watch's power, but it's better than nothing.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      Holding onto it makes an enemy of *every other nation on the planet*.

      Malicia is thinking small, seeking to divide and conquer and slowly whittle down nations cowering in fear.

      Instead, most of the others would simply prepare their forces for a massive simultaneous onslaught to destroy the Gate-making Superweapon and the Empire that spawned it.
      ```

      - u/ricree:
        ```
        Her fear is that she is already an enemy of everyone on the continent, or at least enough that the difference didn't matter. What she's hoping for here is mutually assured destruction writ asymmetrical. The others have enough conventional forces at the ready to Savage the empire, if not defeat it, but in doing so they would spell their own destruction at it's hands.

        By holding it out as a threat, she might hope the others would grudgingly accept the status quo, since it beats the hell out of demon portals on your doorstep.
        ```

      - u/Oaden:
        ```
        The nations don't matter, black is right. Every Hero, young or old, legendary or forgotten would come out of the woodwork to overthrow the Empress and destroy the weapon, And black just a calamity to the band in the free cities, it might have cost two heroes, but black now realizes he can no longer keep up.

        Better face the crusade then the inevitable doom at the hand of heroes
        ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  From chapter 59 onward, each chapter title was related to music. The clues that this was Bard's plan all along were hidden in plain sight, though I was under the impression they were related to The Girl Who Climbed The Tower. Who knows, maybe Cat will kill Malicia and become an Empress next chapter.
  ```

  - u/M3mentoMori:
    ```
    Malicia isn't physically there, so not next chapter, but it's a possibility in the future.
    ```

    - u/werafdsaew:
      ```
      My prediction is that Book 4 is about the Crusade, and Book 5 is about the Tower.
      ```

      - u/Empiricist_or_not:
        ```
        I generally agree, but somewhere in there bard needs to be befriended or fed to Triumpant
        ```

- u/Nihilvin:
  ```
  So I take it the flying fortress is gone?

  Tinfoil hat: With the weapon crippled and the Crusade coming, Malicia will have no choice but to ask the Dead King for help. There have too many mentions of the contact between the Empire and the Dead King.
  ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  You know, Black's objections here actually felt more emotional than logical, which is *really* weird to see. At best, he's leaning heavily into narrative logic.

  Even more surprising was that Cat actually *agreed* with Malicia, which I can only take as a very worrisome sign about her mental state. It makes a certain sense to keep the superweapon since the damage has already been done, but damn Cat is just ice cold now.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I think his objections made a lot of sense. I mean, the timeline is basically:

    Akua: My flying fortress can open devil gates! I am invincible!

    *ten minutes later:*

    Malicia: My flying fortress can open devil gates! I am invincible!
    ```

    - u/paradoxinclination:
      ```
      Oh, I don't deny that Black's arguments had some reason to them, it just felt like his emotions might have been tipping the scales a bit. It's only noticeable because ordinarily he makes these kinds of decisions with a complete sense of clarity and detachment.
      ```

      - u/aeschenkarnos:
        ```
        I think he *did* make this decision with a complete sense of clarity and detachment. Destroying the superweapon was the most practical course. It could not possibly be defended against infinite escalation, and better to destroy it *now*, before that escalation is started.
        ```

    - u/TheEngineer923:
      ```
      No. To quote her "We've seen our forbears USE these types of things and fail." She had absolutely no intention of using it at all. Just to have it there so the other guys know not to fuck with her. 

      And I find it perfectly laughable that a goddamn Warlock with decades of experience in the fullness of his power and a Hierophant with eyes that can perceive and deconstruct miracles can't create a suitable place to contain such a thing? I mean by the gods people it's not Impossible! Just look at Keter! The Dead King breaks Crusades like we break toothpicks. Why can't they emulate that success? 

      Oh, so now you're going to tell me that the Ranger easily enters such areas? Well buddy, how many Named of Ranger's calibre do you see running around?

      Also the main benefit of Liesse is that it's  COMPLETELY MOVABLE. So if Mario the Red Plumber and Luigi the Green Sorcerer come to destroy the array, poof. Sorry Mario, you're array is in another dimension. 

      Hell,if you get the thing that allows you to map all of the hells and Arcadia you could hide the bloody thing any place. Shit you could probably orchestrate a randomized rotation shift every 3 days or so. Heroes can't destroy it if they can't get to it. 

      Black was way too rash here.
      ```

      - u/SkoomaDentist:
        ```
        What guarantee is there that the successor to Malicia wouldn't use the fortress? To me Black was simply making the sensible observation that at some point in the future, there was pretty much guaranteed to be an Emperor / Empress who would use the fortress and Praes would suffer the consequences.
        ```

        - u/AurelianoTampa:
          ```
          > To me Black was simply making the sensible observation that at some point in the future, there was pretty much guaranteed to be an Emperor / Empress who would use the fortress and Praes would suffer the consequences.

          Absolutely. Keep in mind what happened regarding the Still Water project previously. From chapter 47:

          >“Everyone involved was killed and their souls bound to prevent necromancy. Uncle said if it ever got out we could do that there would be a Crusade mobilized within the month.”

          Amadeus literally murdered and stole the souls of everyone who worked on the project so word of it could never get out. And then he found out Malicia was like "Nah, let's totally get news of AN EVEN WORSE PROJECT out in public. That'll be a deterrent!" 

          For 20 years Black has opposed even acknowledging any of the Dark Day Protocol projects. Malicia's known this, and went ahead with a plan to announce she has *two* of them at her beck and call.
          ```

  - u/Ateddehber:
    ```
    Part of that is certainly the impact of Sabah's death, which seems to have been *JUST AS PLANNED* by the Bard
    ```

    - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
      ```
      The Bard is just... such a bad excuse for things to happen. The idea of an eternally suffering Good eldritch abomination is great in theory, but I'm not liking the execution here. 

      Too much *ALL ACCORDING TO KEIKAKU* like you mentioned.
      ```

      - u/Hoactzins:
        ```
        Weirdly, I kind of have the opposite feeling. Last chapter felt like everyone got off a little too easy. (yeah, I know Cat basically corrupted her soul with Winter, but still) 

        For most of the story Black's been the face of grim practicality, and the combination of Sabah's death and his own (presumably) impending death is actually shaking him out of that.

        Basically, Bard for president 2020
        ```

        - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
          ```
          Totally get it. Still, I wanted Black to be blindsided as a consequence of his logic and rationality (like with Sabah situation, but less foreshadowing), not... whatever this is.
          ```

          - u/rumblestiltsken:
            ```
            Isn't that exactly what happened? Malicia appealed to his emotion with "trust me one last time" and he didn't bite. I read this whole debate as black refusing the emotional ties that normally would have kept him in line.
            ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    Say, the narrative logic of having an evil magic superweapon bound to its creator end up with her dying at the critical moment, only to try and steal control of it for functionally the same plan again and it *not* blow up in your face?
    ```

    - u/WalterTFD:
      ```
      Listen, it is fine.  The creator of said superweapon is DEFINITELY GONE, and will not return to contest our usurpation.
      ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    I'm honestly convinced that the appearance of the Bard is because EE wanted a justification for why Black would do such an idiotic thing. Even Cat understands the opportunity here.

    Anyway, Cat still has the ability to rebuild the whole damn thing with Akua as a meat puppet, so that's nice I guess.
    ```

    - u/Oaden:
      ```
      Black has made his justification pretty clear. The thing is a hero magnet, and he is in a literal sense, doomed. He predicts he dies in 2 years, Captain is already gone, it was a close thing with the Hedge Mage and Warlock.  The gambit by Bard convinced him he can't stand up to the wave of heroes that would follow the use of the weapon. 

      So now he has two choices, inevitable defeat to the heroes, or the one in a million vs the crusade.
      ```

      - u/WalterTFD:
        ```
        The Crusade, he's hoping, will only bring out White Knight caliber heroes, rather than the 'Old Monsters' that the superweapon would attract.
        ```

        - u/TheEngineer923:
          ```
          But that Old Monster Schtick goes both ways. There's a certain Villain that many hope will never return as an example. 

          If the White Knight isn't the sharpest blade the Heavens can bare, why should the Black Knight be the any different for the Gods Below?

          I'm all for a bunch of Old Monsters duking it out. Also this begs the question of why Ranger hasn't killed those "Old Monsters" yet? They seem like blokes that are right up her alley.
          ```

          - u/WalterTFD:
            ```
            She hasn't killed either of those we've seen her hunt on screen, right?  Her 'hunt the worthy' deal isn't necessarily fatal for those involved.

      The only thing I regret is that Hierophant didn't get the chance to poke around first.
      ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Yeah, half-measures and all that, but did he really have to destroy the Watch AND wreck the central farmlands of Callow AND break the magical superweapon they already have along with six of his legions AND cut ties with Malicia on the eve of the goddamn crusade?
      ```

      - u/TideofKhatanga:
        ```
        From Black's point of view, Malicia's Name finally got to her and she's going down with a bad case of villainous madness. When Malicia talks, all he hears is "I have a superweapon, my plan cannot fail".

        And that's how Bard fucked him over. By killing Sabah in a way he didn't see coming, she convinced Black that he needed to step up his game and be way better at manipulating stories. He will NOT go for the old and tired superweapon bullshit no matter what he's told, because that's how Praes starts collapsing in the stories.
        ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        The legions and farmlands and such are all outside the pocket dimension of the city.  Hopefully the fallout is contained.

        Not that Black was really worried about anything other than "stop the superweapon story".
        ```

- u/Hoactzins:
  ```
  Jeez, the outcome was already bittersweet. Now it's just shitty for everyone. 

  Malicia loses her superweapon deterrent and is left with half an army. She doesn't have any particular reason to not let Callow be basically independent at this point - as Cat pointed out, the choice between Praes and Procer is starting to look almost cosmetic, and Malicia needs that goodwill desperately. 

  Cat has tens of thousands of wights roaming around an exploded city. Did Black destroy the weapon or the Daoine souls? Hopefully the former, for the sake of the Watch.

  Also, Black and Cat just got blown up, so there's that.
  ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    It's a city full of Undead in a pocket dimension that's already being burnt to a crisp by hideous amounts of Goblinfire.

    It's really a self-correcting problem at this point.  Just station people outside the gate with those new siege engines and a lot of pointy sticks and wait for it to collapse.

  So I need someone to walk me through how Cat lost access to her Name waaayyyy back in Book One. Something to do with not being in tune with her Role/Alignment/Name, right? 

  Because it seems to me that a Black Knight just took a stand against his Empress to destroy a super weapon meant to strike fear into the hearts of the rest of continent.

  It seems to me that even after considering his own reasons, that act comes out on the heroic end of the spectrum.  

  Amadeus is alive, but can he continue on as the Black Knight?

    Don't forget betrayal is a very common theme among Black Knights. They've mentioned several times how unusual it is that Alaya and Amadeus work together so  well without backstabbing each other. I doubt this would be enough to damage his connection to his name.
    ```

    - u/ForgottenToupee:
      ```
      That’s true. I think I had it in my head I that the betrayal aspect was more in the Squire-Knight narrative then the Emperor-Knight dynamic
      ```

      - u/HallowedThoughts:
        ```
        I think the betrayal aspect is just Praes all around lol

    Cat lost access to her Name in Book 1 by falling into a redemption arc: she let the Lone Swordsman go after the Lone Swordsman let her go.
    ```

- u/TheEngineer923:
  ```
  Liesse can't seem to catch a break. First it was converted into a Diabolist's paradise, them the vast majority of its populace were transformed into wights, then it got phased out of Creation and NOW it's going to become a "violently haunted" wasteland. 

  Damn, what the founders of Liesse do to piss fate off so much?
  ```

  - u/HeWhoBringsDust:
    ```
    There’s an angel’s corpse there for unspecified reasons. The murder of a purely “good” entity might have something to do with why Liesse seems to be cursed.

    That, or maybe it’s stuck in a rule of three with regards to Cat. The first was the fight with the Lone Swordsman. The second was the fight with Ubua. No idea who the third might be, but my money’s on the Bard.

    It even fits the convention so far, with the first being a win for Cat, and the second being a “draw” (She killed Ubua, but Liesse is fucked and her relationship with Black/Malicia is ruined)
    ```

  Oof. I'm having a really tough time deciding which option was the smarter one here.

  Keep the array: You gain a MAD deterrent that may frighten enough countries into pulling out of a Crusade. On the other hand, it may do the exact opposite - Good is sure to want to counter such an Evil device, which at the very least means Heroes rise from all over. If you're lucky, you can use the array as a beacon and slaughter them as they come. But Heaven is usually the lucky one, and Black's seen that the Calamities are starting to have trouble with Hero bands even before Good is boosting their power. And if Praes is *really* unlucky, a Crusade might take place anyway if Good sends an angel to inspire it. And that's not even counting the issues at home; Daione would likely revolt (or at least pull out completely) as the souls of their Gestalt is taken over by Villains full time. And the rest of Callow isn't going to be super happy with Cat's actions; she's somewhat liked (and plenty feared) right now, but her siding with the Tower and endorsing the use of a superweapon built on the corpses of 100,000 Callowans and powered by millions of Deoraithe souls is probably enough to turn the country against her, even if it *did* mean preventing a Crusade. At the very least the Order of the Broken Bells would likely desert. 

  Destroy the array: The obvious problem is that without a deterrent a Crusade is going to happen, almost for certain. Not due to ideological reasons ("We must fight to destroy this superweapon!") but for practical ones ("Lulz, let's invade because Praes has never been weaker"). The Crusade will be weaker without Good acting to counter the array, and Heroes will be fewer, but almost half the Legions are gone and Callow's already bleeding dry. Daione might still rebel or pull support entirely, depending on what happened when the array was destroyed. Callow will likely remain more pro-Cat, but they're still in no shape to fend off an invasion. The biggest reason I think this might be the worse option though is because *Bard seems to have wanted this to happen.* That's... not good. As a general rule of thumb, I think any time Bard's plan is working means it's bad news for our protagonist.

  That said, it feels to me like the second option was the better one. Black's been influenced by Bard, sure, but Malicia's definitely been straying from their original plan. These kinds of superweapons were researched before by the Calamities and then sealed away because they knew they weren't worth the cost to even complete them. Malicia unilaterally decided to go back on that plan. The problem is that with Black now in rebellion (and Cat on Malicia's side), odds are that Praes is going to default back to old school villainy, which is how Malicia's been sliding for years. Black was the one pushing to destroy the narrative of Praes and Callow, while Malicia's been bogged down in politics. Without Black keeping her in check, I think she's going to go the way of most Dread Empresses... and Cat's willing to follow along, because she was only about breaking the narrative if it benefitted Callow and (erroneously, in my mind) thinks that following Malicia will do that best. Dang.

  Edit: More random thinking... I wonder if Bard messed up here? She succeeded in breaking apart Black and Malicia, but in doing so she threw the traditional narrative out the window. Usually a Dread Empress gets a superweapon, Heroes get called, the Villain gets defeated, and the cycle resets. Now things continue on as they have been; a Crusade gets called, but it's more of a traditional conflict than a Named one. And Praes, even divided, still has an advantage in Names. A Crusade will be hard to repel, but it doesn't necessarily end with the Villains losing. The biggest issue is that after, Malicia gets to keep ruling (if she wins). She can still proceed with the Reforms and her and Black's original dream. That is, if she isn't backsliding like Black suspects. Still, I think Black acting as he did at least gives his vision a *chance* of victory eventually, whereas Malicia's plan would eventually *guarantee* defeat.

  I just hope everybody present lives to hear Warlock say that no, the array couldn't be repurposed, and Black to get a last "told you" in.
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Yet another confirmation, if one was needed, that Catherine has no idea what she's doing.

  The way she explicitely threatened both the Empress and Black with sedition in particular seems foolhardy to me. I mean, it's clearly an empty threat: she would get murdered 20 times before that happened. If she wanted to cross the Tower, announcing it to the Empress would be the most counter-productive course of action.
  ```

  - u/Hoactzins:
    ```
    Well, it was obviously on the table, especially once she learned that Malicia basically allowed Diabolist's little experiment. At that point Catwas basically using the threat as leverage, especially because assassinating Cat would probably have some horrible consequences  for Malicia.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      Assassinating Fae Cat would be very *difficult* for Malicia to do.

      The other Legions are gutted, as mentioned, her assassin's are currently very busy with their enemies rising up, Cat can both detect *and* know of a way to permakill Assassin, Black won't let Malicia go through with it, and Hierophant can convince his dad that its better to follow Cat and Black than Malicia, not that he needs much since he does his own thing and doesn't care about politics.  Captain's dead, Hunter is off doing her own thing, and the Diabolist just got owned, so there's very in little in the way of Name help the Empress could use.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure Black would kill Catherine before letting her rebel openly against the Empire.
        ```

        - u/TideofKhatanga:
          ```
          He would have before. Right now, he's the one who's openly rebelling against the Empire. As far as he's concerned, Malicia has finally gone mad and needs to be removed. And he's **tired** of having to clean up Highborns fuck-ups because Malicia said "trust me, I know what I'm doing".

          That's also what Cat thinks, but she's younger, less tired and she's interested in not turning her country into a pyre again.
          ```

        - u/RynnisOne:
          ```
          Black doesn't care if she rebels or not so long as the Empire comes out better for it.  While one might immediately say it being independent is bad, if Callow continued to serve as a buffer against enemies, a trade partner, and a supplier of food that had its own army to protect itself from outside threats but with no intent to I vade the Empire, he would *definitely* chalk it up as a win.
          ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        How does Cat know of a way to permakill Assassin? Are you talking about the Fourfold Crossing?
        ```

        - u/ketura:
          ```
          Yeah, one of her alt selves killed him with goblin fire.

          (tho tbh I'm sure that would have been her second try after discovering that regular murder doesn't work)
          ```

  - u/18scsc:
    ```
    You're right, but as Cat noted. They depend on her. Without Cat and Callow the Crusade will almost surely succeed.
    ```

  - u/LordGoldenroot:
    ```
    They really cant kill her though because as she is now she is the most powerful named in the empire by a significant margin. If she rebels praes would be unable to deal with a crusade even if you ignore the fact that Cat would have a good chance of winning anyway and realistically if Malicia blew her off there is not much that could actually stop cat from walking into the tower and killing her. The best case scenario for her would be mutual destruction and both of them knew it.
    ```

- u/sickening_sprawl:
  ```
  I'm actually super disappointed by this chapter. Completely out of left field, Malacia becomes a trope villian. Her entire reason for existence is to *kill the fucking story*. It's implied it was her idea in the first place. She has said multiple times that there is a reason trying to take over the continent with a superweapon failed, because it's written in Creation. Yes, it's realistic to think "maybe just this once" - but she's been consistent with the position for *40 years* against all other hardship  and even the last time Cat talked to her drove home making the empire futureproof and stable. Magic nuclear deterrent does not stability make.

  Seriously. This feels completely out of character to her. "Taking over the continent with an army of invisible tigers will never work also here is our flying city that can open permanent hell portals powered by the nascent god made of ten thousand dead souls we stole".

  If this turns into another Wandering Bard "all according to plan" I'm shanking someone.
  ```

  - u/PrettyDecentSort:
    ```
    To be fair, "my superweapon will only be used as a deterrent" is a (slightly) different narrative from "my superweapon will conquer the continent".
    ```

    - u/tomtan:
      ```
      And it's consistent with the entire MAD doctrine we have on earth. It's not necessarily a bad gambit
      ```

      - u/LeifCarrotson:
        ```
        >And it's consistent with the entire MAD doctrine we have on earth. It's not necessarily a bad gambit.

        I think you've connected two things that don't necessarily connect. A lot of people think that MAD is a bad doctrine IRL.

        And whatever protections you might be able to place around existing MAD weapon systems - which, given the propensity of humans for mistakes, aren't great even in relatively stable places like the US: United_States_military_nuclear_incident_terminology - the story will conjure up heroes and villains that could repurpose it.
        ```

      - u/RynnisOne:
        ```
        Not really MAD if you're opponent ts have no such weapon of their own.

        That being said, I think that whole "Angel of Contrition" thing is the "good" opposite of the Hellgate Maker.
        ```

  - u/M3mentoMori:
    ```
    I saw it more as Malicia not wanting to throw away a potential tool. It's also, as Black said, a massive beacon for Heroes. As we saw at Marchford, knowing where your enemy will strike gives you a great advantage.

    Keeping it is a bad idea, but Malicia's logic is sound enough to me.
    ```

  - u/AurelianoTampa:
    ```
    I'm annoyed by it too, but I don't agree it's out of left field. Malicia and Black being on the outs because she keeps moving away from their original goal and closer to being like an old school villain has been a recurring theme in their interactions. Up until now Black has allowed it despite his reservations. Now she reveals that she planned to acquire a doomsday device, but not to use it, and for Black it was a bridge too far (especially since they had stopped research on these kinds of things before because they agreed even having them was too dangerous). 

    Granted, Black was manipulated by Bard to make this the pivot; but I don't think he was wrong. Malicia's way would almost certainly fall into the old school villain narrative of acquiring a super weapon and being taken down by Good. Giving into narrative to acquire power is not the way you break a narrative.
    ```

  - u/leniadolbap:
    ```
    It's not out of the left field, it has been foreshadowed.
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      Agreed, we've known for a while that Malicia wants this weapon.
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Men I don't really like the black queen name, did bard just played back himself? Did the lost of the captain hurt him so bad that it moved to do such a mistake, or is black the only sane person of the 3? This story is so good I'll buy the books as soon as he start publishing.
