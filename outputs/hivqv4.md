  Woo, WtC fanart!  I love Bethel's piece in particular, I think you nailed her aesthetic.  Your art's also getting plaudits in the WtC Discord, come by if you'd like to join the conversation there.

  Great details! If you don't mind me asking why did you go with Juniper as the Magician instead of the Fool?

    Thanks! Tbh, I simply went for the literal meaning of the word; it seemed like an obvious card choice for multimage character. Come to think of it, The Fool indeed might have been a better fit ðŸ™‚

      Uh, for the uninitiated in Tarot symbolism, what do all of these mean?

        There's really no bottom to that particular well, but in a nutshell:

        0 - The Fool: The novice at the beginning of the journey. Inexperience and naÃ¯vetÃ©, but unlimited potential.

        I - The Magician: Wielder of knowledge. Resourcefulness, willpower, creation. Reasonably strong mythological associations with Hermes.

        II - The High Priestess: Keeper of more subtle arts. Intuition, mystery, sacred knowledge. Minor association with the Torah.

        III - The Empress: Motherhood. Femininity, fertility, the gentler side of the natural world. Minor associations with Isis.

        IX - The Hermit: Inner search for knowledge. Self-reflection, introspection, analysis.

        X - Wheel of Fortune: Luck and fate. Destiny, good fortune, the inevitability of change.

        XVI - The Tower: Greatness brought low. Upheaval, disaster, hubris. *Strong* associations with the Tower of Babel.

        XX - Judgement: Rebirth. Absolution, healing, aftermath of the reckoning.

        Juniper (like most protagonists) is an easy fit for The Fool, but I like Juniper-as-DM for Magician and he wears that hat too. Amaryllis is tricky since her outward persona might be more associated with The Chariot or Strength, but she has that maternal side that comes out every so often when circumstances allow, which works with Empress. I'd probably give Fenn the Death card for a long list of non-obvious associations, but the overt interpretation can't help but be too ham-fisted to overlook. After that it's like a 4-way tie IMO, but Wheel of Fortune is on that list and works for me. Grak, Solace, and Valencia are obvious enough fits that I can't really comment, except maaaaybe to acknowledge that there's an alternative (mediocre) argument to give Solace The Hierophant for its bridging of the mundane and divine. Bethel for The Tower works to an unfortunate degree so far, but we'll see where that goes in the future...

          What's the other three in Fenn's 4-way tie?
          ```

          - u/Versac:
            ```
            The Lovers' straightforward focus on interpersonal relationships - particularly romance - has some clear play, but I feel like it's ultimately a one-dimensional take on Fenn's role in the story. Ditto with how her role in the party dynamic works with The Sun's symbolism as a source of positivity and vitality.

            The more I think about it though, the more I think I'm coming around on The Moon - the themes of trickery and deception fit for the self-appointed party rogue, and the internal themes of suppressed anxiety and insecurity work with her character arc before its conclusion. And the link to Celestar is blunt, but valid.
