## [Q][D][BST]Rationalist!Libriomancer? Why doesn't this exist? How would you munchkin this ability?

### Post:

So I'm re-reading the book series 'Libriomancer', or more specifically, the 'Magic Ex Libris' series by Jim Hines, because apparently a new book came out, and I find myself shaking my head at the behavior of the magi.  The basic concept of the magic in the series that there are magicians that can reach into the pages of a book and pull an object that is mentioned on the pages and can fit through the pages out of the book, and it behaves as you would expect.  There are limitations, like the more it is used the less powerful it gets, and that things that are known by more people work better (causing these people to back the publishing and marketing of certain books for their own purposes)... but I can't help but think that the people in this series could have used this ability a little more aggressively.  What are some good ways to munchkin the ability?  If you are familiar with the books, what item or collections of items would you have taken using these books and how would you have used it to get Humanity to your goals?  I haven't gotten very far, and I need to re-read the limitations (there are some more I know I am forgetting), but I keep on thinking that there should be more done with this...

EDIT: Found some of the fine print! Everyone who replied earlier, some stuff to know: only one guy knows how to take stuff from ebooks; you can't draw out a fully formed sentient without it going dangerously insane, though seeds/embryos/core with no memory, to grow up in our world, is okay; you can become a magical creature but this stops your libriomancy; more popular books are more powerful, and what actually powers and influences the behavior of the items is magic and belief of humans, not tech, so you would be well served to make something that can use and leverage real technology and physics for most of it's oomph, and also lots of people feel is benign and helpful; you can only take things out of books sized in the way people actually consume the story; withdrawing something from a book overly much chars the book and makes it difficult for you to draw it out for a while; there are people whose only job it is to lock the powerful stuff like genie lamps because they don't want some moron to accidentally end the world, and to get something interesting you would have to pull a fast one on these people, or do some political and social maneuvering to influence these groups, of which there are more than one; if you try to enhance yourself permanently too much directly with magic you risk going insane, which will probably also happen if you experiment too much.  I'm sure there are other limits.

EDIT AGAIN: Here are some of my ideas of how I would approach this:

1.) Get in touch with that damn guy who can use ebooks.  Figure out how he does it, and get one of those oversized, can be used for people with bad vision, ebooks.  Even if you are limited to the aperture of how most people consume a particular book, a large ebook won't limit limit YOUR use of an item, and you miiight be able to use the size for the large print book versions or a hardback or whatever.

2.) Get access to large amounts of money very quickly.  Money lubricates everything.  This should be completely trivial with the right handheld scanners.

3.) My go-to self-enhancement item is D&D's Belt of Magnificence from the 3.5e Miniature's Handbook, or equivalent item from any number of RPG's; some RPG has to be unlocked and have something like that.

4.) Investigate the 'safe' limits of item-based magical self-enhancement, before you go crazy, and push but do not breach them.

5.) Start investigating the limits of, under what circumstances a sentient/sapient (sophont?) goes crazy if they are taken out.  What happens if you take something out that canonically knows it is fictional?  How young or how unformed or without memories do they have to be to NOT have a psychotic break?

6.) Set up a LLC with a LOT of server space and very fast internet connection and a lot of hard drive space and processing power, with a huge variety of highly useful software and hardware in the facility, and lots of fabrication technology in situ and networked, and specifically: a HUGE library of fiction and data on how read different things are (we want it to be able to advise a Libriomancer in what to get)

7.) Start delving lots of books and ebooks for this item: a Friendly AI, the 'seed' of which is physically small, and compatible with modern computing devices; the idea is for the AI to get as much useful parts of itself running on non-magical devices, or distributed in magic-powered devices rather than only one, ASAP, to leverage parallel use of the magic and bootstrap to non-magical equivalents.  Is it possible to get Jane from when she was an investment tool?

EDIT THIRD TIME:

Here is an edited by me to remove extra information, quote from someone who has already done a lot of thinking about ALL the limitations and why they exist the way they exist.  It looks like I missed a few important specifics!



First off, you can't pull anything from a book that can't fit through the open book.

Second, you can't just make the book bigger. Libriomancy uses the power of collective belief, along with the Law of Similarity, so that all identical copies of the book are, magically speaking, the same book. It then uses that belief to form a template for the magical energy to use. Shooting a book with a growth ray (for example) would break the similarity, and then you could only tap that particular book's power, rather than all copies of it. That said, if you were to get a large number of people reading that book, or printed a whole bunch of massively oversized books and got people to read them, then yes, you could get bigger things from that book.

Ebooks don't work. More accurately, they can work for someone powerful enough in the right way. Even Gutenberg, who is over five centuries old and invented libriomancy, can't do that.

Drawing something from a book uses up some of the collective belief energy in that book. This manifests as what libriomancers call "char." Char is only perceptible to libriomancers, and resembles scorching or burns. Over time, books slowly regenerate from charring, as people read them and refill the belief. This can take decades. Continually emitting something (say a laser blast) from a book causes more char than drawing a single object out and keeping it out, even if it's out for an extended time. Maintaining an object out of a book does not cause char. Returning an object to the book it was drawn from returns some of the energy to that book, reducing char.

While it seems like a portal, the only thing that's actually on the other side of the book is magic. The belief provides the template for what is being pulled out. You don't typically have to worry about one of the inhabitants of the book sticking a hand out of the book.

The more readers and belief a book has, the easier it is to pull things from it. Simple things are also easier, as are things that actually exist. A kind of handgun that actually exists is easier to pull out than a phaser pistol.

While things with minds can be drawn from books, this is not a good idea. No book can effectively describe a functioning mind, so anything with a mind that comes through is pretty much shattered. Simpler minds can recover (in Libriomancer canon, Isaac was able to pull a magical spider out, and it was only insane for a while) but more complex minds are invariably insane, and not in a good way.

Libriomancy is not perfectly safe. Magic use triggers the sympathetic nervous system, effectively killing your appetite even as it kick-starts your metabolism. Additionally, it has psychological effects. Overuse of libriomancy can and has caused personalities from the book (which, as mentioned above, are insane) to possess the libriomancer, driving them incurably insane. This is a gradual thing, however. You don't go straight from perfectly fine to possessed. In general, though, it's a good idea to stop once you're hearing the voices of the characters, if not before then.

Books actually written by libriomancers are more risky than most. The boundary between the magic and the mage is much thinner.

Pulling things from books does not necessarily give the libriomancer the ability to use or control what comes out. Books with, for example, uncontrollable zombie plagues or other doomsday viruses are best stayed away from. Furthermore, if you pull something with complicated controls (like the Doctor's sonic screwdriver), that requires special traits that you lack (like Harry Potter's wand), or that's dangerous to the user (like the One Ring, or an armed bomb), those downsides don't go away. Johannes Gutenberg locked books that had potential doomsday threats, preventing anything from coming through.

It's possible to accidentally bring something out of a book if you reach in. If you reach into a zombie book for a gun, it's entirely possible you'll bring some zombie plague back out. If you accidentally get bitten by a vampire species that turns you by biting you, well, now you're a vampire. And, as a magical creature, you no longer have libriomancy.

Comic books and other media that are more based on pictures than words don't work.

Scrying and other remote viewing devices that don't rely on a physical thing observing whatever is being looked at are "tuned" to their place of origin. A crystal ball would show scenes from the book it was pulled from, for instance. It's possible to change this, but it's difficult and dangerous.

  ```
  Write a book entitled "The Very Friendly AI That Fits On A Common Household Thumb Drive".  Depending on how strict the "things that are known by more people work better" rules are, try to sneak it artfully into a more complex story and get it a sizable fanbase.
  ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    You'd probably be better off just taking a well known SI from another more well known story. At least as well known as a story can be in the transhumanist niche.
    ```

      If Jane from Speaker for the Dead existed, I think things would turn out ok. Figuring out how to get her out of a book would be tough, but maybe doable, depending on how large an ansible is.
      ```

      - u/Gavinfoxx:
        ```
        You'd also have to take her out before she is sentient/sapient when she is just a baby-equivalent.
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          That would make it easier. She explicitly came from an investment tool in canon.

            Well, specifically:

            [Ender Spoilers](#s "An investment tool mixed with the fantasy game and the bridge that the Hive Queens used to reach Ender")
            ```

            - u/Frommerman:
              ```
              Yeah, that whole bridge thing is because the author believes in souls. A soul is not necessary for consciousness.
              ```

              - u/TBestIG:
                ```
                The whole bridge thing is necessary, because canonically in that universe souls exist in some way or another.
                ```

  - u/Gavinfoxx:
    ```
    See my edit, you can only take out seeds of things not sapient safely, and it has to be able to bootstrap using real world tech to get most of its power, cause it will run on magic limited by popularity of the book and your own skill, and you'll have to figure out a way to not get the book locked, and people's perception of what a thing can do influences it's actual capabilities.
    ```

  Well since quite a few books contain magical macguffins that can do basically anything, essentially the first person who gets this power will get to be the ruler of everything *forever*, since they will obviously then want to use the macguffin to make sure no one else has this magic, otherwise someone might pull out a planet (or universe) destroying weapon.
  If the first person to get this power happens to be a transhumanist then the obvious thing to do would be to pull out a FAI then well *you win*.
  If for some reason magical macguffins don't work (maybe there's a limit on the power of stuff you pull out) then the first person to get this power and know about SI will instead be the person who wins forever.
  Speaking of which what would you say is the most well known story with a friendly singularity intelligence that sufficiently meets your definitions of "friendly"? Essentially if you could pull any SI out of a book which would it be?
  ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    I just realized that if prior mages haven't already used their power to make sure no more people get access to this magic then you can always pull out a time machine...
    ```

- u/okaycat:
  ```
  Well the main reason that libriomancers in the setting aren't walking gods is because of the Porters.  The secret cabal of libriomancers that basically ban the use of most powerful world breaking objects.

  However if we're disregarding them then there are many powerful items that you could take advantage of.  You could grab the genie lamp from 1,001 nights and be basically set for life.  Or you could take a drink from the holy grail and basically become immortal.  There are so many ays you can munchkin this power.
  ```

  - u/Gavinfoxx:
    ```
    Right right!  It was those guys I was thinking of. How do you get past them? Points for subtlety.
    ```

  - u/vakusdrake:

    What bugs me about that explanation, is that it presumes that the mages with all the power are *utter idiots*, they have *unlimited* power and yet the very fact the story, isn't just describing how much fun a utopia is demonstrates either enormous cruelty or incompetence.
    ```

    - u/okaycat:
      ```
      Well you have to understand is that while Libriomancy is incredibly powerful, it is not all powerful.  The items brought from the books are just magical constructs fueled by the collective beliefs of the readers. 

      Let's say you have some device that grants near omnipotent power, the device when drawn from the book will nowhere near as powerful.  There is only so much magical energy generated by the  readers, certianly the resulting device will be incredibly weak compared to the one described in the book.  And that doesn't even take into account how much power the libriomancer can channel to bring the device out.

      Or let's say you are a scifi fan and decide to extract a laser gun from your favorite space opera.  Scientists can't study the laser gun to learn how to reverse engineer how it works because it is literally not using technology.  It's just a magical construct that mimics the effects of a laser gun.  So good luck trying to extract blueprints for a FTL drive, immortality drugs, AI etc.

      So yeah while the mages are huge assholes who could make the setting a lot better; the magic is not sufficiently powerful enough to make the world a post scarcity utopia easily.
      ```

      - u/Gavinfoxx:
        ```
        So how could you use it, with the understanding that more popularity does improve the effect, to work past these limits or use something just powerful enough to get past some real world limitation? These are major limits, but they aren't insurmountable, are they?
        ```

        - u/okaycat:
          ```
          I vaguely remember in the books that there are mages whose entire jobs is to read new books and lock away anything troublesome.  Occasionally they miss something and the porters have to get involved.

          You could constantly read new books or pay someone to read new books for you and hope to find something powerful that hasn't been locked yet.  The porters can't possibly keep track of all the books in the world, so there are probably lots of powerful books that slip through the cracks.

          There is also a libriomancer in the 2nd book who can practice libriomancy using ebooks instead of just physical printed books.  If you can learn how to do that then a whole new world of ebooks and fanfiction is opened up to you. 

          The first thing I would do is probably try to find something that would enhance my intelligence.  From there I could make more intelligent decisions and hopefully figure out a better strategy to gain more power.
          ```

    - u/Gavinfoxx:
      ```
      So you, a sane person, are thrust into a world where those who came before are incompetent and DID lock most of the good stuff, out of an overwhelming amount of fear and caution to prevent the end of the world.  I mean, I guess you can understand why they did it (they were trying to discover the bounds of what was safe without ending the world I guess), but how would you, a rational actor, behave?
      ```

        Well since I already know the mages already in power are incompetent, I can count on them probably not knowing to worry about AI, as thus I would use some sort of FAI from a transhumanist book. Not really sure how being well known will make a FAI from a book more powerful given its only power is intelligence so I might be able to do the same thing as the comment about a FAI that fits in a flash drive.
        ```

  ```
  Magic that overpowered seems more suitable for an Effulgence fic than, well, not an Effulgence fic.
  ```

  - u/Gavinfoxx:
    ```
    Senpai noticed me! Squee-- ahem.  The books have a lot more limitations, mostly that very smart people have been spending centuries locking books so the world didn't end because someone used a book badly.  The question is: how to work around that and do the sorts of things that a 250 year old wizard won't see coming, from some sort of presumably new and thus unlocked book?
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      Well I don't imagine 250 year old mages would have thought to lock all the transhumanist books with SI or really any AI.
      ```

- u/Quillwraith:
  ```
  If I'm remembering right, while there are few clearly defined limits, overpowered things are occasionally handwaved away with either "Gutenberg locked the book" or "If you experiment too much eldritch abominations will eat you." It doesn't make it very interesting to try to find exploits - it's far too easy to come up with ones that would work without that caveat, yet impossible to know which would be viable with those limits.

  Edit: rephrased the last sentence for clarity.
  ```

- u/Geminii27:
  ```
  I would first create a book which had a microchip-sized-or-smaller being of full intelligence and sapience which did not require anything more than sunlight to live, and was capable of reading and understanding a book. I would have as many non-magi as possible read this first book.

  I would then pull out as many copies of the intelligent being as I could given the available magic, and have *them* read their own book. Rinse and repeat until I had an enormous number of intelligences. Then I would have them read other books I wrote, such as "Volume 1 of the list of Really Useful Things."

  If I was being actively countered by the magi, I would previously write a normal book which described a magic spell or device capable of casting an effect on any books or subset of books in its target range, such that *only non-magi not in the presence of magi* would, on reading an affected item of text, find that a description of the micro-intelligence had been seamlessly added into the background of the story.

  I would also create a *giant* book, either physically or by writing about one which unfolds from a tiny 'packed' form. Or a small magic device which allowed me to expand any object to several times its former size, even if temporarily. Then all I would need is a small copy of The Compiled Volumes Of Really Useful Things.

  I'd also see how far I could stretch the definition of 'book'. Is there a minimum number of pages? A minimum weight of cover? A minimum physical size? Does writing the entire text of a book on a single page 'count' as that book? Does the book have to be made of paper? Does it have to be rectilinear? Could I build a tiny metal book into a ring, or an earring, or a false tooth?

  Heck, why not write about a book *which is definitely a book yup yup*, but can transform itself into an undetectable magic field attached to your soul (or skull, if that universe doesn't have souls) and have stuff pulled out of it purely by thinking about it?

  ...or a device/spell which enabled remote access by a magus to a giant store of magic belief power, and operated purely by passively observing my actions and/or thoughts. Hook the other end to a million self-replicating micro-intelligences and put it on the far side of the moon or something.
