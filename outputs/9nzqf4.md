  Back, finally, on a new computer after my old one finally gave up.  I've also been busy with some family stuff, but I hope to return to posting chapters of The Maker's Ark soon.  In the meantime, enjoy this little bit about Elder Trig.

    My dad turned something in the high sexties yesterday and my folks are passing through on the way back from their vacation.  This put a happy tear in my eye.
