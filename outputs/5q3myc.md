## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So I've got this world that is basically robots building and maintaining facilities around the stars, that use their energy to power servers that simulate happiness. 

  Basically, people (in the far future) discovered that you could upload your mind onto servers and have a simulated awesome life with lots of happiness. Everyone did that and left everything in charge of robots. Now the robots, being pragmatic, simplified the codes, to optimize happiness and also created new servers with other simulated lives, but this time they didn't even upload minds, they just created AI's. Eventually, they simplified it to just a few lines of code, outputting happiness.

  The robots, with their only goal, being to create happiness, just build servers hosting lines of codes having continuous orgasms. This until the heat death of the universe or until another civilization interrupts them.

    I like the idea that there's a shortest program that can experience happiness. This idea could fit into lots of other settings.

    In the cyberpunk future, a sect of philosophers begs borrows and steals computer time to run this program as much as they can. Of all people, Bitcoin miners completely sympathise with their quest to run quadrillions of iterations of a program that just solves the same mathematical problem over and over, and only debatably produces anything useful.

      *And we haven't found it yet.*  There is a rift in the philosophy community, between those that want to create more happiness in the world right now, and those who want to spend those resources researching new, more efficient algorithms.

      Another debate is whether old processes should be killed to free up their resources for the newer algorithms, given that the oldest algorithms that can experience happiness are less than 0.1% as efficient at creating happiness as the newest generation.

    I think if you gave such an obviously flawed goal to strong AI things would go south a bit faster than you portray.             
    I suspect as soon as they manage to make the first strong AI with the horrifyingly naive goal of maximizing happiness, you get an intelligence explosion where everything available is deconstructed to simulate as much happiness for the AI as possible as it expands outwards as quickly as possible..

  I am trying to conceptualize what a bubble of locally sped up time (say 100m radius, 100x time increase) what would look like to the inside and outside observer. Are there physical effects I am not considering in this event?

  **Inside**: Because time is advancing more quickly, light is not entering the bubble often enough, and as a result bubble interior is quite dark. Weird things happening at the boundary (would anything going at different accelerations be sheared at the boundary?). Sounds coming in would be shifted into low pitch. You could not stay in the bubble for longer than a few minutes or the different rates of air exchange would cause the bubble to fill up with Co2 or other toxic gases. Other effects?

  **Outside**: You can't see into the bubble of sped up time, it would appear like a black sphere. Possibly generating very high pitch noises if anything makes a sound inside. Other effects?
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    Looking into the sphere from the outside would appear incandescent white, (assuming it had an energy source, like IR radiation from body heat) not featureless black.  This is because the number of photons leaving per observer-second is much higher, and also the frequency  (and therefore energy) is higher as well.

    It would also rapidly depressurize itself.  Assuming that the bubble popped up in normal air, the molecules of gas would be leaving  (due to random motion) at 100x the rate that they are entering.  A similar thing happens with heat transfer, with heat flowing out very rapidly.
    ```

    - u/Norseman2:
      ```
      I decided to do the math on this, and it seems like you're right. I was skeptical because the Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the total radiant energy emitted by an object is proportional to its absolute temperature raised to the fourth power. This means that even when you're radiating 10x as much energy because of time acceleration, an object at 300°K (room temperature) will still emit 1,000x less energy than an object at around 3,000°K (like a halogen lamp or incandescent light) which is outside of the zone. Of course, once that hits the edge of the zone, frequency shifting will make that 1/100th.

      People will emit about 13% more total radiant energy than room temperature objects around them. Wien's law states the wavelength of the peak of their emissions would be about 9.5 μm. Once that hits the edge of the zone, that would change to 0.95 μm, or near-infrared (instead of long wavelength infrared). This is close to the same peak as you'd see with objects at 3000°K outside the zone (see this [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Black_body.svg)), but the curve would probably be quite a bit flatter. The peak would be in the about the same frequency range as a halogen lamp, although much of the light would be spread out through a wider range of (mostly non-visible) frequencies. The flatness is likely to make the color appear whiter than you'd expect from a 3000°K light source, but dimmer as well. I haven't calculated this, so bear that in mind when reading my estimation of luminance in the following paragraph.

      Since every object in the zone would be about 1/100th as bright as staring into an incandescent filament, and humans would be about 1/88th as bright, the [luminance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(luminance)) of objects inside the zone (seen from outside) would be in the ballpark of a [low-pressure sodium vapor lamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-vapor_lamp). That probably wouldn't be so bright that it's painful to look at, but definitely bright enough that you'd be dealing with a decent amount of glare when trying to look at anything inside the zone. The brightness would be temperature-dependent, so humans and other warm objects would obviously have somewhat visible contrast from their surroundings. Objects in the zone would probably stand out due to being somewhat cooler and thus somewhat darker than the ground.

      One big problem is that any typical light sources from inside the zone will be hazardous to you on the outside. All visible light (380-740 nm) will be shifted to the extreme ultraviolet range (now 40-74 nm within the range which is 10-124 nm), and the total power output of such sources would be amplified by a factor of 100 for objects and people outside of the zone. A strong LED flashlight or laser pointer could become quite dangerous.
      ```

      - u/CreationBlues:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure that light exiting the bubble would get it's wavelength divided by 100, not 10, so it's peak would actually get moved between near ultraviolet and extreme ultraviolet.
        ```

        - u/ulyssessword:
          ```
          It looks like all of the figures are based off of a 10x time acceleration, not 100x.
          ```

          - u/Norseman2:
            ```
            Correct. I probably got a bit too excited about the question and doing the math for it and glossed over that part. At 100x time acceleration, luminance of room-temperature objects should approximately match an incandescent filament. Ouch. Peak energy output wavelength for objects at human body temperature will be about 95 nm which is in the near ultraviolet range. Due to the flatness of the curve, you're probably going to be getting a sunburn if you get too close to the zone and stand there for a while.

            Visible light would be shifted into the soft X-ray range (3.8-7.4 nm in the 0.1-10 nm range). Total power output would be 10,000x the original output. Even if you were exposed to what would normally be only 1 watt of power in the form of visible light, once it exits the zone you'd be hit by 10,000 watts of x-rays. If you're 70 kg (154 lbs), that would work out to roughly 140 Sv per second. 3-4 seconds of that would give you symptoms of radiation poisoning. 14 seconds would produce severe radiation poisoning, 38 seconds would be usually fatal even with prompt medical attention, and 76 seconds would be fatal regardless of medical attention.

    *(everything below is just a bunch of guesses, feel free to correct\elaborate on any point)*

    I love questions like that.

    >heat, oxygen, and pressure

    Covered by ulyssessword.

    Some other things (assuming the above have been magically fixed):

    * From an inside PoV, Earth’s gravity will drop to 0.098m/s². So if the person inside is not aware and careful about this, they can accidentally launch themselves into the air without any means to control their flight trajectory, and end up finding out on themselves exactly what kinds of weird things are happening at the bubble’s surface.

    * From an inside PoV, some things that are outside [will change their colour,](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/EM_spectrumrevised.png) some things will become invisible, others that were invisible before will become visible. Or everything that was visible regularly will become invisible, and some wavelengths that were invisible to the human eye before will now be perceived in regular colours.

    * Radio-signals that have to travel through the bubble will reach their destination a bit sooner.

    * It will be possible to burn something that’s outside using a regular source of light, especially if it’s a powerful laser pointer.

    * solid bodies that are hitting the bubble’s surface from inside (e.g. bullets) will crumble into themselves, or just bounce back upon hitting it. I’m not sure how Newton's Third Law will interact with the bubble.

     * same bodies hitting from outside will get pulverised. Or maybe a continuous series of atomic explosions will be happening?

    * Radioactive elements that are inside the bubble will be much more dangerous to the outside environment.

    * maybe the bubble will effectively become a hole-puncher in the world, if everything that enters it accelerates and leaves its current frames of reference.

      I'm not so sure about the gravity decrease. Sure if gravity is caused by gravitons you would expect that, but we don't have any reason to think gravitons exist per say, so i'm not sure the time dilation would change the effect of spatial curvature.

      So the FCC won't be approving this sort of device anytime soon. /snark

      That strongly follows /u/ulyssessword speculation about pressure and heat too, I am thinking this bubble more and more strongly represents the vacuum of space as time passes.

      Seriously though, thanks for the speculation. I think I have a solid framework I can use to write about and build off of. Affecting the EM spectrum was not something I had previously considered.

    I've seen this question (or something along those lines) before on /r/AskPhysics, and unfortunately, it's a lot deeper than it looks. You see, the answer really depends on how exactly time is being sped up. If you're actually somehow accelerating *the flow of time itself*, then you've already completely broken physics as we know it, and it becomes impossible to give you a good answer (since any such answers must rely on *known* physics).

    With this in mind, your first task should be one of the following:

    1. Conceptualize a way to achieve this "acceleration" effect that remains at least somewhat compatible with real-world physics. (E.g. perhaps everything inside the bubble experiences reduced inertial mass? Pros: things mostly behave as you would naively expect things to behave in a region of sped-up time. Cons: it's unclear how such a phenomenon might affect massless quantities such as light, if it affects them at all.) 
    2. Invent a different underlying set of physics that your universe runs on which is compatible with such regions of sped-up time. This latter approach seems, if anything, even more difficult than the former, but if you pull it off successfully you might end up with something *really* cool on your hands. (As a _very_ rough starting point: perhaps this is a universe where Newtonian mechanics or something like them holds rather than relativity? This has... well, there are a lot of problems with this that still need to be addressed, such as the fact that the speed of light in such a universe would be *infinite*.)

    TL;DR: Talking about bubbles with sped-up time is hard.
    ```

    - u/Afforess:
      ```
      Good point on the framework being important. I'm imagining our world, our physics (as closely as possible), and the universe being a computer simulation. "Time sped up" then means the affected bubble receives 100 simulated frames of plank time for each frame of the simulation of the outside universe. This makes sense if everything can be described as discrete particles that can be simulated but breaks down if not. For example if light acts as a discrete point in space it either receives 100/1 frames of updates or it does not. However if it is a wave bordering the edge of the bubble does it receive 100, 50, 1 or some other amount of updates? Does the uncertainty principle apply to the underlying computer or is fuzziness a part of the map and not the territory? 

      I am not certain about a lot of this but I probably will hedge in the direction of vagueness because I don't want the inhabitants of said universe to be able to use time bubbles to leak details of the above universe.
      ```

        > "Time sped up" then means the affected bubble receives 100 simulated frames of plank time for each frame of the simulation of the outside universe.

        Ooooh, this makes a number of important differences. For one thing, it means that things leaving the bubble don't stay accelerated.

        Consider an oxygen molecule, bumbling along through the air. It's in the time-sped-up bubble. travelling at 1m/s relative to the observer in the bubble (measured with his sped-up clock - the observer outside the bubble sees 100m/s). Then it bumbles off to the edge and drops out of the bubble; it loses 99 out of every hundred frames, but its speed doesn't suddenly jump up to 100m/s. Its speed is still 1m/s. So, to the outside observer, it suddenly drops in speed by 100x.

        This is happening to every molecule that attempts to leave (and about 100 are leaving for every one that enters) so before long, you'll have a continuous, spherical wind blowing out of the timesped sphere in all possible directions.

  Continuing where I left off [last Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5optr4/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dcl9ap0/).

  Kung Fu Battle Wizard setting:

  **Concept:**

   Humanity isn’t on top of the foodchain. Rather, humans are forced to huddle in heavily forified settlements while being surrounded on all sides by all manners of scary animals, many dwarfing the size of humans, and still very agile.

  Nonetheless, there’s still a need from time to time for humanity to step outside, explore the world, and gather resources, or to travel from one settlement to the next. 

  Enter the elite soldiers known as ninja, who wield the power of chakra better than any other in combat environment. They are heavily specialized for movement and parkour, and their effort is focused on outrunning and outsmarting monsters rather than hunt them, perfect for the environment and challenges they contend with on a day to day basis.

  There are three classes of ninja in this setting:

  Scouts - Free ranging explorers. They look for opportunities and dangers. This may be looking for resources, or looking for creatures which may endanger supply lines.

  Runners - Couriers who runs on known fixed routes. They carry packages in pocket dimensions and are the crucial supply lines between settlements.

  Heavy combat - Their job is to defend settlements, resource extraction locations, outposts, convoy, and VIPs.

  **Environment:**

  If there is anything to be said about the environment, it is their sheer scale and lack of flatness, starting with the very ground.

  Earthquakes are a frequent occurrence, running the gamut of very strong but rare to weak but frequent, causing the ground to take all sort of shape, anything but flat. Most of the ground would be very tough for humans to walk on, as they are frequently very steep.

  Another force of nature to contend with are fast moving waters, which are unpredictable and torrential, carving cave systems, creating further elevations.

  Finally, life itself seem to frequently be on the large side. Trees often rose hundred meters into the air, their branches and roots creating natural highways for humans and other critters.

  Beasts of all kind frequently outnumber humans, are huge, and often have their own special chakra abilities.

  **Resources:**

  Light crystals: Useful crystals that usually emit the right kind of wavelength, without emitting useless infrared radiation. They are the primary mean of growing food for colonies, or otherwise it would be impossible to practice agriculture.

  **Power and Abilities:**

  Every human beings born uses chakra, and have roughly the same basic powers, though only a fraction of the population will be scouts and warriors.

  Chakra Adhesion: To navigate the three dimensional terrain of the world, they must be able to stick to walls and other objects. Otherwise humanity would not survive in the world.
  Charka Boosting: At time, jumping between chasm and gaps may be the only option.
  Enhanced Kinesthetic Sense: Anybody could easily fall to their death if they made the wrong move, so it’s important for people to be highly aware of their own bodies and what they are doing.
  Enhanced Upper Body Strength: Since the world is three dimension, all four limbs must be used.
  Sigilism: A relatively undeveloped science. By drawing diagrams certain way, it’s possible to create chakra effects independent of a person.
  Justu: Any techniques casted by the user in the form of handsigns to create effects. Although handsigns are not strictly necessary, and could be omitted, it makes creating effects easier. Using a justu without handsigns is often a sign of mastery. 

  **Sigilism**

  The art of creating magic through the drawing of sigilism and its infusion by charka.

  Sigilmasters - Scientists, engineers, and craftmen who study and practice sigilsim. They spent their time drawing and infusing sigils, but also experimentation. Almost every part of the process must be done with care, lest harm will come to sigilmasters or their users.

  Crafting or drawing sigils must be done with good craftmanships as the tolerance for error is high. Infusion of a sigil must be done with knowledge of how it work and how to shape one’s charka.

  Materials must be chosen carefully. Drawing must be done with charka-conductive materials, such as blood, ink, certain type of metals, and so forth. The medium must be nonconductive to charka. Frequently, this would be animal skin, wood, or clay.

  Type of Sigils:

  Storage Sigil - Store objects in pocket dimensions at the volume of one cubic meter with one-fifth the mass. This is what make ninja logistic and trade between colonies possible. 

  **Colonies:**

  While there are hunter-gather bands, most humans live in colonial cities. Colonies, unlike our cities are self contained supporting environment, heavily fortified. The world agriculture is synonymous with cities.


  **Questions:**


  What is the origin of humanity?

  How did the first colony developed?
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    > *What is the origin of humanity?*

    I'm always partial to "Humanity isn't from around here." Could humans ultimately be descended from Earth? If there's chakra to begin with, it wouldn't be unreasonable to suppose that there are places with more or less chakra. Maybe there was a shift in the amount of chakra in Earth's universe, ultimately allowing people to figure out how to use it to cross to other universes (with Earth as a hub).

    Then there was another shift, and the outposts in this (and every other) world were cut off. 

    Also, can light crystals be grown?
    ```

  - u/Radvic:
    ```
    > What is the origin of humanity? How did the first colony developed?

    Ideas:

    Normal evolution in a world split into two (or more) parts: Chakra monsters originated on one side, then expanded to the other(s) as an invasive species. Humanity has been on the decline ever since.

    Colony mission from Earth (or some place without Chakra monsters), something went wrong and memories were lost, or old earth became a legend became forgotten. But the materials from the ship were used to form the first colony.

    Chakra is a technological development of humanity gone wrong. It warped the planet and animals, making the world as it is. It's only success was the few powers it granted humans, who have been backpedaling ever since.
    ```

- u/trekie140:
  ```
  I just saw a YouTube video about Valve cracking down on illegal gambling with CounterStrike GO skins and I've got a cool idea for a Black Mirror-esque sci-fi story I want to write down. The way the gambling works is that skins are traded between Steam accounts between gamblers and bots run by the gambling dens, so I got the idea about criminals in the future using robots who pretend to be human to commit crimes in the real world.

  It probably wouldn't be that easy for a robot to get fake ID in the future, but it's still a really cool idea. It could be like Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, except the rogue androids are acting the behest of other humans instead of independent goals. Or maybe it takes place in a world where humans have started uploading their minds and suddenly there isn't an easy way to tell who's a bot and who isn't. It's just a thought, but it's one with a lot of potential.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Running a quest on SV at the moment, and been thinking of the magic system I'm going to introduce eventually. 

  The big theme behind it is "Change". Essentially, you cannot create or destroy anything with magic, only alter it. Further, magic isn't something you learn, it's something you *use.* Belief (or Quintessence) coalesces into items that you use to perform magic through. There are three broad categories of items:

  Charms: Small trinkets that can be made easily (eg Witch-Doctor rituals) that perform variable effects but have a one-time use. Like a feather that can let you glide for five seconds or a bead that will purify a pool of water.

  Icons: These ones are rarer and take longer to make , usually the result of decades of investment by an individual or years of desperate need by a society. Like a doll that can help you in all manners of agriculture (and provides a bonus to growing plants) or a chalice that lets you absorb the strengths of any animal whose blood you drink from it (for a limited time). 

  Artifacts: Singular, unique existences that are the product of a culture believing in something for centuries. I have a few ideas, but the main one right now is a crystal ball that contains a God of Knowledge that will answer any question you give it (usefulness of the answers nonwithstanding).
  ```
