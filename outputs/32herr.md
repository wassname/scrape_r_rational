  It probably wasn't, but I kept thinking this was some sort of reference to the button.

  I could see myself giving several different answers to this sort of test, depending on many factors down to even things affecting my mood like the time of day and when I last had a meal; I don't think I'd like to be classified by something so... arbitrary. 

  Consider Chris Anvil's story Test Ultimate short story (go read it if you haven't*): a jump into a pool of predatory fish, encouraged by an authority figure, seems pretty similar. I would be far more likely to jump into that pool than I would to jump from the tower, simply because I am irrationally extra afraid of heights but I am not extra afraid of piranha... 

  Also, I for one enjoy the company of those who approach things differently from myself at least as much as those who are similar...

  An interesting and thought-provoking story, though.

  \* You can snag a lot of Chris Anvil's stuff from the 1635 Baen CD released with full allowance for free copying/redistribution of the CD's contents, from http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/ . Test ultimate shows up in one of the two Interstellar Patrol books there.

    Agreed. Do I even want to work with the kind of people who think this is a good test?

  Green goes east, blue goes north, brown goes west, white goes south, grey goes down...

  The pattern's missing one. What about up?

  (P.S. White is clearly the best colour.)

  Hmm.  My actual reaction would probably be some mixture of white and gray, with a very strong tendency to signal blue-robedness because I'm not-so-secretly paranoid about people using my open-secret idealist tendencies against me.  The brown-robers are the ones I admire most and want to be like.

  Is there another robe color for being a fucked-up person?

    "- leap from this tower," said the gray-robed figure.

    The dizzying drop loomed before them. After all this effort, after all these trials, after being pushed to the limits of his mind, it all came to this. What a joke.

    Jad grinned, his lips parting wider and wider until his polished teeth were fully revealed, his smile reaching up to his cheeks, then his eyes, then his eyebrows. He put his hand on the gray-robed figure's shoulder. Jad was a picture of joy. The laughter that shook him soon erupted into audibility, and he screamed his ecstasy from the top of the tower that all the world might know his sublime pleasure. 

    He stopped laughing, and for a moment the chamber echoed with his aborted mirth. It was pleasant, to have an audience that appreciated him. He turned to look at the gray-robed figure.

    "I get it! I got the joke, mentor. That's what this is, right? A sick joke?"

    Silence from the gray-robed figure, except for a grunt and a slap. Unperturbed, Jad continued.

    "That's the right answer, isn't it? This is all some kind of fucked-up game for you, isn't it? Answer me!"

    Jad shook the grey-robed figure violently, but still no reply. Not even a grunt any more. 

    "Why won't you ANSWER ME?"

    Finally, he let go of the gray-robed figure's neck and the man fell limply to the floor. Jad was alone at the top of the tower, now, with only echoes his companions. He laughed, and the world laughed with him.
