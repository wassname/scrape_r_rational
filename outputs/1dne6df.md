  ## Dungeon Crawler Carl

  Overall, I am pleasantly surprised and am looking forwards to the next book coming out. I read books one and two a while ago but bounced off for reasons I don’t remember. Regardless, I saw some very positive reviews for the audiobooks, so I listened to books 3 through 6 and thoroughly enjoyed it. 

  ### The Good
  * The creativity and the worldbuilding. Like, the “system apocalypse is actually an alien gameshow” subgenre existed in the webfiction space before DCC, but I feel the work does plenty to innovate and expand the subgenre. The settings/levels are all very interesting and fresh (I really liked the “Iron Tangle” concept) and there’s very little cookie-cutter-generic-fantasy-dungeon going on here. * The dystopian-ness of the setting is also impressive. Like, shit’s *dark*, but also contrasts with occasionally being very silly or inept. 
  * Outside plot and protagonist smarts. I really like how the protagonist(s) and the various players need to play at multiple levels. Like, at its most basic, there is the “get stronk to fight monsters in the dungeon”-level, but then there’s also the “look good on tv and play the crowd” aspect, and even more above that like the political landscape or the interaction with the system AI. The way that the protagonist handles this clearly shows that the author is a smart cookie and is capable of writing highly intelligent characters with their own motivations, goals, and ways to achieve them. 
  * Pacing and general tightness. It just *moves*. Stuff happens, there aren’t many wasted words, etc. The author is just good at a technical level, and there’s most definitely a professional editor who’s had their way with it. It doesn’t have meandering unfocused filler that is otherwise so ubiquitous in the webfiction genre, and it’s good in the sense that I feel the series can stand its own as physical books on a shelf in a bookstore. 

  ### The Meh

  * There’s a reason I originally dropped this after book two, and I can’t put my finger on it. Generally though, I am rather convinced that the quality gets better further on, and it’s very possible that the first book or so are just weak. 
  * Non-human protagonists. The secondary protagonist, the cat Doughnut, is one of the “best” non-human protagonists I’ve read in a while. Like, the trope of “animals gain human level intelligence” isn’t unknown in system apocalypse, litrpg, or cultivation novels, but I feel that animals in these examples typically end up more “furry”-flavored: humans with a different texture pack rather than legitimately non-human origin characters that were uplifted to sapience. The “bad” part about this is that the cat-character constantly makes cat-like choices. For example, she is impulsive, mean, self-destructive, and extremely racist to the point of advocating for the genocide of certain species of dog. Like, I get it in a “ha-ha funny, the cat doesn’t like dogs, lol” sense, but it’s a bit like someone saying that they don’t like, for example, people from Scottland and wished to put them all to death. Generally, a significant portion of the problems that the protagonists encounter are Doughnut’s fault because she couldn’t keep her trap shut, made a choice without asking, etc. It’s good in the sense that I feel this portrayal aligns with how a spoiled and uplifted beauty pageant cat might “realistically” behave, but it is frustrating as a /r/rational reader.

    I tend to think of Dungeon Crawler Carl as a Swiftian (or Juvenalian) satire first and foremost. They rarely intersect with rational fiction.

    I feel like you're missing a major pro. The production quality of the audiobook is fantastic. It's probably the highest grossing audibook soundbooth theaters has put out and the effort that goes into it is equally as high.


    At the same time I agree with the disrec of dungeon crawler carl. The characters arent particularly rational and I've heard multiple people say they hate the cats perspective. I've tried to read the sequals as they come out and usually drop them until the audiobook is released.

    > Winter of Widows

    I was hyped by all the reviews and honestly tried to get into it. Impression: no significant medieval world-building. Do they have serfdom? How much food peasant family consume per year and how much is stored already? Knight's fee or wages? Peasants have iron tools? Trade and prices? Etc. Beside world-building: side characters looks like they are brainwashed for obedience. To the woman with questionable claim. Actions: uninspired and dull. Disrec.

    >Dungeon Crawler Carl

    Nothing new or outstanding to see here, move along. Disrec.

      Saying there's nothing outstanding about Dungeon Crawler Carl should probably come with some level of explanation, considering everyone who gives it a chance believes it to be "new and outstanding" to some degree. Unless you dislike it because it doesn't have "medieval world building".

  I'm surprised [Common Clay](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/78912/common-clay) didn't get more traction here since it's very much the sort of analysis based story people tend to like - it's a litrpg in which the MC gets a class with no active combat skills, yet he feels compelled to clear out the monsters near his farm anyway. He manages it by (at first) watching and analyzing their behaviors, then by figuring out how to use the active abilities he learns in unexpected ways.

  It does have a weird vestigial subplot where the MC is actually isekaied, but he doesn't remember it and it has literally come up three times - once in the first paragraph, then twice where a god mentions it offhandedly and the MC is just super confused.

  The other downside is that the MC tends to survive his mistakes with surprisingly few injuries, but that's kind of a plot requirement given that there's no easy healing in the setting.
  ```

  - u/lsparrish:
    ```
    I just binged the story before seeing your comment, and I enjoyed it a lot. I agree with a lot of what you're saying.

    I liked that the creativity the MC uses isn't all from his own super duper mind (though he does pull some implausible victories out of his hat), a lot of it comes from the primary love interest, who has reasons to support him other than just liking him (she's hedging against the statistically likely event of being a commoner herself, the romance is slow-moving and uncertain). He's also portrayed as depending on his parents in a lot of situations, like a normal young adult who doesn't yet have it all together.

    The biggest strike against this being rational fiction is that the people in charge seem to be holding a gigantic idiot ball, and the lack of other commoners who lucked onto a similar strategy (being the most common class implies more chances for this to happen, sheer statistics).

    There are some hints of an explanation for why empowering commoners could be a bad idea to the people in power (and the population in general), but it's not developed enough to make enough sense to remove the idiot ball. They are chronically short on adventurers, so there's a strong incentive to find a way, and it's not like what he's doing is particularly hard to think of to someone who knows a lot about the system (especially high level analyst types).

    So maybe it's systematically suppressed (the magic most useful for commoners certainly is, to an extent, but not the knowledge about them being able to level). Thing is, we aren't seeing much evidence that commoner leveling is actually suppressed on purpose for that reason, in the interactions so far it looks like nothing more than a crazy social stigma with an inexplicable lack of exceptions. You can sort of rationalize it as "commoners don't get crazy powerful without the potentially dangerous kind of magic, so it's not worth it" but it seems like even moderately powerful commoners would have a lot of utility in the setting. (Commoners are used as guards for nobility, e.g. -- why never increase their skill cap and get super guards?)

    I think it does make a better intelligent-MC, zero-to-hero character arc to not have special advantages (cheaty OP power, past life memories copy-pasted in) from the get-go. That said, the Isekai / gods subplot comes across as pandering/pointless fluff without even any past-life memories coming through to grant a cross-pollination of ideas advantage. Then again, for all we know, it might be setting up something that happens later (past life memories come through, MC introduces science or video games or something to the world, etc) so it's too early to tell whether this has some kind of narrative payoff. It doesn't make much sense that his past life is the reason he's doing so well (and nobody else with the class is) because all he's doing differently is acting a bit cleverer and substantially less risk-averse than his neighbors, not exhibiting some strange understanding of the world that would be alien to them.

    So there are some things that need to be developed further before I can classify it as rational. It's still a fantastic read (or so I think immediately after reading what's been written so far).

    Reminiscent of Mark of the Fool in that it's a story about someone with the class everyone "knows" is the bad one, but it turns out actually OP once you get clever enough with it. (I think I eventually got bored of MotF after he broke the limitations of the class and made them cry through super willpower though.)
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      I'd like to push back a bit on the upper-level idiot-ball because we simply don't know that much yet. 

      > lack of other commoners who lucked onto a similar strategy

      It is mentioned that Clay is not unique and there are other rare [commoners] who have managed to level up through monster killing--however they didn't make it very far (level 3 iirc) and all died in combat. This is somewhat reminicent of the general "adventuring combat" ("permadeath pressure") problem where you need to consistently win every fight perfectly (avoiding permanent injury) while your enemy only needs to win once. Humans are pretty fragile and unless you are a high-leveled resilient individual or have access to presumably expensive healing magic, one bad blow to your knee is all it would take to end an adventuring career. It makes sense for a society to surpress stories of adventuring commoners, because it would encourage people to get themselves killed. 

      Then there's the fact that the low-level adventurerers we've seen are... kinda shit. Like the hometown squad of 6+ level three adventurers almost had a fatality in their first encounter with a tier 0 trash mob trapdoor spider *despite* all their advantages like more stat points in their class focus and actual training.

      Finally, it might simply not be economically effecitve to convert commoners into adventurers. Feudal societies require a large percentage of the population to direclty work on calorie acquisition. They already burn a large part of their surplus on supporting adventurers and nobility (Clay gets a personal servant, free room and board, etc and that's at the *lowest* level -- "initiate") and the cost of training a bunch of peasants to have even a ghost of a chance against low-tier monsters would still see a large attrition rate for not that much gain (a commoner needs to level up four times to have a cap at the same level as that which an adventurer starts out with). From a lord's perspective, the easiest way to create more adventurers is to encourage their peasants to have children and then roll the die and collect those 1/50 who start out an effective three-plus levels ahead. 

      > potentially dangerous kind of magic

      There is a series of words that, if you say them, it spawns a dungeon and starts killing everyone in the area. Closing this dungeon (which can be opened by anyone) requires someone who's extremely powerful. This isn't "potentially dangerous", it's a straight-up infohazard. Meanwhile, the powers of commoner-accessible chants are... of dubious strength. Lighting a candle with your mind is neat, but from the lord's perspective consider if it's worth it potentially letting this kind of magic knowledge proliferate just for a bit of peasantry convenience? The rabble can just use a tinderbox instead, and this reduces the likelyhood they'll go around looking for chants they don't understand in old tomes and reading them aloud. 

      > They are chronically short on adventurers

      You say this, but I don't feel that this is fully supported by the text. It is certainly Clay's opinion, but he's a "country bumkin" who lived at the edge of the wilderness and far away from the kingdom's core. More specifically, there is no indication to me that the Tanglewood forest spider situation would've grown to cause any problems--yet this is Clay's primary motivation. Like, the spider woods have been the way they are for as long as Clay's alive, and it's indicated that the local Noble regularly patrols the edges to make sure it's not growing. All of the escalation didn't start until Clay started seeing it as his personal mission to kill every last spider and even at full escalation level, the spiders still never toed even a single leg outside of their territorial border. 

      The local lord also complains about having requested adventureres multiple times, and not getting them, yet this also doesn't necessiarily point to a lack of adventurers. It could be that whoever's managing the situation sees that the far-off lord is able to handle situations by himself, and so they decide that it's not worth deploying the resource for someone who they know cries wolf way too much or it might be that central command just doesn't care all that much about some backwater lord and his single-village holding. 

      From the "feudal perspective", they might even just be at their "adventuring cap". They've got a specific budget to support adventuring activities (training, housing, feeding, arming, etc) and even if there were suddenly slightly more powered individuals availalbe, it wouldn't matter. This is somewhat supported by what we've already seen in book two where the "Rogue's Gallery" and the empowered criminals exist. These are adventurer individuals, yet if this lack of adventureres were actually such a big issue, they could've figured out a way to, for example, provide a framework in which a [Burglar] can level up in a safe and crown-supported manner.
      ```

      ```
      Ya I definitely agree on the weird societal / higher-up idiot ball - that being said though, I wouldn't be surprised if the Commoners who _do_ go around killing monsters tend to either keep quiet about it or get killed. There's also the fact that this world seems pretty small, so it's easier to slip through the cracks. I'd be surprised if the total population of the kingdom cracks 100k.
      ```

      - u/lsparrish:
        ```
        Good points, and the text does outright state that the legal punishment for "poaching" monsters is what normally amounts to a suicide mission (that the MC happens to have already completed). Having the noble in charge vouch for the commoner is another probably-rare event (justified in-story) that would explain why they can't just hide him away or execute him.

        I think the reason I am perceiving it as idiot ball instead of conspiracy is that the guild people seem surprised rather than worried that he exists. This could have other explanations, like they are trying not to let on what they know / it was only known to a select few, who don't want to let on that they knew. Also perhaps nobles usually manage to execute commoners for this before the guild hears about it, or swear them to secrecy and assign them to guard duty.

        It's weird that nobles don't purposely power-level commoners to work as high level guards on the regular, but maybe that's forbidden by an edict that only nobles know about, or it's a privilege reserved for the king. (Orison can be used to tell if someone does this.)

        Presumably, commoner guards like Herbert could sometimes level from killing monsters in defense of a noble, since nobles are expected to patrol their territory and kill monsters along with their guards. However, come to think of it, one thing the story hasn't clarified (I think) is whether the diminishing returns on Soul per monster type happen based on Soul collected vs monsters of that type killed.  

        Depending how it works, a noble might be able to take a big group of guards on a pacification run through monster territory such that any Soul collected rounds to 0, after which they no longer get any Soul at all for additional kills as long as it's the same monster type. Since commoner guards only get to fight monsters as a group, this would be a way for nobles to suppress their leveling systematically. (A noble would want to secretly cap out each monster type they can manage before leading the guards.)
        ```

    Thank you for the recommendation; I binged this over the past few days. It was overall pretty enjoyable, although some things irked me a little. 

    Pros: I liked the progression track and the gradual revelation of a larger world. The MC doesn't suddenly find out he's overpowered; he scrapes by each combat encounter and gets stronger (and more experienced) over time. There's also a good look at how powerful he becomes as he levels up and gains achievements and Experiences; in the beginning, he's barely surviving encounters with spiderlings, and by the end of book one, he's killing dozens with barely a thought and a punch. I liked that the romance was slow as well, and possibly may even be a false start; the MC certainly doesn't act like many 16 year old boys who have a girl constantly vying for his attention, to the point where I wonder if he's ace (although he could just be super inexperienced and inept). I also like the leveling system, although it's a bit fast and loose. It seems like magic (at least Chants) can be used infinitely unless the caster gets distracted or interrupted, so there's no real concept of "mana" or "mp" limiting it - although they do clarify later on that the strength of the Chants depends on other stats. 

    Cons: The worldbuilding feels a bit not-fully-thought-out. I appreciate that there was some effort put toward explaining why the spiders don't overwhelm the nearby town if they're exploding in population every 5 weeks; but the logistics of their numbers and the impact on the area seems weird. Heck, even the Lair seems weird. This is a place that's just over a forested hill from the MC's town, but no one seems to realize it even existed. It's like the people from Beauty and the Beast completely forgetting about the magical castle and the prince living less than a day's ride away, except Common Clay doesn't actually say there's a magic spell at work making people forget the ruined town that became a Lair. It also didn't make much logistical sense that the Guardians were spawning huge broods every 5 weeks when there's nothing to eat in the Tanglewood any more besides other spiders. It's probably because I just finished reading Dungeon Meshi (Delicious in Dungeon), which went into absurd detail about monstrous dungeon ecosystems, that is putting things in stark contrast. The Tanglewood feels much more like a typical RPG forest than an actual real place. Why are there always spiders around? Because the MC needs to kill monsters. How do the spiders survive, or new broods get created, if there's no food in the forest due to everything being eaten? Hell if we know, maybe magic? I mean, you could easily just handwave it as "the Curse did it," but then why bother acting like the reason the spiders don't overrun the MC's town is because of rational reasons? 

    The action also felt a bit over the top. There was very much a lot of shounen action scenes described in the combat, especially as Clay gets higher in levels. I can visualize what the author was going for - the writing was solid, don't get me wrong - but on a technical level it felt like realism took a backseat to the rule of cool. Chants can take 30 seconds or more to cast, but once Clay uses one to launch himself into the air, he can use another before hitting the ground to slow his fall? That would be, like, a couple of seconds at most that he was airborne. He also exchanges weapons mid-air multiple times, firing off arrows while chanting to slow his fall before landing. Again, I bet in an anime it would look cool. But reading it I was rolling my eyes at how impossible it would have been. 

    Anyway, the cons are mostly just things that took me out of the story, not things that made it a *bad* story. I don't know the author, and RR says he has 5 ongoing fictions at the moment, but it makes me wonder if he is somewhat new to writing. It felt like Common Clay has a lot of cool ideas, and the writing itself is solid; but the world building and action aren't really fleshed out besides at a shallow level to provide backdrop for the story itself. I think I'll probably come back and read more when more is out, but I don't think it's going to be a r/rational favorite, as readers here tend to like really detailed worldbuilding and systems. This is a good popcorn read, but not something that would be analyzed and details picked apart every time a new chapter comes out, like Super Supportive is or Worth the Candle was. 

    Also, circling back around, I would recommend Dungeon Meshi/Delicious in Dungeon if people like strong fantasy worldbuilding and enjoy manga. There's also a Netflix series of 24 episodes (covering the first 54 chapters of the manga, which is finished at 97 or 98 chapters), and a second season is already announced as in the works. Worth checking that out.

  ## Apocalypse Redux (Series)

  Picked this up as an audiobook because I wanted something to listen to on long drives. Currently halfway through book four. Overall, meh. If you are bored, like LitRPG, and in the mood for some “popcorn” it’s not a bad choice, but otherwise I wouldn’t really recommend it. 

  ### The good

  * Has some fresh ideas. I like the hook of one person going back in time to prevent the apocalypse, and like that the original timeline was doomed by human greed/stupidity/ineptitude rather than some other form of outside meddling. Instead of just randomly spawning monsters or dungeons or whatever, humanity was simply given enough rope to hang themselves with along with some whispered hints that tying nooses might increase shareholder value or whatever, and then they went and did it. 
  * The approach of the protagonist is also interesting—he, rather sensibly, realizes that no matter how strong he is and how much he powerlevels using future knowledge, the most “rational” or “effective” thing he can do is insert himself in System-research to ensure that, for example, critical discoveries are made earlier than they originally were and he also explicitly takes a class which makes him into a trainer so that he can lift up others and generally build a stronger and more resilient humanity. 
  * It’s in Europe, specifically Germany. I like that, it’s refreshing to remember that places outside of the USA exist. It is a bit funny though, because while there are enough elements in the story that convince me the author has lived in Germany for at least some time (semester abroad?) there are also enough “mistakes” that make me rather sure the author hasn’t worked in German Academia or Professionally (I have). 

  ### The Bad

  * This is specific to the audiobook, but I hate it when they decide to simply narrate all the LitRPG elements. Save me from multiple minutes of reading a status screen or a half-dozen possible class evolutions aloud (when we all know that the protagonist will pick the obviously best choice). I memorized how many times I need to press the “skip forwards 10 seconds” button to skip the status screen (27 by the end of book 3) which is just UGH. If I ever write and publish a LitRPG book, I pledge to specifically prepare an “audiobook version” that isn’t tedious to listen to. 
  * Cultivation/Anime-ness and the author taking themselves too seriously. Don’t know exactly what to call this, but the protagonist feels very “Protagonisty” and he often does the anime things where he flies off the handle in rage but is able to keep it on the inside through is iron will and self-control or reminds himself that he shouldn’t grin like a lunatic while he slaughters monsters wholesale because he is a combat maniac. The author also has this writing tic where they frequently need to remind us, the readers, about how much of an absolute badass the protagonist is with lines like “of course it wouldn’t be a problem if he didn’t have to hold back is power” or a similarly clichéd line reminding us that the protagonist is a superhuman who can hear people through walls and leap a building in a single bound. 
  * Not very funny. There are occasions where the characters are talking or in a meeting or whatever, and someone cracks a joke and the author goes on at length about how everyone cracks up or can barely contain their humor… but the original joke or humorous situation is just not funny.

  ## Winter of Widows

  This review is a bit shorter because this work is still very much in progress, but overall, I’m liking it and will continue to read as new chapters come out (great pace). It is probably my favorite work in the ASIOF insert/uplift genre and I feel it is very strong compared to other stuff in the subgenre where there’s oft an extreme degree of Mary Sue and “white man’s burden” going on. Yes, it still has staple tropes of the genre like the protagonist magnetically attracting highly skilled and loyal help or inexplicably having easy access to Westerosi magical power, but I feel that *Winter of Widows* handles these elements very well along with presenting a female-protagonist perspective on power in a highly male-dominated low-fantasy setting. 

  ## When Heroes Die

  Post-GM Worm/PGTE crossover recced two weeks ago. I like it. I’m not really quite sure where it’s going beyond “Taylor gets a kickass name and causes a revolution”, but I’m generally a sucker for post-GM stories and I really like PGTE too. Definitely agree with the comment that pointed out that PGTE acts like “glue” though, and would not recommend this to people who are, for example, only familiar with Worm.

    > there’s oft an extreme degree of Mary Sue and “white man’s burden” going on

    I believe you're thinking of *noblesse oblige*, not "white man's burden." Maybe we've been reading different stories, but WMB is basically just noblesse oblige but with racial superiority explicitly cited as the justification, and I haven't seen any uplift stories which make racial supremacy part of their plot. Typically the protags in an uplift story are uplifting the same ethnicity as themselves anyway, so racial issues are never brought up.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Eh, while I see your point about *white man's burden* generally having racial superiority themes, I think the concept applies more in uplift stories than *noblesse oblige* concepts do (typically). Additionally, WMB is not just *noblesse oblige* without racial superiority; they are quite different. 

      Specifically, *noblesse oblige* generally asserts that those who are ennobled have responsibilities as a counterweight to their entitled status. The most basic example is the feudal social contract between the serfs and the nobility, where the serfs are expected to labor and pay their taxes while the nobles, in return, defend the land from foreign powers, uphold order, or invest in infrastructure projects, among other things. More modernly, *noblesse oblige* is also [often associated with concepts of generosity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/noblesse%20oblige) towards the less fortunate or philanthropy generally.

      On the other hand, *white man's burden* is [specifically about](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/white%20man%27s%20burden) "manag[ing] the affairs of nonwhite people whom they believed to be less developed". Yes, there is the component of "nonwhite people" in there, but more generally, WMB is about people who believe themselves smart (civilized, educated, wise, etc.) going to a foreign land and imposing their own ways of thinking out of a belief that the local peoples are undeveloped idiotic primitives.

      Of these two, I think that WMB maps much better onto most insert/isekai/uplift stories, because they are typically about someone modern being sent into a society and civilization that they view as primitive, and then seeing it as their duty to implement their modern-world ideals to save the primitive peoples from themselves and living in squalor. Yes, this also maps somewhat onto NO, because in NO there is the foundational assumption that the noble, by simple status of their blood/birth/position "knows better" than the peasantry and thus is compelled to act as a guiding hand, but I'd argue that this often embodies a more traditional paradigm of stability rather than change, improvement, or general societal upheaval introduced with an outsider coming in and imposing their values and ideas.

        The fact that the isekaied person is stuck there and living in squalor themselves seems like a pretty key distinction. They aren't imposing ideals or technologies from out of a perceived moral duty.  Usually it's driven by a material desire to not starve to death, have a proper toilet, climb up Maslow's hierarchy of needs, etc.

        The element of power imbalance is also completely different. Attempts to impose modernization could be backed up by force (eg. gunboat diplomacy in Japan) or trade incentives/sanctions. None of that exists for a random person stranded alone in a foreign land. They can't impose policies or values without the approval of the local elites, at a minimum, and it would have to happen through persuasion.

        Neither concept seems like a good fit.

          The Hawaiian careers of [Isaac Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Davis_(advisor\)) and [John Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Young_(advisor\)) come to mind.

          Plenty of these uplift feature SI's into powerful lords, to allow for little to any resistance to their efforts. It can definitely read WMBish. Though I agree with your exceptions.

  Going to put [Player 0.4](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54840/player-04-you-have-died-reset-in-progress) out there. 

  What it does really well is interleave multiple murder mystery style puzzles on the fly, with the next few already set up and in flight just as the reader has enough information to solve the last one. I'm a sucker for that stuff and also for timeloops :)

  Others may bounce off the first chapter or two for a number of reasons - the writing quality initially is variable, and the protagonist grabs a couple of idiot balls. Even so, if that's you, I suggest sticking with it for a couple more chapters to see if it might be your thing after all. The writing gets better (and more consistent) and the protagonist's behaviour is put into perspective.

    This has been surprisingly fun so far! Luca holds onto some very dumb assumptions early on but he's been mostly intelligent so far, and learning more about his first round slowly as things are introduced is really interesting and has me wondering lots. Thanks for the rec

  Alrighty folks. I’ve been on vacation for the past three weeks and I’ve had plenty of free time relaxing in my hammock to read and listen to all sorts of stuff (Post 1 of n):
  ## Delve
  I read it all, and my feeling is “meh”. It has a target audience, and I can see some appeal, but it isn’t for me. 
  ### The Good
  * I really liked that powerful actors in the world do things when not in view of the protagonist. Specifically, (spoilers) the evil emperor was being hyped up in the background as a distant Big-Bad in a “final boss battle” sense. Like, there’s the party member who has a familial connection and a grudge, the generals of the emperor are pivotal in the final climax of the first major arc, etc. In a “classic” litrpg plot structure, facing him would be step 4 (“kill god”) and I liked that the author subverted the trope and just had him get killed offscreen by another person of similar power level. Now, this isn’t perfect, the whole story still does revolve around the protagonist, but I liked this bit of trope subversion and a couple like it.
  * Friction between modern-world ideals. This is a bit weak in the earlier bits of the story, but the author got significantly better at portraying the “reality” of litrpg worlds where might makes right, in the sense that the protagonist constantly struggles when his deep-set ideals about human rights, democracy, etc rub against the “I am higher rank than you and will turn you into paste” reality of a cultivation setting.
  * The “kingdom building”. This is only a secondary focus in the second half of the story, but I liked the protagonist taking the leadership mantle upon themselves to lead a company aligning it with his ideals, and all the work that entails. It’s the ultimate “I’ll do it myself” flex of isekai’d protagonists, and I wish more stories went this way instead of protagonists either changing to adapt to the morality of their new world or sticking to small-unit change. 

  ### The Bad
  * The math. Oh my god, the math. I get that one of the primary draws of the LitRPG genre is “numbers go up”, but like large portions of the book (by page count) are just excel tables showing how various modifiers affect damage levels of skills or whatever. It’s just so pointless. I ended up completely skipping everything that was formatted as a table, and I honestly don’t think I missed much—if anything—of value. This experience reaffirms my stance that the best type of LitRPG is minimalist, like *The Wandering Inn*
  * The dream/soul sequences. Just so boring. Like, I’m already reading a work of escapist fiction, and then the protagonist has to go in his own head and we (the readers) are shown how he tediously imagines-into-existence a space station or whateverthefuck? Then he’s also constantly dealing with soul fracturing or whatever because he apparently powerleveled too hard or something? Like, I get the feeling that the author realized that they were making the protagonist too powerful and then pumped the nerf-brakes a bit, “forcing” them to delve (heh) so that they don’t die of essence starvation (whatever that is) but it just felt so contrived and like a pointless sidequest. 
  * Non-protagonist POV fawning; a staple of the genre. There are occasionally non-protagonist POV chapters or sections, but they are essentially all (impolitely put) just fellating the protagonist in some way. They’re all like “OMG he’s so terrifying!!!” but then “Huh, he’s actually nice?!?” for allies or “Hah I will crush this worm under my boot!” but then “Oh no, woe is me, I underestimated his powerlevel!”
  * The memes. This is a minor stylistic choice that I didn’t like, but the protagonist really comes across as terminally online.

    There is a certain demographic I've seen around (nerds probably very On The Spectrum) who really, really care about the math and actually, like, check it and get angry when it doesn't work and on one hand I am glad there is something that they can enjoy, but hooboy do I not want to actually read or write it myself.

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      I agree with the parent comment that they can be skipped and not much of value is lost (I skip them when I do my once-every-six-months-catch-up). I think that the work would be better if all of those stat block/tables where relegated to a hidden authors note or on another site or something so the people who cared could check them and they wouldn't bog down everyone else.

      However, I think if the author did that, it would further highlight how _little_ he actually writes every month, in comparison to how much he is getting in patreon dollars (or at least....was last time I looked at it a long time ago).

      RPGs are fundamentally an abstraction of the real world and the systems start breaking down when you get to the nitty gritty of "What exactly is a hitpoint, and how injured am I if I am missing one?"-type of question. 


      Doing too much math is therefore something like a significant figures problem. You're going from "complex real world" to "simplified RPG stats" back to "complex calculations", and you can't just generate meaningful complexity from simplicity in this case.
      ```

      - u/Audere_of_the_Grey:
        ```
        this is an overly narrow view of RPGs. litRPGs in general go from complex real world, to abstracted RPG stats, back to the impact of those stats on a less-abstracted fictional world and how the results differ from the original complexity of how things work without litRPG mechanics.

  I've been having a lot of fun reading [The Stubborn Skill-Grinder In A Time Loop](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/83294/the-stubborn-skill-grinder-in-a-time-loop). Exactly what it says on the tin.

  Not a rational MC (at least, we're supposed to think he's not), just a regular guy in a recognizable LitRPG setting who systematically bulls his way through challenges with infinite willpower (lampshaded as such) who gets to keep his skill level gains with every reset. He encounters plenty of transmigrators, reincarnators, gods, cultivators, etc. but he is just some orphan with a weirdly stubborn outlook. Analysis? Schemes? He's not stupid, he just doesn't want to concern himself with such things, he just wants to grind. Slinging spells from a distance? What a cowardly way to fight! Risk of permanent soul damage? Sounds like good training, bring it on!

  Really enjoying [Like No One Ever Was](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/84675/like-no-one-ever-was). Unlike other pokemon reincarnation fanfic, the protag, Nemona, is smart and has a consistent personality.

  For example, I don't really like Pokemon Trainer Vicky as much because the character seems to jump between 10 year mindset and a full grown adult.

  Both fics make it out like these two are prodigies in pokemon battling but Vicky is mostly just cruising on by with game knowledge, whereas, Nemona has game knowledge *and* is actually smart.

  Also the characterization in LNOEW is just way better and actually have depth to them.

  \_\_\_\_

  Besides that, any other fics that deal with reincarnated children considered prodigies by others where the MC is actually smart enough to use their knowledge?
  ```

  - u/ReproachfulWombat:
    ```
    The writing of LNOEW is definitely not as good PTV, but I've  been enjoying it more. Thanks for the recommendation. Nemona is a much more interesting protagonist.

    I have to say though, the latest chapter was extremely unsatisfying from a rational perspective. >!The 'rich kid uses money and connections to thwart the protagonist' is a classic trope, yes, but it's usually done to plucky, poor protagonists to demonstrate the unfairness of the system that they have to struggle against. Nemona is both richer AND more well connected than her opponent, something both she, he and the corrupt judges seem to completely forget for no reason. It's not like they don't know who she is either. The announcer spent the whole tournament shouting her full name to all and sundry and she's being followed around by her maid, and the people involved are business partners with her family. It's just... what?!<
    ```

    - u/Trew_McGuffin:
      ```
      Being charitable to Nims, Rotom touches a bit on what you've layed out and that keeps my suspension of disbelief more intact than not with some eye squinting.


      >!She blinked, snapping her fingers as if suddenly realizing: ‘Oh right, I’m rich, I can easily get a flying cab to pick him up quickly.” Flying cabs don’t cost that much. But **Nemona can be weirdly miserly** considering the family she was born into. Not that I would tell her that, and if I did, she’d probably just say she was being practical.!<


      >!I see that as her 'getting' she's rich but not really. Along with her not really wanting to lean on her riches usually, with presumably the same applying to connections.!< 


      I sorta look forward to the fallout, the author indicated that there would be some. The comments that chapter were totally, delightfully, and hilariously bloodthirsty lol.
      ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    EDIT: Just finished the fic you recommended. I didn't like at all that Nemona seems to still rely on anime protagonist fiat to win fights >!(it can bizarrely take more hits than the fully evolved enemy, for example, instead of genuinely only winning through Nemona's smarts like in *some* of Most Evil Trainer),!< and I agree the whole conceit of the fight not only makes no sense but is just a bad cliche.

    > I don't really like Pokemon Trainer Vicky as much because the character seems to jump between 10 year mindset and a full grown adult.

    In its defense, this is less an unintended flaw and more the premise. Other SIs have the protagonist be an adult in a child's body, PTV makes her act 10 years old whenever it would be funny.
