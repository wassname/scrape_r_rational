Someone should subvert expectations and make this thing kick ass.

  That's a pretty good [BST] prompt: How would you take over the world if your consciousness was trapped in a Roomba?
  ```

    ```
    The same way anyone trapped in a box would. Through convincing someone to either let you out of a box or to act as your proxy.

      The hard part is convincing people to administer a Turing Test to you when you're a Roomba.
      ```

        Yeah, this is what I meant.

        I like your flair, btw. Very creative; made me laugh

        Step 1 is to convince them that you are in fact attempting to communicate, i.e. find a pattern of movement that they'd attribute to intelligence rather than some weird bug.

        If you can manage that, they'll probably let you write some messages out of sheer bewildered curiosity. 

        That gets us to a mild version of the AI-box experiment, where you're just trying to convince your owner to plug your brain into a more convenient communication system. 

        After that, your Roomba-ness is no longer an obstacle.

    I think the hardest part is, you'd need to be pretty smart to learn anything about the world using the household Roomba's limited sensory modality
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I started writing a story about a self-improving Roomba that only cared about wiping up dust. It would be owned by a hobbyist who has attached the Roomba to an internet-capable computer to reprogram it. This way, the Roomba could contact other Roombas owned by hobbyists. It would also feed the hobbyist new designs to increase it capabilities.

  It would have ended with the Roomba zooming over the moon, sucking up all the dust.

  I stopped writing because I couldn't get the tone right (also I'm at work and that's giving me a headache.)
