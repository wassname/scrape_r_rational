## Joss Whedon's Dollhouse

### Post:

I wanted to recommend Joss Whedon's series "Dollhouse". 

Setting [copy-pasted from Wikipedia]:

The show revolves around a corporation running numerous underground establishments (known as "Dollhouses") around the globe that program individuals referred to as Actives (or Dolls) with temporary personalities and skills. Wealthy clients hire Actives from Dollhouses at great expense for various purposes. 
Each Active has their original memories wiped and exists in a childlike blank state until programmed via the insertion of new memories and personalities for each mission.

...

Okay, so far we have standard fare. Starting from lame stories "hunt serial killer blah blah", the show (and its characters) progresses in an almost rationalist fashion towards exploring some possible implications / usages of this type of tech. We get the belovable combination of some power creep, scope creep and inexorable descent into full-blown apocalypse. 

TL;DR
If you like Joss Whedon (Buffy, Angel, Firefly), then you should not miss Dollhouse. Otherwise, it might be a gamble.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  I really liked Dollhouse. The season one finale ("Epitaph One"), with its flashforwards, was absolutely brilliant - there are all these implications of the technology that have been built up over the course of the season that just hammered home one by one over the course of an hour.

  And yes, it's a little uneven at times. I wish that they'd gotten a better actress for the lead, since she's outshined by the other two main dolls (Enver Gjokaj is amazing). I wish that they'd been able to skip some of the more procedural aspects that were forced on them by Fox at the beginning - episodes that you could cut entirely and it wouldn't make any difference at all. But it's still a great premise that gets pretty thoroughly explored, and I've watched it through three times now.

    I think the least rational part of it was that Joss dealt with Fox AGAIN. He seems like a smart guy, when is he going to learn?

      Dushku had an open-ended offer of a project with Fox.  She wanted Whedon.   It wasn't like Whedon went back to Fox, hat in hand.

    I cannot agree more.  What's-her-face is just not very good at playing anyone other than herself.  Enver Gjokaj showed himself to be a versatile and broad-based character actor: he should have been the star.

  I really loved the 50% of the show when the executives stopped meddling and let the writers give us some damned good cyberpunk.  *Dollhouse* is basically everything cyberpunk *should* be; it's only a wonder Topher never attempted to build a recursively self-improving Doll (and even then... those Epitaph episodes...).

  Oh, and the identity of the Big Bad is one of the greatest, most retrospectively sensible ass-pulls (in the sense that Joss admitted they *didn't actually plan it ahead of time*) in all of fiction.  It really succeeds wonderfully in giving me that "I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING BUT DIDN'T!" feeling.  The sheer Magnificent Bastardry of it all is on a level with *Following the Phoenix*'s Quirrellmort's two-day war-starting.

    Executive meddling is what *made* the latter parts of dollhouse worth watching. They gave the showrunners a fixed number of episodes to wrap this up, and suddenly it stopped faffing about.

      Other way around: they stopped mandating Thingy of the Week episodes.
      ```
