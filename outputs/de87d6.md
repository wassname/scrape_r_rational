The end of chapter eight.  Thank as always to my awesome fans.

Pyrebound is a high fantasy serial with thematic similarities to the Book of Job (I'm challenging myself to describe this thing differently every week; I realize this'n's a stretcher).  The back-cover blurb is [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/), and the story starts [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).

  That metaphorical egg dripping down Piridur's face is comic gold.
