  Not sure I'd call this rational, but it's a fun rational-adjacent deconstruction/parody of the Order of the Stick (which is, itself, a parody). 

  Regarding teleportation and communication magic, I don't think they're very reliably available. Shoujo seems to have only one wizard who can cast teleport, since the Order had to wait for him to be resurrected after he was eaten by a roc. Not sure how many casters know sending, but there's almost certainly more demand than supply, so people who ride around carrying messages (like Miko did) are still necessary.

  But getting the Order to Azure City would have been a top priority, so limited supply isn't a good reason not to use magic there. And your comic has a solution that sidesteps the Order entirely.

    I consider that to be another example of "nonsensical wasting of Miko's time", to be honest.  Any message urgent enough to warrant the attentions of a 16th-level paladin is urgent enough to just use Sending/Teleport for.

    The number of people who can cast Sending and Teleport are doubtless limited, but who exactly is going to pull rank on or outbid Shojo in terms of getting first pick on the service?  Even if the teleporting wizard he lent to Roy was unavailable for some reason, Sangwaan is also sufficiently high-level to learn the spell and he has clerics who can cast Wind Walk (a 6th-level spell, same as the Planar Ally they would have had to cast to summon angels.)  That's without reaching out to, e.g, elven allies or wizardly acquaintances of Eugene or Julia.  Or making a trip to [magic walmart](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0989.html).  This is a universe where it's basically implausible that the Guard could *not* have worked out some rapid long-distance transport options.

      Wasn't Miko estimated to be level ~10-14 in Paladin at most in the Class and Level Thread?

        Well, 12-14 of paladin plus 2 of monk, so I'm glossing over a few details.  Either way, it's clearly a waste of time for someone with her level of skill and experience.

  A lot of this won't make particular sense to people who haven't read The Order of the Stick extensively (including prequel/bonus materials), but basically-

  OOTSverse is, as you can probably gather, essentially a D&D parody universe where spells that allow instant transport and communication over long distances are, if not exactly commonplace, at least known generally to exist and pretty reliably available to high-level characters and central governments.  One of the major early plot-points is a chapter where the titular protagonists wind up being dragged in chains to azure city so that Lord Shojo, the head of a major paladin organisation, can hire them to go on a secret McGuffin quest.  Given the range of options at his disposal, Shojo's methods are inefficient to the point of verging on sabotage.

  (This is not to say there aren't any number of irrational decisions on the part of the cast earlier on, but half the protagonists are legitimately characterised as not-very-bright, so it's mostly easier to overlook.  Mostly.)

  reasons why this is not a good plan, from the gods point of view: this way, you do not stop the snarl with help from the purple diety that redcloak represents, you just keep it in its cage for a while longer. 

  the meta of OOTS is really deep, you have a posthuman community of 'gods' who have been running millions of simulations in a row to get to this point. their mind-states are directly altered by the souls worshipping them. and the problem is all down to their buddies that got killed by the snarl way back when. 

  all the mortals? they dont matter. the gods will just make a new world. what does matter, is dealing with the snarl that is trying to kill them, that is imprisoned inside the world. and the snarl may have its own world inside that mess.

    >all the mortals? they dont matter.

    The mortals in question, who are making all of the decisions shown in this comic, disagree with that position.

    Although I do agree, there are absolutely gods who don't want this outcome. There are probably gods that do, because the OOTS gods are super divided on basically every topic. But still, getting the Dark One on board with stopping the snarl is their only win condition.

    Actually, do you think that the Northern and Western gods are super mad at the southern gods? They insist on antagonizing the only hope for a lasting existence that anyone has seen in a very, very long time. I mean, yes, the Dark One is Evil, but substantially less so than some of the gods that the various pantheons put up with willingly.

      I think it's more the Dark One's habit of trying to actively murder the other Gods and/or threaten them with death if they don't kowtow to his demands that might have pissed off the Twelve.  (It's been suggested that Rat might be playing a different angle here, however, and there is the rather large question of why they don't strip their powers from Tsukiko, given all the crap she gets up to.)

      I've toyed with the idea that Dorukan might have been researching alternative options for handling the Snarl, given that his Talisman apparently had dominion over all 2nd-edition creatures.  (What 'edition' would the Snarl be, I wonder?)
