  Hopefully the dice and u/eaglejarl will be merciful and this won't wind up being the penultimate chapter :D

    I should warn you that my dice are getting very grumpy because they haven't managed to kill a single PC yet. I think they're starting to collude, and they keep whispering to one another when they think I'm not listening. I worry about what sort of rolls I'll be getting from them in the near future.

      I'm curious, what would happen if any of the PCs actually die? How about with only one survivor? All dead?
      ```

      - u/oliwhail:
        ```
        There's only one actual PC, which is Hazou. If any of the rest of the party dies, we all cry irl. If Hazou dies we aren't sure what happens, but the QMs have hinted that death won't necessarily be the end of the quest. If Akane dies, we riot.
        ```

        Pretty much what /u/OliWhail said. 

        /u/Velorien and I have discussed it pretty carefully; when you're co-authoring, killing a character is a big deal because you're killing them for the other person too. (Plus, normally the way it's going to go is that the character will die as the climactic moment of one update and then the other author has to clean up the mess in the next one.)

        Anyway, we've talked about it and decided that yes, if the dice break the wrong way then yes, we will let the relevant person die. Give the other author a head's up, but let the character die. It's made writing this a bit tense for me.

          Thank you for responding, but my question was how would you guys handle the aftermath of the death or in other words, who possibly can be the new PC if Hazou dies?
          ```

          - u/Velorien:
            ```
            It's not going to be a case of another member taking over - if a character dies, the players roll a new one, while any survivors of the original party continue to be NPCs somewhere in the world.

            Edit: That is unless the PC dies because the players have destroyed the world, which we are not at all ruling out.
            ```

              That's fair.  Mad Science has no limits.

              Though I will be endlessly sad at losing all these wonderful characters.  I'm deeply attached to every one of them.
              ```

                ```
                Us too. Please don't get them horribly killed, or at least not before the inevitable team-up with Orochimaru.
                ```

              Working on it

- u/blazinghand:
  ```
  Yu seems so reasonable from the inside
  ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    He *is* reasonable, he's just not used to social situations. Or mercy.
    ```

      > Or mercy.

      I giggled
