## [Q] Lamest superpower (challenge)

### Post:

I'm feeling like writing a superhero story. (Once I finish everything ELSE on my plate, anyway.)  Writing flying bricks and winners of the superpower lottery is boring, I'd rather write someone who gets creative with an apparently lame power.

What is the absolutely stupidest, most useless power you can think of?

          More like a paradox. If you are about to cut the wrong wire, then you start to glow and you will not do it. Therefore you are not actually in danger, therefore you do not glow. Since you do not glow on the wrong wire, you are in danger, therefore ...
          ```

          - u/ulyssessword:
            ```
            That's why there's the "if you had no danger sense" clause in the description.
            ```

            - u/sephlington:
              ```
              But the original statement didn't have that clause, thus making it a really lame superpower.
              ```

  - u/E-o_o-3:
    ```
    When you *think* you're in danger, or when you're *really* in danger regardless of what you think? Depending on the specifics of what exactly causes it to glow, you might be able to spin the latter into a generalized "answer any binary question" oracle.

      Hm. How fast can you press your hands together and release them? If we say that a light clap counts as a press, and you're a super naturally fast clapper at 4 claps per second, then you'll be producing 4 doves per second (assuming that each dove is magically carted away as soon as it's created)

      A person eats about 2.1 kg of food a day, which is roughly the mass of a dove (according to Google). There are 86400 seconds in a day, and 4 doves per second means that you can feed 345600 people per day at max rate.

      So if you're on some super-amphetamines to produce nonstop, you could feed a country the size of Belize (with some really involved distribution system), or over 1/10 the United States.
      ```

      - u/OffColorCommentary:
        ```
        How many people can I feed if I become the world's most famous stage magician and donate as much as I can?

        Because that sounds like a lot easier lifestyle.  And the super-amphetamines would be purely recreational.

        - u/6340:
          ```
          Let's say you're as popular as Beyonce. She makes $2.4 million per city. With your super-amphetamines and magical stage performance skill, you'll still only be able to pull one show a day, in order to hit prime time and get the right audiences (unless you have a very supersonic jet).

          Let's be generous and say that with your impressive transportation from being an expert performer, you can make $5 million a night on average. If we call the price of the components and the making of a meal about $5 (being generous), then you can make a million meals, and feed 333,333 people. 

          Wow, isn't it interesting that the two numbers seem to be nearly the same? Though of course, I doubt you'd be able to keep the world interested with the same act forever, and practicing new acts takes time away from our philanthropic procedure...

    So, in the general case where you can summon matter from your hands and force it to be in a specific place, this should have quite a few high-powered hacks.  The hard part is not injuring your hands.
    ```

    - u/OffColorCommentary:
      ```
      I'm going to assume the dove fully fits into the space that you sweep through with your hands, so you can only force matter into existence where you can already push your hands through.

      Actually, mechanically, let's make it be that the inside surfaces of your hands become an air-tight, dove-cross-section-shaped portal, wrapped around a dove, somewhere.  As you pull your hands apart, you move the portal so two ends of the dove are somewhere, and the middle is between your hands.  If you try to move your hands in a way that does not fit a dove, you encounter as much resistance as it would normally take to bend the dove that way (if you're strong you can use this to summon a dead dove).

      This does mean that if you're in a closed room, each dove summoned will slightly increase the air pressure.  I'm pretty sure the equivalent underwater does not actually cause a shockwave any more than it does for someone without this super power, but I could be wrong.

    > The ability to correctly guess how works of fiction will end after experiencing only a fraction of their content

    First use:  Perfect lie detector.  When someone tells you what happened in a situation, you can instantly tell that they are making up the story if your power triggers off of it.

    Second use:  unbreakable cryptographic communication, although the bandwidth varies with the specifics of the power.  Get someone to send the necessary fraction of a purpose-made story to you, along with a key to interpret the results.  For example: "the butler did it" means attack now, "the maid did it" means wait until morning, "the wife did it" means that reinforcements are incoming and so on.  Alternatively, "your orders are what the last page of this story says."

    >The ability to correctly guess the outcome of a situation, but only so long as you believe that outcome to be inconsequential (ie you don't believe you nor anyone else has any stake in it)

    How transitive is this, and what is the threshold?  Assuming very permissive limits, you could pull stunts like "I have no money bet right now.  That roulette wheel will turn up a 12.  I guess I should bet now." or compound many small things together.  "The home team will not score between 0:00 and 0:05 of the first quarter of the basketball game.  The home team will not score between 0:05 and 0:10 of the first quarter of the basketball game..." and so on for every 5 seconds of the game.  No one interval that size matters, so no one prediction fails.

    >The ability to look fashionable in any clothing

    This seems like it would need to act as the opposite effect in order to make sense:  You have the ability to look appropriate for any *situation*, as fashion is defined by where you currently are and what you are currently doing.  It would be a great power for a spy, as they could go from a posh party to hiding as a homeless man in seconds.

    >The ability to instantly vaporize yourself (works exactly once, for obvious reasons) 

    That looks like a pretty decent suicide bomb, and it's obviously undetectable.  My numbers may be off, but I got 100 kg of TNT equivalent energy.

    >The ability to grow your hair at a slightly faster rate than normal humans.

    Human hair is used to mop up oil spills because of how absorbent it is and there are organizations who collect them from barber shops. Or sell your hair to be used as wigs.
    >The ability to correctly guess how works of fiction will end after experiencing only a fraction of their content.

    You can fool others into thinking you are an oracle, ghost-write the ending to famous incomplete works, or predict the future by writing about events but with minor details changed to make it 'fiction based on a true story'.
    >The ability to synthesize random numbers.

    You can encode messages without a computer.
    >The ability to look fashionable in any clothing.

    You can disguise yourself among the rich and wealthy. You will appear wealthier than you really are and will gain respect in formal or business settings.
    >The ability to know the local time.

    Can you know the local time of the Sun, the Galaxy, or the Universe to deduce the age of the Universe to a more precise figure than 14 billion years (repeat for nearby astrological objects)? You will never need watch and you can time anything down to the millisecond.
    >The ability to instantly vaporize yourself (works exactly once, or obvious reasons).

    Any terrorist would love your ability to defeat bomb detectors and can you vaporize cut off body parts as well?
    >The ability to know whether or not (a binary value) if the injuries you currently possess will be fatal in the 24 hours.

    I'm assuming that the power is just the ability to know if your body won't be able to heal in 24 hours without medical services instead of true precognition. You can test poisons with an antidote in increasing dosages until you have the smallest amount that can kill in 24 hours and just take the antidote. Test effectiveness of safety gear where you can get hurt, but won't die instantaneously and have trained doctors ready to help. There's a lot of ways to use this power in situations where slow-acting deaths which can be treated can tell you something.
    >The ability to correctly guess the outcome of a situation, but only so long as you believe that outcome to be inconsequential (ie you don't believe you nor anyone else has any stake in it).

    Have people ask you random hypothetical situations where the majority are meaningless and you become able to predict the important ones, but you can't know which ones are important until after the prediction.
    >Constant, can't be turned off, X-ray vision.

    MRI scans are ridiculously expensive. You just saved the hospital you work at a lot of money.

      Earlier today I was reading (in one of the threads that was linked from here?  on TVTropes?  not sure) about a book in which someone had the power to get lost...and he used it while falling from an airplane.  Someone else had "arrive late to anything", and used it to arrive late to the pain of being tortured.

      Indeed you can.

      >Infiltration. Too easy. Be sure to read up on the boy bands in other countries.

      You may get some unexpected surprises when people find that Justin Bieber is infiltrating their neo nazi group.

      >"Living" is an activity.

      It is, though I'd probably make the power more limited than this- people don't actively live, they breathe and such. Also, you have no control over autonomous functions-people will breathe and be hungry regardless of what your powers do. I'd imagine the story would have a lot of exploration of what boredom worked well to stop a person and have a lot of exploration of motivation and reasons people do things.

      Suppose there was a religious extremist and you made them bored of religion to stop them. You then find out that actually what really motivated them was pleasing their companions.

      >This test has a time limit of five minutes, and consists of one essay prompt. Drawings and schematics are encouraged. The prompt is, "outline, in detail sufficient to build a working model, plans for a stable cold fusion reactor, which can be built from under $1,000 worth of parts at an average Super Wal-Mart."

      I'd probably use a different definition of ace- they perform better than the majority of testers around them, or they perform to the expectations of the tester. A test with an imprecise mark scheme like 'A working cold fusion machine' wouldn't be enough- suppose the machine actually worked via quantum bullshit, how would the tester evaluate this?

      >Mind control? Way too easy.

      Not mind control, mind alteration. You can induce love in teachers. You can't control what said teachers do.

      The power would be about ending social interaction. It wouldn't give you any magical power to kill people, it would be a mental ability involving enhanced body language reading skills and intuition and mind reading to achieve the goal of ending parties.

    > The ability to ace any test.

    You can only pass this test by writing a Friendly AI in less than 20 minutes. Your power activates and you do it somehow. 

    Let's be honest, being able to retrieve any knowledge you want based on the arbitrary definition of a test is an immediate victory.
    ```

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      You can ace this test.

      So you can perform better than 80% or so of programmers in designing a friendly AI.

      Testing implies a tester who can verify the success of your abilities and acing a test implies doing better than the average.

      Tests are often also applies en masse- if you're the only person your power may be less compliant. You can't really ace a test only you do.

      With these powers if you attempted to apply them to situations they didn't fit they might just nope you. This doesn't fit my test criteria, you're on your own.
      ```

      - u/Zephyr1011:
        ```
        > acing a test implies doing better than the average.

        Doesn't ace mean to get full marks on a test?
        ```

        - u/Nepene:
          ```
          It normally means receiving an A, which tends to not be full marks but something less.
          ```

          - u/Zephyr1011:
            ```
            In which case, you can easily mess with how marks are allocated on that test to get your desired result
            ```

      - u/6340:
        ```
        Sorry about that, I defined ace to be "to score above 90% on the test, regardless of others' performances", rather than "to score in the 90th percentile". Disagreements on definition are the worst.
        ```

        - u/Nepene:
          ```
          The definition of test is "a procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something, especially before it is taken into widespread use."

          "c : something (as a series of questions or exercises) for measuring the skill, knowledge, intelligence, capacities, or aptitudes of an individual or group "

          So regardless of the exact details of the power 90% on the mark scheme isn't enough. It needs to have measurable standards for performance on a reasonably official scale, and is generally applied to a group.
          ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          So 90% of the time the AI is friendly. And 10% of the time, it killed everyone and tiled the universe with regular dodecahedrons.

  Controlling bugs. Duh. That's just so useless and unworkable.

  More seriously, any "open ended" superpower is probably munchkinable in some way or another. What you really need is something that seems cool, but is restricted. Say you could only control bugs, but they had to be within 5 feet of you? You're limited to only the bugs that are already near you; if you try to run around too quickly you'll leave some behind, but otherwise you'll never come across a really significant amount. (Of course I expect someone to be able to munchkin this. The point being that while it's still usable, it's less usable than the open-ended version)

    Let's assume it's an actual power where you do not need to consume more salt and stay hydrated. Otherwise it's a genetic condition like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis. As a result you have a near infinite resource of slightly salty water. We currently have a shortage of fresh water throughout the world and the problem with salt water is that the salt concentration is so high it's really hard to remove all of the salt from it. Sweat on the other hand is much easier to use for Osmosis to extract fresh water from.

  If you get half of a [Feruchemist](http://mistborn.wikia.com/wiki/Feruchemy)'s power (from Mistborn), it would be pretty useless.  You would get the ability to put some of your attributes in metal "batteries" of different types, but not the ability to draw them back out of the batteries to boost yourself like a normal Feruchemist can.  

  You would get 17 abilities: (they are temporary and can scale to any amount you can survive, unless otherwise noted)

   - Reduce your mass (useful!)
   - Reduce your physical speed
   - Dull any of your five senses
   - Reduce your muscle mass  
   - Reduce how fast you think
   - Reduce your body's core temperature (useful!)
   - Permanently remove memories
   - Fall asleep without getting rest out of it
   - Lose oxygen from your bloodstream
   - Lose calories from your stomach (useful!)
   - Become sickly
   - Become apathetic
   - Become unlucky
   - Become less magical (maybe? it's unknown)
   - Lose your connection to yourself, spiritually (unknown)
   - Lose spiritual attachments to other people, so you don't connect to them (less empathy both ways, if I'm right, useful!)
   - Become older.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    > Become older.

    You said that these wear off, right?  So our 16-year-old Feruch (she didn't get the -emist part) would be able to become 21 so she could go drinking and then, after a little while, she would de-age to be 16 again?
    ```

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      Yup.  It can be used as a very effective disguise, but also carries all of the downsides of old age, like being weaker and such.  Some of them aren't quite as useless as the others. Specifically: Mass (breaks conservation of momentum), losing calories (instant diet pill), dulling senses (painkiller), removing memories (eyebleach, operational security), reduced muscle mass/old age (disguises and deception.  Also breaks conservation of momentum and mass).

      They're more like super-strength-without-super-ligaments or super-speed-without-super-reflexes tier powers than truly useless ones.

      As for wearing off, that isn't quite it.  You need to actively store the attribute in order to lose it, and you go back to normal the second that you want to.  Storing memories is the exception to this rule, as it is permanent once you decide which memories to store.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Ah! So, I can reduce my mass to basically zero, run at someone full tilt to get lots of v^2 and then bring all my m back to produce a lot of KE?

          >Ah! So, I can reduce my mass to basically zero, run at someone full tilt to get lots of v^2 and then bring all my m back to produce a lot of KE?

          Yes, but it wouldn't work quite as well as you might think.  You still need to deal with wind resistance and losing grip (from having low weight) and the max speed your muscles can move.  Also, your clothes and other stuff is unaffected.

          >Can I store anyone ELSE's attributes, or only my own?

          Only your own.
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            Hm.  Suppose I store, say, 2kg of mass, then eat enough to regain the weight, repeat until I have 1,0000kg or so stored away?  This would take a long time, of course, but maybe if I had a teammate whose power allowed me to gain weight / gain mass.

            Does my shape change when I store / recall the mass (i.e., do I get thin / fat), or just my density?
            ```

            - u/ulyssessword:
              ```
              It's just your density, your shape doesn't change at all.  For example, if someone was normally 50kg, and they started storing half of their mass, the only differences would be that they are attracted by gravity half as much it's twice as easy to change their speed.

              In this case, if you were to gain 1000kg you would still look (and be) severely obese, even if you weighed the same.

  [The Extraordinary adventures of Ordinary Boy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_Boy_%28novel_series%29) is a children's book with a great variety of lame powers. Some of the lamest powers include:

  * Being able to whistle a perfect tune

  * Lobster claws instead of hands

  * temporarily grow hair on anything you touch

  * Inability to be stained by ink 

  * Strong-smelling farts

  * Ability to turn pale white

  * A head that resembles a watermelon
  ```

- u/tilkau:
  ```
  * The ability to cause any one effect that is physically possible and expends no more than 1 millijoule of energy per second.

  (that is, you can switch effects -- and any knock-on effects that have been caused wont be wiped out -- but only one effect may be active at once.
  1 Millijoule/sec was a rough estimate -- it should be possible to tweak the threshold to make the power both sufficiently difficult to effectively use and sufficiently munchkinable)
  )

  Also, 

  * The ability to forget anything that you don't want to forget.

  Sakaki (Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya)'s power, as interpreted by Kyon: Big Damn Hero, is also a candidate -- possibly TOO lame:

  * The ability to witness only things which you can explain with your current understanding of the universe. If that sounds confusing, you can imagine an 'absolute normality field' projected around you, where 'normality' is defined by your current understanding of what is possible in the universe. Inside that field, your sense of normality is never contradicted; events which are possible under actual physics but not under your understanding of it simply cannot occur.

  (It's about the only power I can think of that is useless in a horrifying way. Any munchkining would, AFAICS, have to be done via someone else. And is likely to involve brainwashing.)


  EDIT: *This third item may require more explanation*. It's essentially *absolute anti-falsification*. Here's an example. Supposing you are a bigot who genuinely believes that gay and bi people don't really exist, and someone bi enters your sphere of influence... then they will be unable to perform any act which would classify them as genuinely gay or bi to you. Which could be as little as a mannerism, or as much as having sex, according to your particular interpretation. Your AoE is 'anywhere you are currently perceiving', so if they are in another room
   then your power would probably have no effect on them.

  Or here's another example: You believe that quantum mechanics doesn't work. Most likely, this has no effect, because if you believe quantum mechanics doesn't work, you probably don't have any idea of what it working would be like.  (AFAICS, if you both understand quantum mechanics and believe it doesn't work, I think this would prevent anything at all from happening in your AoE ever.)

  Now, if you believed something smaller -- like 'USB keys don't work', then they indeed would not be able to work in your vicinity. Not through any modification of their functionality, but physical prevention of any event that would prove that they did work. Again, your AoE covers only what you are currently perceiving, so people could use USB keys in your vicinity as long as it wouldn't lead to you discovering that USB keys do in fact work.

  In other words, the effect does not alter the rules of physics to suit your preconceptions; rather, it prevents you from witnessing anything that is contrary to those preconceptions; it suppresses possible evidence.

  So, a final example: 'No-one is strong enough to pull a train'. This wouldn't prevent anyone from actually being strong enough to pull a train. It would prevent them from using enough of that strength in your AoE to actually pull a train. If you thought that one type of train, a heavier type, was pullable and another, lighter, was not, and they in fact had the strength to pull either, then they could only pull the heavier type in your AoE.

  You can conjure a live animal, uniformly randomly chosen from a currently living specimen of the family [*Muridae*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muridae), at the approximate range, relative momentum, and precision of anywhere you can throw an object of the same mass and shape within your line of sight.

  * You can do this about every three or four minutes, but it gets gradually harder and more exhausting without rest.
  * The mice/rats/whatever are not under your control or direction any more than you can mundanely accomplish.
  * The conjured animal does not 'dismiss' itself after a period of time.
  * The specimen is selected from the world's current population of murids, and teleported to location you conjure it. You cannot choose a specific organism. It carries its natural flora, gases, pathogens, dirt, digested food, etc. with it, but does not transport any non-food items intentionally attached or fed to it. It arrives in the same condition it was, though momentum from the conjuration or pressure differentials could kill it.
  * You will get something reasonably mouse-shaped; immortal cell lines, individual cells, cancers, teratomas, etc. don't count. You will not get unborn embryos on their own. Pregnant creatures take their babies with them.
  * You can only conjure specimens on Earth, and if then, only while you are on Earth (assume a 100 km altitude edge of space, no "different Hubble volume" nonsense). You can't use conjuring to transfer information faster-than-light any more than you normally can.
  * The critter disappears and reappears more-or-less instantaneously, with minimal sonic effect; it's not quite clear if the volume of air that formerly occupied the space where you conjured goes to where you displaced the conjuration from. In any case, you can't use the process to displace something out of your way.
  * There's no obvious indication that you are using your power other than its result and the physical effects of your conscious intent (mind-reading works to detect it, mind-control works to use it). You can use your power with the approximate mental effort and intentionality it takes to pick up an object and throw it; random gerbils flying out of nowhere from a seizure are extremely unlikely, but in principle possible. Physical restraint has no effect on your ability to conjure. Inability to visualize the situation could effect your success, but you could still conjure something at an abstract vector from yourself.

  Here is my offering:

  The Ineffective Rain-Dancer: You can spawn a single raindrop per second. Your range spans roughly any visible part of the sky (raindrop can be defined as a sphere of water of a certain small size, sky can be defined as a specific range of distances from the ground - not too close, but not out in space either, and your range is a function of distance from your body - the "visible part of the sky" bit is just a rough heuristic for how far the power goes). 

  If too easy, decrease accuracy over where the drop spawns.

    Hm.  Well...if you could create one drop WAAAY high up, then create the second inside the first as it falls, then the third ditto...you could get a noticeable water ball when it finally hits.  I'm having trouble figuring out where to go from there, though.
    ```

  Rather than completely useless powers, I'll try and figure out double-edged ones that are very unconventional or at least fun to play with in some unique way.

  Coin Flip: The power to make any action either succeed or fail spectacularly... but you have no way to predict which way things will go.  If you punch someone and use your power, you might send your foe flying, or break your own wrist.  For extra fun, *YOU* actually go and flip a coin each time the power is used in the story, so that the results aren't even predictable to you.

  Killer Shadow: Your shadow is animate and capable of applying surprising amounts of force.  But it doesn't always follow your actions, especially when you can't see it.  Sometimes, it even seems almost _traitorous._

  Super Solipsism: If you don't know something is there, it can't effect you.  You can walk down the street with your eyes closed and ears plugged and the cars will just harmlessly pass through you.  But if one of them honks loud enough for you to hear...  

  Respawn: Any time you're killed, your body disappears and then reappears in perfect health somewhere within a 100 meter radius.  Any blood/biomass you lost also disappears, and any foreign bodies within you are left behind where you despawn.  Your clothes and possessions may or may not move with you, depending on which way you think would be better for the story.  Other than that, assume baseline human, and dying usually _hurts like hell._
  ```

    The coin flip power is really interesting. You'd need some way to manage / predict it, at least a bit, or you really couldn't afford to use it. Maybe if the results are always diametrically opposed, or if you can choose the "fail" outcome? So, you could say "I'm going to hit this guys with massive force, and he force is either vectored into him or into me."

    I don't entirely like that...any other thoughts?

    Traitorous killer shadow is basically what Mord Naag has in Worm. Her shadow beast familiar is powered by genocide.

    The respawn power reminded me of a hilarious build a friend made once in the RPG Champions.  He took as his only powers an instant reincarnation power that worked like your respawn idea and a power that allowed him to blow himself up with highly damaging and fatal results to himself and anyone nearby.

  You can make someone forget something but if you do you make yourself forget what you made them forget. As a result you have no memory of ever using your powers.
  ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    You can still establish that you have it. For example, writing down what you'll make them forget beforehand. It's just memory erasure with a slight inconvenience. You could make a fortune in what would otherwise involve NDAs. Someone wants an outside expert to look at proprietary information that they don't want stolen? Just hire you to erase their memory afterwords.
