  Well, I've been reading several things in the past few months, but most of this sub probably knows the majority of them already. Still, in case you missed any, or haven't checked them out yet, here are my most recent picks:

  [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) recently finished its third book, and remains as captivating as ever.  The fantasy world in APGtE is a battleground for a meta-war between Good and Evil, where each side has heroes or villains empowered by archetypal Names. The story revolves around an orphan girl named Catherine Foundling, who has grown up in the (Good) country of Callow under the occupation of their (Evil) neighboring country, Praes. Catherine gets an opportunity to take the Name of Squire to serve under Praes' villainous Black Knight, and begins her journey to save her country through practical Evil. 

  It's a fantastic story with a very active commentary section. Some aspects aren't purely rational - I mean, it literally is "Good" versus "Evil" - but the nuance between "Good/Evil" and "good/evil" is the central theme at play. Lots of great characters, amazing banter, intense battles, and a large amount of foreshadowing that leads to constant threads about what's going to happen next.

  Also on hiatus after finishing its 13th book is [The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)... although looking at it now, there have been two bonus chapters released recently, so it's likely to start again soon! The story is honestly pretty sprawling and hard to sum up. The world setting mixes genres; early on it mostly sticks to a combination of fantasy and western (the wild west, but with wands and magic), but later adds hints of industrial revolution, steampunk, and sci-fi. The main story revolves around a group of eight freshmen starting at the magical University at Last Rock, run by the 3000 year old elven archmage Arachne Tellwryn. But there are B plot stories, and C plot stories, and throwaway characters... and all are connected in an overarching plot that is slowly drawing them closer together.

  TGAB might not appeal to everyone here, but I like it for a few reasons. First, it's a fantastic palate-cleanser if grimdark stories like Worm left you feeling upset. This is pretty much the opposite - yes, the going gets tough and characters face tough challenges and losses, but hardly anyone ever dies. This ties into its major criticism too: because no one ever dies and new characters keep getting added, the character list is ENORMOUS. As such it can be difficult to remember that one character who showed up or was referenced five books ago but is now involved in a later book's plot. The dialogue is also a bit static at the beginning; many characters (especially the non-main characters) all seem to talk the same way. This improves after the first few books, though, so I think it's worth working through. I keep reading it because I love to follow some specific characters (Joseph P. Jenkins and Antonio Darling are the best), but also because I like to see how all the seemingly separate plots intersect with each other. And the worldbuilding is phenomenal!

  I also finally, after overlooking it for months, tore through [The Good Student](http://gravitytales.com/novel/the-good-student). The story follows a boy who excels at one thing: studying. And studying. And studying. As a result of his focus, he attains an incredibly high ranking on his country's national exams, enabling him to enter Ransom Academy, the magical school usually reserved only for the rich and powerful. The story involves investigations into the origin of magic, the nature of beliefs, and the true history of his country. The plot takes a lot of twists and turns later on, where you think you have an answer to what's going on in one chapter just to find it completely overturned one or two chapters later. I liked, but didn't love, the author's previous work - but I'd definitely recommend TGS. 

  As usual I've kept up with [Mother of Learning](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning) (magical teenager repeats a month over and over trying to discover why while improving his abilities), [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) (a teenager struggling after the death of his best friend finds himself in the fantasy world of Aerb, which seems to be an amalgamation of all the old tabletop campaigns they used to play), and [Pokemon: Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) (a rational/ist take on Pokemon - great worldbuilding and very interesting characters). You'll see all three referenced on this sub quite often.

  My final recent read is a... different... type of story than we usually see here: [The Erogamer](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6oje2x/nsfw_the_erogamer_a_quest_about_a_girl_who/). That's a link to an /r/rational thread about it, because the Questionable Questing website requires you to create a free account, since the content is undoubtedly NSFW. From the context of those last two sentences you can probably guess the general overview of the story: it's a quest story (ie, the commenters get to select different options to steer the plot) about a girl who wakes up one day as a pornographic game (eroge) character. You may have read quest stories, you may have read Gamer derivatives... but I've personally never read something quite as fascinating as The Erogamer. Its tags are roughly Gamer/eroge/transhumanism/existential horror/lovecraftian sex comedy. Book 2 just ended, and I think there might be a brief break, so now's a great time to start reading and to catch up. I also HIGHLY recommend reading the comments in between chapters as well, because the commentary is very interesting on its own, but also tends to get rolled into the next chapter as well. Oh, and the sex scenes are pretty hot (though they don't occur as frequently as you might imagine).

  Outside of reading, I've started listening to the podcast hosted by Daystar Eld (Pokemon: The Origin of Species) and Alexander Wales (Metropolitan Man/Worth the Candle, as cthulhuraejepsen), [Rationally Writing](http://alexanderwales.com/rationally-writing/). Only a few episodes in, but I've been liking it so far - great job, guys! And finally, I read an article or two on Slate Star Codex (by Unsong writer Scott Alexander) that make me think I'll be reading quite a bit more. I enjoyed [The Categories Were Made For Man, Not Man For The Categories](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/) quite a bit, both for the great critique of transphobic views and for the exceptionally engaging writing style.

  Whew... ok, that's all for me. For now, at least!

  **Edit: Nope! Forgot one, as I'm still reading it now!**

  [Heretical Edge](https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) was a series I started up a long time ago; I made it to Arc 19 (I think?) before getting caught up, and recently I went back to it... up to Arc 28 now, and the series is on Arc 33. The story is about a teenager sent to a hidden school that trains Heretics - humans endowed with the ability to cast magic and absorb the abilities of the supernatural monsters they are sent to hunt. When I first read the story I thought it was pretty dark and gruesome, with a lot of family trauma and super violent scenes. Now that I'm about 10 arcs further in, it's still pretty dark at times... but also not as bad as I had previously thought. Many of the tragic backstories are somewhat lessened; characters thought dead are often just out of the picture and show back up later. The story very much is moved by plot contrivance, but there are some really good instances of foreshadowing. A lot of seemingly "background" characters often rise to more prominent roles later on. The plot itself is quite fast-paced, with characters often rushing from one emergency situation to the next (sorta like a Dresden Files book). My only issue with the pacing is that you often have 2-3 chapters and then an interlude chapter. The interludes are all interesting, but I usually found myself just wanting to skip ahead to find out what happened to the main story. Other than that, I've really enjoyed rereading the series!

    The Rationally Writing podcast is awesome. I listened to them all over the past few months, and I really enjoyed it.  Not only did it give me a lot of insight into writing, it also gave me a new perspective on the works of u/daystareld and u/alexanderwales. My favourite episodes were Magic Systems, Power Dynamics, and Tabletop RPGs and Writing.  The quality was improving and I felt they were really coming into their own, it's a shame they mostly stopped doing them.

    If they see this comment, consider doing an episode on author/fan interaction. (That would make this comment dangerously meta, though)
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      The big problem with the episodes is editing time, which is handled exclusively by DaystarEld (for which he has my eternal gratitude). I think right now there are two episodes recorded, one mostly edited (which I gave a listen to today) that should be posted soon. I've actually got a draft for the next one we'll record, which *is* something like "Audience Feedback" or interacting with readership, so we're already set on that one.
      ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Glad you're enjoying it so much :) Yeah, it's mostly down to 1 per month now, but I'm hoping to go back to 2 soon if I can squeeze in a bit more editing time from my new job.

    Thanks for recommending Heretical Edge! I started it because of your recommendation and am loving it, I've binged up until arc 26 so far. Isn't quite rational (definitely agreed about plot contrivances), but extremely fun. And an incredibly sweet and rational approach to personal relations, with characters being genre savvy and actually communicating and talking through their issues before they become major problems. And competent and reasonable authority figures!

    Well, that seems to be a surprisingly hard request.

    * [*Luminosity*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Luminosity), a rational *Twilight* fanfiction. Fits quite well, if I recall correctly.

    * [*HPMoR*](http://www.hpmor.com/), as mentioned by u/I_Probably_Think, but you probably know it already.

    * [*Twig*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twig): the main characters usually aim for "immediate survival" instead of "immortality", but the desperate need to prolong your and your friends' lifespan past bodies' natural limits becomes an important plot point later on.

    You may find more [here](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalitySeeker) and [here](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingForeverIsAwesome).

      Note that Luminosity is best read in conjunction with its sequel.

      Although I did recently recommend it to my sister-in-law, simply on the basis that she hated canon for having such a wishy-washy female protagonist, and Luminosity definitely does *that* differently.

  [With This Ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/) is a sane-itization of the DC comic universe. The main character is a self insert, but this is mostly irrelevant to what makes the story so good. In the past I've been loath to recommend it here, as it felt just a bit too much on the popcorn action side of things, but having just finished a multi-week re-read, I find that I can't avoid singing it's praises. 

  The biggest thing that WtR brings to the DC universe is a much-needed injection of consistency. One of my favorite such interactions is [minor power spoiler](#s "Cornwall Boy is a thaumovore, or someone who absorbs magic. The Sword of Beowulf is a magic sword that smites anyone unworthy who attempts to draw the blade. Give it to Cornwall Boy and now he can refill his magic mid-fight, absorbing the bolt of lightning that tries to erase him from existence whenever he likes").  The work is *filled* with these sorts of clever interactions, mostly spurred on by the main character taking two existing canon DC concepts and putting them together, no real further fiat needed.

  Without spoiling too much, the work also follows an alternate-universe version of the MC as he takes a slightly more...villany-looking path. Ever wished someone would just *take care* of the Joker permanently? He's got you covered. Each major plot point thus comes up and get handled in two very different ways, one MC punching above his weight class through clever abuse of the world's rules, while the other rolls his eyes and puts a bullet wherever it makes sense. Both are quite satisfying to a comics fan for very different reasons. It never quite gets old, either; eventually the two have branched so far that they have quite different equipment, tech, and contacts available, so you never *quite* know what either is going to do.

  The level of writing skill in this work is very impressive to me. Unlike Worm, which has a similar premise and word count and ratchets up the tension every chapter without any real breathing room, WtR knows how to ebb and flow. One arc we'll be in a frightening fight with demons way above our pay grade, and then next we'll take a break for a few chapters and figure out how to use magic portals to replace and fix the London underground. I also like that he fully understands information that *doesn't matter*; links are provided for one-off side character mentions, the plot doesn't concern itself with pointless or repetitive minutia, and all in all I feel like my time is never wasted on any post.

  In short, if you like the superhero genre, railguns, banter, or consistent settings, then I can highly recommend With This Ring. It's an ongoing daily (!) post by post serial work that took me about a month to read spending practically every spare moment to read, and it's all so, so good.
  ```

  - u/Igigigif:
    ```
    I ended up dropping the fic when it just veered into even more "staus-quo apologism" (for lack of a better term). Specifically, after the MC got into a fight with green arrow jr. about bow being a terrible choice of weapon for someone with her "peak human" powerset. The narrative then implies that the MC was at fault and he apologizes by making super-arrows.

    Am I missremembering? Does it get better?
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      You're remembering correctly, although that event is quite early on. The MC wasn't at fault for hating on "pointy stick launchers" (a view which is only entrenched, expanded, and *vilified* as the fic goes on), he was at fault for being extremely domineering over it (and taunting her to flash him, behavior which *is* rather unbecoming of a 30 year old to a teenager). He has to learn not how to get people to change their behavior, but how to persuade them to change what they *want*, and this is a crucial lesson for him to master if he's to make any sort of dent into understanding the orange light. 

      A big theme of the work is the MC constantly attempting to get everyone to realize what ridiculously overpowered tech is sitting right underneath their noses, which early on is mostly him trying convince Badass Normals to upgrade. If I was in English class I would classify this as a Man vs Insane World sort of work, where the MC must attempt to defy the conventions that everyone else is happy to live with. This is definitely a deconstruction of DC, so any perceived apologism is more likely to be setting the stage.

      I would recommend giving it another go, at *least* until the Ophidian is introduced, at which point this specific concern begins to be addressed in earnest.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        It's worth noting that the teenager in question eventually does come a long way toward his point of view, not by being embarrassed or taunted, but because he goes out of his way to let her know that he's on her side.

        When he later gives the League a performance review, he rates her effectiveness meaningfully higher than Green Arrow himself, due to her [advanced ammunition](#s " and alchemical augmentation").
        ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      I think its moments like that that stop the MC from being a Mary Sue, namely when their clever min-maxing and rule twisting and "spacebattles competence" runs into obstacles relating to interpersonal skills or hidden draw-backs/limitations or the reason behind the status quo.  I think the author tries to reconstruct the DC universe even as their main character SI tries to exploit it, so the authors goes into worldbuilding to try to make sense of the world and avoid a curbstomp on the SI's part.

      The specific example you are complaining about, is, as ketura said, a case where the MC SI was being a jerk, even if they were mostly right.
      ```

  I recommend two fantasy books this month. 

  1) [Grey Sister](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35530652-grey-sister) by Mark Lawrence, the sequel to [Red Sister](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister), which I thought was the best fantasy book of last year. Here's the rec I wrote for red sister last year: 

  >I finished reading Red Sister and I really enjoyed it. The setting was possibly the best part for me. It's set in a ice world which was colonized by four different "races" of humanity, each with their own magical/physical ability. With the aid of a solar mirror their ancestors were able to create a corridor of suitably temperate weather around the equator. The rest of the world is basically just glaciers that are constantly encroaching on this shrinking corridor. The knowledge that the mirror has been slowly falling out of its orbit and that the death of everyone on the planet is inevitable is widespread.


  2) [Master Assassins](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35437058-master-assassins) by  Robert V.S. Redick.  Don't mind the title or the stupid cover. The book is not an action story, it is not about "master assassins".  It's a story of two brothers that get caught up in events way out of their league. They're part of a persecuted ethnicity that has only recently started fighting back, under the leadership of an extremely brutal theocracy governed by a still living prophet. What I really like about the book is the characterization of the protagonist and his companions, and the protagonist's relationship with his brother.

  This season of the Magicians was superb ([spoilers](#s "though I thought the resolution in the final episode was kind of lame, and find the Big Bad revealed there less than impressive -- but the journey to get there was some of the best TV I've seen this year")). In general, I've really liked the show, particularly for the pop-culture references, and the way the show approaches the wish-fulfillment/coming of age fantasy it's clearly responding to (particularly Harry Potter and Narnia).

  I also had fun with the new season of the Santa Clarita Diet. I think the comedy has improved from the first season -- in particular, I think Timothy Olyphant is carrying the show less than he was in the first season.

  Have I recommended *The Fifth Season* trilogy here? Because those books are good, and are also quite refreshingly different from a lot of other fantasy.

  I've read through the first three books of the [Galactic Center Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center_Saga) so far, and definitely recommend it. There are definitely some weird bits (Bigfoot showing up in the first book, the machine art in the third book), but overall I've liked them so far.

  Speaking of weird, [Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_\(novel\)) by M. John Harrison is really weird, but also fascinating and very good. I haven't started on the sequels yet, but I think this book is definitely worth it for any fans of science fiction.

  Finally, I just got [Grey Sister](https://www.amazon.com/Grey-Sister-Book-Ancestor-Lawrence/dp/1101988886) yesterday, and though I haven't finished it yet, so far it's been just as good as the rest of Lawrence's stuff.

    Have you read the book series for The Magicians? It's one of my favorites, though definitely not for everyone.
    ```

    - u/FriendlyAnnatar:
      ```
      The book series is one of my favorites as well, but I had a hard time watching the series (stopped after the first season) because although it deals with the same themes as the book and had mostly the same plot/characters, the television series turns the journey into an "adventure of the week" and mostly makes the plot sillier (the book series also takes some liberties, such as how Quentin swings from being a magical expert to being a dunce magician depending on circumstances). Also, mostly I think the author's prose was half the beauty of the books.

      By the way, is there an episode of Rationally Speaking where The Magicians is discussed? Be interesting to see it deconstructed.
      ```

    - u/waylandertheslayer:
      ```
      I completed the trilogy, but I found the first two books incredibly frustrating. I think *The Magicians* is full of examples of characters we are told are clever, and who are shown to do things we are told take a lot of intelligence (i.e. magic), but who rarely act in a clever way when the topic is something the readers can understand. The ending of the first book, in particular, and the fact that [spoilers for the first book](#s " Quentin knows for a fact that time travel is possible, there are people who can make time machines, he has a broken time machine in front of him, he has no reason to believe that it's not a fake anyway and the real one is still around, he's able to bring animals back to life, and so on and so forth, and he doesn't even consider trying to bring Alice back.")

      Other examples include that [more spoilers for the first book](#s "When creating combat magic, none of the magicians talk about any defences or shields, and they don't end up making any. They even mention using a D&D book for inspiration - Magic Missile and Fireball and lifted from there, but that means they paged over stuff like Mage Armour and Shield, so it's not a case of not thinking of it.")

      Overall, however, I did enjoy reading the series. I really liked the magic system and a lot of the worldbuilding was fascinating, while Quentin's moods were incredibly infectious due to the writing style. When he's depressed, the grey almost oozes out of the page, and when he's happy, it's like a burst of sunshine.

  [Even Further Beyond](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/even-further-beyond.45951/) is a nice quest on SV that seems pretty rational so far IMO. The premise is that the main character is a human from the ordinary world who, in the afterlife, is commanded by the divinities to reincarnate into a Xianxia-inspired setting and defeat the Heroine, a reincarnated goddess who will bring about the end of the Age of the setting. If he succeeds, the divinities will grant him a wish, and if he fails then he will be given some unspecified punishment. There's a lot of min-maxing involved in how he can develop his magic abilities.
  ```

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    This may sound a bit pedantic, but is the min-maxing actually any good? Usually when I see these kinds of "use an original magic system to become more powerful" kinds of tales, the actual optimization is just a bunch of obvious low-hanging fruit and not actually inventive or impressive. I much prefer the kinds of characters with outlandish combinations of unexpected abilities to create *overwhelmingly* powerful synergies. Basically, the "max" is never all that high for me.

    Like, Pathfinder allows for a character build which converts alcohol into angel summons, and makes for a defensive powerhouse as well. It's a four-step chain of mutating character resources that transforms consumed beer into myriad celestial allies, and it's *totally unlike* the sorts of things you usually see in a game which supposedly supports "min-maxing".
    ```

    - u/Timewinders:
      ```
      Well, it does tend to have a lot of low-hanging fruit from combining different schools of magic that other characters aren't able to access all at once. I think Rihaku (the author) is pretty cognizant of most methods of gaming the system so players haven't really come across anything truly inspiring. It's more the main character who acts rationally using his abilities. But it is still fun to read, and there isn't much of a ceiling to the level of power that can be reached.
      ```

    - u/Adeen_Dragon:
      ```
      I feel that there is a difference in terms here. To me, min-maxing refers to ensuring that your stats and abilities match your character ideal. To use D&D as an example, this would be lowering your Wizard's strength to boost their intelligence. 

      To me, you are referring to munchkining. As I understand, munchkining refers to using the rules in a way that was not originally intended by the designers, usually to be more effective than usual.
      ```

      - u/AmeteurOpinions:
        ```
        Yeah, I guess I'm not really talking about min-maxing. But I find highly effective munchkinry to be much more entertaining and yet harder to find in stories which are supposedly all about obtaining great power through any available means.
        ```

  - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
    ```
    Word of warning to anyone who gets into this, it is extremely likely that this quest will not finish. Rihaku has a history of losing steam after escalating himself into a corner.
    ```

    - u/Flashbunny:
      ```
      I hold out hope that he will this time, as he has set a clearly-defined win condition for the quest, where the few other quests of his I've seen were generally more open ended. It's easier to maintain focus with a goal in sight.
      ```

    - u/Timewinders:
      ```
      To be fair, how many stories on the internet actually finish? I could probably count on my fingers the good, long, completed fanfics that I've read. George R.R. Martin probably won't finish the Song of Ice and Fire books and he's getting paid to do it, it only makes sense that people who are posting their stories online for free don't finish. Most of the quests I've read on SV end up getting abandoned after a while. Authors tend to get interested in a new idea but lose interest after a while.

  I've been absolutely obsessed with [Zombie Knight](https://thezombieknight.blogspot.com/2013/04/page-1.html) for the last few weeks. I saw it from a thread on here and was hooked fast, so I recommend going in sight-unseen, but it's a sort-of-fantasy, sort-of-superhero story that comes bleedingly close to being a ratfic. The only thing that I think holds it back is that the world has some ill-defined rules, but some of that could be explained away by [minor spoilers](#s " the know-it-all character having a bit of an unreliable narrator syndrome"). Also, it's very much a soft system rather than hard, with most of the rules being pretty nebulous.

  The other thing I wanna give a shout-out to is 3-gatsu no lion, or March Comes in like a Lion (it's on Crunchy Roll, but I'm at work so I don't wanna link it). It's a slice of life anime about a high school boy that's really good at shogi, and the first season is just like putting some hand warmers around your heart. But the second season (which just wrapped up) goes so much further. Really high quality animation and the characters are *so good*. Seriously, it's some of the best characterization I've ever seen - no characters being dumb because it's on their bullet list of traits, everyone's just trying their best, and the world feels very real (well, it is real, but you know what i mean).
  ```

    When she wakes up again, she’s not exactly the same, either physically or mentally.
    Her only goals in life, now: get out of this cave, and reunite with her family.
    Oh, and also: slaughter, in as painful a way as possible, anyone who was involved in her imprisonment, anyone who profited from it, and anyone who even remotely gets in the way (plus those people’s families, friends, acquaintances, business partners…)

    Sounds extremely violent, care to share any selling points?

      Thanks for asking. I didn't have time to write a description when I first posted this. It is violent but not as much as that description suggests, and her stated goal isn't static nor straight forward. The story is not revenge porn. Despite the violence I find the tone light-hearted. 

      It's a fantasy setting with magic, but the magic is researched somewhat scientifically. This is not a big part of the story though, or rather it is important to the story but it's more in the background.

      What I like about it the characters have their own motivations that are reasonable and consistent. Basically no idiot balls, though their use of magic/technology seems far from optimized. The main character's naivety is endearing, but she is not 'good'. I also really like the world building, which is revealed to the reader at a good pace. The author combines ideas in a simple but engaging way. There may be other reasons that I can't identify.

      The author updates pretty regularly once per week, but she(?) is writing two stories at once so there are gaps of several weeks while she writes Trials.

  I really loved Anathem by Neil Stevenson, are there any books that are similar or in the same rational, spec fic with an action plot sorta niche?

  Alternatively, I've really enjoyed Delphic but after a couple of months giving Worm a go I've realized I don't love the neverending melancholy and poor decisionmaking. Are there any other relatively positive (or just not as negative as worm) super stories?
  ```

  - u/Tokyo_X-4:
    ```
    If you're not into Worm's aesthetic, *With This Ring* would be my second recommendation. It's a Young Justice fanfic that at this point is very likely longer than Worm. The author has a few idiosyncrasies, and it's a self-insert, so it's much more a challenge of learning to live with the author's unique perspective, but once you get into it you'll find that it's one of the more engaging takes on the DC universe as a whole. My only complaint aside from that is that some of the fight scenes really felt like they dragged on quite a bit.

    This is a list of most of the superhero webfiction in order of weekly votes. Ward is the sequel, you can probably skip that. The Zombie Knight is really good but I'm not sure I'd call it a super hero story, the main characters have super powers but it's not set up as a standard super heroes versus super villains story, it's more about rival conspiracies/armies of super powered people fighting each other. I haven't read the others but I think they're Worm-esque universes but less dark.

  I watched all of _Legion_ in this last week or so; it's amazing. Definitely one of my favorite shows of all time.

  A decent snarky summary is: "Hey you're crazy!" "No, you're not crazy, you're a telepath!" "Wait! You're both a telepath, AND crazy!" "Wait, that's not a--- !"

  Things that stand out to me are: 

  - the character depths (in all characters, but particularly the main character)
  - the range of acting they all get to do (there's a scene where actor does their normal "american" accent, an amazing british accent, and then a _bad_ british accent)
  - the cinematography (it's not quite as pretty as American Gods, but close)
  - the pacing: It never really slows down, but has 3-4 to-black cuts (for a few seconds) in an episode, which are rarely (if ever) cliffhangers. It's full of easy, natural stopping points, so I felt zero pressure to binge.

  I wouldn't call it "rational", but I would call it _amazing_.

  Also this has been fun: https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/bunkercore-post-apocalyptic-dungeon-core-original.45976/

  It's a "dungeon core" (as in Dungeon Keeper / Evil Genius) set in a post-war nano/nuclear apocalypse. World building seems solid and the main character is decently thoughtful about their situation, environment and actions.

    march comes in like a lion

    Slice of life anime. Rational, not rationalist, but characters always act in accordance with their (very in-depth) characterization, and even when characters do the Wrong thing, it's never frustrating because the viewer totally understands why. And there's a lot of just...people getting better and working their way through really tough problems.

    How willing are you to read My Little Pony fanfiction? There's a lot of good stuff, but MLP ain't for everyone. For example, I'm currently reading [The Maretian](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/396744/the-maretian) which is the Martian, but then ponies are also stranded with Matt Damon for reasons that make sense in-context but would seem nonsensical if I tried to explain them. It's a The Martian/MLP/Kerbal Space Program crossover first contact story, although the KSP part is mostly a holdover from the MLP only prequel.

        Good, that's not a problem. I haven't watched the show in years, and the recs I have reflect that. Note that I'm including both "humans and ponies make *official* contact" and "humans/ponies wind up in equestria/earth, cultural exchange ensues" stories. I'm not including stories that are just isekai though.

His lieutenant ends up sleeping with his girl, and they have a kind of nice messed up poly relationship. The whole world is very dark gray.

  [*GURPS*](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/) (the Generic Universal RolePlaying System) should appeal to this subreddit's denizens.

  Quotes from [the *GURPS Basic Set*](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/Basic/):

  > [The system's designer:] I've tried to make *GURPS* as fast-moving yet realistic as possible.

  &nbsp;

  > [The system's designer:] I’m satisfied that *GURPS* is the most realistic, flexible, and "universal" system ever developed.

  &nbsp;

  > [T]he combat system is "modular"; you can use *all* the rules for a complex, detailed, realistic combat simulation&mdash;or just those in Chapter 11 for a quick game.

  &nbsp;

  > For the most part, *GURPS* stresses realism. Heroes can get disappointed, injured, sick, or even dead. So it goes. The GM is expected to stretch realism in an emergency (defined as "whenever realism would ruin the game"), but[,] the rest of the time, realism rules.

  &nbsp;

  > The *GURPS* rules are designed for two main things: *good roleplaying* and *realism*, in that order.

  A quote from [*GURPS Fantasy-Tech 1*](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/fantasy-tech/fantasy-tech1/):

  > *GURPS* is known for highly detailed, well-researched supplements containing a wealth of up-to-date historical and scientific information. These volumes are written by well-read, enthusiastic amateurs and people with real-world experience and academic credentials in their fields, often working in consultation with a range of experts and professionals, to produce works useful[,] not just to *GURPS* players, but to players of other games and to nongamers with an interest in the subject material.

  > This is not one of those supplements.

    I've found that while **GURPS** is able to do a lot of things fairly well, it doesn't do as well at evoking theme as a set of mechanics designed for the purpose, since the mechanics shape how you approach and play the game. Using a set of generic mechanics therefore means that you lose some of the "fit" between mechanics and story.

    Games like **Apocalypse World** or **Shadowrun** or even **Dungeons & Dragons** are very much set up to generate a particular play experience; they will probably do better at that particular story or genre than any generic system, having been made from the ground up for that purpose.

    That said, GURPS is extremely useful precisely because there's such a range and wealth of supplements available, and for an idea where there doesn't exist any system that fits the idea it can be great. The last quote is very true - I've stolen quite a few useful bits and pieces out of GURPS supplements over the years.

      I completely agree. My personal favorite rpg system is [Fate](https://fate-srd.com/) because it places the fiction first and has mechanics designed to serve the narrative you’re creating together. [Powered By the Apocalypse](http://apocalypse-world.com/pbta/) is my second favorite because it is designed for a story to emerge from its mechanics that directly interact with the themes of the genre.
      ```

      - u/fortycakes:
        ```
        I'd actually say that FATE suffers from a lot of the same problems, and to a worse degree than GURPS due to its lack of crunch. It takes a lot of work to make FATE into something that has mechanical teeth enough to feel like it's supporting the genre of the game (although see **Dresden Files** for an example of it being done very well).

    This is one of my fav RPGs: http://suffadv.wikidot.com/

    I'm a little biased being familiar with the people that wrote it and having contributed to the expansion.

    The basic idea is that a long time ago, someone made an achronal artificial intelligence. They left humanity with some cool future tech (nanotech, psychohistory, wormholes) and buggered off for awhile. Now it's the future, the civilizations are cored around deep cultural beliefs rather than geography, and the AIs are back... to run the patent office.

    You play "patent officers". But, since your bosses can do something approximating "see the future", you really just get sent interest places to do interesting things; usually weird moral dillemas around technology that would explode or go unnoticed had you not been sent.

    Mechanically, the most interesting part is that you, as the player, have plot abilities (balanced against your character abilities); the space amish have amazing plot abilities, the living starships have very little. It works _really_ well.

  [Monthly Girls Nozaki-kun](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23289/Gekkan_Shoujo_Nozaki-kun) is one of the best comedy anime I’ve ever seen. It’s up there with Ouran High School Host Club as a fantastic parody of shojo romance manga, but without an overarching plot or character development. The fact that it’s *just* a high school comedy shouldn’t dissuade you though, it’s freaking hilarious and the best adaption of 4-koma jokes I’ve seen yet. I’m definitely checking out the manga to get more of it.

  I won’t spoil what the show is about, it’s actually better to go in blind and discover the characters for yourself. They all fall into traditional archetypes, but subvert them in significant ways that satirize both shojo romance and traditional gender roles. I think that’s what elevates the show beyond *just* a parody of romantic plots driven by misunderstandings where the joke is that everyone is smart enough to figure out other people’s problems but oblivious to their own, though that’s still enough to carry the comedy.

  There’s also some great jokes about how manga gets made and how the life of the writer often revolves around their creative process. I love the meta-humor about how the mangaka turns all of his friends into romance stories while being utterly oblivious to the actual romance story he’s in that never advances. The situation is contrived as all hell, but the absurdity of it just makes it funnier. If you have ever liked a romantic comedy anime, you’ve got to check this out.
