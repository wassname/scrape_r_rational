  >Rain glanced at the weakly-burning evertorch, then shook his head. It was about to burn out, and he didn’t have another to replace it. He left it where it was, and wearily picked his way back through the hallway. He needed to take care of a few things before the workers broke through.

  &#x200B;

  >“I’m not doing anything,” Rain said, hanging his helmet on his belt and raising his hands. “The cold is just from before. I was using Refrigerate to—never mind. There shouldn’t be any magic affecting you.”

  For anyone wondering, Rain was going back to kill off the remaining slimes for some delicious exp.

  >Rain winced. *Shit, common knowledge. My weakness.*

  Best line in the series.

    I think it’s from him breaking up rocks. He doesn’t need the XP.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      The exp bit was a joke.

      The real reason for killing off the slimes is so that he isn't leaving monsters behind to wander out and attack the workers through the exit that just opened up.
      ```

  ```
  Well, where's the domain of his soul now?  It might be the same couple of inches out from his body as everyone else, but it might be feet or yards now that he's leaking.

  I'm also surprised he wasn't using the Cycling Ring and didn't train Mana Manipulation by charging all of the other equipment.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Right now, he needs his armor charged. Charging up the cycling ring and the other equipment is only useful for training, while charging up his armor is both training and improves his defense. Besides, what is he going to do with the equipment? They're useless for getting him out and knowing Rain's character, he's going to do his best to return them to the original owners.
    ```

    - u/Agasthenes:
      ```
      Can He eben charge his armour? I think he never got more than a few hundred Mana in it as it always didcharges in darkness.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        He can charge the armor with or without light. What's going on is that the armor takes 1% of the incoming mana (due to the terrible import efficiency) and sends it into a holding space (aka the Capacitance Rune). The mana either stays there while there's light, or it gets used up to 'build' up the Durability Rune when it's dark. It looks like he's losing the mana, but in reality, every time he turns on the Durability Rune, the armor is stronger than before.
        ```

        - u/Agasthenes:
          ```
          Yeah and that's why he can't charge the armor full, because it uses the mana every night.
          ```

          - u/ricree:
            ```
            Max durability with the rune active is just under 20000. He's at 11,879 currently, so only about 8000 left to go.

            So at 0.8 mp per durability and 1% charge efficiency, that's about 640,000 mp left to go. (Assuming the armor takes no durability hits that need repairing).

            I can't remember whether he's bottlenecked on regen or charge skill. Either way, it's going to be a bit before he can even start to fill up the charge. On the plus side, the other runes don't cost a ton, so once durability is capped it can keep going for a long time without too much issue.
            ```

            - u/ulyssessword:
              ```
              He's bottlenecked on regen.  

              His mana regen is a couple a second, or up to a dozen or so with all boosts.  The charge skill is 1680/second with channel mastery.
              ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        He can always have light if he wants to, even while sleeping. Unless he needs to sleep with something that does not give light.
        ```

- u/Watchful1:
  ```
  So we now get an inkling of how the build is going to be overpowered. But still not really how it can be abused. I doubt having an overpowered soul means his damage or resistances increase. Obviously having people respect him more because they can feel him being powerful is at least a bit useful.

  The only thing I can think of is that he'll be able to jump up really fast if he manages to kill a higher level blue. 

  Though I bet it will help with the shield artifact thing somehow.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    There are definitely benefits *and* drawbacks to being overestimated. 

    The watch was already wary of him for (entirely sensible) protocol reasons, but he could play the part of a non-threatening civilian. And his entente with Velika was (barely) working because Velika believed she could kill him on a whim. Now this will have to be readjusted, but he'll get all the suspicion with none of the actual power.
    ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Someone strong is going to feel it and challenge him and kick his ass.
    ```

  - u/WalterTFD:
    ```
    There was that one comment, long ago, about how giving someone a lot of mana at once was a weapon, not a buff.  He might find a way to overload people's mana capacity.
    ```

- u/Luminous_Lead:
  ```
  Oversoul, huh? The metric ton of Accolades he ate probably didn't hurt.
  ```

  - u/danielparks:
    ```
    I don’t think he managed to unlock the accolades yet. [Chapter 93](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/chapter/491104/093-tomb):

    > After a minute, he gave up. While he could recall the scene perfectly, he remained in his body no matter how hard he concentrated. Either there was some trick to it, or he’d made a faulty assumption somewhere.
    ```

    - u/Luminous_Lead:
      ```
      Fair point. I wonder if he's going to try to hide all the magic items he found or if he'll just be carting them out openly.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Knowing Rain he's probably going to hand them over to the first authority figure he sees
        ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    It's probably just the indigestion from the protein bars.
    ```

  - u/Reply_or_Not:
    ```
    the one thing we know about his soul now is that it **prevents** him from using the accolades
    ```
