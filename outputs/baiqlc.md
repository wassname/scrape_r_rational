  Really sorry for the delay. I hope I can pick myself up, I have the plot decided, what I can't find recently is the actual inspiration to put it in words, or just the energy to do it. I still haven't finished chapter 21, but I wanted to post this just to make it clear that the story's not dead, I'm still here and writing it!

    You know, I'd seen this pop up in the subreddit a bunch of times, but only checked it out yesterday, while browsing through other people's favorite lists on [ff.net](https://ff.net)

    It's really good! I only know a small segment of canon, and it's not this part, but that doesn't seem to matter (having briefly looked up Bulma's canon incarnation, I'm glad you've altered her). Properly measuring and quantifying ki usage to understand how to repeatably reproduce its effects and presumably bring them to the masses? Most excellent.

      Thanks! I think Bulma is a pretty awesome character in canon too, in theory, she’s just got the bad luck to be in the wrong genre of story. So she gets sidelined relative to all the muscle heads. 

      I think one of my favourite defining moments of her comes at the beginning of the android saga. Trunks brings news of the coming of the androids from the future, and her first reaction is “well, let’s go kill their creator before he can make them!”. A utilitarian if I’ve ever seen one XD. But then of course no one does that because the plot must go on (and Krillin points out that actually having a continuous stream of common enemies might be the only thing that keeps their dysfunctional bunch from blowing up).

  Finally!  
  Was there a Blackadder reference in this chapter or is it just me?
