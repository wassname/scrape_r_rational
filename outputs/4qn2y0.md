## [RT][FF] Marked for Death - Chapter 53: Reaching Out

### Post:

Latest chapter is [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/page-728#post-6352237). First chapter is [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/). 

This is currently the 10th most active quest on SufficientVelocity; it's a rational take on Naruto with a different setting and focused on original characters. The players have just closed out the latest arc, escaping from the village of hillbilly ninja with the pangolin summoning scroll they came for.

  Oh, I should have mentioned that this chapter was written by /u/Velorien. It's been both a pleasure and a challenge trying to measure up to him as a co-author.

  I really appreciate the choice of animals used in this quest. Tapirs and pangolins! What, were you expecting a different animal?

    Someone in the thread was speculating on what would happen if Hazou got a contract and it turned out to be for amoebas.  That is now a thing I want to do.
