  I think using both what I have already written and what I have planned for the rest of the story I could justify this story's existence here but I don't want to argue about it, and I'm not trying to annoy anyone or start a ruckus.

  I won't personally post the chapters here and I asked the moderator to take down other people's instances of it if he thinks that it doesn't belong.

    Ignore appropriate-username. Everyone else is very much enjoying the story.

    Judging by how your comment is the most upvoted comment, and appropriate-username's comment is the most downvoted comment in this thread, I think it's a strong sign that the majority of redditors here want your story to keep being posted here.

    Please. Keep writing this gorgeous work of art.

    Not sure why you feel the need to kowtow to a handful of whiners, the upvotes have clearly indicated that most people who read your story both like it and think it belongs here, this story has consistently gotten more upvotes than most things on the sub.
    ```

    - u/appropriate-username:
      ```
      >and think it belongs here

      Upvoters generally upvote stuff regardless of whether it belongs in a sub or not. If this was not the case, there would be no need for rules anywhere, people would just downvote everything that doesn't belong out of view.

      If you want examples, feel free to go into random rising /r/science threads and see how many puns, jokes and especially anecdotal comments get plenty of upvotes.

      As far as I can tell, voting has a huge bias towards "like/dislike" and away from "belongs/does not belong."

      For another example, see my comment ITT being downvoted when I'm talking about the story. It clearly belongs ITT but it's been downvoted because people don't like it.

        True but it's not a big issue on subreddit yet
        ```

      - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
        ```
        Honestly, you're being kind of negative about this story, and no one else really agrees with you. Go start your own subreddit if you disagree with the desires of people on this one.
        ```

          It's honestly so persistent and weird that if the account wasn't so old I'd think it was gaz's alt intentionally starting controversy XD

            /u/gazemaize plays a long, and fairly mystifying, game...

            Honestly the thought had occurred to me.

          - u/appropriate-username:
            ```
            So anybody who defends their point is intentionally starting controversy? No wonder reddit's an echo chamber if lots of people believe that.

            Also, how am I weird?

        Not really seeing the problem here? Puns and jokes are funny, of course I would want to see funny things related to an article im interested in. And anecdotes play an important role in grounding a scientific finding in reality, in making them more than just abstract numbers.

        I am simplifying the problem of, whether a post belongs here, by suggesting that it's as simple as counting upvotes. There are lots of complicating factors, but sometimes it's best to look at the simple facts. It's easy to get bogged down in overcomplicated arguments on the definitions of rational, the purpose of the sub, etc... But the simple fact is, every upvotes is someone who's day was made a bit happier by these updates. Sure it doesn't fit into your definition of rational, but it does fit into mine. If there was a consensus that it wasn't rational, that might be different, but the content of a sub should be decided by the people of a sub. And the best way to measure whether the people like something, is upvotes.

          They don't belong in /r/science.

          >And anecdotes play an important role in grounding a scientific finding in reality, in making them more than just abstract numbers.

          Anecdotes misrepresent reality, especially since on the internet anybody can just make them up. The point of science is to represent reality - there's a reason why scientific evidence is not anecdotal.

          >sometimes it's best to look at the simple facts.

          That may be true but I don't see any reason to suggest that this is one of those times.

          >And the best way to measure whether the people like something, is upvotes.

          Sure, which wasn't my point.

  This is poetry. 

  Thank you for the chapter.

  >The doors closed half of the way, three quarters of the way, four-fifths of the way… and then Keerthi pushed through the crowd, ignoring the loud screams of her mother and father, and squeezed her way inside.

  How many people think Keerthi just got herself killed after what looks like a disqualifying action thanks to her parents?

    I think she will be fine. Despite what he said, I don't think Charles will kill her. He might not even mention it.

      I don't think Charles will kill her, but that doesn't mean she'll be 'fine'. Mr. Bucket is clearly a lunatic of the highest order...

        Wait, but there were six winners in the challenge, I'm sure of that. Did I misread the story that hard?

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          There are six winners. He's just not one of them.

          The winners are JUROR, miss vaper, tide honey, the genius baby, actually loved daughter, and the protagonist.
          ```

            - u/xamueljones:
              ```
              To be fair, everyone thought he would end up winning in a later chapter. Goes to show no matter how good a system is, there will always be human error to muck it up.

                Just adding a footnote that because the Chococlipper didn't get to participate in the contest doesn't mean it isn't going to end the world in chocolate.

          The six winners were JUROR, Mahuika, Tide, Lim, Keerthi, and Chili

  Taking an inappropriately wide swing here because with this story I’d rather WMG at the most interesting thing my intuition gives me instead of the most likely:

  The one who shot himself was the real Bucket, and the other one is the robot. Maybe you can’t die in Wonkaland for some terrifying chocolate-related reason (Would explain how the other kids in the first one survived like that to leave), and the only time to leave the factory is at the inception of the suspiciously Cabin-In-The-Woods-esque “contest” ritual. The inside of Wonkaland might as well be a sweets-themed nightmare realm, after all, and not an underground factory.

  Or I guess it could be a realistic (chocolate) robot, or (chocolate) engineered bioclone. If you think that’s more rational.
  ```

    > The one who shot himself was the real Bucket, and the other one is the robot.

    I mean, it's certainly more plausible that a robot could a 40 foot octuple backflip than an old man... That said, who knows. Gene Wilder's fun little summersault may have made people question their assumptions about Wonka, but Old man bucket's insane actions here make people question reality itself. It's a great escalation.

  I was very happy to see that Keerthi's very fine duo weren't sprayed with chocolate for the crime of trying to protect her from what seems quite like a deranged man and in fact might be just about anything.

  Is the use of England instead of the UK a clue that Scotland is independent?

  They said the Queen of England before right? And she hasn't existed for 300 years irl

  Tides dad is an astronomer then?

    No he's a scientist. That's definitely what she said. 

    Also her mom is _totally_ Matilda. I forgot that Matilda was adopted by Miss Honey at the end of the film, which would have changed her name.
