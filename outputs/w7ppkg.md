## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I was happy to find out that after a four year hiatus, [Denial (Worm)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/denial-worm-alt-power-comedy.679429/) has started updating again. This is a crack fic where an unpowered Taylor takes out Lung by accident, and everyone believes she's a powerful cape. More lucky coincidences follow, and you are never quite sure whether the PRT's assessment of an instinctual combat thinker power isn't right after all...

  Also, [To the Stars (Madoka)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984) updated after more than a year. The most recent chapter is an Akari interlude, so we don't really learn anything new about the main open questions. That said, the first chapter of the next arc is to follow soon...
  ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    Wait what that's fantastic news. I loved Denial and was so sad when it just abruptly stopped.

    Then again there is a lot of stuff on royal road that should've ended but might mean the end of the author's patreon revenue
    ```

  - u/nikic:
    ```
    On that note, does anyone have recommendations for more fics like Denial, where coincidence gets misinterpreted as competence, and this gets played for comedic effect? [Professor Arc (RWBY)](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10898868/1/Professor-Arc) is probably my favorite instance of this, but nothing else really comes to mind.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Youjo Senki fanfics tend to do this, _A Young Woman's Political Record_ (basically completed) and _A Young Woman's Delinquency Record_ (hiatusy) being standouts.
      ```

    - u/xachariah:
      ```
      If you're familiar with 40k at all, Ciaphas Cain novels are exactly this and spawned a dozen books, and are considered in the list of genuinely good 40k novels as books and not just 40k (a short list, among the >500 some odd 40k books).

      There are earlier examples (eg Flashman), but Ciaphas Cain is probably the most influential in the genre for SF&F.  IIRC, Denial's author said it's the closest example/inspiration. I highly recommend.

    SF I like, from most to least HFY. 

    [Dread Empire's Fall Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85653.The_Praxis) - Space Opera with mostly hard SF space combat. Extremely HFY and optimistic. 

    [Uplift Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96472.Sundiver), particularly the first trilogy. Humans find themselves a small, primitive part of a huge and ancient galactic community. Very HFY, pretty optimistic. 

    [Starship Troopers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17214.Starship_Troopers?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=72F9Poxkk6&rank=1) - Intergalactic war against insectoid aliens with power armor. Very HFY and optimistic. 

    [The Forever War Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21611.The_Forever_War) - Intergalactic vietnam war against ~~insectoid~~ aliens with power armor. Mild HFY and increasingly optimistic, by the last book. 

    [Imperial Radch trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333324-ancillary-justice) - Interesting examination of AI, mind uploading  and our normative assumptions on gender. Mild HFY and optimism. 

    [Diamond Age](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/827.The_Diamond_Age) and Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson - Read in this order. Not set in space, but very readable Cyberpunk. No aliens, so no HFY. Mildly dystopian, but overall positive. Included it because they're both among my favourite books.

  I need some help identifying a web serial whose name I have unfortunately forgotten.

  Some details I remember are that the protagonist is male, and lives in the countryside on a farm.  He and his family have a sounder of pigs.  War breaks out, and the protagonist has to join a militia. 

  Not too sure about this particular detail, but I vaguely recall that this world is ruled by an AI which enforces some sort of ban on metal.

  Last week there was a request for healthcare advancement-themed stories, either in original historical, original fantasy, isekai or fanfiction settings, and I only noticed the request on Sunday, at the end of the week, whereupon I recommended [Jin,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_(manga\)) which a few people may have missed due to the delayed response. It's a mostly-rational, completed isekai manga wherein a modern-day surgeon struggles to set up a medical practice and advance healthcare in 1850s Japan.

  While I'm here, can anybody recommend any rational or rational-adjacent stories about any aspect of local or regional government? I've been rewatching the NBC TV show *Parks and Recreation* and I'm looking for something with a less comedic theme, although some humour is fine.
  ```

  - u/TumbleweedOk8510:
    ```
    I've heard [Yes Minister](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080306/?ref_=tt_urv) is quite good, and it matches what you seem to want mostly, but I haven't seen it myself.
    ```

    - u/ProfessorPhi:
      ```
      Veep too is a great example of this, though it isn't all that regional. The final season in particular is excellent and there are plenty of play and counterplay scenes that are played for comedic effect.
      ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    Jin was fun, I liked seeing a more grounded seinen take on the historical isekai genre. 

    As regards the protagonist's rationality, he's very passive and unambitious, not really taking the initiative with his foreknowledge to spread public health interventions and germ theory worldwide, nor trying to turn Japan away from toxic nationalism, nor investigating the fetal brain tumor that sent him to the past and could have affected others, but instead just slotting into the expected social position of a doctor and excelling there on a city scale. That said, it is a character flaw the manga is aware of and he does slowly grow. I get the impression that he was the kind to follow the socially-endorsed path of conventional success all the way to becoming a neurosurgeon before his isekai, and that lack of any internal drive was what caused his fiancee to leave him.
    ```

  - u/ChikaoJ:
    ```
    I'd like to recommend 

    Release that Witch!

    For a good isekai government story, it has action and magic too, but more often than not the main character focuses on solving housing, agricultural, and education issues.

    Synopsis: Chen Yan travels through time, becoming an honorable prince in a world set in the medieval age. Yet this world is not quite as simple as he thought. Witches with magical powers abound, and fearsome wars between the Church and kingdoms rage throughout the land.

    Citadel - it's on amazon, but can be found for free on the author's site: 
    https://unillustrated.wordpress.com/

    First book follows new recruits to the citadel program, training for a federal agency of super-powered responders to emergency in a world with a lot of super power violence and collateral damage. I consider it Worm-lite. Not quite as well written, not quite as heavy on the general horror and despair. Also, in general powers are very strong, so less grounded. One of the main pros is that the trainers are clearly good at what they do, and truly try to prepare their trainees to a work filled with hard choices and a lot of directed violence. All in all, it's actually pretty fun.

    Second book follows some of the MCs from the first book when on assignment as junior agents. Third book starts to do the same for other characters but dies in the middle, so I would suggest simply reading the first two, they've relatively closed stories.

    I've been enjoying [Switchblade](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27750934/chapters/67927960). It's a BNHA fic where Midoriya at the start of canon turns up at school with no memory of the past week. He ends up with a bunch of instinctively learned combat skills and a major mystery hanging over his head, but manages to make it into UA on the back of a mini-batman shtick instead of any actual superpowers.

    Haven't been explicitly looking at it from a rationilst perspective, but it expands on a lot of worldbuilding space that was otherwise disappointing in canon, and doesn't turn into the shounen power-scaling mess like canon ended up either, with Izuku clearly a minor player in a much bigger picture.

Voldemort goes to Gryffindor and the world of HP is fleshed out much more dramatically, with so many flow on effects downstream that are fascinating to see. Done as a series of short stories for different characters, with the story stopping halfway into the most detailed arc, Hermione Granger and the Silent Country, where Hermione returns home to Britain as part of the Beauxbaxtons delegation to Hogwarts for the Twi-Wizard Cup, and draws the attention of Headmaster Riddle.

    [Under The Skin](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/under-the-skin-worm-altpower-body-horror.93343/): Worm. Extreme body horror. Taylor still has bug powers, but on the "I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream" end of the spectrum. Only started a year ago, but the author seems to disappear for a few months at a time.

    [Desperate Times Call For Desperate Pleasures](https://archiveofourown.org/works/37131436/chapters/92638714): Worm. *Technically* a romcom. Actually feels like watching (reading) a complete and utter trainwreck and being unable to look away. I applaud the author for being able to intentionally write something so horrific whilst almost entirely focused on interpersonal drama and relationships.

    To actually explain what is going on, Taylor gets Cherish's power, resolves to be a hero instead of mass-mind controlling sociopath, and decides to try and help the absolute mess that is Amy Dallon wrok through her feelings. The solution is for Taylor to redirect Amy's incestual love for her sister on to Taylor instead in a pseudo-Pavlovian set up, as they start fake dating to explain why they keep hanging out and why Amy is so overtly interested in Taylor. Amy is fully aware that she can cry wolf at any time to get Taylor birdcaged for what she is doing, or just being able to rewire brain her any time they touch, while Taylor could use her city-wide mind control to various ends, so to say there's an odd balance of power here is an understatement.

    Author originally planned to update every fortnight, but is taking a break right now because writer's block. Not abandoned as of yet, but it still would be my recommendation for anyone interested in the other recommendations I gave. (Also, [SB link,](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/desperate-times-call-for-desperate-pleasures.996028/) which is behind the other places but has easily accessible comments instead of whatever you're supposed to do on AO3)

      *There Is Nothing To Fear* is neither dead nor abandoned, and lastly was updated in March this year, which is very recent in fanfiction times, especially in the HP fandom (I've had several HP fics I'm subscribed to update after 3-4 years of hiatus).

      The author left the following comment as recent as July 16th:

      > Updates are currently erratic. Job searching has taken up a lot of my time/cognitive energy (though, at the risk of jinxing things, that may not be true for much longer; fingers crossed).

      > I promise that if the fic dies / is abandoned, I'll tag it accordingly and add a note. I'm too familiar with the despair of not knowing if a good fic is dead or not.

    Honestly I think it fits this sub rather well - it's certainly not rational_ist_, but the world and characters are very well written and plotted, and the characters have reasonable and believable motivations for the things they do.

    [Naruto and the Power of Partnership](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7124104/1/Naruto-and-Pokemon-Power-of-Partnership) Is still one of my all time favorite fusion fics. It's admittedly a little rough around the edges and the first chapter is definitely the weakest, but overall I still really enjoyed it. Even with the caveat that it was noticeably done when Gen Five was the current pokemon generation

    [Swinging Pendulum](https://archiveofourown.org/works/855577/chapters/1637703) by cywscross is a Bleach fic that I go back yearly at least to re-read. The characterization feels very real in a way that I have a hard time explaining. But also super dead cause it's from like 2014 and the author kind of flits between fandoms with good ideas and good implementations, but does seem to be at the mercy of their muse at times. But still top tier pretty concise read it love it reread it.

    [Peter Parker: Agent of Hydra](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/peter-parker-agent-of-hydra.515572/reader/) by scriviner, this one just appeals to me in a deep nostalgic sense. Mostly that back when it was written we were less in danger of our real life analogues of Hydra. Peter Parker more credited as the scientist than the webslinger also not like a believer in the Hydra ideology, still kind of questionable I dunno if i'd want to read it for the first time fresh at this moment. 

    [but you gotta get up at least one more](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7392847/chapters/25125312) by simkjrs this is a My Hero fic that more or less takes a lot of what Saitama is from One Punch Man and makes a lot of the conflict in the story is more around the emotional issues of a physically op Midoriya and I love it. And I still hold out hope that the author will get around to making new chapters at some point. They've talked about it on their tumblr but it seems like not something to expect within the next year.

    [For Those We Cherish](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/for-those-we-cherish-40k-rwby.408155/reader/) Warhammer 40k/RWBY fanfic by The Crimson Lord. It might be better said to be The 40k/RWBY fanfic I'm not sure if it's the first but it's definitely one of the bigger and impactful ones. And I'm a huge fan of Military Sci-fi in general. But what I really enjoyed was the promise that of these two broken and faltering settings that they could together find hope on the road of cooperation, where they might falter alone. That to me is one of the main reasons to read crossover fanfic to transcend limits that one cannot breach by themselves and be made better by the introduction of new ideas and people.

    [Human Debris](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/human-debris-gundam-ibo-mad-max-multi-si.486034/reader/) by luckychaos which is a multicrossover mainly centered around Iron Blooded Orphans and doesn't really have that much time to get into a lot of implied insanity. Now if you're reading these in order than like take out the fic description before and put it around the shed and you put it down so it doesn't have to see how things could be made worse. Great enormous amounts of references akin to Erfworld in some senses but I just really enjoyed the feeling of being as the story is named Human Debris. Kind of falters do to being a little bit much to actually write for but I enjoy it for the promise of what it could be much as I enjoy Episode seven of Star Wars for promising big even if those promises aren't met.

    [But Doctor I am Pagliacci](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/but-doctor-i-am-pagliacci-dc-joker-au.59162/reader/) by Acyl is a fic where the villains one so thoroughly that they've erased all of Batman from existence, everywhere except for in the mind of a Jack Napier better known as the Joker. And who is the Joker without Batman? Author is busy with life, but damn do I want more of this fic crazed insanity which then tapers to reasonably logical.

    [Life Ore Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/life-ore-death-dc-feruchemy-young-justice.35443/reader/) by Obloquy a feruchemist inserted into Young Justice. It's been mentioned a few times on this subreddit before and while it's only been 2 years in comparison to some of the fics that I mentioned on this list I genuinely regret in some ways that the Young Justice tv show was continued, because of how thoroughly it derailed Obloquy's plans for this fic. I don't think they've ever outright stated that's why they took a break from writing it and also advising a ton of people writing fics on Spacebattles and Sufficient Velocity in the Young Justice universe I'd even go so far as to say that they're one of The Forces of Young Justice on those websites with how they've influenced and also outright beta-ed fics. Love it slow start doesn't really pick up until like dozen chapters in and doesn't really hit it's stride until like the Red Volcano scene that really hard breaks with canon.

  Hey, I'm looking for stories where someone has the power to resurrect the dead, and this is a large focus of the story, or at least treated as a major part of the character's life.

  When resurrection exists I've found it's either treated as extremely rare and out of reach except in the most exceptional of circumstances, or it's sufficiently widespread as to be a general fact about the setting rather than something specific to one or a few people. I'm looking for the potentially awkward spot where it's something only one or a few people can do, but they can do it pretty regularly and reliably.

  I think this might be a tricky ask, so I'm happy to hear about any stories that only sort of fit, or just have similar themes. Thanks in advance!

    Spoiler for Ward, but even letting on that this is a spoiler for Ward is itself a spoiler so not bothering to tag it:

    Having this power is a major part of one character's life, but that character isn't part of the main cast so it doesn't get a ton of focus in the story as a whole.

        That's right. It's a [UK acronym](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/SPAG) which has become popular online over the last few years. It's a particularly useful shortcut when discussing fan fiction and other types of amateur fiction.

      That's a great series.

      I remember one book goes over the different types of assassinations. Most often when you hire an assassin to kill someone, but not to make them perma-dead, it's the equivalent of sending a very expensive "cease-and-desist whatever you are doing that is pissing me off" message, like the horse head in the bed scene in *The Godfather* series.

    This is more about D&D than fiction, but I remember it was posted on the sub: [The King is Dead! Long Live the King!](https://critical-hits.com/blog/2015/05/18/the-king-is-dead-long-live-the-king/). Resurrection spells are tempting, but the best kingdom is a [Lichdom](https://critical-hits.com//blog/2015/01/25/the-lich-kings-of-avalon/). Only necromancy guarantees stability ;)

    [Never Die Twice](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32067/never-die-twice) is also more about necromancy than resurrection, but if you count "defeating death" as the ultimate resurrection, then it's very much central to the story.

    I think that [Raise (RWBY)](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/14043289/1/Raise) fits your request quite well. Jaune's (unique) semblance is resurrection (within a short time window), and it's certainly a central part of his life. That said, I wouldn't consider this one of Coeur's best works.

  [Sanitize](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/chapters/49228244) got re-recommended last week, and since it had been a while since I read it, I decided to a re-read.

  Firstly: still great. One of the better works that's been posted on this sub, in my opinion. Well written and really makes you feel the emotional weight of the story.

  That being said, when I got to the end of it, I noticed an A/N that said "coming up next will be a final chapter and then an epilogue", but there was nothing added. There are a couple additional compilations of interludes, what ifs, omakes, etc. that are posted separately, but the last chapter and epilogue never got posted (that I could find). Does anyone know what happened?

  It's not a major deal since the last chapter ends the story in a pretty satisfying place, but if there is more out there, I'd love to read it.
  ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    Pretty sure the author is just still working on it.
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      I suppose it's possible given the web serial world, but given that it's been nearly a year since the last update, I'd be starting to lean towards "probably not going to happen" at this point. Although, as I mentioned, not that big a deal since the story as-is ends on a very satisfactory note and doesn't really need more.
      ```

      - u/anenymouse:
        ```
        The author took more than a year to put out this last chapter I'm pretty sure. Actually based on the reviews on the chapters. The first review was on  

        1 Apr 2, 2017 And that was the day it was first posted on fanfiction.net

        So I'd say given the current instability and how much longer it's taken over time for the chapters to be posted which is normal for stories to take longer to write out that it's premature to say that they won't finish it. Tell you what I'll post on the monday request and recommendation thread and message you personally u/DangerouslyUnstable . When the next chapter comes out.

    Maybe I'm missing something but is Sanitize only 20 chapters total? I feel that people talk about it all the time and feel that I'm missing something if that's the case.
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      Where are you seeing 20 chapters? On both [Archive of our own](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824?view_full_work=true) and [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize) there are only 13 chapters. 

      But yes, it's relatively short and (per this discussion) more-or-less complete, but it's _very_ good. I actually think being short is a strength. A lot of web fiction seems to think that length, in and of itself, is a virtue; which leads to a lot of works that are chapter after chapter after chapter that goes no where and accomplishes nothing.

    Thor, Love and Thunder probably? If that, I immensely enjoyed the regisseurs Hunt for the Wilderpeople.
