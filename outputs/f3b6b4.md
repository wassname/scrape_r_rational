  Yeah, Sanderson does some excellent hard magic systems. Most of his stories are not rationalist, but the world building is consistent in a way that makes many of his stories rational by the definition on the sidebar, at least.
  ```

  ```
  I agree with this; I bought this book for easy rereading just for the planning, thinking, and how all the book's factions play together. It's a really well fleshed out set of characters who all have plans, desires and actually act on them. There's lots of subtlety and it's great fun reading the reading all the moves and counter moves.
  ```

- u/Fresh_C:
  ```
  The description of the magic system sounds almost identical to soul casting in the Stormlight Archives.

  To anyone who's read both: Is it basically the same thing? Or are there more nuanced differences in the systems than the surface level idea of convincing the "soul" of an object to change its form?
  ```

  - u/thequizzicaleyebrow:
    ```
    They're related, but distinct, as far as I can tell. We don't fully understand soulcasting  yet, but it seems to rely more on perceived authority, confidence, and being persuasive to the spirit of the object you're trying to change.  

    Forging, in contrast, focuses more on the plausibility of a change. Plausibility here means something like "is it possible that the desired effect could have been the case, if something in the past was different"  Instead of convincing a chair that it would would prefer to be broken, you use your magic to make it so that something that *could have* happened, insects chewing up one of the legs, *did* in fact happen.   How much magic and skill it takes to accomplish any desired effect is dependent on how much of a bend in reality it would take for that desired effect to be true. 

     If you want to make a wooden chair turn into solid gold, you would have to essentially convince reality that the creator of that chair decided to make the chair out of gold, instead of wood.  Maybe there's some extremely unlikely universe where that happened, where an emperor happened to want a chair made out of gold and picked this artisan to make it, but that's such an implausible change that the magic is almost guaranteed to fail.

    ```
    It's actually quite different. He specifically took steps to make sure that they were sufficiently different in implementation, and I think he was successful. The only similar notes are really the name and the concept of "stuff changing."
    ```

  - u/xland44:
    ```
    While there is an underlying similarity (both magics are in the cosmere and rely on similar principles), they're very different, both in appearance and in application.
    ```

  - u/lordcirth:
    ```
    Soulcasting works (as far as we know) by convincing the object that it would like to be something else. Forging works by constructing an alternate history that makes the object something else, then stamping it with a pattern that encodes that history. The tinier and more plausible the change, the better/longer it will take.
    ```

    It's not about alchemy (changing one substance into another) so much as rewriting history.

  Hot take - you're much more likely to get a good rational story out of a random Brandon Sanderson tale than a random Eliezer Yudkowsky one.

  It's not even close.

    Hard disagree. Sanderson [can't even follow his own laws](http://daystareld.com/stormlight-archives/), let alone write rational fiction:

    Spoilers below for Stormlight Archives (and some minor ones for Mistborn). Extra warning that this may mildly ruin the books for you even if you enjoy it, maybe, but I’m a strong believer in being able to look critically at things that I can still appreciate for other elements.

    So there’s four main criticisms I have of the Stormlight Archives (maybe more that I’ve forgotten), not all of which are spread evenly over all three books. In fact the sequels get a lot better, by my reckoning, and may be worth reading through the first one to get to them. But hoo-boy, that first one’s got some problems, and I’ll try to highlight those as I go.

    First off, the author cheats. He was bad about this in the Mistborn trilogy, and it’s no different here. For someone who’s codified the “laws” of how to write magic systems, you’d think he would be able to get through a book without pulling some new shit out of thin air to resolve a major conflict. Seriously, pretty much every single major conflict in Stormlight is resolved by a character suddenly having a philosophical breakthrough that gives them new superpowers. It’s fine to have superpowers tied to resolve or oaths or wisdom or whatever, but when there’s NO indication ahead of time of WHEN these can manifest, or WHAT those superpowers are, or who they work for and not work for… it may feel awesome the first time or two, but it quickly gets more and more cheap and anticlimatic once you see it coming. They start to feel like deus ex machina, which is complemented by all the diabolus ex machina that keep ratcheting up the stakes for cheap tension throughought the series. This may be the only one of these flaws that is actually not as bad in the first book as the later ones.

    Second, and even worse, Sanderson hands Idiot Balls out like he’s playing Hot Potato. Why did it take three books for Adolin to use that nifty Shardblade-throwing technique he developed, despite multiple circumstances where it would have been the perfect solution to the problem he faced? Guess he just forgot about that. Why doesn’t anyone put two-and-two together about Elhokar’s mutterings about seeing spren, even after everyone was in the same place and talking about them? For that matter why didn’t he try saying the words just before the battle at Kholinar, rather than waiting until his life was in danger? It goes on and on, I could probably list a dozen in each book and still find more with a reread.

    But the most egregious of Idiot Balls is in the first book, where Sanderson hands it to a god. The CENTRAL PLOT of book 1 ends up hinging on whether or not Dalinar could trust both his visions and Sadeas. He does a SMART thing by demanding the visions give him one clear answer to see if he can trust them, rather than vague and ominous statements. In return for his question of whether he can trust Sadeas, the vision says, unambiguously, “Yes.” Full stop. Followed by “This is important.” Full stop. Followed by some more vaguer comments that seem to tie in to trusting Sadeas.

    And after Sadeas betrays him, he asks the visions why they lied, and finds out that they’re just recordings. That the god who sent them is dead, and this god somehow decided that randomly saying YES like they were ANSWERING A QUESTION was a smart thing to do. This would be bad enough on its own, but the fact that Sanderson wrote the story so that Dalinar would finally ask THAT question at just THAT moment to get THAT response is so infuriatingly hackneyed that I nearly stopped reading the series then and there. Because there were so many better, simple ways to have the same effect, and he should know better.

    Third complaint is that a lot of the characters feel soulless in Way of Kings. This is a general problem I have with Sanderson’s writing, and YMMV, but I’ve talked to a lot of people about his books and this does not seem to be a unique view of mine. It definitely gets a LOT better in the sequels (in direct contrast to Mistborn, where the first book felt like its characters were more alive than in the later ones), but most of the Way of Kings feels like a slog in part because I just didn’t care about most of the characters. They don’t act like real people to me, they don’t seem to care enough about solving the problems they have, they talk like they’re reading scripts. The pacing here is part of the problem too: each of the different storylines feel like they take forever to get from point A to point C, and like you’re just rereading Point B again and again and again. How many times did we really need to read about Shallan agonizing over whether to steal the soulcaster, or Kaladin struggling with his depression, or Adolin being frustrated with his father? It feels like at least 1/3 of the book could be cut out without much loss.

    Fourth complaint is a fairly niche one: Sanderson is not great at writing non-theists. Again, he gets a bit better with it in the sequels, but listening to Jasnah justify her atheism in book 1 made me want to pull my hair out with how canned and unconvincing her arguments were, especially coming from someone who the text keeps insisting is exceedingly brilliant. I can’t fault Sanderson for trying, he’s at least very clearly treating atheism with RESPECT, but I still can’t help but wish he found some better atheists to beta read and give feedback so he could better understand the epistemics that go into skepticism. Also I’m still wary Jasnah might eventually recant and realize the error of her ways, similar to what happened to Mistborn’s atheist.

    So yeah, that’s it just off the top of my head. There’s certainly a lot to admire in the series, and I enjoyed the sequels more than the first book, so maybe it’s worth reading for that, but I’m not holding out hope for the author to get past these flaws overall. Despite his amazing skills in worldbuilding and designing magic systems, Sanderson has disappointed me too often for me to ever see him as some shining beacon of the fantasy genre that others seem to perceive him as.

    (Edit 2: Decided to just show the whole thing I linked to, since the poster below misquoted it and mirepresented it multiple times, which caused me some frustration)
    ```

    - u/AHaskins:
      ```
      Alright - I'm gonna have to wall of text this, because every single one of these objections is... kinda contrived.

      1) "There's no indication ahead of time when or how the oaths will manifest." followed by "it gets cheap and anticlimactic once you see it coming." Yeah, that's what happens when a mysterious ancient power gets to be slowly understood. It always had clearly defined rules, you didn't understand them and they seem like Deus Ex Machina, then you do and they seem anticlimactic. This objection makes no sense. If you already knew the normal progression of a surgebinder, book 1 wouldn't have a dramatic ending. It would be an expected victory lap for the clearly standard path the main character is following.

      2) "Adolin took too long to learn to throw his shard blade." You see him practicing it, he references how he's still practicing it in book two, and then he throws it in book three to so-so effect. Considering the relatively quick timeline of these books, it's really hard to call that one an idiot ball. That's a normal progression of a minor skill from a secondary(ish) character in a series that highlights the difficulties of training martial skills. 

      3) "Why didn't Elhokar say the words just to try them out?" Considering his obsession with the concept of being a hero, he certainly did. But it would undercut the dramatic moment that I wont spoil here if it had been shown. It's fairly well established that just saying the words doesn't do shit - there has to actually be understanding behind them on the part of the speaker (in fact, the actual words and their phrasing don't seem to matter as much anyway). Not showing the entirety of a tertiary character's journey for the sake of allowing perceptive readers to predict the dramatic moment is normal for any well written book, rational or otherwise. And he never talked about talking to spren, I don't know why this guy got that impression. He talked about people following him and being watched - which, for a paranoid king who tried to organize his own attempted assassination, has a much simpler explanation.

      4) Why did Dalinar test the messages from the god and then correctly act upon the results of his test? Gee. Would he have gotten different results if he had conducted a different test? Of course. That's how things work. But he didn't, because he wasn't handed a plot baton. He suspected something was amiss, tested his theory, and got a result. 

      5) He complains about not liking the characters. I think it's safe to say he's in the minority here. I suspect, however that this is his *actual* objection to the series, and the rest is derived to support this dislike.

      6) He complains about Sanderson not using the arguments he prefers for atheism. This is more of a wtf response from me as a lifelong atheist. Ignoring the fact that this is a world where literal gods do exist (and I would expect the arguments in such a world to be different), Jasnah's arguments are all both reasonable and common in real atheist-religious confrontations. She even has a few that are somewhat unique to that world. He doesn't like that the atheist in Mistborn gained more nuanced views on religion as part of the process of *becoming a god.* Seriously, this one doesn't make sense to me at all.

      I was prepared to accept real objections to the series, here. But these... just don't make any sense.

        You missed the objection: it's not that they seemed anticlimactic because I understood them, they were anticlimactic because they were predictable as *story beats* while also being utterly unpredictable in *effects.* 

        You seem to be saying that the magic system's rules are clearly defined, and this is just not true. There is nothing in the books that indicate ahead of time what the powers the characters suddenly gain will be.

        >"Adolin took too long to learn to throw his shard blade."

        Not what I said, read more carefully please: he learned to do it in book one, he never bothered trying to use it in combat until book 3, where it worked the first time he tried it after his practice session. You seem to be misremembering the events of the books.

        >Considering his obsession with the concept of being a hero, he certainly did. But it would undercut the dramatic moment that I wont spoil here if it had been shown. It's fairly well established that just saying the words doesn't do shit - there has to actually be understanding behind them on the part of the speaker (in fact, the actual words and their phrasing don't seem to matter as much anyway). Not showing the entirety of a tertiary character's journey for the sake of allowing perceptive readers to predict the dramatic moment is normal for any well written book, rational or otherwise.

        This is my point about predictability: you are basing this off of what is predictable for *plot structure*, not what is predictable for the magic system. You cannot claim that Sanderson's magic system is predictable and understandable when the trigger is something as subjective and internal as "when the speaker truly understands them." It's a gimmick that works well for letting the author decide when they want things to happen, but is not compatible with a truly rational and understandable magic system.

        Which is fine, if that's the kind of magic system Sanderson wants to write. But he wrote the Law of Magic that states that the magic system's ability to solve plot points should be proportional to how well the readers understand it, and yet he constantly solves plot points with a magic system that is not just unpredictable in its development of new aspects, but also its effects.

        > And he never talked about talking to spren, I don't know why this guy got that impression. He talked about people following him and being watched - which, for a paranoid king who tried to organize his own attempted assassination, has a much simpler explanation.

        This guy (who is me btw) got that impression because he very explicitly was describing spren, specifically the same ones Jasnah sees, Cryptics. You may not remember it or have noticed it, but it's certainly there in book one.

        >4) Why did Dalinar test the messages from the god and then correctly act upon the results of his test? Gee. Would he have gotten different results if he had conducted a different test? Of course. That's how things work. But he didn't, because he wasn't handed a plot baton. He suspected something was amiss, tested his theory, and got a result.

        You completely missed this argument's point. Please reread it.

        >5) He complains about not liking the characters. I think it's safe to say he's in the minority here. I suspect, however that this is his actual objection to the series, and the rest is derived to support this dislike.

        If you think I disliked the series before I even started it, you're just assuming bad faith, which I have no answer to. But again, please read more carefully: I disliked the characters in book 1 specifically. Most of them got better. 

        >6) He complains about Sanderson not using the arguments he prefers for atheism.

        I did note this is the most subjective one, but my actual problem is that the arguments for atheism are not actually good ones considering the world she lives in. You even bring it up yourself: "where literal gods do exist." If you're writing an atheist in a world like that, particularly from a brilliant academic who's the premier skeptic in her world, I expect a better class of argument than the ones Jasnah used. If they were acceptable to you, great, but I found them very weak.

        >I was prepared to accept real objections to the series, here. But these... just don't make any sense.

        Hopefully this clarifies things.

          Yo daystar, I like your content and agree with your arguments here. I don't think this was a very constructive comment though. Your opponent is more likely to get upset about being accused of forgetting and misreading than they are to respond constructively.

          Can you write this in a way that respects your opponent more or rephrase your own arguments in the places where he misunderstood?
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Can you help me out with how to do that? I can see how the last line bleeds some of my frustration through, but for the rest of it I'm just stating that he misread my criticisms or the book and asked him to read more carefully. Is it just the last line that I should change?
            ```

            - u/FordEngineerman:
              ```
              Asking your opponent to re-read has never been a successful technique for me in any online debate ever. I have also never seen it succeed. I have seen it cause offence many times. It often gets taken as an Ad Hominem attack regardless of the intent.

              Starting with that, my recommendation is to quote the specific part you want him to understand better and possibly even restate the point it makes differently.

              Also sadly, when people are debating a point that becomes a contention of memory, I don't think there is anything to do but either drop the point or do the hard work. It is unlikely that he will re-read or change his memory. I recommend actually finding an example or two from the book or tabling that part of the argument until a later time.
              ```

              - u/DaystarEld:
                ```
                That's good advice. My frustration here is that it means I have to do twice the work for him, and people should be able to recognize that if they read the argument itself. My first mistake in part was not just posting my thing myself instead of linking to it, but you're right that the best path would be to specify each point line by line that he misrepresents. I just find that tedious, and I hoped I would not have to do something like that in this sub of all places.

                  There is some fault of your own though. I honestly didn't fully understand a few of your points. That is why there is value in restating them differently even though there is more work involved.

                    True, and I did for most of them. The only one I just skipped over entirely and told him to reread was the one where he missed the point entirely, wasn't even in the same ballpark. I still don't know how he could have thought I was complaining about Dalinar's actions when I actually, specifically PRAISED him for testing his beliefs. It really comes off to me like he just skimmed the whole post.

          We must have read different books here. There are only two people who's powers aren't fairly explicitly defined on arrival (maybe don't skip the epilogue that lines out how they all work). The first is Kaladin at the end of book 1 - and they're foreshadowed heavily both by his own story and the presence of someone who specifically outlines how they work in the prologue. Testing the details about your powers (ala Shallan's lightweaving practice) is a common trope in ratfics anyway. The only *real* example you can point to is a single action by Dalinar at the tail end of book 3 - and given that we have no reason to believe we're not starting another cycle of "explaining how that was a normal progression" (there's no book 4 yet), I'm giving that one a temporary pass until we learn more.

          >Not what I said, read more carefully please: he learned to do it in book one, he never bothered trying to use it in combat until book 3, where it worked the first time he tried it.

          And you can't come up with a reason that someone wouldn't throw away their weapon before training on how to do so with effect? More to the point, it is explicitly called out as something very difficult to accomplish at all (let alone use in combat) by Hrdalm, the person he saved.

          >You cannot claim that Sanderson's magic system is predictable and understandable when the trigger is something as subjective and internal as "when the speaker truly understands them."

          I think you're being obtuse here. If you don't see a difference between me reading from a script to see if I get powers and actually internalizing concepts, then I don't think you're speaking in good faith.

          >This guy (who is me btw) got that impression because he very explicitly was describing spren, specifically the same ones Jasnah sees, Cryptics. You may not remember it or have noticed it, but it's certainly there in book one.

          Shallan sees Cryptics, not Jasnah. And I absolutely remember it, because it was one of the clues for the aforementioned "perceptive readers." Let's stop speaking in generalities. In the middle of a speech about how he sees assassins everywhere and thinks he's being followed, Elhokar says:

          >I see their faces in mirrors. Symbols, twisted, inhuman.

          He says this to a room full of people who do not know anything about spren (or even the concept of sugebinding), and who all know that he is a paranoid little shitbag. It would be insane for anyone to call him out on it. I mean genuinely weird. I mean "how can you even think that would be a reasonable response" weird.

                Well, it's true that he could have handled that more gracefully and rephrased his point.

                But from what I understand, it *does* seem like you completely misunderstood that very short point.

                Given that you apparently also disagreed with every single one of his other points, it does give the impression that you stopped honestly weighting and/or trying to understand his arguments at some point and just rejected everything on principle.

                **So**, let me rephrase his arguments for you. (Bear in mind that I haven't read the series in question.)

                **He says:** The god sent prerecorded messages. He did not only (somewhat stupidly) not declare them as such, but did also (very stupidly) send messages like "Yes.", "Yes - definitely." *without any context whatsoever*, like some deranged Magic 8-Ball, instead of an intelligent being. This constitutes an idiot ball.

                **You reply:** Had the guy receiving these prerecorded messages replied with different (unread) messages than he canonically did, he would have come to different conclusions than he canonically did.

                Your "counterpoint" is a true enough statement. But it does not contradict the point that the god is acting like an idiot.
                What the receiver of the messages does or does not do is completely irrelevant to /u/DaystarEld's point.

                **EDIT:** Note, I am not claiming that /u/DaystarEld's point's is correct. I do not know. I have not read the books. /u/DaystarEld might be mischaracterizing what happens, or the received messages might be out-of-order, altered or fragmented for some legitimate reason for all I know. (Though in the latter case, the plot might be attacked on the grounds that it requires a ridiculous contrivance of coincidences.) All I am saying is that your point does not at all address his point, which makes you latter statement be quite out of line.

                  Thank you, this is in fact exactly what my argument was. The god does in fact say that it's all a prerecorded message, but the character and readers don't know that because the character apparently just forgot about it due to how traumatic the visions were, which I also find... difficult to swallow, but even taking it for granted, the actual criticism is that this entire event is utterly contrived to get the protagonist to trust the visions to disastrous effects.

                The idea that you can assign "jobs" in arguments by examining their broad structure and ignoring specific details seems misguided.

                If Alice makes an argument and Bob responds based on a misunderstanding, then *surely* before telling Alice what her "job" is, you should ask such questions as: "is Alice able, with reasonable effort, to present the argument in a different form?" "Did Bob appear to be actually making an effort to understand Alice?" "Are Alice and Bob trying to convince each other, or to convince bystanders, or just arguing for the sake of it, or what?" "Do Alice and Bob have a broadly friendly relationship, and would they like to keep it that way?"

            >We must have read different books here. 

            Yes, but luckily we can look at the books again to demonstrate which of us recalls the real ones ;)

            >The only person who's powers aren't fairly explicitly defined on arrival are Kaladin's at the end of book 1 - and they're foreshadowed heavily both by his own story and the presence of someone who specifically outlines how they work in the prologue.

            ...you cited the only example of powers that ARE clearly defined, for the reason you listed, and ignored all the other ones that are not? I don't understand where you think that, for example, Dalinar's powers that allowed him to summon stormlight in the final battle of book 3 were anywhere predicted. Can you please point to where this was foreshadowed or explained at all?

            >And you can't come up with a reason that someone wouldn't throw away their weapon before training on how to do so with effect? More to the point, it is explicitly called out as something very difficult to accomplish at all (let alone use in combat) by the person he saved.

            You misread me, and the book, again. **Please read more carefully**: he DID manage to do this during training in book 1. How long has it been since you read the books?

            >I think you're being obtuse here. If you don't see a difference between me reading from a script to see if I get powers and actually internalizing concepts, then I don't think you're speaking in good faith.

            Let's not throw around words like "obtuse" when you can't even get my criticisms right, or the events of the books, alright?

            >Shallan sees Cryptics, not Jasnah. And I absolutely remember it, because it was one of the clues for the aforementioned "perceptive readers." Let's stop speaking in generalities. In the middle of a speech about how he sees assassins everywhere, he says: I see their faces in mirrors. Symbols, twisted, inhuman.

            Sorry, pause real quick: you know you just contradicted yourself, right? I mistook which of Shallan or Jasnah has the ones called Cryptics, but you just said he never talked about "talking to them," which I never said he did, and implied that he ONLY talked about "people" following him. So you were wrong, as you're admitting now, and he did NOT just talk about people following him.

            >He says this to a room full of people who do not know anything about spren (except Kaladin, who only knows the one honorspren - which is completely irrelevant), and who all know that he is a paranoid little shitbag. It would be insane for anyone to call him out on it.

            It would be insane for anyone to call him on it THEN. Not LATER when they all know what spren are, 2 of them know what cryptics look like, and all of them have talked about these things together, as a group. You are not reading my criticisms carefully.

            >Not gonna do your work for you.

            You're literally attacking a criticism that doesn't show up in my post. I don't know what else to tell you other than to read what I actually said: I can't defend a point I didn't make.

              So, you say that this is a super common thing that happens throughout the books repeatedly. I say that the only example you could give happens at the very end of an unfinished series, and that it gets a pass until we learn more. You then say "Don't forget about that one time it happened at the very end of the unfinished series!" Your lack of ability to point to any example other than that one is good enough for me.

              >You misread me, and the book, again. Please read more carefully: he DID manage to do this during training in book 1. How long has it been since you read the books?

              You see him practicing, in a controlled environment, a very concentration-intensive and canonically difficult skill with a single half-success. I don't know whether you've ever trained any martial skills in reality (I hate to pull the veteran card here, but it actually is relevant), but c'mon. This is silly. Even if the quirks of training martial skills weren't specifically highlighted in that very chapter, this would be a reach.

              >Sorry, you know you just contradicted yourself, right? I mistook which of Shallan or Jasnah has the ones called Cryptics, but you just said he never talked about "talking to them," which I never said he did, and implied that he ONLY talked about "people" following him. So you were wrong, as you're admitting now, and he did NOT just talk about people following him.

              So cannot at all see a reason why an unhinged person who organized his own assassination attempt might say those words - *other* than that he is being followed by *unheard of* creatures from beyond your dimension.

              >It would be insane for anyone to call him on it THEN. Not LATER when they all know what spren are, 2 of them know what cryptics look like, and all of them have talked about these things together, as a group. You are not reading my criticisms carefully.

              "Hey, Elhokar! Remember that time you got kinda crazy and talked about assassins in mirrors and shit? Well, none of us have actually met full Cryptics yet (we've only seen Pattern, at best), but I just want to make sure that you weren't seeing spren. In fact, the first time anyone other than Shallan or Jasnah will see cryptics in full will be >!right after you die!<. So... yeah. I guess I should have talked to Jasnah about the actual word-for-word specifics of a single line of Elhokar's ravings from 6 months ago."

              Seriously, I think we're done here. You seem like the kind of person that absolutely requires getting in the last word - so go for it. You're getting a bit foolish in your arguments.

      I don't want to walk into the rest of this shitstorm, as I haven't read any sanderson, but I just want to say that criticizing him for not following his own rules and cheating while simultaneously propping up hpmor seems ideologically inconsistent

          criticizing sanderson for not following his own rules is bad because hpmor does literally the same thing
