## Rational Yugioh Gx idea. Thoughts? [RT][D][Q]

### Post:

Greetings! I am Sailor Vulcan, champion of justice and reason. And yes, I know my uniform is highly visually displeasing to most intelligent life forms. Deal with it. This is my first reddit post.

Below is an idea I had for a rational Yugioh Gx fanfic. I have little confidence that I can stick to writing an entire novel by myself because of real life, my rather short attention span and the vast number of novel ideas I've had to scrap over the years because I ran out of steam and lost my interest and/or motivation. So if there's anyone out there who's willing to coauthor this with me or write it themselves, I'd really REALLY appreciate it. I think this is too good a concept to let it die:

*Meet Jaden Yukiâ€”a creative and fun-loving comic book freak and chemistry geek. He loves playing Duel Monsters. It's one of his favorite games. ONLY ONE OF THEM. He'd love to play something else for a change. Unfortunately the high school he attends is Duel Academy, a prestigious private secondary school for Duel Monsters enthusiasts. Nearly everyone there is OBSESSED with the game. And Jaden is starting to wonder if maybe the Universe itself is too...*

What do you think?

  Your entire post could really have been summed up as 'Rationalfic of YGO GX, Jaden is the rational protagonist'.

  C'mon, give us a bit more of a conversation-starter than that. Where's the rest of the idea?

    Well, it at least *looks* like a comedic deconstruction based on the idea that the universe being obsessed with a children's card game is a bit of a WTF.

  I really like the Yugioh game. I've watched the original anime completely, and have recently begun watching GX from the beginning on Crunchyroll. So I don't know where the GX storyline goes after the first few episodes.

  I would not make Jaden lose his love of the game. Instead I would flesh out Bastian as someone who is incredibly intelligent and is planning to use his intellect to become the best duelist for money and for fame. Better, to become a great scientist. And good dueling stkills are important for anyone who wants to become anyone in any field. 

  In general, things to address:

  * Holodeck technology is invented and is only used to make duelling more spectacular-looking
  * 'Heart of the cards' is an actual thing. Jaden figured out as a kid that cards he likes are more likely to come up when he needs them. The probabilities don't work out as they should, unless he plays with somebody else's deck. Of course, he figures this out by playing thousands of games and keeping careful track of everything. Since then Jaden has done every psychological trick in the book to feel closer to his cards, like giving them names and acting out conversations.
  * Duelists don't show off by explainging their cards to each other. If they say anything, it's that they should have studied harder.
  * The side deck should be more important, and powerful duelists should have more than one deck depending on circumstances.
  * in the anime rare cards are a really big deal, but the whole world duels, so most people will have the same kind of non-rare cards.
  * in general, dueling is a really big deal. Law cases can be fought out with duels, most sports are hobbies compared to dueling, political battles are fought out with duels. It's a cultural thing, but also it's believed that the righteous win more duels than the wicked.
  * Jaden is on a quest to document every single card in existence, to share with everyone in an easily searchable online format (Pokedex). It annoys him that most of the information is locked away from non-academy students, and even then from everyone but full graduates. Basically, he wants to make the Yugioh wiki. The school's director on the other hand is a brilliant professor who believes that the information should indeed remain secret, because society structure would collapse if the lower class would so easily learn the strategies to defeat the upper class. Wars would break out. Better to keep the status quo. Except of course lower classes are kinda miserable, with all technology and advances going to duelling and making it look more fun.

  Probably the stakes should be a little higher and tie in a bit better with the actual anime, but these are my first thoughts on it.

  My suggestion: start writing it.  

  1. If you keep enjoying the idea, you will keep writing.  If you stop enjoying the idea, you wouldn't have wanted to read it anyway.
  1. You probably will not enjoy someone else's take on your idea better than your own.
  1. Having a co-author doesn't work if your concern is that you're going to lose interest and stop working on it.  If that's a concern then, when you quit, your co-author would quite likely get disheartened and quit themselves.
