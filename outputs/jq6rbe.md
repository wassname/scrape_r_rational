  I liked this chapter, felt like a lot of things happened and that isn't every chapter these days. If every chapter included this much content I think there would be a lot less complaints about Delve lately.

  Can I just say I'm glad we're really back into the adventure part of the story instead of the talking a bunch part? Now we just need Rain to get a blue and this will turn into a proper story again.

    You know what subreddit you're in, right? You're not likely to get rational fiction without significant talking parts.

      I don't think any good fics had a slow spot as long as Delve did. Even mega long fics like mother of learning or worth the candle have more action than this.

        And Delve’s slow spot was really awkward too. There was really no reason for it to be dragged out as long as it did, there were so many weeks where I thought the weekly chapter was completely unnecessary and extraneous. 

        Hell, there’s literally an entire month’s worth of chapters of Rain stuck in a literal hole in the ground doing diddly squat, which could’ve been entirely summarized in one chapter or shorter. 4+ chapters were spent on him being trapped in a hole in the ground.

        I’m glad we’ve moved past those arcs and have gone back to plot progression, although I will admit I still wish these chapters were faster. I wonder what the end of this lair will bring.

          People keep complaining about the 'stuck in a cave' arc, but I'm going to whole-heartedly defend it. i liked that arc. Yes, it was long and had no action, but it was a transformative time for rain, both for his in-story development, and narratively. If the arc had been short, or briefly summarized, it wouldn't have had as much impact. Instead, it gave Rain time for real introspection, and set up aspects of the longer narrative. 

          Delve is by nature a slow-grind web serial. The earlier chapters were similarly, it's just that no one was reading them when they came out, but instead binged them all in a go. The cave arc similarly would be a noticeable slow point if you were reading these chapters all at once, but would not come across as overly-long. If you want a fast-moving story, you should either not read serialized fiction, or stick to faster-moving serials. Delve, in my opinion, has been consistent between what the author promised and what was delivered.

            You say this as if Rain isn't navel-gazing most of the word-count away through action chapters, too. The balance in the early chapters was already skewed towards introspection, and were perfectly fine for it. But there was still stuff *other than* introspection going on.

          I agree, but on the other hand it's tricky to convey the experience of being stuck if it only takes a moment to read. Well, evocative prose can do it, and the obelisk sequence managed it quite well with less idling. Nesting two separate being stuck alone sequences back to back inside a being stuck in a dome arc was a bit much. If the author wanted to explore the theme of stuckness, it would have been more effective to have it present in different domains, say system, physical and mental, instead of having two physical stuckings nested. Twice in a row.

          Perhaps give Rain himself a bit more angst about being stuck in a dome. And also about being stuck mechanically. Tune it up to eleven in the pit, make everything he tries to escape fail, have the end of a single chapter be a deep downer, where he gives up (with soul rupture contributing). Then in the beginning of the next chapter have Dozer do an interesting thing and Rain be "Huh, interesting" and realize that in his original world all the progress people had was learning more about the world and improving their skills, not Skills, he shouldn't let a weird system arbitrate his sense of purpose. With this motivation, he could have the original digging and training montage, and finish the chapter with detecting the rescuers.

          Then the obelisk entrapment could be framed as him now refusing to get stuck. The way Rain just keeps going despite all the ridiculous hardship and seeming lack of options in the void is really impressive. The prose could celebrate that more, and framing it as him applying a lesson from the pit would achieve that nicely.

          Well, it's always easy to say stuff like this after the fact; that's why published books go through editing passes. Consistently producing a chapter a week is no joke.

            Wow, this sounds like it would be a lot better than what I've read.

          I really don't see how you can summarise all that occurred in the cave in one chapter. Definitely not less than one chapter.
          ```

            ```
            Yeah I agree. But two could have done it. And I think fewer chapters could have been spent in the dome overall.
            ```

        It's been less than twenty chapters since the rank shift though?

          It felt to me like it moved away from being an adventure story as soon as he got back to the city after the first lair. It's not nearly as exciting when events are happening to the main character and he's reacting as when he gets to make decisions and decide where to go himself. That's what got me into the story in the first place, the feeling that he's in this new world and he gets to go out and explore, not get caught up in the politics of people a hundred times as powerful as him.

          - u/EsquilaxM:
            ```
            I don't think it was ever that story. A low level guy simply doesn't have that much freedom on his own. And someone who has no idea how the world works with regards to magic, politics, customs etc. isn't going to be able to be decisive either.
            ```

            - u/Watchful1:
              ```
              It's a fantasy story? It can be whatever the author wants it to be.
              ```

              - u/EsquilaxM:
                ```
                Right but you seem to think the author wanted it to be a story that you wanted it to be, rather than what he wanted it to be. Unless my take of what he wanted it to be is wrong and he wanted it to be the same type of story you want it to be.

                Rain seemingly not being able to go explore the world so early on to me indicates a much more rational take on isekai into a world like delve.
                ```

                - u/Watchful1:
                  ```
                  I don't understand your point. Criticizing a story isn't allowed since this is just how the author wanted it to be?

                  A story can be both rational and exciting. Having a slow pace doesn't somehow make it more rational.
                  ```
