  Haha, his infatuation is showing!

    So is hers.  And other hers.

      Dizzy, Winnun Roke, Simole. 

      Guess the Tutt Effect also turns you into the attention target of cold heartless girls...

      That's really cute. I like how possessive Dizzy is and "threatened" by Simole.

  I really hope the smell is foreshadowing of Roke.

      Yes, I think so. But I'm really hoping it's Roke pulling a long term game with his perceptions for her own victory. Like the demon did last book, just much more subtlety and time involved.

  Boy oh boy, dizzy is starting to spoil book 2 for me already. Sheâ€™s such an unpleasant character.

      I'm very aware of what she's trying to do. She didn't need to explain anything as it is - this is something she more or less talked about in the last quarter of the last book. Either way, I don't think there's anything hidden behind her words or motivations in this case. She flat out stated that it should have been her in the last book as well.

      It's nothing recent, on my part. I've always hated her character AND Nic's general interactions with and feelings for her. I'd have to admit he's also a part of why all her scenes have become so taxing. Inevitably, something to endure and plod through. Part of the problem I have is that I feel like I'm reading the exact same scene every time the two characters interact. 

      The other part is that the longer his feelings continue, the more bizarre and jarring they become to me, as a reader. At first it was hopeful, then it was sad. Eventually, it became weird and disgusting, especially considering all the events that have occured in the middle of this. 

      He's not particularly old, I don't believe his infatuation (or is it limerence?) should have lasted anywhere this long. It's very clearly not love (I don't even think romantic love should be possible given his age at the time of meeting and his subsequent history with the girl in question). I don't know what the author intended to add to the story with all of this, but I think it ran its course a long time ago and it has only detracted from it since, as far as I'm concerned.

      EDIT: I should probably mention I have a small issue with how she behaves in general as well, given what we've seen with her and the rest of the people around her. She has never not come across as some sort of vengeful bully who operates on fear. The incident with the sausage in this chapter is indicative of that, and it's just one of many instances. So yes, while the MC's interactions with her contribute significantly to the unpleasantness, she's still just sort of odious all on her own.

        His infatuation is magically derived, no?

        I thought a demon overwrite him across years so that Dizzy is the absolute most attractive to him that any woman could possibly be. It's just that by the nature of this story, I'm not sure if that interpretation of the plot point is correct or not, nor if it's dropped now to be picked up later or just never touched on again.
        ```

        - u/thunder_cranium:
          ```
          I can't speak to this as there was a LOT of really abstract stuff that was kind of incomprehensible to me towards the end of the first book. I want to say that sounds familiar but that also might be me mixing it up with the MC from Worth The Candle. 

          Off the top of my head I can't remember how a demon would be mixed up in his early life, but you either remember better than I do, or you covered this more recently than I did. It's honestly been a very long time.

          Can you go into the reason behind this? What was the point of causing this infatuation with her?

    Yes. It's meant to evoke the kind of mock outrage friends display when they're actually amused by the insults thrown their way.
