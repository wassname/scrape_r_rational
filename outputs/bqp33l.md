  >But the magnitude of the mistake that Card makes in deciding that Mormonism is likely true because he can’t imagine that someone could write the Book of Mormon, structurally and stylistically and in richness of content, as a hoax… is so irrational I would call it hostile to rationality. 

  The hilarious part to me is that he does this in several of his works, most recently (that I've read) in the Pathfinder trilogy where the world is *literally artificiality constructed and guided.* And the goal of the main characters is to find the truth, break out, and be free. I'd almost call it a 'cry for help' a la "closeted gays are the staunchest anti-gays" if I believed that sort of thing. It certainly is frustrating the mental roadblocks people can have.

  Question: what rhetorical effect do you think it would have on your essay if you timestamped your OSC quotes?  For example:

  >**In 1990**, Card also said that gay sex is sinful and that not just gay marriage but sex should remain illegal

  This doesn't strike me as all that weird.  Go back to 1990 and poll people; you'll find that a supermajority of Americans believed the same thing.  It's hard to find a politician (democrat or republican) who *wasn't* anti-gay marriage in 1990.  I guess the most radical part of this statement is that he said "I think the laws that are currently in effect should remain in effect, status quo = good"?

  You did timestamp one of his remarks as being "as recently as 2008":

  >as recently as 2008 after judges began ruling gay marriage bans unconstitutional

  As an alternative to talking about what some judges were doing at the time, here's another way you could contextualized 2008:

  >back in 2008, **when California (the most liberal state in the union by most measures, perhaps tied with New York) passed a ballot proposition by popular vote defining marriage as being between a man and a woman**

  Following 2008, we also had 5 years of presidency under an Obama that did not openly support gay marriage.  So in this case, Card was indeed guilty of harboring anti-gay sentiment at around the same time that California voters affirmed "no gay marriage" and democrats nominated a presidential candidate who didn't openly support gay marriage (and then 4 years later we elected him again).

  >He has pushed the frame that homosexuality is more environmental than genetic

  My recollection is that this wasn't a rare view within the scientific community in the 00's, and this wasn't even strictly speaking a partisan thing; there were plenty of gay advocates (and gay individuals) who in the past ascribed to the belief in environmental factors over genetic.  The position I recall being the standard when I was in university at the time was, "It may be genetic, it may be environmental; to me the question is largely academic and irrelevant to the question of whether or not gay people deserve civil rights."

  >I do not use that word lightly: it is one thing to say that you disagree with gay marriage, it is another to publicly state your position, and then it is yet another entirely to go to the lengths Card has gone to crusade against it. 

  Do you think that Card has done more or less to harm gay people than, say, the democrats who controlled congress when Don't Ask Don't Tell passed under president Clinton?

  I feel like the main thing that separates Orson Scott Card from these sorts of people (pick a Clinton or a democratic congressman) is that they all shifted views by 2013, whereas Orson Scott Card still believes the same things today that he (and essentially everyone within mainstream discourse) believed back in the 00's.  And as I stated at the top of this post, I'm pretty sure that this is because the Mormon church has yet to update their beliefs.

  The impression I have of most Mormons (of which you will find many other within science fiction and fantasy, see Brandon Sanderson and Stephanie Meyer for prominent examples) is that most of them are on board with what the church believes, and right now, that means believing that marriage is between a man and a woman (and if you're someone like Brandon Sanderson or Stephenie Meyer, doing everything you can to avoid talking about it in public). These people's stance "I am Mormon, and my position on gay marriage matches that of the Mormon church" would remain if the church's view changed tomorrow (which is to say, they would all be okay with gay marriage if the church was.

  I'm sure you can mount a defense of democrat politicians not supporting gay marriage publicly because it was the politically expedient thing to do, even if these politicians did go as far as saying, for example, "Marriage has historic, religious and moral content that goes back to the beginning of time, and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been, between a man and a woman."  Maybe when Hillary Clinton said those words, she secretly believed in her heart believed that gay marriage was okay, and then she publicly changed her stance in 2013 after it was clear that supporting gay marriage wouldn't damage her politically, so really she was actually pro-gay all along, and it was okay for her to pretend to be anti-gay marriage because that's what it took to get elected.

  To me, this idea of politicians who change views when the pollsters them gay marriage is okay seem analogous to the idea of a religious person who suddenly changes stance when the church tells them it's okay.  I'm curious as to how you think "I said what I had to in order to get elected" ethically compares to "I said what I had to in order to be on board with the slate of beliefs that is supposed to get me into heaven."

  Two possibilities:

  * Card agrees with whatever the church's position is, and would support gay marriage if the church did.  But right now, church says gay = sin, so Card believes gay = sin because that is part of the slate of beliefs he has signed up for.
  * Card is anti-gay marriage, and if the church changed its mind, he would go against the church and continue to advocate against gay marriage.  Under this model, his religious objections are merely a convenient cover for his more deeply-held belief that gay = bad; if the church changed its views, he would be exposed as not really being a true Mormon.

  You seem to argue for the latter...while also claiming that Card's problem is that he considers Mormonism important above all else (including an honest pursuit of the truth)?  I am deeply confused by this.  Is Card's main loyalty to Mormonism, or hating gay marriage?

    Was gay *sex* illegal in the US in 1990? Outside of the occasional state with some old ass, no-one-ever-bothered-abolishing-it anti-sodomy law?

      [Lawrence v Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas) would hardly have reached the supreme court in 2003 if sodomy laws were not being enforced. For that particular case, the arrest and original conviction came in 1998.

      So yes, it was illegal, and was being prosecuted back then. To what extent, I'm not prepared to say, but even if it was limited, the fact that it was prosecuted at all has a pretty clear chilling effect.

    My impression from at least Brandon Sanderson is that, yes, he stands by the church's view of homosexuality, but he is a lot more nuanced about it than Card is. Compare [this](https://brandonsanderson.com/euology-dumbledores-homosexuality/) to some of the stuff Card wrote. 

    Note that this is from 2007 (with a preface/disclaimer added in 2011), so 2 to 5 years before the moment you're saying the majority started shifting views in America. As you mentioned he has since stopped talking about it in public (wisely, I think), so we don't really know how much his view has shifted over the last 8 years.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I really don't see his view as that different than Card's pre-disclaimer.  His rhetoric is different, but the end result is the same.  Some people are mostly attracted to the same sex.  Get married and have kids anyways.  Or live a sexless life.  Post-disclaimer I think that he finds a way to avoid supporting discrimination while not changing his moral argument, which consequentially makes it a far more moral argument than Card's.

        Rhetoric is underestimated in importance to judging character, imo. I have very little reason to believe Sanderson is bigoted after reading that, even if I still think he's wrong on a number of levels.

        Oh, he is definitely still on the opposite side of the discussion, but he is a lot more friendly and reasonable about it and genuinely seems to want to think about why the people on the other side of the discussion (ie. us) believe the things they do. That's not the vibe I get from Card. 

        Maybe I've been reading to much SSC recently, but I feel like having kind and reasonable people that disagree with you, but make a good faith effort to understand your position (and de-escalate their own side a bit) anyway is just about the most valuable thing you can ask for in any discussion. 

        I think posts like the one Sanderson wrote have convinced more people that it's ok that JK Rowling made Dumbledore gay than a million angry twitter posts possibly could have.

    >  Card was indeed guilty of harboring anti-gay sentiment at around the same time that California voters affirmed "no gay marriage"

    Given the fact that support for Prop 8 was [very controversially funded by the Mormon church in Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_California_Proposition_8#Controversies_about_campaign_financing_and_donations), I don't think that's a particularly good point about Californian voters.

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    You raise a good point about the year stamps, and I linked to each article so that people can follow the timeline themselves, but when someone continues to hold a belief into the present day I don't think it's all that important, to be honest. If OSC came out for gay marriage and I wrote a piece saying he's not a REAL ally to gay people because he said X and Y and Z and I didn't include how long ago that was, I think that would be misleading. But since he still basically believes all that, I don't really care when he thought it unless he's written about how he has meaningfully changed his mind since. If you have any examples of that, please do share it.

    But "he was anti-gay marriage at a time most people were" doesn't really excuse it, to me, because I hold him to a higher standard. To be frank, most people are pretty dumb, politicians included. OSC demonstrated that he could think. His valuing his faith over his reason feels like a moral failing in a way that \[insert Democratic Politician\] not being particularly more intelligent than their constituents, or pretending not to be, doesn't.  

    >Do you think that Card has done more or less to harm gay people than, say, the democrats who controlled congress when Don't Ask Don't Tell passed under president Clinton?

    DADT was a compromise between those who wanted to allow openly gay members to serve and those who wanted to find and remove gays from the military, iirc. Are you referring to the democrats who voted against Clinton? Obviously they did more than OSC, but I don't know if that's about power or intention. You just made me realize I didn't read a single thing about his views of gays in the military, and I just searched specifically for it and couldn't find anything. Maybe I'm just being optimistic, but I actually wouldn't be surprised if he was okay with it.

    >You seem to argue for the latter...while also claiming that Card's problem is that he considers Mormonism important above all else (including an honest pursuit of the truth)? I am deeply confused by this. Is Card's main loyalty to Mormonism, or hating gay marriage?

    If Card's concept of Mormonism is shaped by his personal views and faith rather than what the church ultimately decides Mormonism is, that would resolve the confusion I think. I don't know for sure if that would be his reaction to it obviously, and it's a large reason why I wish he'd written something about black Mormons before or after the policies changed. 

    Ultimately I think his faith is meaningful, but just blaming his faith isn't enough simply because there are people who are raised Mormon who either leave the church or stay and accept homosexuality. It's an explanation, not an excuse.

      It's hard to really actually run a fair hypothetical on "what if the Mormon church changed its views, tho" because in that case there would be significant *justification* for saying "all right, the leaders of this church are themselves abandoning principle; these views are timeless and eternal and were never open to debate; this is no longer true Mormonism."  And that justification would not necessarily have *anything whatsoever* to do with a secret deep-seated bigotry (though a secret deep-seated bigotry would certainly be *sufficient,* it's also far from *necessary).*

      To put it another way, this is the inconvenient side of the AI/agent foundations concept that values work to sustain themselves, and Gandhi wouldn't willingly take a pill to remove his revulsion around violence because then he might be more likely to be violent, and he finds that repulsive.

        > It's hard to really actually run a fair hypothetical on "what if the Mormon church changed its views

        This is kind of a funny statement as there are quite a few historic examples of major view changes. E.g., polygamy, black people being allowed into heavy, etc. Most recently they enacted a policy of not allowing children of gay parents to be baptized a few years ago and then reversed it this year.

        My anecdotal observation is that most people defended the prior bad position but then switched views with the church and were happy when the church got rid of bad positions (esp. black people and baptizing children of gay people)
        ```

        - u/ketura:
          ```
          It is different within the framework of Mormonism, tho. Even when blacks were disallowed the priesthood (~lay clergy) there was a corpus of doctrine that stated this was a temporary measure--from the perspective of eternity, I suppose. It was supposed to be in force so long as the world existed, and then be lifted in the afterlife (so much for that), so merely "moving the timeline" on that is at least doctrinally *compatible*, if obviously not socially until the time it happened. How much of this is a post-hoc cover up is left as an exercise to the reader. 

          On the other hand I'm not sure what Watsonian justification would be used to permit for homosexual marriages, since so much of the lore insists that marriage and having children is something that continues into the afterlife and thus requires both sexes. It seems to me this is something the church will stand on, as they don't (doctrinally) have any other choice.

            I am not super knowledgable about Mormonism, but don't they support a husband having multiple wives? In that case, there's a gender imbalance, and that could be fixed by having celibate (or gay men) attached to such a family.
            I think there are definitely possibilities of a doctrine where gay relationship is allowed and fertility is an important virtue.
            ```

        This is also true. I think, though, that if someone's sticking point for "This is no longer True Mormonism" is changes in gay marriage, but not equality for black people, it's a pretty safe bet for homophobia.  


        Not absolutely, of course; they might just think the reasoning in one hand is sufficient while the other isn't, or felt the latter was a step too far and would have acted the same if the order of them was reversed, or if some other major belief was changed.   


        We can't know what's in other people's hearts. But after a certain point we do have to say we have "enough" justification to at least tentatively believe in one explanation, while holding ourselves open to other explanations that might gather evidence.

          There's a lot more historical precedent for "sexuality is regulated by God/society" than color-based racism though.  Maybe not in Mormonism, which was racist from the get-go, but even the earliest Mormons still came from a Judeo/Christian social background.

          The whole "black people can't be priests because they were cowardly souls in the spirit realm" stuff was invented and then disavowed in a 150 year span.  Religious and societal regulation of sexuality, including forbidding homosexuality, has been around a really long time.

          Not that it would make SENSE to trust in the Mormon church on one but not the other, because it wouldn't, either the current President is a real prophet or not, that's pretty foundation to the religion.  I'm just saying the two issues aren't exactly equivalent.

  Is it so hard to believe that bigots can write good literature? 

  Ender's Game is brilliant, but it did not surprise me at all when Card turned out to be a bigot. His beliefs about traditional gender rules are pretty evident in his work, including in Ender's game. Look at Valentine. Look at Petra, very clearly painted as an exception. I can't remember the exact quote but the text even explicitly makes statements to the effect of even though battle school is co ed in practice girls just don't make it into the program, can't fight millions of years of evolution. If your eyes are open to it you can see the sexism right there on the page. 

  If you were surprised when Scott turned out to be this way, it only means that at whatever age you read Ender's game the things he wrote did not stand out as objectionable to you yet (this is pretty understandable). For those who are still surprised, i recommend re-reading the stories, with an adult, modern eye.

  Same with CS Lewis, who is mentioned here, his work is explicitly religious obviously but it's easy to see racism in the depiction of the Calormen if you're open to seeing it. There was an entire passage on washing off  blackface that they used to disguise themselves and being "white Narnians" again.

  Edit: I have located the exact quote

  >"A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution
  are working against them. None of them will be like Valentine, anyway. But there'll be
  brothers there, Ender."

  This, in no way undermines that he wrote an amazing story. It's possible to be both sexist and a good writer. It's possible that *work you like* contains sexism and racism or was written by someone like that. To be...not just surprised, but shocked...I get it, I don't mean to deny the feeling of betrayal 

  (I guess I'm a bit bitter about people who feel betrayed only *now* as adults, because *I* was betrayed right then, as a child, reading those words on the page *stung* right then and there, to realize that the evil calormen were meant to depict *my people*, the people who were to weak for battle school were *women*, and I'm not a woman but... it still jumped out, in part because I wasn't necessarily mature enough to dismiss it as just bigotry, part of me was worried it might in fact be the *horrible truth* of the matter)

  ...but it says more about our denial about how pervasive racism and sexism are, as if they are the property of some dark corner of our culture rather than *the overwhelming default*. I think it's safe to say *the majority* of the work one personally enjoys and draws inspiration from contains some problematic stuff, because the majority of work in general contains it.

    > Is it so hard to believe that bigots can write good literature?

    Writing good literature is one thing, I think the amazing thing is reading someone espousing principles that if they *minimally applied to their own beliefs would send their whole world upside down*. The cognitive dissonance and irony can reach amazing levels (and I say this having read only Ender's Game, and yes, you could definitely see *some* of his weird beliefs in it, e.g. the paranoia towards a tyrannical state that limits the number of children people can have).

      I agree with your comment but disagree with this example:

      > e.g. the paranoia towards a tyrannical state that limits the number of children people can have

      There was nothing that really framed the government as bad or evil in the book. It was just a feature of the futuristic society he was writing. If you had no idea what his politics were, I would be highly skeptical that you could pick that out as an actual paranoia of the writer's.

    Yeah I don't really get this obsession with the internal reality of awful people. 

    Does it really matter if OSC's internal reality is that of a bigot, or if he's just a p-zombie who acts like a bigot? Does it change anything?

    There was a similar theme in the documentary about Theranos. It spends a lot of its runtime obsessing over whether or not Elizabeth Holmes knew that she was lying. Is that really something that's worthwhile to examine?

      I think it does, actually, but like I said in the OP, I get that from the perspective of those being punched or those only concerned with stopping people from being punched, it might look academic.

      To me though, understanding the root of something is intrinsic to being able to prevent or stop it. Kind of a big part of being a therapist; if you can't differentiate between different kinds of internals states that result in harmful behavior, you're not really going to be able to find the best responses.

        Yep. Too much credit, maybe, but unless it's a theme of the story I tend to think that characters like that are just expressing their own views.  


        Another example of this was the gay man in the Shadow series that was sad because he really wanted a family and ended up just gritting his teeth and having sex with women. I thought it was just a comment about how often gay people try their best to live hetero-normative lives and be happy in worlds that are often hostile to them, but now I think back on it with much more jaded perspective, despite technically it still being able to be read that way.

          I must've read that story 15 years ago and the quote still sticks with me. he certainly had something to say to closeted midwestern teenagers

        That's how I'd read that passage, personally. Card actually does have strong female characters in most of his books. Never as the main protagonist, I don't think, but it's not unusual for authors to prefer writing their gender as the MC. I never felt like women were underrepresented. But then, I'm also not a girl.

  A good read, though your take on his statements is far more benevolent than mine. Just because someone claims they want others to be kinder and more compassionate to their adversaries, doesn't mean they actually care. This bit in particular I found extremely chilling:

  >“How long before married people answer the dictators thus: Regardless of law, marriage has only one definition, and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy. I will act to destroy that government and bring it down, so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage, and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn.”

  That's extreme, it's a call to arms that is very carefully worded to give the author plausible deniability. 'I didn't say people should destroy the government! I just asked how long till they would!'

  To me, that level of vitriol makes his calls for compassion and kindness a lie.

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

    > To me, that level of vitriol makes his calls for compassion and kindness a lie.

    To be fair, a lot of people are happy claiming that if the government should become tyrannical, a violent uprising would be the only proportionate response, if a painful one. I mean, the USA's *foundation myth* is rooted exactly in that, right? The British being too oppressive and the brave, freedom-loving colonists (who owned slaves and wanted to keep them, but never mind) rising up against such indignity. Where things start getting blurred is where does everyone draw that line of 'tyranny'. For some it's banning abortion. For some it's banning gun ownership. And for some it's gonna be allowing gay marriage, however nonsensical and completely removed from reality that is.

    I mean from my perspective, if OSC sufficiently empathized with gay people he would rebel against God, so it's kind of obvious that his empathy for them is really limited, regardless of what he says.

        I'll try to find one, but he often uses the "I'm just an economist asking tough questions in an academic context!" as a defense against accusations that the questions he happens to ask often insinuate or imply trivially false or harmful things.

        Like he once asked, I think on twitter, "what are the odds that someone just decided to report a real rape now, if it wasn't politically motivated?" for the Kavanaugh thing.  Once he got blowback he was like "I'm just asking questions!"

          I don't see the fundamental difference, just a difference in the complexity and size of the belief system one has been raised in. Mormonism *entails* racist beliefs, but also a lot of other things. Which are in fact significantly *crazier*, so if anything, they could warn you to the extreme frailty of the whole edifice (or wreck you with cognitive dissonance so thoroughly your brain becomes utterly incapable of rational thought by adulthood, I guess).

  Thanks for posting, was an interesting read. I've thought about this before in the past as well, Orson Scott Card is an amazing author and the extended Enders Game series is one of my favorite series of all time, but some of thing things he says at times outside of his books seem unnecessarily fanatical.

  It's complicated because for me Orson Scott Card is in a weird limbo where he's not quite hurtful enough with the things he says to fit neatly in the category of hateful bigot but also not quite innocent enough to perceive him as a merely misguided but otherwise pious and loving man. Most people I know about seem to lean more heavily towards these extremes but Card seems to have found some sort of awkward middle ground. At the end of the day I've had to accept that while I believe his ideas are harmful, I've ever read from him can reasonably be construed as hate speech so he has as much right as anyone else to free speech. And as you say, you can always appreciate his books independently from the flaws of the author.
  ```

- u/doremitard:
  ```
  The key to understanding Orson Scott Card is that he’s a self-hating gay man with a tendency towards ephebophilia.

  Watch video of him talking and he doesn’t come across as straight... which isn’t definitive, some straight men do have a camp affect, but still.

  Now read the plot summary of his book Songmaster: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songmaster

  It’s about a sexy young boy who is given drugs to delay his puberty and preserve his beautiful voice (a kind of castrato that in the world of the book is called a Songbird). He gets lots of sexual attention from older men, including a guard who is punished for groping him.

  Here’s how the book ends:

  >	Ansset eventually offers himself to the young man, saying, "I know what you want, and I'm willing". Josif lovingly brings the boy to his first climax. As Ansset experiences his first ever orgasm, he experiences enormous pain. The Songhouse drugs have almost killed him and he is forever impotent.

  Orson Scott Card is always writing about pubescent boys, lots of naked wrestling in Ender’s Game. He even makes up a sci-fi reason why the boy in Songbird stays pubescent but is technically over age.

  Songbird is full of homoeroticism, but anyone who actually does any kind of gay stuff gets punished. Notice also how the enemy aliens in Ender’s Game are called “Buggers”. 

  It’s pretty clear that he’s sublimating his own desires in his writing. He wants nothing more than to lovingly bring a young twink to climax, but that’s so sinful for him to admit that, even when exploring his desires in fiction, he has to invent a contrived pretext where cumming from gay sex would cause terrible pain and suffering - which of course makes no sense; why would a drug that delays puberty make it hurt to have an orgasm?

  No straight man would write a book like this, about the temptations of gay sex, because straight men aren’t tempted to have gay sex. Only closeted gay men who have been forced to spend their entire life denying to themselves that they’re gay.

  I feel sorry for OSC. If he hadn’t been born into such a conservative environment, he’d probably be a happy daddy bear with a husband half his age. Instead, he’s had to force himself to father 5 children. The reason he’s so against gay marriage and the idea that gay people are born that way is that he’s spent his whole life fighting his own desires. If being gay is OK, if gay marriage is allowed, then it means all his battles mean nothing; he could have had companionship and intimacy with someone who he was actually attracted to, and his honeymoon wouldn’t have been a grim charade of trying to hide his distaste for vagina.

    Haven't read Songmaster, but I'll chime in that some parts of _A Planet Called Treason_ are at least 763 milliVanyels worth of gaaaaaay.  I'm pretty sure the male protagonist has sex with a man at one point, in a euphemistic 1970s way, and this is depicted entirely sympathetically.  Which doesn't make the author gay, but seems hard to square with antigay.  If there aren't antigay statements dating to around the same authorial era, we should probably consider there as being at least two distinct Cards worth analyzing.
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Card's "antigay" position is *exactly the same* as his "anti-premarital-sex" position is *exactly the same* as his "anti-adultery" position.  If you read Characters and Viewpoint, he explicitly discusses the gay characters and how easy it was to port over empathy and understanding of Romance Type A into empathy and understanding of Romance Type B; I think it's extremely easy to see how someone could convincingly write entirely sympathetic characters engaging in all sorts of "sins" once they've decided to view "sinners" in general with sympathy.

      I think positing latent homosexuality from Card's work is plausible, i.e. there's nothing to *disprove* it, but not at all required, i.e. I think those works are just-as-strong-or-stronger evidence for general writing skill than for the specific hypothesis of secretly gay.

      Or, as we say with tired voices, "authors are not their characters."
      ```

    - u/doremitard:
      ```
      My model is that it’s the same closeted gay Card the whole time, but he could accept his situation when gays were marginalised by society. See [this 1990 essay](http://www.nauvoo.com/library/card-hypocrites.html) where he’s arguing for a position of relative tolerance, but draws the line here: 

      >	The only people I have contempt for are those who try to remain inside Mormonism while denying the validity of guidance from the prophets, and I oppose them, not because they live as homosexuals, but because of the hypocrisy of claiming to be Mormon while denying the only reason for the Mormon community to exist. If they prevailed, it would destroy our community.

      As society gets more and more tolerant of being gay, the risk that the Mormon Church will rule that being gay is acceptable increases, which would mean that he’s denied himself decades of boi pussy for nothing. So he becomes more and more stridently anti-gay.

  >his attitude has repeatedly been one I would characterize as self-righteous bitterness, in much the same way a lot of modern “Intellectual Dark Web” members talk about the “Intolerant Left.” Example: “Faggot” and “Homophobe” are “exactly analogous,” according to Card, and thus anyone who decries one and uses the other is apparently a hypocrite. This by the way is from an article that’s probably Card’s [most liberal explanation of his views.](http://www.nauvoo.com/library/card-hypocrites.html) Again, context does not help)

  Context does help, actually:

  > > The only thing I would quarrel with .. is the use of two words: abomination and homophobia. Both are relatively meaningless these days, and are most often used to express loathing; therefore, while the loathing may be sincere, the words become less than helpful in serious discussion. .. Likewise, there are people who show a virulence in their hatred of homosexuals that is obsessive, personal, and pathological, and I suppose homophobia could be regarded as the technical word for that. The overwhelming majority of the cases where I've seen homophobia used, however, it was used not to describe the pathological condition, but rather as an ugly word to fling at anyone who does not go along with the political agenda or self-story of various activist wings of the American homosexual community. If you don't accept the full politically-correct line .. then you are a homophobe in the view of these people. Frankly, I find that this quickly turns into a delicious hypocrisy: Those whose agenda is "tolerance" and who insist that ugly words like faggot not be used against them have found an exactly analogous word to use as a weapon in their virulent intolerance of those who disapprove of either their behavior or their political agenda.

  >> They use the word to silence opposition, to subvert legitimate discussion. Those who use the word this way are so convinced of the righteousness of their cause that they are willing to deny the right of others to disagree with them. Thus, in the name of tolerance of diversity, they seek to force others into a perfect uniformity of thought. The fascism of the left is no more attractive than the fascism of the right. 

  Also, he’s not saying that “‘Faggot’ and ‘Homophobe’ are ‘exactly analogous,’”, he was saying that “Those whose agenda is "tolerance" and who insist that ugly words like faggot not be used against them have found an exactly analogous word to use as a weapon in their virulent intolerance of those who disapprove of either their behavior or their political agenda.” So you’ve grandly misinterpreted his statement from the original article, leaving out vital context, and preemptively informing the readers that the left out context wasn’t vital.

  >and thus anyone who decries one and uses the other is apparently a hypocrite

  That’s not what he was saying in his article either.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    You said he didn't call them analogous and then quoted him doing so. Can you explain specifically how I misrepresented what he said?
    ```

    - u/NewDarkAgesAhead:
      ```
      Sure. I was criticising not the “analogous” in your interpretation, but the “exactly”. Compare: 1) “A and B are exactly the same.” 2) “In some cases, A and B are exactly the same.” The first implies that the two "functions" “match” (or correspond to each other) all the time, while the second only implies that they match only in some of their sections. So there’s a significant difference in Card’s statement compared to your interpretation of it. 

      Card was saying that “faggot” and “homophobe” are analogous when those who use them are so convinced of the righteousness of their cause that they are willing to deny the right of others to disagree with them. That they use these words: 

      * as ad hominem attacks without any real meaning behind them; 
      * not as valid arguments in a serious discussion, but as a weapon to derogate the opponent when they don’t go along with the user’s political agenda;
      * to silence opposition, to subvert legitimate discussion; 
      * to force others into a perfect uniformity of thought.

      So when these conditions are met, the sets of usage for these two words intersect, making their usage analogous to each other. The “homophobe’s” set still has areas outside of this intersection, which Card either doesn’t address at all or hesitantly accepts to be an accurate usage for the term “homophobe” (Ctrl+F to "Likewise).

      What your interpretation of Card is saying, on the other hand, is that “faggot” and “homophobe” are exactly analogous, and that’s pretty much it. 

      Your interpretation of Card trivialises Card as someone using the word homophobe in the abovementioned manner would be trivialising a target who is presenting complex arguments that the user of the word doesn’t want to understand or agree to.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Thanks for expanding; I thought it was obvious that I was not asserting that Card literally meant that both words meant the exact same thing, but rather that the two are equally derogatory words.

        I disagree that Card is drawing the line as distinctly as you are, though, and think you are reading more reasonableness into his position than exists. This part in particular;  

        >Likewise, there are people who show a virulence in their hatred of homosexuals that is obsessive, personal, and pathological, and I suppose homophobia could be regarded as the technical word for that. The overwhelming majority of the cases where I've seen homophobia used, however, it was used not to describe the pathological condition, but rather as an ugly word to fling at anyone who does not go along with the political agenda or self-story of various activist wings of the American homosexual community.  

        Is such a spineless and grudging admission of the existence (but not prevalence) of homophobia that honestly I find it a minor point of evidence toward him actually being homophobic.

        Imagine reading this:

        >Likewise, there are people who show a virulence in their hatred of **black people** that is obsessive, personal, and pathological, and I suppose **racist** could be regarded as the technical word for that.

        You "suppose," OSC? How good of you. Just the "technical word," of course, which brings to mind "technically, but not actually."

        Maybe I'm not being charitable, so I'll be extra clear about why I think he's wrong in this:

        Faggot is a derogatory slur that has no meaning other than to degrade a sexual orientation. Other than cigarettes or bundles of sticks, it has literally no other use.

        Homophobe is a label for a type of bigotry, no different than "racist" or "sexist." It has use as more than an insult; there is no other word to describe someone who yells "I'm going to kill you faggots!" at gay people.

        Card can disagree with the use of homophobe against him, and there are definitely those who use homophobe too loosely in the way he describes. But by calling the two analogous, even by specifying that he just means as a political weapon, he's showing his ignorance of the actual dynamics of what life for homosexual is like.

        People started calling people faggots because they hated that they were gay. Not because it reflects on anything they believe or said.

        People started calling people homophobes because those people hated/feared gay people. And yes, sometimes because they hate those people for hating/fearing gay people, or just appearing to.

        OSC is trying to equivocate the two because it serves him politically to do so. It protects himself, it protects his allies, it furthers his cause of disenfranchising homosexuals. It even resolves dissonance when people use the word to describe him to just dismiss them as trying to "shut down debate" or "censor disagreement."

        It's neither of those things: it's just the word that arose for people who argue against equal rights for gay people. If it shuts down a discussion he's been in, it's because that discussion was deemed unproductive and harmful by someone else, and if he disagrees with that, well, he's not really the one who gets to make that judgement.

        His attempt to equate them in any way is no different from any other attempt to discredit attacks on intolerance by equivocating it with intolerance. It's a semantic shellgame, and pretty empty of substance in most circumstances, I've found.
        ```

        - u/NewDarkAgesAhead:
          ```
          >I .. think you are reading more reasonableness into his position than exists.

          He elaborates enough on his position in the linked article for there to be no need of “reading more” into it.

          >Imagine reading this: “Likewise, there are people who show a virulence in their hatred of black people that is obsessive, personal, and pathological, and I suppose racist could be regarded as the technical word for that.” You "suppose," OSC? How good of you. Just the "technical word," of course, which brings to mind "technically, but not actually."

          I think by replacing homophobia with racism you are cutting out the very reason for the hesitant tone of his admission. As some context / examples, [here’s Wikipedia’s current take on the problems with the word “homophobia”,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia#Criticism_of_meaning_and_purpose) and here’s [Conservapedia’s,](https://www.conservapedia.com/Homophobia#Term_of_Insult_or_Manipulation) for the perspective. 

          >Faggot is a derogatory slur that has no meaning other than to degrade a sexual orientation. Other than cigarettes or bundles of sticks, it has literally no other use.

          That’s incorrect but beside the point. Whether or not it has other uses is irrelevant, because the analogy he’s talking about isn’t about the background of the used words and about the manner and purpose of their usage. And “faggot” as a derogatory word can and is often used for the purposes highlighted in my previous comment.

          >Homophobe is a label for a type of bigotry, no different than "racist" or "sexist." It has use as more than an insult; there is no other word to describe someone who yells "I'm going to kill you faggots!" at gay people.

          Which is again beside the point, since the genuine use of that word, one that isn’t an ad hominem with washed out meaning, was not what he was talking about when he was drawing the analogy. You are missing the point, but I’m not sure how to rephrase my previous comment to better convey what I’m trying to say. Perhaps someone else will manage to articulate the thought better.

          >If it shuts down a discussion he's been in, it's because that discussion was deemed unproductive and harmful by someone else, and if he disagrees with that, well, he's not really the one who gets to make that judgement.

          And now you’re making baseless assumptions and trying to strip him of his agency without addressing his arguments themselves.

            Let's go back to conflict theory vs mistake theory. I think Card is in Conflict Theory mode. I do not think he is seeking Truth, I do not think Truth on this topic concerns him: I think he has deep seated sacred beliefs (literally) that he is defending at all costs from those he believes will destroy something good and precious, and that attitude shifts his approach from one of clear sight to one of defensiveness and dismissiveness of anything that challenges his beliefs.

            Without going into specifics of what exactly those beliefs are yet, do you agree with that much?

He's *explicitly talking about how the word "homophobia" is commonly used,* and the "I suppose" is pointing straight at the motte-bailey.  He's saying "people will fall back on saying that homophobia is just a diagnostic, denotative term for anyone who hates gays, but in actual usage it's a label thrown onto anyone who disagrees with the political trend of increased civil liberties for people with gay lifestyles."

          I find your objection here disingenuous and maybe motivated.

            Let's read this again:

            >The overwhelming majority of the cases where I've seen homophobia used, however, it was used not to describe the pathological condition

            The *overwhelming majority*, OSC? In 1990? Get the fuck out of here.

            Look, I know the world probably looks very different to me and OSC in this regard. My experience of when people get called homophobe is that they said something homophobic. His is that HE or his friends/allies said something people thought was homophobic. I'm sure that makes him dislike the word and think it's just being tossed around as an insult.

            Hell, I got frustrated at the word "Islamophobic" for a similar reason when I was younger. It gets used a lot to describe someone who criticizes Islam, but doesn't hate Muslims, as if they just hated Muslims. 

            But I understood that the reason for that is there were a shit-ton-fuck more people who hated Muslims around than those that just criticized Islam, and they often say many of the same things. Recognizing that moderated my language.

            So yes, I find his language insufficient to denote a clear understanding of the world. If someone said something like that in person I would call them on that shit in a heartbeat. I find it mealymouthed and sly, a concession of the least possible kind that somewhere, out there, occasionally, there might be people who legitimately hate or are disgusted by gays, but that the MAJORITY of people called homophobic are mislabeled.

            Shit, I might even admit that was true today, in 2019. But 1990? Fuggeddaboudit.

                I'll check with some of my non-gay older friends and coworkers and report back, but also 1990 isn't the pre-mass-media age, and it's really easy to look into what the attitudes of the general public were like then.

                I'm actually a little confused by your skepticism of this claim. I've been keeping track, and something like 1/11 of my suicidal calls involve kids who are gay or trans where people's attitudes toward their sexual or gender identity is directly responsible for their depression, anxiety, etc. By NO accounts or narratives that I've ever encountered has this problem gotten worse, rather than better, over the last few decades. I'm curious what exactly you think the 70s and 80's were like for gay people? Shows like Will and Grace, which are often cited as turning points for common perception of gay people, didn't come out until 1998.

                (Random interesting tidbit, atheism is something like 1/17 the last time I checked my files. There's some overlap)

    >Also, he’s not saying that “‘Faggot’ and ‘Homophobe’ are ‘exactly analogous,’”, he was saying that “Those whose agenda is "tolerance" and who insist that ugly words like faggot not be used against them have found an exactly analogous word to use as a weapon in their virulent intolerance of those who disapprove of either their behavior or their political agenda.” 

    I refute this point on the ground that both kinds of intolerance are not equivalent. 

    Reasoning. comming from the premise that gender is something you are not something you choose, then intolerance against people on the base of gender is inescapable. To avoid it you either have to hide what you are, leave or die.

    Intolerance against homophobia instead is aimed at something people believe, not something they are. Being homophobe is also is mostly ok in the same vein that being a pedophile is ok, so long you dont act upon it. If you act upon your the homophobia you are acting on someone that cannot feasibly avoid the persecusion. To avoid being attacked for being an homophobe though? That is easy, all you need to do is avoid acting on the homophobia and the attacks should stop or atleast relent. There are others homophobes to persecute. 

    That is why both kinds of intolerance are not equivalent. One has an easy exit and the other doesnt. And the whole extra pressure of being persecuted for something you have very little control about is also very non equal. 

    Intolerance against those who are themselves intolerant seem to me as a moral imperative to defend those who cannot escape the persecution

  Like, OSC is straight up 'love the sinner, hate the sin', vs gay people, yeah?  This isn't like a complicated or nuanced viewpoint.  He would help a gay person he found on the side of the road...right over into the church for some corrective therapy.  Dude thinks gay sex is bad, because it costs you soul points, he'd like to help gay people conserve their soul points by doing less of it.

I think most of the people as outspoken about it as he is are actually bigots, hence why I think it's worth dissecting the ways he's similar or different from them.

      " (fun fact: Card studied archaeology before he gave it up for being “hard work”)"

      &#x200B;

      Full stop, what is this?  Like, why is dude being bad at archaeology going to help anyone learn anything from your post?  What's fun about this fact?  It seems like you are arguing that this disqualifies him from having an opinion about the Book of Mormon being true, but unless you are about to confess that you are writing this in between digs it seems like you maybe don't actually think only architects get to talk.

      &#x200B;

      On an overall level, this is just a meandering take on labels, right?

      &#x200B;

      Like, we know on the object level what Card does and will do.  He makes it pretty clear.  Being a writer, he isn't super bashful about saying stuff.  

      &#x200B;

      There's an old LW post about how it isn't worth it to beat yourself up about what labels are on stuff, if you agree on the underlying level.  Like, 'tree falls in the forest with no one there makes no sound', both the sound guy and the no sound guy agree on all possible predictions, the whole debate is on the definition of 'no one there'.

      &#x200B;

      So, like, Card's words tell us what to expect from him, and his actions back that up.  Why are you tying yourself in knots trying to figure out if 'bigot', or 'holds bigoted beliefs', or 'has aligned himself with bigots' describes him?  What describes him is what he says and does, and that is clear no matter what label it ends up stuck with.

      &#x200B;

      A good trick to avoid doing this kind of stuff is to mentally put the person you are talking with/about on the praiseworthy side of a debate.  Say it is the past, and OSC is obsessed with stopping people from smoking before that was cool.

      &#x200B;

      You wouldn't write this about him then, right?  You'd put his priors in place and work out where his beliefs came from, and what they implied, without all this random dunking on dude.  You are mad smart, you'd do great at it.

        You're taking that line out of context: the reason I found it so jarring is that Card's writing promotes tolerance and rationality, not blind faith that disadvantages certain minorities.  

        >Full stop, what is this? Like, why is dude being bad at archaeology going to help anyone learn anything from your post? What's fun about this fact?

          Re: Expertise

          So, like, the basic failure of empathy is saying you are taking on the other side's priors and then continuing to operate using your own.  Like if I'm trying to grok Dan who talks backwards I can't keep thinking that backwards talking is silly and then try to figure out why he loves silliness, what it is about silliness that attracts him, etc.  In his mind, this isn't silly, this is reasonable and serious behavior.

          &#x200B;

          Similarly, if you are going to step into OSC's mind and talk about the Book of Mormon, you can't say that he needs to be an architect to believe in it but you don't need to be one to scoff at it, because the judgement on which experts are credible is something you took along from your own brain.  Google is vast, and the anti vaxxer or Book of Mormon truther can find links that tell them they are smart just as well as you can.

          RE: dunking on dude

          The reason I am disappointed in you for calling him senile is that it is the empathy version of a nuke.  Once you set it off, you are done.  If the person isn't a person (or rather, isn't fully modeled as a...you get it), if their behavior is determined by degrading cells or misfiring brain lightning, then you are done, yeah?  They behave this way because someone hit them in the head with a hammer, case closed.  You need a LOT of evidence to go there.

          Sum up:

          Ok, like, there are some math problems that are hard because they have many steps.  If you get just one bit of the long division wrong you are on the wrong path and barring a happy accident you will end wrong.  But this isn't one of those situations.  This is 2+2, but you have excluded 4 from the solution space. The boring, naive answer is the right one.  OSC has the motivations that he says (over and over) he has.

          &#x200B;

          Meta:

          Categories are useful because they help us predict behaviors.  "Bob is a bigot, black people don't knock on his door if your car breaks down."  OSC is a person who won't shut up about his motivations and behaviors.  Figuring out what categories he belongs in is a waste of time (because we don't need any help predicting his behaviors, they are famous), and could actually make you less accurate.  Like, if you just knew him as OSC, famous bigot, you might well expect he'd support President Trump, but if you treat him as OSC, as-seen-on-tv, you know he loathes the guy.

            This is basic to *understanding why he is Mormon,* but it is not sufficient to cast judgement on his *continued belief in Mormonism's irrationality*. I totally get that he has reasons to think he's correct. That doesn't mean I can't cast judgement on his ability to determine if he actually is or not. There are plenty of people who were raised Mormon and somehow managed to realize, hey, this all doesn't really add up.

            I didn't say that I think he is senile now: I said that when I first encountered his toxic ranting online years ago, it was a possibility that I considered to explain the level of disconnect from the intelligence and empathy his characters showed.

            But that's not what I said. I said his silence on his Church's attitude toward black people despite his prolific writing on the Church and society in general is a mark against him. Not slam dunk evidence, but yes, evidence. This seems similar to the attitude that you need someone to shout the N-word to think they might be at a wee bit racist, and anything short of that is just speculation. Sometimes you need to be able to make a judgement on insufficient evidence. I'm not betting my life on any of this stuff, but I'm not going to bully my reason into ignoring it. That just feels like another form of PC thinking.

            What makes you think I can not or did not do this? This is like basic empathy. If you think I can't pass an ITT on OSC, you could just say that. I'm pretty confident I could. Seeing him the way he sees himself, as a good husband and father, a pious man who's protecting his faith and society from degrading forces, doesn't change his words and attitude, and those are what I'm examining. 

            >Ok, like, there are some math problems that are hard because they have many steps.

            Well, that's just, like, your opinion man :P 

            Saying I've excluded 4 from the solution space is... kind of insulting, to be honest. It's like you think I'm just so stupid I can't possibly imagine that maybe OSC really is just what he says. But my entire article is pointing out why I think it's not that simple. It's like... shit, put yourself in MY head for a second; why do you think I spent hours of my life writing this thing? Because I just wanted to bash the poor old man? Because 4 was just *inconceivable* to me? 

            Obviously I think it's possible that his stated motivations are his real ones. But my assessment of his words and behavior do not lead me to think that is the most probable state of reality. In all the different possible realities, the ones where his motivations are what he states look *very different* to me. Being someone who lives in the world and pays attention to history, I've noticed a hell of a lot of people insisting they're not prejudiced who do or say prejudiced things. Do you want me to just throw out those observations? Sounds like you're the one excluding possible answers from solution space. 

            As I said elsewhere, we can't know what's in other people's hearts. But after a certain point we do have to say we have "enough" justification to at least tentatively believe in one explanation, while holding ourselves open to other explanations that might gather evidence. Maybe you just have a higher threshold for this than I do, and that's fine: sometimes I'll be too quick to judge, and sometimes you'll be too slow too. But I don't think OSC deserves to be let off the hook as simply as 2+2=4 simply because he states that he's not prejudiced. 

            *shrugs* Idunnoman. Life and people are more complicated than that; worst part is some people legitimately don't know or realize they're prejudiced, and so are being 100% honest and sincere when they insist they're not. And then they still say gay people shouldn't adopt kids because it's bad for the kids/the fabric of society, despite all the evidence against that, and then falling back on "my particular interpretation of God said so" when they have nothing left.

  Good post, always nice to see some sane political discussion that doesn't immediately devolve into shouting.

  With regards to religious views versus emotional bigotry, I'm not really sure about Orson Scott Card, but I think this is much more obvious with people like Ben Shapiro. When Ben says that he unfortunately cannot attend Dave Rubin's gay wedding because of his religion, I don't believe for a second that he is secretly disgusted by Dave. I am willing to take him at his word there. But when he talks about Palestine versus Israel, there's a degree of vitriol and irrationality that enters his speech that you simply do not see when he talks about gay people. So I think this is a clear example of these two separate kinds of bigotry, and in the same person to boot.

  Of course all the examples you name in your post are w.r.t. right wing views, but I actually think that the refusal to acknowledge different kinds of bigotry is itself a form of left-wing bigotry. I have been told in the past by left-wing people when they found out that I liked Ender's Game that "this tells me everything I need to know about you". If that's not bigotry, what is? And when it comes to not caring about the truth... I have literally had people tell me that they view socialism as an *axiom*; that they literally view it as an end in and of itself. When I pressed them on their logical grounds for this, they happily stated that they do not believe logical consistency to be worth pursuing.

  In other words, I suspect that those who decry Orson Scott Card as 'just another right-wing bigot' are, themselves, bigots who do not much care to find out what their political opponents actually believe. A lack of understanding makes it so much easier to hate.

    Agreed, though the word "bigotry" to apply to it feels muddying, even if I know what you mean. I think those left-wing people that said that to you are just kind of dumb and incapable of critical thinking in a way that leads to prejudice. Maybe I'm splitting hairs too fine though.

      I think that's one of the biggest mistakes of the modern left, honestly. This over reliance on naive consequentialism: "My logical error is not as bad as your error because it does not hurt as many people". It doesn't work that way. The reason I'm calling it the same phenomenon is because that kind of lazy thinking is the exact what's causing so much needless pain and misery in the world right now.

      Let me ask you a question: Do you really believe that this person I quoted does not also have prejudices about minorities? That they do not call right-wing black people Uncle Toms, maybe? That they do not talk about needing to protect our fragile women, or call right-wingers virgins and closet homosexuals as an insult? How on earth are we supposed to get people to become wiser, if some kinds of prejudice are considered 'not that bad' or 'not really bigotry' just because it's coming from people on our side? And yet wherever I go, those kinds of comments get excused by intelligent, thoughtful left-wing people, purely out of partisanship.

      Ironically enough, it was the New Atheists who were originally accused of that kind of thinking, of worshipping blind utilitarianism and replacing one kind of faith with another. But in reality it was the Social Justice types who rejected the New Atheists that ended up making that mistake - perhaps precisely because the New Atheists had been warned about it so many times. I certainly respect people like Sam Harris, or even Jordan Peterson who you mention, a lot more than those folks.

    * Are the teachings of the Mormon church completely accurate?  If so:
       * Do you follow the Church's stance on homosexuality?  (It's a sin to them and you can be kicked out for it.)  Why or why not?
       * Do you follow the Church's pre-1970ish views of Black people.  If not, why didn't God reveal the truth earlier and save a lot of racism and discrimination?
       * How do you support a religion with an obviously disproven/disprovable view of History?  (I.E. Jewish people here, lots of European animals here pre-Columbian Exchange, worldwide flood.)
       * How do you reconcile the Bible's non-violent version of Jesus with the Book of Mormon's one that [burns and floods entire cities](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?)?

      >Do you follow the Church's pre-1970ish views of Black people. If not, why didn't God reveal the truth earlier and save a lot of racism and discrimination?

      Mormonism actually has precedent for God revealing things that the church wasn't ready for, the biggest example being the Law of Consecration, which was essentially communistic. Basically each family would regularly sit down with the bishop, determine how many of their assets were necessary for their need, and the excess would be allocated into the bishop's storehouse, to be redistributed to those without and/or to be used by the church itself. 

      Following the catastrophic failure of the system, God shrugged and said the people weren't ready, and instituted the "lesser law" of tithing as had been done anciently, which is still in force today. 

      Apologists claim the same deal would apply with the black priesthood ban, that had it been lifted before the US was on the same page it would have gone poorly. This isn't as totally out of left field as it sounds, considering that Utah was nearly invaded due to the polygamy practice, and that was only lifted when the US government basically threatened to sieze all places of worship held by the church, including the temples which are so central to Mormonism. It's easy to see how reactionary this would make the leadership. 

      > • How do you reconcile the Bible's non-violent version of Jesus with the Book of Mormon's one that [burns and floods entire cities](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9.20?)? If they're the same person, why are they worthy of worship rather than hatred for the act of destroying cities?

      Mormonism squares this circle by claiming that Jesus is the same as Jehovah, which is to say if it's not consistent with the mortal teachings of the man in the New Testament, it's at *least* par for the course for the Old. It's also claimed that his mortal ministry was supposed to exemplify mortal conduct, while the actions taken in a godly office are supposed to often be tough choices of letting the world go stagnant vs pruning the population to select for believers.

      Also remember that the absolute negative utility of death is not nearly so absolute within a framework where literally everyone is going to be resurrected and granted an immortal body at the end of time. Under such a framework and with Mormonism's perspective of life being a brief 60 year stretch between two gulfs of millions-plus-years existences, the worst injustices and sufferings of mortality are supposed to be somewhat less severe than they seem; a cost for the whole system to function, waste heat produced while elevating mortals.

      Which is scant comfort if they've flubbed some of the fundamentals, there.

        >Mormonism squares this circle by claiming that Jesus is the same as Jehovah

        Wait a minute here.

        I thought that LDS explicitly rejected the idea of the Trinity (that YHWH the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three aspects of the same God rather than three distinct entities).

        Do you just mean that they reconcile this by saying they both have the same perfect morality, so whatever one does, it makes moral sense that the other would do as well, or am I wrong about their beliefs?

          As a former Mormon, I can answer this one. Mormons explicitly reject the concept of Trinity, but Jehovah/YHWH in the Old Testament is Jesus before he came to earth and gained a mortal body. His father (aka The Father, aka Elohim) is a distinct entity, as is the Holy Spirit.  


          So I think the bit that's confusing you is the connection that to Mormons, YHWH =/= the Father. Elohim == the Father, Jehovah == Jesus, ??? == Holy Spirit.

          Under Mormon doctrine they do have the same interchangeability of morality as you mention, but you're correct about the rejection of the trinity. The father, son, and holy spirit are considered separate individuals. It's easiest to consider those three as titles or offices; Mormons treat the father's given name as Elohim, and the son's given name as Jehovah, with the rank of "God" and the job description of "Father" and "Son", respectively. 

          Thus earth's existence has had Jehovah presiding over it as God in the world's longest on-the-job training, with Elohim only occasionally stepping in, such as when Jehovah was being a mortal, when directing the creation of the world, or when providing character references ("this is my beloved son").

      The latter should be fairly uncontroversial, I think. If you have irreconcilable differences of belief and practice with an organisation, naturally enough they may be unwilling to continue the association. That's not limited to this issue, nor to churches.

      As to the former - gender and family go to the heart of our beliefs about the nature of heaven, and a relationship that excludes one of the genders and excludes the possibility of children cannot match the gold standard according to those beliefs. So yes, I think a homosexual lifestyle is a serious obstacle to eternal happiness.

      I think you'll find that *most* members of the church still have no answers about the whys and wherefores of that. And those that do have answers, are probably just guessing.

      What I can say is, there was never any scriptural mandate for restricting the priesthood by race, and it's not entirely clear how the policy came about. As far as I have been able to tell, it was largely due to Brigham Young's influence, and while he was the president of the church, he never claimed to be infallible and we don't believe he was. Beyond that, there's a lot of, "I really don't know." And it was all before my time.

      Despite the personal views of some church members, even prominent members, there's actually no doctrinal problem with a local, rather than global, flood. And the Book of Mormon is definitely not a comprehensive history of ancient America, nor was it ever intended to be, so the possibility of other migrations is not a problem.

  This is a *very* well done piece of propagandistic persuasion.

  In the attempt to point out the biases of its target, stepping back for a moment and look at it, all it really accomplishes is confirming the biases of its writer.

  The writer apparently went into this hoping to further understand someone he considered a "hero", only to realize that they held opposite opinions on some very key beliefs.  The mental anguish of this discovery led to lashing out an accusing the person of insanity or mental degradation rather than accept the much more sane possibility that that person *did not believe the same as the writer did*.  It's a simple truth of life that no human is perfect, and no person will completely agree with you on everything.

  > “false beliefs about a specific demographic that knowingly disadvantage or cause harm to that demographic.” 

  This is the definition of 'bigotry' established by the writer.  At no place is this established in relation to OSC.  The closest thing to fulfilling the definition is pointing out that OSC thinks that same-sex marriage is a sin.  This is not a false belief, it is in direct congruence with his religious beliefs.  The belief is not even false in general terms, as all longstanding religions have the same tenet.  OSC writing and working for his beliefs does not make them false.  If one wants to take offense at the concept of 'sin', then one must follow a religion without such a concept or have no religion at all, in which case the proper response is "so what?"  

  OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in, and he has done it in ways less insulting than the original post.

  ---

  > if you’ve spoken with bigots at all, they always have justifications for bigotry.

  All people have justifications for what they believe.  Is the original writer implying that this is not the case?  It must be strange to discover that other people might have rational reasons for their beliefs, but it should not be a surprise.

  > So what were Card’s views on black Mormons?

  I wondered how long it would take before the racist card would be played.  About halfway through the article, it seems.  The amusing part is that OSC doesn't much seem to care, but observe the written trickery that seems to accuse OSC of racism despite not showing racist tendencies.

  It's about at the Obama portion that this entire thing falls apart, and it's right at the moment where **THIS** :

  > While Card doesn’t quite fit that pattern, and breaks from it entirely in some places, he made one that seems to run parallel to it in other places. 

  Turns into **THIS**:  

  > Do I think he would have said that if Obama wasn’t black? 

  One comment that the writer disagrees with and falsely attributes to racism for OSC means that he is so, and thus also bigoted?  

  Yeah, no.  I'm sorry, but just because the writer believes that Bush is more stupid than Obama, it doesn't mean that OSC disagreeing with him means OSC is a bigoted racist.

  That's not rational.  That's not even partially reasonable.  THat's just... sad.

  ---

  The entire piece follows a similar pattern, over and over, and it gets rather tiresome reading it.  There is nothing direct, merely backhanded compliments that get torn down, and then indirect accusations that are not fully supported before moving on to the next.  At least they are all tied together somewhat, with the implication that if enough of them are questionable then they must all be true, and thus OSC is a bad person.

  I myself disagree with OSC on numerous points, but I'm not going to call him racist, bigot, toxic, or any of the other buzzwords that get thrown about nowadays.  I am interested in the man's writings, not his politics, and I don't even agree with the mainstream that he's all that particularly amazing.   Like Frank Herbert and "Dune", I consider his first work to be amazing and all the ones thereafter on a slow decline from that greatness, as if the most important concepts they had were put forth into a masterpiece that could not be equaled.  But I see no need to accuse the man without basis, attack his beliefs, or attempt to imply he is something he is not.

  The irony is that I rather enjoy the works done by the original writer here, and by reading this piece, I have just went through almost the exact same cycle of discovery that he went through with OSC.  The well-done and extremely creative rational writings must now be forever separated from the beliefs and actions of the person who wrote them, as they are vastly contradictory.  But I do not see him as an evil bigot or anything of the sort, just a man who believes differently.  Ironically, this places him in the same company as OSC, and to use a recently overused quote: This does put a smile on my face.

    Hoo boy, that's a lot of poor reading comprehension and passive-aggressive insults. Let's take a crack at this and hope we're both arguing in enough good faith to resolve the apparent misunderstandings:

    >The writer apparently went into this hoping to further understand someone he considered a "hero", only to realize that they held opposite opinions on some very key beliefs. The mental anguish of this discovery led to lashing out an accusing the person of insanity or mental degradation rather than accept the much more sane possibility that that person did not believe the same as the writer did.

    Right off the bat, your timeline is off: you're describing my initial reaction from almost a decade ago as if it was the impetus for this article. And you seem to have badly missed my point; my "mental anguish" as you put it was in fact over the contradiction between his personal beliefs and the themes of his stories. Others simply believing different things is trivially easy to accept; understanding why is where the challenge lies.

    >This is the definition of 'bigotry' established by the writer. At no place is this established in relation to OSC.

    Right, which is why I ultimately concluded that I don't think he's a bigot other than in the run-of-the-mill religious sense. You should probably finish reading articles before you respond to them.

    >OSC has expressed disagreements with things he does not believe in, and he has done it in ways less insulting than the original post.

    I guess you didn't read the articles I linked to either, where OSC is rather insulting to a number of people who disagree with him. More on that later.

    >All people have justifications for what they believe. Is the original writer implying that this is not the case? It must be strange to discover that other people might have rational reasons for their beliefs, but it should not be a surprise.

    No, the original author was pointing out that giving a justification for a belief that others deserve inequality does not make them less someone who believes others deserve inequality. Is must be strange to discover that you misread something that simple, but try to update on that surprise!

    >The amusing part is that OSC doesn't much seem to care, but observe the written trickery that seems to accuse OSC of racism despite not showing racist tendencies.

    OSC not caring about his church's historic and blatant racism is not a point in his favor. Insofar as you keep accusing me of potential shock, it may come as a shock to you that not all people with prejudice show overt "tendencies," but keeping silent about the inequality of black Mormons when he's otherwise so outspoken about his religion and society is a pretty big deal, imo. 

    >One comment that the writer disagrees with and falsely attributes to racism for OSC means that he is so, and thus also bigoted? Yeah, no. I'm sorry, but just because the writer believes that Bush is more stupid than Obama, it doesn't mean that OSC disagreeing with him means OSC is a bigoted racist.

    Didn't you say that OSC is less insulting toward people he disagrees with? I certainly didn't call OSC the "most bigoted writer in the world," while OSC called Obama "the stupidest president in history" on foreign policy. Seems pretty insulting to me.

    But more importantly, it wasn't just that one comment. It's clear you didn't read any of the articles I linked to, but I quoted multiple parts from that one. Why are you just picking one comment out and ignoring the others? 

    >That's not rational. That's not even partially reasonable.

        The repeated backhanded insults and passive-aggressiveness on the part of your response indicates that you are not actually attempting to argue in good faith.

      > you're describing my initial reaction from almost a decade ago as if it was the impetus for this article.

      The article is inexorably linked to the original experience.  It was unpleasant for you then.  You decided to go into more detail, and found that it was even more so at the later point in time.  Nothing in the portion you quoted was factually incorrect.  You did that once.  Part of the impetus for your 'deep dive' was previous discoveries.  Part of the purpose of the article was to interpret and explain your findings in a way meant to convince others of your point of view.  If A = B, and B = C, then A = C.

      > Right, which is why I ultimately concluded that I don't think he's a bigot other than in the run-of-the-mill religious sense. You should probably finish reading articles before you respond to them.

      "I decided he's not a bigot, except that he's a different kind of bigot".  I did finish the article, thank you for the false assumption that I did not.

      > I guess you didn't read the articles I linked to either, where OSC is rather insulting to a number of people who disagree with him. More on that later.

      I did.  I would assume you would try to be better than him.  If you are saying you are the same, or that it's OK that you do it because he does, then criticizing him for things you yourself do is hypocrisy.

      > No, the original author was pointing out that giving a justification for a belief that others deserve inequality does not make them less someone who believes others deserve inequality. Is must be strange to discover that you misread something that simple, but try to update on that surprise!

      You call his beliefs bigoted.  Then you point out how "bigots" always try to defend their beliefs.
      **ALL** people try to defend their beliefs.  It must be strange for you to misread something so simple.

      > OSC not caring about his church's historic and blatant racism is not a point in his favor.

        Why?  Why are you trying to make the discussion about something *else* than the supposed "bigotry" on his beliefs of same-sex marriage?  If you can't provide enough evidence of a thing to prove your point, do you *often* try to start other arguments or make commentary on other subjects in an obvious attempt to poison the readers view toward the person?  You know, instead of having evidence?

      Do you clump all forms of "bigotry" together in a mass and assume that if one trait is shown, all the others must as well?  You do realize the fallacious nature of such an argument, yes?

      >  but keeping silent about the inequality of black Mormons when he's otherwise so outspoken about his religion and society is a pretty big deal, imo. 

      Yes.  In *your* opinion, it's a very big deal.  He apparently doesn't think much of it.  Is such an equality still long-standing and pervasive?  Do they continue to hold a person's race against them religiously?  Are they oppressing such people now?  Or is this a solution in need of a problem, when the original organization has since moved on?

      Why are you trying to make past views of the religion he belongs to a negative slander on a man who is indifferent to it?  Is he not allowed to believe differently?  Are all religious people within a certain religion in 100% alignment with each other on every single view?

      See, for anyone else, it's a situation of "His religion believes something we may consider bigoted, but the man himself seems not to believe that".  Somehow, you want to make this a negative thing, and there is little reason to do so unless you are trying to make him look bad.

      > Didn't you say that OSC is less insulting toward people he disagrees with? I certainly didn't call OSC the "most bigoted writer in the world," while OSC called Obama "the stupidest president in history" on foreign policy. Seems pretty insulting to me.

      Nice dodge.  I notice you avoided the key part, but that's fine.
      Yes.  Obama was pretty insanely stupid on foreign policy.  At least Bush can blame the fact that Congress **voted** for that retarded war, but everything Obama has done is on his own hands.  

        But see, none of this matters, because it's all a distraction on your part.  **You** disagree with OSC on his political beliefs about our previous President.  Because he disagrees, *you* decided to call him racist, despite lacking any proof of such whatsoever, merely your own implications.  Implications with zero evidence.

      > but I quoted multiple parts from that one. Why are you just picking one comment out and ignoring the others?

      Exactly as you treat OSC.  Your stories are good.  When you're trying to tell a rational tale, you do it well.

      In reality, however, you are far less rational than you think, and while it is disappointing to discover that you're just a normal, flawed, emotion-driven human being like the rest of us, I didn't really expect anything different.

      Please, though, do *not* stop writing your stories.  You have a talent, and you should continue using it and sharpening it.  If you think about it, you've learned much and grown thanks to OSC's works, despite your disgust with the reality of the man.  Others may end up growing from your works as well, despite their dislike of your personal beliefs.

        Alright, I'll break this down with an example: if someone says "Gay people molest children so shouldn't adopt," this would be a bigoted belief, yes? If they justify this belief by saying "There are a lot of men who molest young boys," does this justification for their belief make it less bigoted?

        If you say yes, then we have bigger problems going on here, but if not, then congratulations, we agree! My point in highlighting this was to head off people who might argue that "OSC believes he's doing what's best for children/families/God/etc," because that doesn't change the classification of the belief as bigoted. That's all it really was; when making an argument, it's good practice to predict and defuse counter arguments, so that's what I did.

        >Why? Why are you trying to make the discussion about something else than the supposed "bigotry" on his beliefs of same-sex marriage?... Do you clump all forms of "bigotry" together in a mass and assume that if one trait is shown, all the others must as well? 

        Well first of all, because OSC isn't criticized only for his gay bigotry, but also for potential racism. So you know, it would have been a little weird to ignore that. 

        As to clumping it all together... Ehhh *waggles hand left and right* Sort of, no, but a little, maybe. Prejudices of all kinds basically follow the same flawed epistemics, I don't know for sure if they're correlated, but if someone shows signs of one kind of bigotry I'm certainly less surprised if they turn out to be bigoted in other ways too. I do explain this in the post, but you're off the hook on not recognizing it since it's actually a rather complex point that I made over the course of a few paragraphs.

        Basically, I was pointing out that it's really tempting to just blame Card's religion on his beliefs about gay people, but that there are underlying failures in Card's epistemics and patterns of behavior that show him failing to distinguish truth from falsehood and failing to empathize with or be charitable toward those he disagrees with, the way I would expect someone who "hates the sin but loves the sinner" to do. Bringing up his worrying silence on the historic racism of his church doesn't fit my model of a Card who hates bigotry.

        >Yes. In your opinion, it's a very big deal. He apparently doesn't think much of it. Is such an equality still long-standing and pervasive? Do they continue to hold a person's race against them religiously? Are they oppressing such people now?

        Well, yes, according to many ex-mormons, but even if they're all dirty sin-blackened liars, dude was 27 when his church finally decided maybe black people deserve to be equals. I don't know how old you are, but if you don't think that's old enough to speak out against inequality, then we're operating on different expectations of people.

        >Or is this a solution in need of a problem, when the original organization has since moved on? Why are you trying to make past views of the religion he belongs to a negative slander on a man who is indifferent to it? Is he not allowed to believe differently? Are all religious people within a certain religion in 100% alignment with each other on every single view?

        You know what, I'm turning this flurry of questions around, because their answers seem pretty obvious from my post (that you totally read fully and carefully). En garde!

        Why do you care so little about his church's racism? His church that he thinks is infallible about gay people? His church that he defends constantly? Card isn't "all religious people," he's an outspoken and fairly famous member of his church, and of course he's allowed to think differently, my point is if he did he should have *said so.* You're not even a little bit concerned that maybe the guy who's totally "indifferent" about his church's about-face on racism might be racist? You don't see any remote shred of a problem, there? This really strikes you as totally off topic? Your picture of a non-racist Card just meekly stays silent on that? Because "indifferent" is not a good look on him at all, and if your goal here is to try to convince me I'm wrong, you're just shooting your argument in the foot with that word.

        >Nice dodge. I notice you avoided the key part, but that's fine.

        You seem confused, that was a "direct rebuttal." You said X, I pointed out why X was wrong. Rebuttal, not dodge. And which key part was that? "Foreign policy?" I mentioned that, actually. You have to be specific here if you want to defend your points, because they're not doing well.

        >Obama was pretty insanely stupid on foreign policy. At least Bush can blame the fact that Congress voted for that retarded war, but everything Obama has done is on his own hands.

        Oooh, okay, so this all kind of makes sense: you don't CARE that OSC was incredibly insulting to Obama, because you believe those insults were TRUE! Good to know we can use that as a defense; as long as I think I'm right about OSC, my insults are fine! Huzzah!

        >But see, none of this matters, because it's all a distraction on your part. You disagree with OSC on his political beliefs about our previous President. Because he disagrees, you decided to call him racist, despite lacking any proof of such whatsoever, merely your own implications. Implications with zero evidence.

        Nah, he also said he's a "black man who talks like a white man" and a bunch of other stuff that you totally read because you totally didn't skip over the articles I linked to in your totally well thought out original response, so it pretty much sounds like none of what you're saying *here* matters, because you're trying to distract form how factually incorrect you are by presuming my intentions. 

        You accusing me of accusing Card of racism just because he insults Obama is about as empty an argument as me accusing you of defending Card because he insulted Obama. It's not a really effective argument, you see? 

        Better stick to the actual point, which was... *checks* oh yes, that you ignored the entire article I linked to and quoted multiple times from so you could just take this one line and spin a narrative about me and my intentions around it. Next!

        >*Looks up at your entire series of very specific cut replies to my own post* Funny, that.

        Laaame. Come on, that was weaker than the rubber and glue thing. You actually just tried to equivocate me responding to your post point by point (you know, the most thorough way to respond to someone's argument) with your blatant mistake (can't say lie, that would be presuming bad faith) that there was just one thing I was focusing on while ignoring all the other things I quoted?

        *refreshes other page* Still no reply to that, so still waiting to see if you have the integrity to admit your mistake. It's pretty simple, just admit that you shouldn't have said "One comment that the writer disagrees with" because there were more than one.
