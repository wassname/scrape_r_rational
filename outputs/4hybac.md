## [Challenge Companion] Romance

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the challenge companion, post recommendations, ideas, or discussion below.**

Why is romance one of the least rational genres?

I think the stock answer is probably "because love isn't rational!" but that just doesn't sound right to me. The Hollywood version of love is fraught with deceptions that spiral out of control, simple misunderstandings that could have been cleared up with five minutes of conversation, and love triangles galore. Some of this is lazy writing, but I think the reason it crops up so much is that conflict is one of the foundations of storytelling.

Conflict is easy, since conflict is foundational to humans. Hollywood's problem is that they want conflict, and especially romantic conflict, to be wrapped up nicely at the end. If two characters are in conflict and they're also in a romance, that's great for moving the plot along, but you don't want to leave the audience with the feeling that the relationship is never going to work because the conflict is an ongoing one. That removes most of the best sorts of conflicts, or at least makes them a lot harder to write.

So Hollywood goes for a bunch of things that are *stupid*, sure, but that also aren't going to be a problem that lingers in the audience's mind. Once a misunderstanding is cleared up, that's it, it's over. Once someone says, "It started out as a bet, but once I got to know you ..." and the apology has been accepted, the natural reaction is not to think "Well that's going to come up in every fight they ever have".

Contrast that with something like the Capulets and Montagues (in their archetypal forms). Two people from feuding families fall in love, the conflict that drives the plot is that their friends and families will never approve of it. The plot can't be resolved until that conflict is dealt with, one way or another, but feuds don't tend to happen for no reason, and converting everyone on both sides away from the feud is hard -- and in addition, probably takes away from what's supposed to be the central piece of the story, the romance. Same applies to most deep philosophical (rather than tribal) conflicts which don't have easy solutions that you can wrap up in a 90 minute movie.

My favorite sorts of romance movies are ones in which both people have to go through some process of change. The primary conflict that stands in the way of the romance is that the two participants are not yet their best selves, and the journey is about personal growth as much as it is about love. Those are hard to write though, especially if you're a writer working within an incentives system that doesn't reward it.

  Well, I missed this train, as I seem to be missing many trains lately. Shame.

  I've long wanted to write a take on the Pygmalion formula (both the original Greek "lonely man creates woman of his dreams from literally nothing" and the Shaw "pretentious man attempts to transform naive woman into something more like himself") set in a near-future AI research team. The lead developer's foolishness, of course, jeopardizes humanity, as the iterations who learn to love him take his already-unsavory attributes to extremes, and the iterations who don't learn to love him learn to hate him and all humans with him.

  There would of course be a FOOM scenario that goes something like this: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=t3mC4485Ue0

  I expect the most interesting topics on this theme will probably relate to the challenges, ethics and consequences of fantasy powers and characters in a romantic context. Apart from fantasy settings, cultural variations on romance in sci-fi settings may also be worth exploring. Example topics:

  * **Love potions:** Probably unethical, but are you sure? There are many ways to make someone fall in love with you, so what exactly makes love potions different?

  * **Telepathy:** Rationalists are often attracted to other rationalists. How would a rationalist telepath woo another rationalist without them figuring out about the telepathy?

  * **Cupid:** If Cupid died, how would the process of falling in love change? What would be the sociological impact? How could we prove that Cupid had died (or ever existed), and how could we correct the situation? Would love potions become acceptable?

  * **Shapeshifters:** They gain a unique ability to test their lovers' faithfulness, but what problems or ethical dilemmas might arise from doing so?

  * **Polyamorous families:** In *The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress*, Heinlein describes how lunar prison colonies adapted to an environment with far more men than women by forming marriages between multiple men and women. Is this the most likely outcome of societal gender imbalance?

    I agree with your point, but I find it mildly disturbing that three of your five example topics are premised on trust issues.

    Unless you are doing something along the lines of "showing the other person that you do in fact fulfill zir values," then I'm pretty sure I'd call it unethical, love potion or no.

      I think love potions are interesting in that they're often portrayed as little-different from date rape drugs, but there's no particular reason that, in a fantasy universe, it couldn't work in some other way that's better - or worse - than such a mundane, real thing.

      On the worse end, we've got GWSI Amortentia, which induces *permanent, total ego death*, but...

      On the better end, what about a substance that forces a previously low-probability event wherein the target falls in love of their own accord?  It's something that could've happened anyway; the magic just makes sure that that's what happens.

      Or, as you suggest, what about a purely additive love potion?  Something that doesn't flood the brain with emotional chemicals, but simply imbues the target with more knowledge of someone, until they see things from their perspective?  A true love potion, as opposed to an infatuation potion.

        You might be misunderstanding me. To clarify, unless you *do in fact fulfill the values of your romantic interest*, I'm not sure of any way to ethically get someone to fall in love with you (except perhaps changing yourself to fulfill those values). 

        Anything that changes your romantic interest's values in a way that your romantic interest, pre-change, would not approve, is skeevy to me. 

        The low-probability potion is good, but I'm not quite sure how you're intending the additive potion, because of the "until they see things from their perspective" bit.

        If you are not familiar with [Alicorn's love potions AUSJ](http://luminousalicorn.tumblr.com/tagged/potions/chrono), it is relevant.

        Additionally, the excellent [*Goldmage*](http://goldmage.elcenia.com/) by the same author contains love magic. In fact, it features true love magic, as you put it.

  [The Fall of Doc Future](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) (and sequels) do Romance in a "rational" manner: Avoiding miscommunication, clearly communicating expectations, intentions and boundaries, disclosing emotions, not keeping secrets, never outright lying, and deconstructing harmful relationship norms where appropriate.

  Serial monogamy goes out the window by the second book; but so far it is a little light on same-gender attraction.

- u/Sparkwitch:
  ```
  I remember, several years back, a great discussion about the impossibility romance in video games. The thrust of the argument was that the tension and conflict in the romance genre depends upon the potential lovers being kept apart, while the impulse of the player is simply to bring them together.

  All the obstacles, twists, and misunderstandings that drive our heroes apart are ultimately what brings them together, and their constant failures to see how perfect they are for one another is what makes us (the audience) want them to wind up together in the end.

  Romance games would likely be stuck with a lot of scenes like that exasperating moment when the player walks around a corner and is suddenly disarmed so that the bad guy can talk in a place that you can't simply shoot him.

  It would be quite a balancing act, and a writing feat, to keep that entertaining rather than frustrating.
