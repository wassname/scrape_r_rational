    Two other FiM Fictions that were reasonably-well upvoted on this subreddit:  

    * [The Writing on the Wall](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/41beo5/the_writing_on_the_wall/)  
    * [Friendship is Optimal](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1s0hr1/friendship_is_optimal_mlp_earthfic/)
