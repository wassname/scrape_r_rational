## [HF][WIP] Daybreak on Hyperion - would this fit here?

### Post:

What do you think?

------------

*Born into noble prestige and gifted with genius intellect, Pascal was a promising officer cadet who rose to national fame before even graduating. At the mere age of nineteen, he had everything a young man could wish for...*

*Except his habitual arrogance had destroyed every opportunity of a close friendship.*

*Seeking a companion that would meet his protracted list of requirements, Pascal decided to craft the 'perfect spell' for the upcoming familiar ceremony. If those in his world were not fit to accompany his brilliance, then he would summon a best friend through his own hands -- one that was mature, intelligent, knowledgeable, bright, and cute to boot.*

*He received far more than he bargained for.*

*This is the story of how three wills -- historian, general, and sovereign -- joined to forever alter a continent.*

  It seems a bit Marty Stu-ish, just from the blurb alone. I know that's not part of the criteria, but it does make it less likely for a given person to actually read it. Also not really getting a rational vibe from the blurb, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

    I tried reading it a while ago. The upside is that it wasn't quite Marty Stu-ish, because the charachter described in this blurb isn't as much of a focus as [Minor Spoiler](#s "the genderswapped earth kid he summons.") The downside is that the light novel format feels sort of... I don't know, weird, in english. It reads as sort of stilted.
