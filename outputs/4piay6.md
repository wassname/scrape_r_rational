## Looking for RT(HSF|HF) where the answer is "full Von Neumann, bitches"

### Post:

I want protagonists that go full Von Neumann. I want protagonists facing opposition that's bullshit and assymetric enough that the only answer is to respond by breaking the setting themselves. Strap a rocket to the [anti-]hero's back, grab hold of the exponential power curve, and hold on tight. The only answer to a sufficiently bullshit OP opposition is to become bullshit OP yourself, and I want protagonists that recognize this and avoid being curbstomped by becoming a BESRMoW. 

Because really, who wouldn't want to be a Brutally Efficient Self-Replicating Mechanism of War, if they're facing something sufficiently [bullshit](#s "(omnicidal transplanar spacewhales anyone)")?

Examples include:

* Any _Worm_ fic where Taylor (optionally through teaming up with Amy) builds better monsters (and preferably monster-production facilities—let's go Zerg on that shit)
* Planetary Annihilation Commander fiction
* You get the idea.

  "Tengenn Toppa Gurren Lagaan" is *kinda* this. It's decently, although not completely, rational, and while it isn't Von Neumann-based exponential, it is pretty exponential.

  It's also all-around pretty amazeballs, and you'll know if you like it by ep 3.

  [The Waves Arisen](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/chapter-1/) is this, but you've probably already read it. [spoiler](#s " The use of clones and Rin'negan at the end is what takes Naruto from strong to god")

  It sounds like you have heard of it already... [Amelia](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.916/).  Jack Slash succeeds in getting Amelia to break her limits... and her and Taylor team and go all out.  We are talking multiple Endbringer fights, multiple original Endbringer, literally inventing the zerg, recruiting enough Tinkers to out tinker Toybox, and enough plotting to out plot Cauldron (well not exactly that last one).  The fights are pretty epic.  On the other hand, in between the fights, there is a ton of slice of life antics that kind of drag on, especially towards the later half of the story, and a few original characters, one of which I think is moderately annoying, some of which really irritated some readers.  Also, the author intentionally plays with [Fridge Horror](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeHorror) with the way some of the characters use their powers.  Not quite this bad, but imagine if Perfect Lionheart had the self awareness to realize what sociopaths his characters were and then gradually left hints to the audience.  Finally, the author also mimics Wildbow's shtick of portraying complex scenes from biased character's viewpoint, there are several parts that may seem like bashing, even if you later realize the context and that the other character had a good point.  It's super long, but I would say it was fun and had a satisfying climax, even if it dragged in some places.

  For a non worm fanfic... Have you seen Neon Genesis Evangelion?  To grimderp for you?  Try [Shinji and the Warhammer 40K](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/1/Shinji-and-Warhammer40k).  The author claims the premise is what if Shinji just got a warhammer 40k miniature set and books before canon, although its more like Shinji teaches himself borderline precog levels of planning and observation.  It avoids turning into a stomp fic because the Angels adapt to him using the AT field in diverse ways, and several other factions are changed as well.  Its an illustration of how "If you give Frodo a lightsaber, give Sauron the Deathstar" can both drive an awesome story, and the limitations of this concept as the story and plot gets drowned out under the sheer weight of mecha-sized chainsaw swords and mad science and psychic powers bullshit and multiple diablos ex machinas showing up to keep things even.  Be warned also that the story is unfinished, at near the climax, and the author has only posted one or two additional snippets over the past 4 years.  Also, the over-the-topness I think makes the author kind of regret writing some of it, so it may never get revised or finished...

  Edit: One more I forgot... not so much von neumann in the story, but rather a flashback piece as the Doctor tries to explain to a companion the sheer scale of the time war. http://archiveofourown.org/works/471497/chapters/815855

  Hmm... [Putting Down Roots](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/putting-down-roots-worm.393310/)?

  I mean it's more OP crackfic than ratfic, but it gets bonus points from me for depicting insane plant Taylor's inhuman PoV at times.

  Also it having like... three updates a day. That helps.

  Thought of another one.. are you a Stargate fan, or a fan of the original X-com games?  [XSGCOM](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3631062/1/XSGCOM-Mirror-Image).  It takes the already fast in-game reversing engineering times of the original XCOM games, and gives them Stargate tech.... Lots of awesome feel good curbstompage.  Potassium-naqaudah hand-grenades, staff canon mounted in gatling configuration, and more.  The enemies don't start escalating fast enough to keep up the tension, so the story has more of the lighthearted SG1 feel than the desperate XCOM feel.  The first book finishes at a good place, but the next story ends on a cliffhanger.

  Not quite full Von-nuemann so much as fully exploiting a sci-fi universe with lots of exploitable tech, but close to what you want... (asteroid mining using Tokra tunneling crystals and similar exploits)
  ```

  One more, a long running web-comic, [Schlock Mercenary](https://www.schlockmercenary.com/).  It covers a band of mercenaries in the future.  The technology used is pretty consistent in its physics (still soft-scifi, but consistent soft scifi) and its application by the characters while still having room for them to innovate.  In particular, one of the main characters invents a new type of FTL that sets off much of the conflict that dominates the rest of the story.  

  The characters are also smart about using their resources.  Fabricators and advanced by limited AI are present on every ship.  When the main characters salvage a massive derelict warship, they use its fabricators to churn out a bunch of smaller ships that they still use even after the lose the warship.  Mass fabricated missile/sensor/drone arrays are standard (innovated as the new FTL made them practical).  When the characters get ahold of advanced military nanobot projects, they eventually put it towards a project to make humans immortal [spoiler](#s "a conspiracy messes with their plans, but it looks like it is still going through thanks to the powerful mostly benevolent AI they helped set loose").  A powerful AI [spoiler](#s "literally turns the galactic core into a massive power generator to counter dark matter aliens in another galaxy")  One clever scientist abuses [spoiler](#s "a secret matter replication/teleportation tech to mass produce copies of himself to ensure that one of him will be immortal, but then they get angsting about not being unique, so his army of clones modify their appearances and genders and abilities and personalities, to basically make a small but diverse demographic")  The one time time travel is used it gets exploited to its fullest while simultaneously having a good justification to prevent further time travel plots.

  So yeah, its a long read from years of daily updates (the author like never misses), but it has a lot of high points in terms of "Brutally Efficient Self-Replicating Mechanism of War" and lots of clever munchkinry by the characters.

  Try [Fine Structure](https://qntm.org/structure). I don't recall any Von Neumann shenanigans, but there's some pretty heavy power escalation toward the end. 

  His other full length fic, [Ra](https://qntm.org/ra), is a different kind of story, but also has some serious power ladder climbing, [including](#s "nanotech does feature in this story")
  ```

- u/lsparrish:
  ```
  The Daniel Black series by the same guy that wrote Time Braid features a bit of VN munchkinism, although not as much as I would have liked. First 6 chapters [here](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3198066/1/Fimbulwinter).

  Taylor gets lucky. A ROB hijacks her trigger event, giving her the power to create and modify other powers. Also she's basically unkiliable. short, but fun as hell.
