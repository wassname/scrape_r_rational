## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I'm playing a level one Druid (of the natural laws) in Pathfinder. This is my first campaign, so I'm not too familiar wth the magic limits and science lore. I want to test out the limits of my level zero spells. GM said he approves of science and munchkinry attempts.

  I would like some help in devising an experiment line up. 

  Rules: 

  I can cast a level zero spell once every six seconds, an unlimited number of times per day. I have seven days until the next adventure.

  Spells I'm interested in and tests to do:

  Purify food and water - "Purifies one cubic foot of food and water"

  1. does purifying water get rid of visible particulates?
  2. If (1)=no, how do I know water is pure? Are objects tagged with information about their state rather than having molecular properties?
  3. If (1)=yes, are particulates taken out of water, or transmuted into water? Test  volume and/or mass.
  4. Test varying dirty water to mud. At what point does mud stop being water? 
  5. If (3)=transmuted, what happens to lead in water? Does mass or volume stay constant after purification?
  6. If (1)=yes and (4) gives favorable results, what liquids can I purify? Some cultures consume blood, can I purify blood?
      a. blood inside something living? Would that cure disease or kill creature?

  Mending - "Makes minor repairs on an object"

  1. Can I repair a deliberately broken object? If no, I can't test further.
  2. Will a whittled object be "repaired" to a block of wood?
  3. Will a broken off piece or errant cut off a whittled object be repaired to the point of the original carving?
  4. Does mend fill holes with new material?
  5. If (4) =yes, can I mend a gold coin/ trinket to create more gold?
  6. Can mend repair living things? Test rosewood armor/ green tree branches and work up to small cuts.

  Light - "Object shines like a torch"

  1. test size restrictions on object. Grain of sand? Boulder? Entire house?
  2. Define "object." 
      a. wet packed sand? Can it be broken apart and used as glitterdust?
      b. can part of an object shine? (Not sure if useful knowledge)
  3. line of sight required? (Might be able to use as a lesser Faerie Fire to cancel concealment for team mates if I spot something first)

  Create water - "Creates two gallons of water per level"

  1. Pressure cannon?
      a. Air displacement if I create water in a sealed empty jar?
      b. water in pressurized bubbles on rocks or trees as land mines?  

  I have other spells available but these seemed like the most promising. 

  My goals as a character are to 1: understand the laws of nature, and 2: get battle techniques.

  My goals as a player are to 1: get battle techniques, 2: understand the laws of magic and munchkin the hell out of them, and 3: RP entertaining enough stuff to get XP.

  Edit: formatting post I made from phone to look ok on computer.

    I'm thinking use 'mending' to smooth out glass or crystal to make high quailty lenses, or make them and remove the imperfections.

    Then get your torch spells and make a laser. Average torch is 80 watts? Industrial cutting lasers are 1500 watts, that's just under 19 uses of the light spell.

    My first though was feathers for a small and lightweight light source but you could use the spell on the crystals/lenses themselves. See how many you can get in a row.
    ```

    - u/CopperZirconium:
      ```
      That's a good idea! I already have a spyglass in my inventory, so I can disassemble that to do optics experiments. 

      I order to make the laser, I would need some way to make the light cohere. That would require sophisticated mirrors, I think. I could still focus the light to make a death ray (like the Mithbusters did.)

      Going off of the feathers and needing 19 close packed torches, I could get a bit of loose-weave cloth and Light every thread as it's own torch. That way I could easily pack a bunch of torches in a small area for a higher powered torch.
      ```

      - u/Nickoalas:
        ```
        I'm glad you like it. 

        Another thing to look into is if mending can be used to unseal something that has forcibly been broken/jammed shut. Especially if you can create water inside sealed objects.

        The idea of using 'mending' to trigger a pressurised trap tickles me.

        Then there's security applications; internal mechanisms in doors with a small component designed to 'break' every time the door is closed.

        Or possibility for automation; If you break a piece of string holding a hinge open, would 'mending' the string force the hinge open again?

        If you had string on both sides, would mending the string on one side forcibly break the other to allow the mending?

        If so a magically toggled switch would have a tonne of useful applications.
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    What is the smallest object you can mend? A marble? A thread? A cell? An atom?

    Can you mend melting ice? What implications does that have for the thermal energy of the water?

    If particulates from purified food/water are not transmuted, then where do they go? Are they annihilated? If so, you can experiment with creating vacuums. If they are moved out of the water, can you adapt that movement to generate usable power?

  MC instantly assimiliates the content of any book he touches. He understands the book only if he already understands the underlying prerequisite concepts in the book, but nothing stops him from working his way up any subject starting from the beginner books.

  What can he do with it, besides the mundane ability to enter and change professions fairly quickly?

    Make new discoveries.

    There are very probably techniques that become widely known in Narrow Field A which turn out very useful in Narrow Field B for some A and B - someone trained in A who then wanders into B can then apply this technique and find something new. Since your MC has been strolling through the library running his fingers along the spines of the books (or maybe not, that many in such rapid succession might overwhelm him) he's in a perfect position to apply such techniques repeatedly in many different fields, and gain a reputation as a scientific polymath.

    What counts as a book? Can he read a piece of paper at a touch? A file? A sealed letter? If so, he can spy on any company by accepting a job in a mailroom, or spy on virtually everybody in the area with limited success by taking a job as a courier or a postman.

    How does his power interact with an eBook reader?

      Thanks for the thought-out response. Cross-domain applications did occur to me later, I just have to make it believable (since I'm not a cross-domain super-intelligence myself), without coming off as overpowered invention-X.

      To clarify the other points:

      Only paper (words printed on cellulose based matter) count as books. Ebooks & online articles don't count. Arbitrary, I know, but I didn't want him rising to world-breaking levels too soon. There is a fatigue cost. While assimilation is instantaneous, he feels as fatigued as cramming a real book. Too many books and he can faint. So he can't assimilate the library in half-a-day. Maybe in a few weeks or months. Yes, he CAN use it spy on sealed or closed documents. I had vague ideas of the intelligence agencies trying to recruit such a character for his spying abilities/threat. A job in a mailroom or as a courier is an excellent plot point. I didn't think of THAT. Thanks! 

      EDIT: Come to think of it, the courier/spy idea has so much potential for social drama!!! He learns all the sad/dirty secrets of his neighbors with unanticipated emotional impact, as he feels compelled to help them with his new found "polymath" powers . Ooooh... I am thrilled.

        > Cross-domain applications did occur to me later, I just have to make it believable (since I'm not a cross-domain super-intelligence myself), without coming off as overpowered invention-X.

        Well, *most* cross-domain applications will start out as fairly esoteric and theoretical - he can write a paper on it, and maybe even figure out some of the application, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he can build a device to take advantage of it. The most likely result is that whenever he introduces himself to a scientist, the scientist will say something along the lines of "Oh, were you the one who wrote [paper in my field]? A most interesting read. Very innovative. You could go far as a [my field]ist. I see you've been dabbling in a few other fields too - if I may make the recommendation, you should probably drop the other fields and concentrate on [my field]."

        Any "Invention X" type inventions should preferably be introduced early, and either explicitly kick off the plot or be no more than a slight, incremental improvement over what's already possible.

        > Only paper (words printed on cellulose based matter) count as books.

        Okay, that's fair enough - ebooks and so on are significantly different in physical structure.

        New question - what happens if someone keeps poking him with new books while he sleeps? Can he be kept permanently unconscious in such a way? Can he consciously turn off his power, or can someone who knows of his power check for his disguised presence by asking everyone in the room to touch a two-metre-thick 'book' filled with random letters and seeing who faints?
        ```

        - u/VanPeer:
          ```
          Noted on the cross-domain plot ideas. Thanks.
          Yes, any 'deus ex machina' type plot kick-offs will be at the very beginning, just to give the MC his power. To answer other points, no he can't consciously turn off his power (That's a good plot idea for an antagonist to use, thanks). 

          EDIT: To clarify, random letters won't do anything. It must be meaningful but taxing content, such as text books on law or taxation or govt. regulations or even better (or worse from your POV) govt. regulations on tax law! Talk of cruel & unusual punishment.
          ```

          - u/CCC_037:
            ```
            Does it have to be *new* content? Can the MC immunise himself against a specific book by touching it once, and then he knows it? (For bonus points, after the antagonist uses government regulations on tax law to knock him out once, it would be fitting for the protagonist to get him investigated over some obscure tax law which had been in said book! And then, presumably, his other misdeeds come to light...)

  You are a maximally convincing writer. If you attempt to write a persuasive piece, what you'll end up writing are the words which would be most convincing to the most people who read English were each English reader presented with the words. This power doesn't allow you to persuade every person of everything, it just gives you the best shot, while not being tailored to any individual. It's also a bit hazardous: If you write an essay intending to convince someone else of something you don't actually believe, you might end up convincing yourself of that very something!

    Have a computer generate two large primes, have it show their product to you, and write a piece to convince that this number is not prime. Do I have to read the output while writing it, or can I close my eyes?

    - u/kuilin:
      ```
      The ability generates the set of words that would be most convincing to people in general, not the set of words that would be most theoretically convincing. I'd hazard a guess that most of the world would find more convincing the fact that you used a computer to generate those two primes than actually naming those primes, especially since it takes effort to multiply 'em.

    I wonder how this would interact with specialized domains. If one uses this power to write attempt for the statement "P!=NP" does it start with a maximally readable primer on computational complexity and the problem, or does it only attempt to convince people who understand the thesis?

    I imagine it would only be useful for simple domain problems in the former case because it would be easier to trick new learners with a flawed proof. However, in the former case you can use it as a way to generate maximally educational learning material.

  You have the ability to split the timeline in two, where at the moment of the divergence one timeline is considered prime and the other branching, and each version of you knows which is which.  The you in the prime timeline can create more branch timelines, and the you in the branch timeline can collapse the branch timeline.  This means there is one prime timeline and an arbitrary number of branch timelines, and none of you can know for certain how many branch timelines exist.  The prime you is not notified when a branch you collapses their timeline, and a branch you is not notified when a new branch is made.

  This lack of easy communication is because the only information that can be transferred between timelines is *emotional states*.  Any you in either type of timeline can sense the collective emotional state of every you (yourself included), and each you contributes to the collective.  The more intense an emotion, the greater an effect it has on the collective, so a sharp spike of fear in one you might make the collective emotional state feel like fear even if there are ten you's contributing.

  From a starting position of prime you and no branches, how do you most efficiently utilize your ability to gain knowledge and power in the prime timeline?  Keep in mind that the you's in branch timelines may be hesitant to collapse their timeline, and you have no way to force them to.
  ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Wait does collapsing a branch timeline just merge their consciousness back with the prime (presumably carrying back memories) or what? I mean if not then I can't imagine anyone who's not suicidal would ever have any branch collapses.

    Anyway if collapsing branches brings memories back to the prime then things are a hell of a lot easier, but if not then you will have to limit the number of branches to have any hope of communicating effectively over the background noise.                
    The best communication technique would be to just use series of emotion states as a particular code to send information, with messages being prefaced with the code of that branch (and nobody communicating while someone else is sending a message) the message would be repeated until the prime gave the understood signal.                            
    You would all collect a bunch of videos, pictures or even just thoughts that could easily be used to elicit particular emotional. Then you would deliberately evoke particular emotions in certain orders (if you're really good at quickly switching emotions then you could even encode meaning into the timing) to send something like really slow morse code (it would have more bits, but it would also take a while to send anything).

    If collapsing branch timelines means oblivion for those branch forks then you have to work out the communication system before you create any splits and your actions will be far more limited.

    If you can just collapse your branch without killing yourself then you can do all kinds of risky things in order to obtain information, then just collapse the timeline escaping any consequences and merging back with the prime. If not then you're limited by the fact that none of the branches will want to do anything too unpleasant or dangerous.
    ```

    - u/InfernoVulpix:
      ```
      Collapsing the branch timeline would not save the memories of the branch you, which leads to the inherent risk that if you create a branch timeline, even if you can decipher its messages, the you there may decide they don't want to die, making future communication blurry.

      The main way I see around that is convincing yourself that you don't get enough time to diverge meaningfully from the original, and thus collapsing your timeline isn't a 'death' even as it is a 'duty'.  That would allow you to do quick information-gathering splits without winding up with branch timelines you can't do anything about.
      ```

      - u/vakusdrake:
        ```
        > Collapsing the branch timeline would not save the memories of the branch you, which leads to the inherent risk that if you create a branch timeline, even if you can decipher its messages, the you there may decide they don't want to die, making future communication blurry.

        That seems like a bit of an understatement, I'd go further to say if you aren't suicidal there's zero chance of any branch you's collapsing their timeline.                                     
        The whole "if there's a copy close enough to the original in existence then it's not death" would only work if you (and thus the copy) was gullible enough to believe that. Since memories don't transfer it's blatantly obvious that your subjective experience ends when you destroy the timeline, and there's no distinct causal connection between forks when someone dies so whatever neural processes were generating _your_ experiences are just gone. Still even if you actually thought about it you might still be able to get things to work if you care more about whether some iteration of you fulfills your goals and didn't care about how that affects your personal anticipated future experience.                 
        Another issue with caring about other iterations of yourself as much as your own life, is that if there's a multiverse then there's infinite versions of your, so that logic dictates death means nothing. Plus it raises the question of why you should care more about these particular copies of you than all the others.                    

        Given available information it seems like honestly the best ways of using this are to create a small enough number of branches as to still be able to clearly pick out communication over noise, then have different iterations do different things. For instance once you diverge some versions of you are going to stumble upon interesting things which they will know the others will find entertaining or useful. You may split up studying somewhat and then transmit certain condensed versions of the info that will let you learn it faster than otherwise.                         
        Still the clunky communication method is a serious limitation, so you would probably want to figure out some method of training that will let you more easily switch emotions, and induce stronger emotions at will (because that means you can tolerate more noise, thus you can make more branches).

        Oh wait, holy shit I can't believe I totally missed the implications of this power.. jesus christ you can do so much more.

        Ok so first find some groups that give out prizes for demonstrations of supernatural abilities, then prove your abilities and become extremely rich and famous from being the only known person with powers.                     
        A demonstration that comes to mind is having the versions of the testers in both world use encryption methods (that could never be broken without computer assistance) to send messages back and forth through you, and further they could probably use that to send information that only the testers could know so they know you haven't just figured out some amazing codebreaking trick.                                          
        Once you do that then your abilities can actually be massively useful on a global scale, because they'd be so useful you can probably get some agency to make some kind of transcranial stimulation device in order to massively improve transmission. 

        Ok so here's some things you could help the world with:                                   

        * Policy experiments, both iterations of a government agree to try two or more different policies (or they do it by chance due to divergences between timelines) then they can compare the results and there will be no serious dispute over the results. 
        * Research, different timelines take turns conducting research, and share the results. This means all the timelines can get the effects of spending much more on research than any individual timeline does.                            
        * Prediction, due to random butterfly effect divergences different timeline will have different events occur, or happen at differing times. So if one timeline has a terrorist attack, architectural failure, etc then other timelines can potentially learn from that and act on it without having to experience a disaster themselves.                  
        * Existential risk aversion, different timelines would agree to slightly stagger certain decisions (or things would happen at different time just due to divergence) so if one timeline has a nuclear war others can potentially avert it. Same thing goes for bioweapons and all risks except GAI. With GAI the risk is no less because if the GAI figures out the existence of this communication (which it certainly would if it got any info about the world) then it can almost certainly hijak my mind and use that to get all other timelines to create it.                                         
        * Processing splitting, pretty similar to splitting research across timelines but different timelines split up computational work. This may not be of much use pre singularity, but it would be of massive use to a GAI friendly or not so it would probably alter your mind so the information bandwidth is increased arbitrarily. Then GAI can split up processing between a massive number of iterations of it.                          
        * Violate thermodynamics, it seems like with the right maxwell's demon style setup (using timelines that just split so they're similar enough for this to work, or it figures out how to transmit info on quantum states uncollapsed through the communication) you could get many timelines create many version of these type of setups. Then you can get the results (which let you extract energy) of many systems, while only spending the energy to get information about one particular system, thus violating the landauer limit.
        ```

        - u/InfernoVulpix:
          ```
          Wow, I have to admit that's a lot more uses than I expected for it, and without needing timeline collapsing to boot.  And here I thought I had curtailed information transfer into a blurry, clunky enough mess that this kind of thing wouldn't happen.
          ```

          - u/vakusdrake:
            ```
            Yeah once I stopped using the cached thoughts I would use for most CYOA's, I realized this is nearly exactly the same as a setting I made wherein you could open up portals to parallel worlds that would be exactly identical until they started diverging soon after opening the portal, except this is communication only and has a very crappy communication system.

            Still the things I had thought of in that setting, like splitting research costs work the same (though other things like having different worlds produce different TV shows and either airing both of them or having both timeline's air the one with better ratings doesn't work with this crude of transmission).                  

            Anyway you should expect tech to advance quicker with this power, and for the world to be better in a number of ways as a result of the things I mentioned in my answer.
