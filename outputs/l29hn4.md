## Does anyone have any The Good Place fix fic recommendations?

### Post:

It was a really great show right up until the last episode and a half. It has the potential for a good ending, and I'd like to see someone do a good job of it.

  The whole point of the ending is that immortality without freedom to choose (including choosing nonexistence) is a dystopia, just a candy-flavored one.  Nothing says that there aren't plenty of people who couldn't just keep going and never use the option.

    I feel like the Good Place being boring because they just give you everything was a legitimate problem, but suicide booths were not the solution.

    I think the solution would be to make sure you still have a challenge. Instead of Jason just seeing the monkeys riding go karts, he should have trained them himself and maybe even built the go karts. Sort of like how on the beginning of the last level he played a videogame an gave himself a challenge rather than just cheating his way through it.

      ```
      I think you’d still need the suicide booths, so to speak, after implementing that. Eternity is a long time. But that also requires accepting the premise that people will eventually get bored with anything in eternity, which isn’t a given.

      The easiest fix for the last season would be for heaven to not be broken in the first place, because there’s no real reason it should be. Building a better heaven is something the residents could have done at any point (or at least they should have been able to do so, I don’t actually remember exactly how that happened in the show).

        ```
        It’s always funny how the argument against immortality is boredom when the solution is to reduce or even eliminate boredom. It may take some serious brain-tweaking but we’re already assuming immortal people.
        ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      There are a finite number of arrangements matter can exist in within a given volume of space (however large that volume is, as long as it's finite), and therefore, there are a limited number of thoughts and experiences it is possible to have. I'm not one of those pro-death people or someone who thinks that eternal life would be some sort of curse, but I do think that, given eternity, folks will eventually have experienced everything. So unless you additionally have limited memory and can re-experience old things as new (which I think some people would also have a problem with), I think anyone would eventually get bored. You will eventually have read every book (and maybe even written every book), and explored every possible planet, and mastered every possible pursuit. While some people would probably be fine with this end state of affairs (I have no idea how I would react since I literally can't conceive of it), it isn't shocking to me that some people would not want it to continue and choose to leave. Given eternity, some people _will_ have trained the monkeys, and built the gokarts and mined the materials and coded the video game, and every other conveivalbe thing that you can do. Eternity is a long time, and the Good Place is purposefully (and appropriately) vague on how long they have been there before opting out.

        Maybe eventually everyone would get bored to death, but they were clearly not at that point. Jason hasn't even learned to cook.
        ```

          I mean, there is nothing that says that a particular person has to want to do literally every single thing that it's possible to do. Also, were you expecting them to show every character doing literally every thing? I think the general point of "I've lived a very long time in paradise, and I've done a bunch of stuff, and had a bunch of experiences, and now I'm done" is probably relatively close to what would happen. You personally would want to do more things than the characters did. That's totally reasonable. I'm just not sure what you want from the show. I think they handled it as well as it could possible be handled without having some kind of Narrator voice say "They all did all the possible things before they got bored". That was the first show I'd ever seen that even implied that it was possible to live for meaningfully longer amounts of time than the standard human life time and to not get bored. As far as rational takes on eternal life, this is by far one of the better ones from pop culture.

            I mean Tahani wants to do everything, so she still exists for now. We have a canonical example of a person who wants to do everything, and and almost gets there. I think OP would be that that person, but most people wouldn't be

          - u/JackStargazer:
            ```
            My main issue with the ending isn't that it didn't show them doing everything, it's that after presumably thousands of years their personalities have not changed at all, compared to how they rapidly changed in the earlier seasons.
            ```

            - u/AcceptableBook:
              ```
              I want to give a perhaps weak counter-argument. The people who enter the good place are supposed to be the 'ideal' versions of themselves, the main cast included, so it makes sense that they wouldn't change much. They've already had literal lifetimes to figure out who they were, it's likely that human conceptions of change don't apply to them
              ```

              - u/JackStargazer:
                ```
                But at the end, only Chidi remembers all 700+ lifetimes, the others only have their memories of the last goaround. While this argument might apply to Chidi, it can't to the rest of them.

                Also I'm pretty sure they got to 'cheat' the system by just getting into the good place without going through the trials intended to make you ideal, because fixing the system itself got them a + infinity score.
                ```

                - u/AcceptableBook:
                  ```
                  Doesn't Eleanor also end up remembering all of her timelines with Michael in the library? Or am I misremembering things?

                  In either case, they're "ideal" versions of themselves because they've given up all of the things that gave them angst. Eleanor made up with her mother, and was able to contextualize her actions. Tahani fixed her relationship to her sister. Jason came to an understanding with his dad, and was able to make sure Pillboi would stay on the straight and narrow for the rest of his life. 

                  This is not a very strong argument, and I realize that. They certainly could have had other reasons to change, and probably should have in some ways. I think that the primary reason they didn't have the characters change was because they didn't want them to seem unrelatable in the last few episodes of the story. I wish we got more of the Good place and the lives of the characters within it, despite knowing that it would very likely be boring and uninteresting.

                  That being said, I do think that the writers of the show had one very good reason for not changing the characters too much. I think that if they had, it might have gone against the message of the show. The show is a critique of Western philosophy, especially Western ideas of ethics. Western philosophers (at least the ones taught in my classes) tend to view being ethical as about being a certain type of person with certain capabilities. For example, Kant viewed ethical people as being the most rational, and his conditions for rationality were more strict than I think is appropriate. *The Good place* rejects this idea. This is why we see Chidi get dunked on so much in the show; he's a moral philosopher who gets sent to the Bad place for overthinking things. Instead, the show says that in order to be a good person, all you have to do is try to be good, and that you'll get there eventually. If the characters went to the good place and changed substantially, that might have sent the message that you can only be good if you act a certain way. For example, if Jason suddenly started liking reading books, then it might have sent the message that you have to be literate in order to be good, which is not the message the show wanted to send.

        *What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.'*

        Personally, I think I'm ok with experiencing the same pleasant things over and over again. In my life I've eaten thousands of avocados and enjoy each subsequent one all the same. But while I do like novelty I think I'm generally happy without e.g. I remember chatting to a friend in ugrad about a nearby trail, and she was all "ugh I've done that one SO MANY times, I don't want to go back there any more" and when prompted it turns out she'd hiked it 5-6x... meanwhile I'd probably done it 100+ lol. Also,

        *Personally, I've been hearing all my life about the Serious Philosophical Issues posed by life extension, and my attitude has always been that I'm willing to grapple with those issues for as many centuries as it takes.*

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

          I agree about that, but that’s because no realistic path exists yet to *that much* extension. A millennium wouldn’t be enough to bore me, I’m sure. 10^30 years? I... can’t really know for sure. I’d rather have the option.

        Given a finite but arbitrarily large amount of space, you can have infinite arrangements. (Ex. There is an infinite sequence of unique books where the first book is 1 page long, second is 2 pages long, third is 3 pages long... even though each book in the sequence has a finite amount of pages).

        Of course, that's not even getting into the fact that tgp doesn't even give a fork about the laws of physics.
        ```

        - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
          ```
          I don't think that's correct. I'm pretty sure that in a finite space, atoms can only be arranged a finite number of ways. I don't see how your book example disproves that. The point about the good place and physics is true, but at that point you can just argue whatever you want and say that the good place has special non physics laws that allow it.
          ```

          - u/jaspercb:
            ```
            Yes. Janets can completely rewrite physical laws, and have unbounded power through repeatedly rebooting them. The Good Place _can_ have whatever eternally-increasingly-interesting experiences it needs to contain.

            Why settle for slightly-better-earth when you can rewrite physics?
            ```

            - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
              ```
              I think the show made it pretty clear that the characters were not ok with being rebooted anymore, after having it forced on them for centuries. Also, for some definitions of personhood etc., being rebooted is no longer "eternal" life, it's just the same chunk of life being done over and over again. I'm not sure how being rebooted is that meaningfully different from choosing to end yourself. And while the show could have gone in that route (have Janet break physics/whatever to make eternal life so obviously good that no one would ever leave it), I'm not sure I would have preferred it. It would have stopped saying anything interesting or useful about the human condition, which was pretty much the entire point of the show. Additionally, if Janet _could_ do something like that, then why wouldn't the original heaven have gone that route. I think that the failure of heaven 1.0 pretty much demonstrates that Janet doesn't have the ability to just make humans love having the same experiences over and over again. The only real difference between heaven 1.0 and heaven 2.0 was an option to leave. 

              I'm sure some humans, given the choices you have presented, would take them. I also think some wouldn't. All I'm trying to push back against is the idea that the characters making the choice they made is somehow "non-rationalist". Living for millennia, doing a whole bunch of stuff, and deciding you aren't interested in doing more stuff doesn't seem to violate any kind of rational fiction guidelines that would require a "fix fic" the way that OP is suggesting.  As far as I can tell, most rationalists/transhumanists/whatever want to have the _option_ to live forever. They don't want to force people to actually do it. 

              If the show tried to make the argument that living for millennia/eternally was _bad_, then yeah, that wouldn't really fit the the ethos. But all they said was "give eternal life, but don't force people to stay in it". If there is no escape route, then it's just a more gilded hell. And, having made that message, from a Doylist perspective, they pretty much had to make the characters choose that option just to give the show closure.

  I thought about writing one a while ago. It was called The Good Place: Iteration 0, and it was about what Micheal and Shawn talk about while setting up the neighborhood for season one.
  ```

- u/SecondTriggerEvent:
  ```
  Fix: Human memories are finite, so by the time someone's experienced a good portion of everything they could possibly do, they'll have forgotten most of it.  


  I found it a bit baffling they didn't just give people the option to reset their memories after a while, given that was an established mechanic of the show.  


  That said, I feel like it was less of a critique of immortality and more a critique of peoples' idea of heaven. Being able to do anything with no conflict would be... lackluster. Though considering chronic boredom is a symptom of depression, I'm not not fond that people could read the show as "if you don't enjoy life, end it all".
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    I don't think memory resetting would have fit. The heaven they came up with was largely about people having as much time as they needed for personal growth. That meant different things for each character, but they all spent their eternities becoming more complete, developed versions of themselves. To erase their progress just for the sake of doing it over again, like a rat on a wheel, would defeat the purpose. (Plus, having a jeremy bearimy's worth of your memories wiped doesn't strike me as meaningfully different from that version of you dying.)
    ```

- u/--MCMC--:
  ```
  TBH, I think a fix-fic should probably start from the very first season, maybe with Chidi recognizing the problematic nature of condemning conscious entities to eternities of suffering after some piddlingly finite earthly trial, the outcome of which being largely baked in beforehand (with regards to the heritability of virtue, the socioeconomics conditions to which you're born driving your willingness to engage in various prosocial or antisocial behaviors, etc.). Instead, he seems to accept it whole cloth, instead of railing at the mind-bogglingly tremendous injustice and trying to hack Janet into manifesting an anti-reality bomb down there or descending with it himself, Comet King style.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    That was sort of the point in the show already, wasn't it? It's not like even Chidi started out as a paragon of moral consistency, even if we're >!initially misled to think he's one of the most morally good people of his era!<. They *all* started out taking the premise of their situation for granted, and they *all* >!ended up questioning and ultimately dismantling that system!< as they became wiser people, even addressing pretty much the exact >!flaws with the concept of ranking people by moral worth in the first place!< that you bring up. Wouldn't the fix fic you're describing just >!accelerate the outcome of the actual show!<?

    (Spoiler tags in case you haven't actually gotten to those parts. I had the same objections as you after watching the first season and before watching the others, so it's possible.)

    > with Chidi recognizing the problematic nature of condemning conscious entities to eternities of suffering after some piddlingly finite earthly trial, the outcome of which being largely baked in beforehand

    But that’s exactly the point the show ends up making. I agree Chidi, with his philosophical background, should already think that, but this is where the educational nature of the show kicks in - it’s designed to guide the viewer through the steps to that end, even if they’re used to the idea of a Christian afterlife and never questioned it.
