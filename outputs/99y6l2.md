## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I've been getting more into photography lately, having bought my first inexpensive (~$250) interchangeable lens camera last year (but then stopped with the photo-taking for a time, as demands on my schedule escalated). As of a month ago I've picked it up again on the weekends. Have shared on instagram, facebook, and reddit but typically don't get much feedback, so have been wondering what people think and where I can improve (never had exposure to anything remotely resembling formal training). :] It's been a nice, very low-investment avenue for artistic expression (I used to draw a fair bit -- much easier to snap a photo!) and I figure some of the shots might be neat to show grandkids or whatever half a century hence. I vaguely recall posting [this](https://imgur.com/a/SA96g) long album here a few years ago, taken exclusively with cell-phones and point-and-shoots, and so wonder as to the extent by which more recent photos differ (beyond the gratuitous shallow depth-of-field).

  Some example photos:

  **landscapes** (while hiking) being the most common:

  > e.g.

  > https://i.imgur.com/juVhllK.jpg (horseshoe bend, right off the freeway!)

  > https://i.imgur.com/cA9yeo1.jpg (briones regional park, a fun bay area hiking destination)

  > https://i.imgur.com/n2ieYXY.jpg (north table mtn, a good n. cali hike with tons of wildflowers, waterfalls, columnar basalts, must-see every spring; too bad automated pano stitching failed here)

  > https://i.imgur.com/3dLwPyI.jpg (redwood regional park, another fun bay area hiking spot)

  > https://i.imgur.com/lZkdkzl.jpg (early morning highway in Sedona, AZ)


  **macro**/close-up shots (also while hiking):

  > https://i.imgur.com/dXlRgQK.jpg (spider)

  > https://i.imgur.com/QHjDZmL.jpg (malva flower lit from behind)

  > https://i.imgur.com/Tf4WPfM.jpg (spiky caterpillar)

  some **portraiture**:

  > https://i.imgur.com/6xMK2GI.jpg (grandpa on a balloon ride in Sedona, AZ)

  > https://i.imgur.com/z1RFo6G.jpg (looking very judgmental)

  > https://i.imgur.com/IqQZFnJ.jpg (wife after getting her PhD 2w ago -- 4y, five 1Â° author pubs in a mayo clinic tissue engineering lab, now re-entering the world's #1 vet school! lol #proud)

  more abstract, artsy shots:

  > https://i.imgur.com/dE1U0om.jpg (power lines, I like juxtaposing clean artificial elements with more chaotic natural ones)

  > https://i.imgur.com/fejZFeO.jpg (fairy flowers)

  > https://i.imgur.com/wwaIwDA.jpg (tilt-shift valley)

  **animals**, but most often my dog:

  > https://i.imgur.com/CrID1IA.jpg (our dog bundled up on a chillier, wetter trail)

    These are really good. I think the first two are a bit underexposed, but they are all well done. The shot in the redwoods is absolutely fantastic, and I envy your ability to hike in such amazing locations. I'm not personally good enough to give detailed critiques, but these are all much better than "beginner with a nice camera". What lenses do you have for your camera?
    ```

    - u/phylogenik:
      ```
      Thanks! Yah, balancing exposure and saturation and stuff is tricky, since I'm using cheapo monitors that haven't been calibrated properly -- the same image looks quite different on each, so I usually drag it around while editing and eyeball some average of the three. Afterwards I'll pull it up on my iPhone (afaik it has a really nice screen that apple's taken pains to calibrate well by default?) and usually it looks good enough that I don't bother going back to make more touchups. I'll keep the underexposure point in mind!

      Hiking accessibility played a big role in deciding where I should go for grad school lol! So many cool spots within 2-hours' drive (granite cliffs and alpine lakes, oceans and big herds of tule elk, giant redwoods, etc.). And family lives in AZ, so I visit there yearly too.

      Lenses currently in my possession are the SELP1650 and SEL55210 kits, the SEL50F18 nifty fifty (i.e. 75 mm equivalent, with the 1.5x crop sensor), a Rokinon 12mm F2.0, and a SEL18200. The last one is the most recent -- picked it up last month for $130 -- and was bought because I was getting tired of swapping out lenses in the field (specifically, I've dropped lenses a few times while scrambling to change them. I try to limit photography-related delays to at most 15-30 minutes per 8h dayhiking trip in consideration of my sometimes bored-while-waiting-for-me partner, so everything is taken while moving lol). Has served me well so far! Otherwise I probably use the 12mm the most, since it's the widest.

    Do you have any more highway pictures? That's a beautiful highway and, um, I like looking at roads.

    Also, I love your iggy. I love them in general, they are such tiny greyhounds and it just tickles me!

  - u/PM_ME_YOUR__RAM:
    ```
    I think they're pretty good! You should take a look at photoshops camera raw filters. A bit of fine-tuning on the lighting/contrasts of these images could put them on yet another level.

    (Don't know if there's a similar function in GIMP, sorry)

  I've been interested in learning how to write horror scenes. Horror in a textual medium is a very fascinating topic since so much of horror in other mediums is strengthened by jump-scares, creeping sounds of dread, spooky atmosphere, mounting tension watching someone approach an obvious trap, and other aspects which rely on a visual and auditory medium.

  However with text, the burden of horrifying the reader must be placed more on the intellectual aspects. For example, *Carrie* by Stephen King was an amazing horror novel due to how it starkly displayed the heated outcome of psychological abuse. The horror was derived from the more mundane actions in the story rather than Carrie's paranormal powers.

  The summary of my long-winded post to ask what subject matters or themes would you be curious to read about in a horror story with paranormal aspects with a rational protagonist?

  I'm just getting a feel for what you guys would be interested in reading about since you are the type of audience I would like to write for. ;D

  Soooo....I have the first chapter in a quest I'm writing and planning out. I'm not actually ready to post the quest to SpaceBattles or SufficientVelocity yet, but I'm approaching a point where I want to get other people to take a look at what I've written and to act as a beta for me.

  I'm not actually asking for a beta/editor, but I'm wondering how do other people here get others to proof-read their works? I'm curious about what other writers of (hopefully) rational fiction do when it comes to the editing phase in general and if there's anything I should be aware of.

  I use the "puppy reinforcement" anki extension, which will semi-randomly show me images from a folder on my computer during anki reviews as a method of motivation. I find it really helps, but I also am an anki beast (I do 300 reviews a day when I'm behaving myself), so I need lots of images. I tend to batch download them from some subreddits or from instagram accounts (they don't need to be high resolution). 

  phylogenik's post with his hiking photos got me thinking: does anyone have recommendations? At the moment I have cute animal pictures (animations don't work) and some travel pictures/etc from a variety of subs and instagrams, but I'm happy for pretty much anything - some cool technology or space pictures might be good, for example. Not interested in food pictures but apart from that all good. Also, I have a special soft spot for infrastructure, especially cool highways / roundabouts.

  So, who can recommend sources such as:

  - Instagrams
  - Subreddits
  - A personal collection of wallpaper files you've been amassing since 2007 and are happy to put into a zip / imgur gallery and link me to?

  **tl;dr: looking for instagrams or subreddits with aesthetically pleasing or otherwise interesting images**
  ```

  - u/waylandertheslayer:
    ```
    I like the various artwork compilation subreddits that have fantasy themes, like /r/imaginarylandscapes (there's also [a multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/One_Giant_Nostril/m/imaginarynetwork/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=ImaginaryLandscapes&utm_content=t5_2sf9b) that you could download from potentially).
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      That multireddit looks awesome! Thank you so much! Time to sort by top from all time and scroll for an unreasonably long time so I can make a huge collection.
      ```

      - u/waylandertheslayer:
        ```
        Glad you like it! I remembered the multireddit as being larger, and just figured out why - there's a lot of smaller imaginary____ subreddits that aren't included, but *are* in [this one](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lol33ta/m/imaginarylandscapes/) - it has 41 subreddits in it total. If you run out, you can check through there (and some of the subreddits are pretty specific - /r/imaginarypirates for example).

          I just downloaded 1200 images from the one you gave me so I think I'll be relatively good :)

  i suspect everyone here is familiar with D&D. and how strange that system can get when you start to break down the magic system into what the rules technically allow you to do (anytime people do this, the rules change in response to fix the problem). 

  so, lets look at Pathfinder. this game is full of holes, because its based on the old 3.5 edition. it contains such fun things as: a level 20 wizard can be Immortal, can gain a feat to ignore component costs up to 100gp(with a gold holy symbol), and can make all kinds of magic items with the free feats the class gives. the wizard can also invest in businesses (with complete campaign), and use simulacrium to make copies of himself to help. technically, one wizard can live forever and slowly change the world. he can even live on his own demiplane that he created. 

  so my question to you: how do you break the game with a simple and obvious combination of spells? it does vary by edition. for example, false focus and continual flame would let a wizard make a 110gp item for every 2nd level+ spell slot every day, for no cost, then sell for half price (55gp). whereas in 3.0 D&D, summon monster at a sufficient level to summon 1 or more djin makes a stupid amount of money from asking for organic material (such as spices- saffron is basically worth its weight in gold), and wine, both of which are pemanent, as well as using gold to create walls of iron (a net gain in value if you want more iron), then cast fabricate to break bulk materials into useful shapes for crafters. 

  the problem does tend to get worse as new books are added, but many times can exist even in core as nobody actually sat down with enough of the potential problems to think about how they work together in the world.

    >  how do you break the game with a simple and obvious combination of spells? 

    There are many huge problems in 3/3.5 that occur with high level spells; almost all playtesting was focused on lower levels, as I understand it, so the game has a lot of difficulties with high level play. However, there also some poorly written or thought out things from lower levels too.

    Here are some examples from 3/3.5; a lot of the various writeups are borrowed from FrankTrollman's descriptions of these rules holes.

    - **Free Vacation To The Negative Energy Plane, No Save**: Travel to any plane with your party with appropriate protections, then cast *Gate* to summon the campaign's Big Bad Evil Guy enemy and force him to cast buff spells on you for 20 rounds while your entire party all whales on him for the duration. Gate allows no saves or resistance for almost all potential foes (gods and unique beings are exempt - and "unique beings" includes basically the Tarrasque and very few other foes). Basically, if Evil Necromancer Karl is theoretically menacing your campaign world, he will instantly die with no way to fight back meaningfully. 

    - **Balor Mining:** In 3.0 D&D, at least part of the reason that (Su) supernatural abilities were chosen was so that they wouldn't be granted by Shapechange because they would be broken if grafted onto PC characters. In 3.5, Shapechange now gives Su abilities for no reason, and the exploits are everywhere. When you Shapechange into a Balor, you *gain it's (Su) ability to be carrying a +1 Vorpal Longsword.* So you Shapechange into a Balor and get a +1 Vorpal Longsword, drop the +1 Vorpal Longsword on the ground, spend a Free Action flipping off the Wealth By Level guidelines, and Shapechange into ... another Balor, holding another +1 Vorpal Longsword. 

    - **Wishing For More Wishes**. Wishes can make or improve magic items, with an attached XP cost. You can wish for items that have exceptionally huge XP costs, and not actually pay for any of those XP costs because the original wish is, for example, a spell-like ability (off an Efreeti or the like). These wishes are on the list of explicit wishes the DM is told not to dick you with, so ... the whole Wish paradigm is broken. There are various ways to exploit Wish, the simplest involves getting to a (Sp) wish for a magic item that casts infinite Wishes. Even if your DM is as dickish  as possible with wishes, there are a few ways to get Wish (Sp/Su) on your own character sheet, such as the Ur Priest PRC from Complete Divine.

    Of course, there are also broken magic items.

    - **Candle of Invocation.** I already mentioned one of the ways Gate was totally broken, right? Here's a way to cast Gate for <10k GP - which is of course broken as fuck. Also, an exceptionally literal reading of the rules might allow you to Use Magic Device to prepare spells as a nonspellcaster, which is even worse. There is no reason for this item to exist. 

    - **Dust of Sneezing and Choking.** Stunning for 5d4 rounds with no save or resistance of anything is pretty absurd, not a lot of enemies can win a fight that starts with 12 rounds of them not being allowed to fight back.

    There are even some broken monsters

    - **The Shadow** Shadows are CR3 incorporeal monsters who turn humanoids they kill with their strength drain into a shadow under the control of the original shadow. You can make a shadow under your control kill some peasants and then it's off to the races as your shadow army grows exponentially to wipe out the entire kingdom in a couple days, and all life on the globe not long thereafter. It's like a zombie plague except you can't fight back without magic weapons and they go through barricades and fly and have better senses than you and turn people in at most 24 seconds from death. 

    Of course, they published dozens and dozens of books with hundreds of cumulative spells, monsters, and items in them, many poorly written and thought out. For example, Frostburn:

    - **Ice Assassin Duplication**: You can make an Ice Assassin copy of a creature with all it's abilities under your complete control. If you make a copy of a creature that can *itself* make an Ice Assassin, things get pretty crazy pretty fast.

    - **Shivering Touch**. The power level of enemy creatures is *in no way* correlated with random numbers from their stat line. 3d6 dex damage is enough to kill pretty much all dragons instantly fairly reliably; maximized or empowered, the number of things that survive shrinks rapidly. It's sort of crazy, though due to tactical considerations less so than a lot of the other crazy in this list.
    ```

    5e is pretty good with it.  You can use the trait of a Hag (+2 CR when part of a coven) in combination with chained permanent True Polymorph casts to boost something from CR 2 to CR 7 (or CR 9 with Volo's Guide to Monsters).  This works with Find Greater Steed if you want a more powerful "mount".

    Summoning some Chwinga to get their charms or else Pixies to polymorph you is normal-tier broken.  

    Using Wish to bypass casting time is also normal-tier broken, with a Wished Planar Binding requiring that you keep the creature in range for 1 round instead of 1 hour.  It also works well with Forbiddance, Hallow, etc.

    Glyph of Warding can hold buffs and bypass spells-per-day, casting time,  and concentration for 200 gp and a same-level spell slot.  Forbiddance, Guards and Wards, Hallow, or Druid Grove are good choices once you have enough spell slots.

    There's nothing preventing a Simulacrum from casting Simulacrum, even by Wish, so you can create a chain of 10 duplicates per minute (that each have everything except their 9th level spell slot).  Alternatively, you could have one spend its Wish on getting 25k GP of components, then a bunch making Simulacrua the normal, 12-hour way, and have thirteen of them spend their Wish on granting your party permanent resistance to one damage type each.

    A Zealot Barbarian can survive any amount of normal damage once it reaches lvl 20.

    EDIT:

    True Polymorph (or convince it to shapechange) something powerful into a humanoid, then Magic Jar yourself into it.  Cancel/dispel the transformation, and enjoy your new, more powerful body with all of your class abilities intact.
