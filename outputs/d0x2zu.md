## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  -Blackout Invisibility is a spell which warps light around the caster, making them invisible but also preventing light from reaching them.

  -Nerveskip is a spell which accelerates the transmission of signals down nerves to the point that it is practically instantaneous; casters of this spell still have a reaction time, but that comes from processing in the brain and not transmission time of sensory or motor nerves. The spell does not affect the brain (if it did it would cause seizures.) The effect is overwhelming at first but casters acclimate to it quickly.

  -Blinkstep boots are a magical artifact which teleports the user with each stride, in the direction of the stride, to a distance roughly three times as far away as the length of the stride. The effect can be toggled on and off.

  -an Oobleck Cloak is an alchemically-enhanced cloak whose lining is filled with a layer of impossibly non-newtonion (shear thickening) fluid. The cloth acts like heavy but normal cloth under most conditions but hardens in response to stress, similar to modern liquid ballistic vests, but better.

  -Oobleck Blood is a spell which applies a similar effect to the caster's blood. I've not yet worked out the math to a point where I'm confident that this wouldn't kill the caster, so if someone well-versed in fluid dynamics has an answer, that would be great.

  How could these spells and items be abused or countered?

    Blackout Invisibility can be prevented by casting a spell that causes the invisible person to glow. Ideally, they will glow in a distinct color of light. Warping light that would hit the caster doesn't do anything if the light is emitted from the caster. You may also be able to use the caster as a lightweight but imperfect analogue to a black hole's gravitational lensing.

    Blinkstep Boots could be countered with glue. Depending on whether you count a "stride" as two full steps, fetters would also work by preventing full steps. Also, if it's teleportation, since they can walk through walls, make sure the walls are more than three times the length of the stride of the person with the longest legs. Four times if you're pessimistic, and six times if you're an Evil Overlord.

    Nervestep might be countered by forcing an opponent using it to rely on muscle memory rather than conscious motions; trained motions would go awry if executed entirely within the peripheral nervous system at accelerated speeds, since the mucles would not respond at speed.

    An Oobleck Cloak is susceptible to sustained loud noise at a frequency that helps keep its particles suspended.

    Oobleck Blood would likely kill the caster on their next heartbeat.
    ```

      >Blinkstep Boots

      A cheaper solution is to simply have large numbers of thin wooden or metal rods behind your main wall, and then a secondary wall in the back to cover the rods. Then you don't need to actually build a 16-foot-thick wall for security.
      ```

      - u/Nickoalas:

        Or a moat. Classic defense
        ```

  - u/RedSheepCole:
    ```
    I'm sorry, but I really can't see how the blood one would be helpful.  I don't know enough to say all the different ways it would jack you up, but you're essentially giving the caster a giant, transient embolism for defensive purposes whenever he gets hit.  An impact anywhere near the lungs would have alveoli going off like popcorn; an otherwise glancing blow to the head becomes brain damage.  Assuming the ordinary jostle and stress of blood flow doesn't set it off; like boomfarmer said, the heart thumps.

    What if you cast a spell to convert a thin layer of air around you into a sheer-thickening fluid of sorts?  That would be a closer mimic to the cloak.
    ```

    >Blackout Invisibility

    Countered with [FLIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward-looking_infrared) and thermal NVGs. Your body releases heat both through convection and thermal infrared radiation, so unless this spell also happens to roast you, that heat will have to go somewhere outside of your bubble.

    "Abused" with echolocation, an inertial navigation device with integrated map and compass, or a thin wire and small camera to poke out of the area of effect. I say "abused" because these, at best, only let you do things you could normally do. The ability itself inherently already has a variety of uses that could be considered abuse.

    >Nerveskip

    No counter. In regards to "abuse" could conceivably cure myasthenia gravis and a wide range of neuromuscular disorders.

    >Blinkstep boots

    Could potentially be abused if any other ability allows increasing stride length, like some kind of shapeshifting ability. See boomfarmer and my response him for counters.

    >Oobleck Cloak

    Countered with pepper spray and other chemical weapons, flamethrowers, and other energy weapons like [LRAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Acoustic_Device) and lasers, as well as slow-moving attacks like melee weapons. Or just aiming for areas that aren't covered.

    Could be abused by having someone with this covering their whole body using blackout invisibility and standing in front of you. Then apparently exposed areas might not actually be exposed.

    >Oobleck Blood

    Why? Just because the blood hardens doesn't mean you're safe. All the force being applied to that patch of blood just gets transmitted to the tissue behind the point of impact. One blunt impact and suddenly you've shredded a ton of blood vessels and you're bleeding to death. Is this a debuff that we're trying to avoid getting cast upon us?
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    \- Blackout invisibility could have all kinds of fun uses in laser puzzles.  I feel like Glitterdust would still be a great way of a countering it through tracks and other evidence of movement.

    \- Could you haste someone with neverskip to either make the initial reaction more punitive or to get a multiplicative effect?

    \- Couldn't you use a bunch of small, quick blows to repeatedly slow blood flow  and then give the caster a heart attack.

    \- Vampire bite resistance?
    ```

  - u/CrystalValues:

    Blackout invisibility would work as radiation shielding, correct, not just humanly visible light?

    If so, there are some obvious applications. You would be immune to radiation while it was active.

    If not, then you could wear UV goggles to see and any animals or people equipped to see outside the conventional human visible spectrum would be able to see you.

    Edit: UV, infrared, x-rays. and basically everything else would be able to see you.
    ```

    - u/Solonarv:
      ```
      Not all radiation is light; alpha and beta radiation consists of helium nuclei and free electrons, which would not be stopped by the spell. However, they are easily stopped by air or skin, so they are not too dangerous. The real danger in irradiated areas is ingesting or inhaling radioisotopes, because once they are in your body there is no shielding to save you. The cloak doesn't stop that either.
      ```

      - u/CrystalValues:
        ```
        Good to know, thank you!
        ```

- u/CrystalValues:

  You can extract carbon out of the atmosphere (CO2) and cause it to grow into carbon nanotubes like Vantablack. The furthest from your body this effect can be achieved is 10 feet. Happy munchkining.
  ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    How quickly? For example, could all of the CO2 in the 10 ft. radius be instantly converted into carbon nanotubes?
    ```

  - u/RedSheepCole:
    ```
    Do you wind up with leftover oxygen?  CO2 is very small percentage of the atmosphere, so the effect would not be dramatic either way.  The main use I see right now is assassination; anybody within ten feet gets a lot of black dust in his lungs, assuming you can do this quickly.  Suspect it would be a fairly nasty and protracted kind of death, and highly resistant to treatment.  Would they go anaphylactic, I wonder, or just shred the small airways?
    ```

    - u/CrystalValues:
      ```
      The oxygen would be left over.
      ```

      - u/RedSheepCole:
        ```
        Hm.  The difficulty is that the atmosphere's around 1% CO2, which isn't a lot to play with.  Given time and sufficient fine control, you could probably build structures out of it, and have an infinite supply of custom tools.  You could disrupt electronics by growing things inside them, which has its uses.  Don't know enough about their properties, or engineering, to say much about those applications.

        In the absence of a Manton limit, the easiest application of any telekinetic-type power is going to be stealthy murder, humans being so easy to kill.

        EDIT: you could probably get fine control over fires/burning, with some practice, by rapidly replenishing their oxygen supply.
        ```

        - u/CrystalValues:
          ```
          You could buy dry ice for more CO2.
          ```

          - u/RedSheepCole:
            ```
            It belatedly occurred to me that your exhalations have a substantially higher volume of CO2, even if the overall atmospheric percentage is much lower.  This means you could, if you chose, build small objects inside your mouth, stick out your tongue, and tah-dah!  By exhaling through your nose instead, you could make your nose hair appear to grow quite dramatically as well.  Fun party tricks.

            You could also, at the rates specified, blow a steady stream of black powder out of your mouth more or less indefinitely.  Since that's basically powdered graphite, you could make anything slick that way--not sure if powdered graphite contains oil too, but the powder itself no doubt has applications.
            ```
