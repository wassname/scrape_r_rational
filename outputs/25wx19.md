  Well. That was incredibly depressing.

    Yeah really.

  It was an interesting decision to left the motivations of the angels and God completely unexplained. Was the God just a bored kid playing with ants, similar to how people torture sims in The Sims games or was there some ulterior plan? Was he just a self-obsessed tyrant who wanted complete devotion for its own sake like the dictators of our world? Or was he seeking some kind of artistic beauty and harmony? It's obvious that he still paid attention to people, making all those decisions.

    I believe Chiang intentionally presented God as he is depicted in the Bible and similar monotheist works: inscrutable, all-powerful, beyond any human comprehensions of good or evil.  Then he set out to explore the *actual consequences* of that idea, same as any SF writer does.
    ```

      Yeah, this is probably what he did. It's still interesting to think what might  be God's possible motivations.

  ```
  That was exceptional, one of the clearest depictions of why I am morally affronted by the unwavering conviction and manipulativeness of the divine and how they can strip people of their most human qualities if they alone are allowed to consume us.  I love it.  Another masterful work by Mr. Chiang.
