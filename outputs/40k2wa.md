    > Teleportation. Yes, and absorption.

    Your "leaving" body disappears into nothing, leaving a vacuum.  Your "arriving" body is transmuted from the nearest bodyweight-worth of matter, meaning that you arrive in a spherical vacuum, and are instantly hit by the in-rushing air.  You need a protective suit and precise targeting to avoid killing people or injuring yourself whenever you teleport.

    >Illusions. Yes, but isolation.

    Interacting with any person negates your illusion powers, for a length of time dependent on how meaningful the interaction was.  Handing a cashier payment will depower you for minutes, a job interview will depower you for hours,  and going on a date will depower you for days.

    > Cloning. Yes, but crowds.

    You can be at most 1/10 of a crowd.  If it is you plus 17 other people, you can't clone yourself at all (because 2/19 > 1/10).  If there are 18-26 people, you can create one clone of yourself (2/20 to 2/28 <= 1/10).  If you are in a crowd of 9999 other people, you can make 1110 clones (1111/11110 = 1/10)

    >Precognition. Yes, and fear.

    This would be a granted power instead of a personal one.  When you touch someone, you *automatically* give them a precognitive vision of the next disaster that would befall them (if their actions wouldn't have been altered).  In addition to granting the vision, you *can* also give them a more-or-less specific phobia of that thing.  Someone would be trapped in a collapsed building in a few years? Bam, claustrophobic.  Someone would be bit by a black widow in a few months?  Bam, arachnophobic.

      Sounds like the sort of superpower a social recluse would get, if it's powered by their wish to hide themselves.

    > Teleportation. Yes, and absorption.

    This might actually be a cool answer to the question of what happens when you try to teleport into an object. Instead of just not being able to, or having [other complications](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Am7oKBD3PU), you absorb the intersecting material for use as ... ammunition? Slowly degrading armor? Something like that?
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      So you get armor/ammo by telefragging ?
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Yeah. Telematt (that's his name) starts every fight by teleporting down into the ground and absorbing stone in order to give himself a shell of armor. Or he teleports into the support beams of whatever structure he's in so that he can bring it to the ground. Or uses the absorbed matter in order to throw up a shield if he can't teleport. I don't know, there's a lot to work with. When he's done with a battle, the area around him looks like Swiss cheese.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          Why not just teleport into his opponent?
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            Some equivalent to the Manton effect. Though I've always hated that Worm's answer was just "this was intentionally nerfed" because it seems like a bad cop-out. Right now I'm thinking some kind of [ki-based magic](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KiManipulation?from=Main.KiAttacks) which would place more natural limits; if teleportation is the result of ki manipulation, then the reason you can't teleport into someone is that at a mechanical level you're fighting against their [Battle Aura](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleAura).

            (I'm not really opposed to just answering "why not just" with "no reason, go right ahead" and creating a horrifically deadly villain, but it's probably not a power I'd give to a hero and the story would have to be structured right for it.)

              You're right that the Manton Effect is a cop-out, but it's also necessary.  Without it, nearly *every* power is an instant kill.  TK?  Forget hitting them with boulders, just squish their brain.  Making hands grow out of things?  Make a hand grow out of the inside of their lungs.  Making duplicates of yourself?  Make one inside your opponent.  [Summoning puppies?](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=499) Well...you get the idea.

                It's not that I mind the Manton Effect *itself*, I just wish that it were some emergent property of the system rather than boiling down to author fiat (or author fiat by proxy).

                  In the Change Storms series I said that powers could affect normals just fine, but could not directly affect supers, because [very minor spoiler that isn't really a spoiler if you paid attention](#s " you get powers when a small piece of a Change Storm gets stuck inside you.  Power consist of channeling your internal Change Storm's probability radiation to achieve a specific effect.  Within its immediate area, a Storm fragment will 'scramble the signal' so that it does nothing.")

      Perhaps instead, when they teleport they absorb anything they've touched into their body, a little like The Fly. The first time they teleported they appeared naked as they had absorbed their clothes and now their skin was cloth-like, their feet rubber and leather.

      They end up this patchwork, composite figure; their body a mosaic of different textures and materials. They can't carry equipment as guns and melee weapons are absorbed into them. If this were Worm, they'd look a little like Weld; definitely a case 53. If they don't jump then the soles of their feet absorb the material they were standing on, leaving rough footprint shapes behind. The absorption also grants a limited regeneration effect as the new material is used to replace the damaged skin.

      They've never teleported with a person; they don't dare. Being grappled terrifies them, so they teleport rapidly and fight with hit and run attacks. The lack of ranged attacks frustrates them but their mild 'shaker' ability to damage terrain allows them to take advantage of their surroundings: absorbing parts of objects so that they fall, weakening floors, damaging sensitive equipment.

      A powerful, flexible teleport and a durable, strong body; yet massively cursed too. Fun :)

    > What if your precognition worked pretty well until about 38 years out, when everything just turned black?

    I've seen entire series based on exactly this. Whether the precogs are mutants, psychics, or magic, there's nothing like an inexorably-approaching wall, precipice, or breakpoint to add some tension to a slow-ish plot. Sometimes it's an actual problem that needs addressing, and sometimes it's merely The Monster At The End Of This Book. It can also be a reason for a hero/villain team-up.

    Can Teleport self, but only to an area occupied by another human being. They are absorbed, destroying their body. Their consciousness lives through you for 24 hours.

  These are the powers in the generator:

  > Telekinesis, Water manipulation, Fire manipulation, Earth manipulation, Air manipulation, Telekinesis, Teleportation, Super speed, Super strength, Emotional manipulation, Cloning, Precognition, Clairvoyance, Lasers, Invisibility, Shapeshifting, Flight, Electric manipulation, Telepathy, Regeneration, Healing, Memory manipulation, Time travel, Illusions, Animal control, Portals, Probability manipulation, Shields, Plant manipulation, Sound manipulation, Summoning, Knowledge, Gravity manipulation, Meta powers

  These are the modifiers:

  > time, absorption, movement, charging, heat, happiness, fear, metabolism, theft, repetition, isolation, crowds, mass, velocity, feedback, equivalence, age, range, duration, insanity, memory, pain, self, Thursday

  If you have any that really need to be added, split apart, or removed, let me know. I don't have any interest in making the generator more robust in terms of the simple javascript it uses, but adding things to an array is quick and easy. (I'll probably be raiding the Mutants and Masterminds source book to figure out which obvious things I'm missing.)

  Edit: Added some more.

      Added those (or variants on them). I enjoy the wackiness of Thursday, though I have a feeling that during character generation I'm going to see it too often and drop it. I did add it though. In a world where every character is generated using this generator, there are going to be a whole class of Thursday-based hero and villains.

      Edit: Just got this one:

      > Time travel. Yes, but Thursday.

      I really like that this suggests a whole story all by itself. There's a man who can time travel, but not on (or to) Thursdays. So naturally he waits for every Thursday with a certain sense of dread, knowing that's the one day that he's helpless. And naturally Thursday is always when things go to pot.

        I feel like this would be something that happened to Harry Dresden.

      - u/technoninja1:
        ```
        I'm pretty sure there already is a story about this. I think its referenced in HPMOR, when Harry asks if breaking the time turner will result in getting trapped in an endless loop of Thursdays.
        ```

      - u/The_Magus_199:

        And so we learn the *real* origin of the phrase, "could never get the hang of Thursdays."

    I don't know about your JavaScript thingy, but your list here on reddit has "Telekinesis" twice.

  Benefits of consecutive yes-ands probably level off after the first thousand or so.

  As someone who has done a bit of improv, the best use of "yes, and" I know is for when multiple people have cool ideas that they really want to use, and rather than fighting for whose cool ideas get used, everyone takes the coolest bits of their ideas and yes-ands them together. "Yes, we're going shopping for guns with silly names, and also you have this giant booger hanging out of your nose and I'm trying to be painfully polite about it." This is only a tiny slice of ways to combine concepts, and also only a tiny slice of grammatical uses of "yes, and."

  The "I asked you for cough syrup and you came back with a zebra?" line is another good use of saying yes, where the speaker is riffing off the person with the zebra. They didn't come in with the cool idea of needing some cough syrup, it just seemed like a funny place the story could go. This is not yes-and as combining ideas of different origins, it's yes-and as generating apposite ideas to continue what others have started.

  One can try to apply these to superpowers. The first "yes, and" would be more like how Sanderson smushed a couple of different ideas for magic systems into Mistborn, or how one might build superheroes with multiple gimmicks out of a bucket of individual gimmicks that you think are cool. "Yes, our protagonist rides a zebra (riding a zebra = cool), and they also can make the zebra they ride super big and strong (making things big and strong = cool), and the zebra can breathe fire (breathing fire = cool)." The second "yes, and" would be calling on your creativity to fill in what creates character, or conflict, or comedy, in concordance with the current creation. "We need someone to be super-strong. Yes, so how about they can only use their super-strength while wearing elegant clothing, and if the clothing gets ruined they lose their powers? Yes, and let's make them totally messy when off the clock."

  The prompts from your generator generate results that look more like the results of the second process, because the first part of the prompt is usually cool, and the second part is usually dramatic. But the skills exercised are sort of a mish-mash. If it turns out well, I'm more inclined to attribute it to using yes-and skills *on* the prompt, rather than putting "yes, and" *in* the prompt.

  > Probabilty manipulation. Yes, and isolation.

   Control over fate increases as a function of how dissociated from the world one is. The less you care about something, the more you can influence it. 


  >Lasers. Yes, and equivalence.

   Radiation emited = radiation accepted; no storage, too much energy expenditure will literally cause all photon-mediated bonds in user to cease. Buuuuut, if you can shine 27 gigawatts of light on them, they can repurpose that energy in any arbitrarily complex pattern you can describe to them. This power isn't about arbitrary amounts of output, it's about arbitrary control of output.

  >Time travel. Yes, but time.

  ... Hm. I could put a low-effort joke about the generator and drug use here, but instead, how about this.

  Power to travel in any arbitrary temporal direction. Inability to do so automatically. Subject to the contraint of non-replacement - the user's conciousness travels, not their body. So, the user still experiences time flowing, but for them to flow though time, they must remember to swim. If they stop concentrating on moving from one second to the next, they won't. If they don't focus on keeping the pace steady, it will slow down or speed up. If they want a certain outcome, they might just subconciously travel towards it. They are everywhere they are, and everywhen they live. As a consequence of that sovereigntity, everyone and everything else is dead. The limits of who those other people can become is no longer what they strive for; merely the time traveller's creativity. The world is a pattern that can - will - one day be fully extrapolated, and once explored, it will offer nothing more.

  Only a series of blind alleys and deaths leading to a time when the world is alive once more, and only - *only* - because down those paths, the time traveller is dead, and therefore cannot observe it.

  For your "precognition, but happiness" power, there's more horror if it only works when the precognitive is at least a minimum level of happy. The result is that a somewhat rational and self-sacrificing character tortures themselves finding ways to be happy about learning the horrible events to come so their side can win.
  ```

    Or you get Shinji Ikari, who's _never_ happy because he lives in Neon Genesis Evangelion and the increasingly rare spurts of precognitive happiness just result in visions of the horrible future.

  This has made for some fun characters next time my gaming group feel up for a super heroes game.  
  :  
  **Head Trip - Emotional Manipulation, and movement**  
  You can generate bursts of emotion in others, the intensity of these bursts increases based on the difference in relative speed between you. If both of you are standing still it's barely noticable, if you're traveling at high speed relative to them it's hugely powerful.  
  **Press Gang - Summoning, but crowds**  
  When in physical contact with someone you can use your power to cause them to trade places with one of your minions, these minions take the form of burly humanoid figures loyal only to you. The target of your power remains suspended unhurt in a pocket dimension until such time as you choose to dismiss your minion or said minion is destroyed. The target returns to the same location and in the same physical state it left in.  
  **Tag Along - Telekinesis, but velocity**  
  You have telekinetic control over yourself and one object, you can only move yourself when also moving your target object and you cannot move the two individually.  
  **Stonefish - Earth manipulation and metabolism**  
  Your geokinesis lets you raise walls of earth, launch stone spikes and swim through stone, your biology is uniquely adapted to this and indeed rather than food your body needs stone for nourishment.  
  **Dwarf Star - regeneration but mass**  
  You can regenerate from any wound, literally anything up to and including decapitation and anti tank rounds to the face. Problem is you don’t have access to wolverine’s meat dimension, most cuts or abrasions don’t cost much but a big wound will trim a few inches off your height.  
  **Bug Zapper - electric manipulation but isolation**  
  You have an always on electrical charge running through your body, you can vary the intensity up to lethal levels and with a push extend the range up to ten feet however you can never lower the intensity on contact below the level of discomfort for anyone touching you.  
  **Jump Scare - portals and fear**  
  You instinctively know the location of anyone who is experiencing fear and can teleport to them. Your power’s range is tied to the intensity of fear felt, mild worry can get you across the room, Outright screaming terror will get you across the city. Fear of you personally can be detected at a far greater range.  
  **Lead Belly - Regeneration, and theft**  
  Pressing any solid substance against a wound causes you to absorb the material healing and taking on it’s properties, over time the material will reshape to more closely resemble your original features.
