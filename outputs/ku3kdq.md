## January Genre Fiction Challenge

### Post:

Hello writers! We all know you like rational fiction…but let’s be honest, money talks, and genre fiction sells. Can YOU write a genre fiction, with all the expected tropes?

For the month of January, your challenge is to write an URBAN FANTASY. 

A short description of the genre:

*Urban Fantasy, also sometimes called "Modern Fantasy", is a genre that combines common fantasy conventions with a modern setting. Urban Fantasies almost always take place on Earth, rather than a Constructed World. Alternate universe and magic in society are common aspects of the worldbuilding.*

Character types: vampires, ghouls, angels, demons, fairies, monsters

You can read more about urban fantasy here: [https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanFantasy)

Guidelines:

* There is no set word limit. Write and post as many words as you like! (technically there's a 500 word minimum, but I'm not counting)
* You’re encouraged to include rational elements in the fiction, but the main challenge is to write an enjoyable genre fiction. Everything else is gravy.
* Post your work as a comment to this thread, which can include a link or the entire story (if it is flash fiction). PM me if you want me to post your work anonymously.
* Last day to post is January 31st, but since this thread went up late it might stay open for submissions an extra week.

Optional prompts: (this is a pretty good list!)

I'm also thinking that if this contest runs all year, I'll create an archive of all our 2021 genre fiction stories. It would be sort of like a rational fiction anthology. :)

That's all guys! Start writing!

  Seems fun! Saw this today and picked one of the linked prompts, which is listed in an ed. note at the bottom. Will probably edit continuously, so please feel free to critique and/or run a typo thread.

  Can I just post my 100k WiP? No? Damn. 

  I'll have to whip something up, Urban Fantasy is my jam!

    Very cool! Which prompt did you base your story off of?
    ```

- u/Dragongeek:
  ```
  Since this is a "challenge", is there any reward for participation? Custom flair? Free promotion for other fictions? Eternal adoration from r/rational redditors?
  ```

  - u/Ms_CIA:
    ```
    Yes, isn't it awesome how many rewards there are? Also, don't forget all the beaucoup bucks we'll earn from publishing our genre fics.
    ```

    - u/Stumpy_Bumpo:
      ```
      A (small) incentive could increase participation, at the very least.
      ```

    Delightfully absurdist. I love the things that go unexplained.

- u/gramineous:
  ```
  Any recommendations on where to post? I mainly scribble bits of stories and worldbuilding plans in my phone's notepad app as is, or the odd file on my laptop. Haven't really posted stuff before.
  ```

  - u/kevshea:
    ```
    I set up a wordpress for it, but it was honestly kind of annoying, and then I remembered that posters in the old monthly challenges used to just post read-only Google Drive docs... so in retrospect I probably should have done that.
    ```

  - u/Ms_CIA:
    ```
    I'll second that, sharing work through google docs is pretty easy. Depending on the notepad app you use, it might be super easy to pull it up in your browser and copy your writing to google docs.
    ```

    ```
    You can make a site really easily for free on Wordpress or GitHub pages (if you’re okay with getting a little more technical).

    Also, Archive of our Own is a good place, but you need to be accepted to get an account. Or for immediate accounts there’s Wattpad.
