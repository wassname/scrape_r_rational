  ... gosh, but there are some Implications in this chapter. Maybe when I've stopped boggling about how *great* this is!

    I think the biggest one is: Cassie might have given away the fact that she's not an Andalite after failing to kill the Yeerk possessing her mother but then going back screaming at her father.

    Of course, it's possible that the Yeerks will rationalize this as "the andalite is a really really good actor who never breaks character."

    But geez, even discounting this, Cassie screwed up really big this chapter because of her character flaw and lost both of her dad and a lot of strategic information as a result. I wonder how the animorphs are going to get out of this one.

    Also, Rachel was really, really stupid last chapter and now the Yeerks are prepared. Yikes.

      On one hand characterisation is awesome. Real teenagers probably would behave just like that. On the other hand it's almost too painful to read about such acts of monumental stupidity.

        Yes. And I'm not sure whether it's painful or beautiful that - unlike the source material - there will be *consequences*.
        ```

  Damn, it's almost like those Yeerks are actually intelligent infiltrators and not just comic book villains! I'm really enjoying this book so far, keep it going!
  ```

  Wow! This is getting intense quickly. The Animorphs now have a difficult choice to make: Try to maintain the illusion of being Andilites and hide their numbers and identities with high risk of their families being converted soon, or take their families and flee- probably revealing their identities and putting themselves on the defensive. I wonder if they can find that magical hidden valley in this AU.
  ```

- u/SidAdAstra:
  ```
  That was beautiful. Brutal, but beautiful.
  ```

- u/throwawayIWGWPC:
  ```
  Agreed.

  Rachel was an idiot and now the Chapmans are dead.

  Then Cassie was an idiot and now her father is infested and the Yeerks may indeed figure out that the Andalite gorilla fighters (gorillas haha, get it?) are a group of humans.

  This is great writing; these are exactly the mistakes I'd expect from suburban kids thrown into a war.

  Well, this is certainly going the way of Madoka. Curiously, there was less screaming in my head from this chapter than the last one.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Hm...

    Not sure if there's any point to an r!PMMM. But now you have me thinking about it.

    They all break eventually.
    ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Was the screaming from the last chapter good screaming or bad screaming?
    ```

- u/TimTravel:
  ```
  Awesome! I especially like how they stay in character despite intelligence upgrades all around.
  ```

- u/E-o_o-3:
  ```
  is Cassie's mother soon to be dead, due to being injured? An Injured host is not useful. 

  Surprised yeerks trust themselves to hold deadly weapons considering the incomplete control. A human needs only 3 seconds of control to kill itself and the yeerk.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    The thing about hosts is that they're organisms. It's often the case that they heal. 

    Waiting a little bit for a host to heal is more efficient in the long run that discarding a host every time it gets punched in the nose. Not least because you don't have to make up cover stories for why these hosts are disappearing left and right.
    ```

- u/RebelWombat:
  ```
  This has been really good so far! I have so much residual nostalgia for the Animorphs series that I'm happy just to be back in that setting - but your handling of things is outstanding. I'm looking forward to the next one!
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  as a fan of animorphs growing up, I will check this out. thanks
