  Well alright then. I'm annoyed, but that feels like that's the point of the ending rant.
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    It does kinda bring up an interesting dichotomy between the audience of a fiction and the audience of a news story.

    Like out here in the real world, everyone _knows_ that Wonka's factory is a mystical, questionable wonderland - but in the fiction, nobody actually knows what's going on in there. We all know about the tour that the original five went on - but in the fiction, unless someone wrote a tell-all book afterwards, the only thing anyone would know about is the resulting injuries. 

    We all have an expectation (because this is a fiction) to eventually know the full details and inner lives of the characters involved; but if this were a news story, it would cut out at some point and the rest would remain a mystery.
    ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      Great point. Ned Brillbusker and the news also fit right into the context of the last chapter, an eerie parallel to marbles for public consumption. Exactly why clickbait sells better given a climate of news fatigue.
      ```

    I'm annoyed, but also I really liked and appreciated the ending rant, and on balance I feel like my annoyance is a worthwhile price of admission to the rant. 

    I'm probably weird, though, and I'm glad I held back on recommending this until it finished.

      Now imagine how everyone felt when Roald Dahl never actually wrote that sequel to the Great Glass Elevator before he died
      ```

- u/vimefer:
  ```
  Booo.
  ```

- u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
  ```
  If this is indeed the ending, and the thesis statement of the story, then I'm rather confused. It seems to be a story that hates itself. In which case, why write it?
  ```

  - u/XorolaVenter:
    ```
    I think it's a story about a boy getting invested in something he has no chances of solving, and what's the better point to end the story on than the moment when his newfound hope to win the lottery is crushed?

    Of course, it's Teddy's work, and so there's meta layer about getting the readers invested in the universe we have no chances of seeing fully, because we know it's Teddy and it's going to end abruptly. However, I'm not sure if this meta layer is the main one, or if it's just being used as a means to put us in the shoes of Chili and the rest of approximately 7 billion losers better, because it feels to me the core theme is the danger of lottery narratives and, worse, lottery narratives masking themselves as something you have actual input on.
    ```

    - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
      ```
      But last we saw of him, he wasn't crushed. The sixth ticket hasn't even been won yet. There's a scene missing.

      Obviously, this is the point, we're being robbed of a satisfying marble, etc, but I wonder what the point of the point is. There is a clear and deliberate parallel between Charlie Bucket and the author. They wrote a whole tirade about how him doing a thing makes him an awful person, and then did that exact thing. Why make the people reading this into a billion losers, so to speak? Why write a story where you, yourself, are the villain? Why *not* just do literally anything else with your time?

      Reading back over this, it sounds like I'm upset, but I'm honestly more confused than anything.
      ```

      - u/wren42:
        ```
        It's just a troll anticipating the most earnest response, or maybe an earnest writer lamenting their inability to make even a satisfying distraction from their own depressed state.

        No idea about author's reasoning, but I think it's interesting in its own way, which I value more than being conventionally satisfying
        ```

        - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
          ```
          I for one would prefer a story that's both interesting *and* satisfying.
          ```

          - u/XorolaVenter:
            ```
            Some interesting things can't be simultaneously satisfying, because denying satisfaction is part of what makes them interesting. If it's not your thing it's understandable though
            ```

            - u/crivtox:
              ```
              Some things maybe, but that's not the case with this(and also with sludge reformation), which is interesting even before you know it's not ending, so the denial of satisfaction is not what makes it interesting. But I guess what is interesting or not is a matter of opinion anyway so you do you.
              ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          Agreed, if we had so much of experimental literature then it could lose its interest but there's plenty of conventional stories that being tricked is fun at least for me.
          ```

- u/Flashbunny:
  ```
  Well you succeeded in annoying me, so congratulations?

  I guess I'll try and make a note to avoid future works by this author. I'm hardly drowning in apathy, but I do have better ways to spend my time than being caught in an elaborate "gotcha".
  ```

  - u/GemOfEvan:
    ```
    I don't particularly understand what's so good about this ending that leaving people impressed. Apparently this author is known for doing things like this? 

    The message of "fiction ignores the boring and bad aspects of the real world" isn't particularly deep. A twist isn't good if it takes your story somewhere less interesting than its original trajectory.
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      Seems kind of like a cop out, having written a good concept and intro and not knowing how to finish it.
      ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      At least half the reason I like the ending rant is that it matches pretty closely to my experience. I've been off-and-on suicidal for probably half my life, and while that's gotten better in some ways over the years it's also gotten worse in other ways. 

      5Gpants really captures how I feel about marbles some of the time, and while 5Gpants isn't real, they were written by somebody who *is* real; and while I know, on a rational level, that my experiences are not unique and there are many people who have or had a situation analogous to my own, the effect of that is nothing like the effect of knowing that *this particular person*, in order to write 5Gpants, had to be able to at least *imagine* what it's like to feel these things, and that this particular person *can* (though they won't, because we likely won't ever talk with each other) say, "I feel this. You are known."

      EDIT: I also appreciate that the author effectively telegraphed "This story won't be finished" in the first chapter and, in that light, actually did more to "complete" the story than I actually expected. I thought the story would just go on hiatus forever until it was mysteriously deleted one day, but instead we got a closing device which at least attempts to capture something interesting (i.e. the outside perspective of the ordinary person who will never know what happens inside the factory).
      ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      It's unusual so I like that. When you read so much fiction another story even if good is routine.

      I imagine it's how film critics feel when they like weird movies that no one else likes. Points for interesting.

      As of yet this is meta stuff is not an overdone genre for me.

      But I guess I'm less annoyed because I knew there was a chance and because I have an optimistic outlook when things go bad.

  That was an unexpected meditation on absurdity and consciousness, as well as a meta burn on /r/rational's utility function.

    Considering the author I'm not sure that we can really say it was unexpected though we all tried our darnedest to solve it anyway
    ```

- u/aerocarbon:
  ```
  I never thought I'd ever read something that would make me genuinely go '*oh wow*' in, uh, six chapters. What an excellent ending, lmao. Definitely not the one I was expecting, but it's the one that makes the most sense, and quite possibly the best, most "realistic" take on the original Willy Wonka challenge I never thought I'd see.

  "The point is not to make one winner but a billion losers" is *especially* poignant. Who thought about the millions of disappointed young boys and girls spending all of their cash on chocolate bars to win some absurd candy lottery in the original book? *All* of that tragedy and heartbreak, all those tears shed when the final golden ticket was found by some nothing kid who didn't put in near as much 'effort' as you or your friends did? Certainly not Dahl. When you put it in *that* perspective, Wonka turns into a genuine fucking monster, lmao. Just, *mwah.*

  (Of course, 'that's not what Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was about,' but this *is* a ratfic after all. Exploring aspects of the source material that were underappreciated and taking them to their logical conclusion is the entire point!)

  My only gripe with this story is that I feel like the medium fundamentally takes a bit of oomph out of the ending – seeing it marked as COMPLETE in six chapters when, IMO, *expecting* another chapter and *not getting one* because 'we’re the losers' makes up a substantial part of the impact. But I guess if I saw a fic this short that did such a great job of worldbuilding and setting up a premise within its first two chapters, I'd be intrigued to see how it could "properly end" (lol) so abruptly. YMMV, I suppose.

  ***

  And as a bit of a sidetrack I suppose, I found it pretty funny that the girl introduced last chapter would be the most likely to 'win' the Bucket challenge by force of narrative convention, as opposed to our seeming protagonist in Chili. Shy, likely good-hearted, with loving parents – prime protagonist material. (Though I'd imagine Chili shoving her into a chocolate river or something when nobody was looking.)

    So is the joy of anticipation --  of hopeful fantasy -- not enough to outweigh the bitterness of disappointment? Is hope really the worst of all Pandora’s evils because it prolongs the torments of man? I don’t think it has to be, if you practice selective detachment and remain appropriately calibrated.

        Game of God was the only one I read

        It was very much a live experience,with chapters and titles and the website edited. I believe the author was also active on the discord so there was a whole aspect there too

        Regardless worth a read because it's the same fourth wall kind of thing

      The author of this fanfic (gazemaize) is almost certainly the same author who wrote a bunch of stories here once under the moniker [REDACTED] ^^3 , who one day deleted all his incomplete works. Hence, classic *non*-ending.

      By the way, if anyone's interested in the remnants of the author's deleted works, /u/xamueljones and /u/IV-TheEmperor were kind enough to send me a copy. Not sure if [REDACTED] -bless his memory- would like a public link, so PM if interested.

  Hrrm. 5GPants' rant resonates with me more than I would have expected.

  If it doesn't, this is actually an interesting meta-commentary. One that's even foreshadowed!

  Sure, sure, apathy and marbles. Maybe that's too harsh, and I do get the subtext. Just the way it keeps happening, I have a hard time believing you think this makes the stories better. Maybe don't change your name for the next one so that people have an easier time ignoring you.

  At least tell us if Chili won or not!

  Even if the billion of losers are an audience surrogate for us readers, even they got to know the identity of the final winner!!
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    It doesn't matter if he won or not. The contest wasn't a real contest - the ending corroborates the first chapter's most likely interpretation that it was rigged and yet random from the start. With the theme of 'accidents', there probably wasn't an answer at all. From a pessimistic point of view, we're part of the billions of losers for whom the lure of small marbles drag us along and distract us from an overwhelming reality.

    Just to reply to /u/Cifems in the same post: our investment was stupid and that's probably Wonka's ([REDACTED]'s) gag by god. We're all gazztromples on this blessed day.

- u/Nimelennar:
  ```
  Question for anyone still here:

  Assuming this *is* the final ending, do you think that gaizemaze is using this last conversation to paint themselves as Bucket, laughing at us for having the audicity to want to LIKE something and KNOW something?

  Or do you think they're painting themselves as JUROR, choosing to end the story before common sense would dictate because they believe it makes a better story?

  I'm having a hard time deciding.

  On the one hand, the reference to JUROR is almost explicitly applicable as the author trying to defend themselves against the accusation of doing the same thing Bucket is.

  On the other, the derision 5Gpants directs at Bucket for not giving any answer to *his* riddle is just as applicable to the author of this work for getting us invested in the same riddle and then not giving us an answer either.

  I keep re-reading it and flip-flopping back and forth between the two positions.  Is the author trying to crush the marble by not revealing the answer, or to just make a better marble by ending the story?
  ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    The latter, IMO. Maizegaze is JUROR, not Bucket.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      But why?

      Let's take it line by line.

      >5Gpants: so imagine being a person who figures this shit out

      The rent is *about* the author having figured this shit (the reason people are so satisfied with a story that comes to a well-planned conclusion that reveals all its secrets) out.  Check.

      >5Gpants: and imagine having the power to make those little marbles
      >
      >5Gpants: and you go and say, you know what
      >
      >5Gpants: i'm going to make little marbles on purpose

      This story is a "little marble" as defined in the rant.  Check.

      >5Gpants: and i'm going to get people to like them
      >
      >5Gpants: and i'm going to get people to like them a lot

      There's been a shit-ton of excited discussion of the Bucket Riddle in this sub.  Check.

      >5Gpants: and then i'm going to take the marble, right before that feeling of understanding can come, like right right right before

      Had this been a traditional story (e.g. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), the next thing that would have happened would have either been Chillenial Lee solving the puzzle, or Chili doing the same.  The former was planning to reveal the secret behind the solution; the latter is our POV character and would have had to solve the riddle in front of us.

      Chapter 5 ends "right right right before" the Bucket solution was going to be revealed.  Check.

      >5Gpants: and i'm going to crush it

      This chapter, being the end of a work tagged as "completed," tells us that we're never going to get an answer to the Bucket riddle.  Check.

      I can make an argument for why gaizemaze *is* Bucket, or why he *is* JUROR, but not for why he *isn't* one or the other.  I can't even think of an argument for why there's necessarily a distinction between the two.

      So, why, then?  Why do you think he's JUROR and not Bucket?
      ```

- u/LimeDog:
  ```
  I rather enjoy this ending if that is what it is. The recent trend in fictions that play with the audience is enjoyable. It really shows a fickle and playful attitude from the author.

  My only dislike with this series is that it doesn't work as well read aloud as the original Dahl books did. It's mostly the chatroom sequences that throw this out. I see their purpose, especially when they dictate the audience feelings, they just don't read aloud well and even feel a bit clunky in my head. Likely my personal bias showing.
  ```

- u/GreatSwordsmith:
  ```
  Brilliant, and way too real for me, ending. Shame we don't get to see any more of this world, but I enjoyed every bit of this strange adventure. Hope to read whatever this guy does next
  ```

- u/Badewell:
  ```
  The best comparison I can think of is [Lucy and the football](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmFfTJlIvhQ). At a certain point, it's Charlie Brown's fault. Like, what the hell did you expect man, put that pattern recognition to work.

  I can't remember when, but after a certain point reading these stories I figured that if I was going to keep reading and enjoying I'd have to make peace with the fact that I'd be eating a lot of shit. And I think I've made that peace at this point. Given the chance to go back in time and stop myself from reading this, or any of Korridor I wouldn't do it. But, still. Good grief.

  At one point, Teddy compared their stories to the opposite of pearls before swine, and I thought that was very apt. We're surrounded by pearls. We're drowning in pearls. Pearls are being produced at a fast enough rate that I could spend the rest of my life doing nothing but consuming pearls and not catch up. I'm several chapters or volumes or episodes or gameplay-hours on loads of pearls right now, but damn if I'm not reading this shit the moment I know it's available.
