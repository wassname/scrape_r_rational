## Kill Six Billion Demons

### Post:

This doesn't fit well into any of our tags. The story is (so far as I've gotten) good and getting better, but really? It's the philosophical mythology posted UNDER the comics that the real treasure lies. Here's an example:

“There is no such thing as Truth,” said YISUN, “rely on lies instead. They are far more consistent.”
“Why, Lord?” sputtered Aesma.
“Because we constantly strive to uphold them.”

:mind-blown:

Short summary: Girl gets magical admin key stuck into her forehead and chucked into a fallen Heaven. Does not know what the fuck.

    Dammit. I submitted it as a link, but then supplied text instead of an initial comment.

    There is also an old MSPA forum series that sort of formed the protagonist in a different story arc. It was funny watching her and her situation take shape as people shouted suggestions from the crowd.

    Sadly the MSPA forums seem to be down for maintenance or something, so I can't find and link to it.

    Also, the author seems to have reset the character for Kill Six Billion Demons, though, so I guess it isn't that important.

      the initial forum series was hilarious because it actually STARTED out with a bait and switch seeming like it was an adventure about something ELSE entirely (girl at a pool being vapid) and then jumped into throne and the hells and so on with bizarre spirit Nietzsche running commentary.

      Also I'm not sure but we might actually be able to blame [THIS](https://vimeo.com/30798517) (potentially NSFW music video) for at least the initial sequence?

  This webcomic is one of  my favorite webcomics in existence. I dont know if its rational, but it is certainly beautiful and amazing.

    It definitely explains itself thoroughly

  What the ever living fuck am I reading?

  ... I love it.

  This is a very interesting and odd story. I'm not sure if it's rational, but whatever drugs the author is on, I totally want some of them.
  ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    The drug is WANT and is it used to CUT for the first act of divinity is DIVISION.

    Or something.

  This is too colloquial for me.  I don't understand what you're saying.
  ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    Girl meets some enigmatic figure; the enigmatic figure pushes a magical thing made of light into her forehead. A little while later, you find out that the magical thing is not just *a* key to the universe, but basically *the* Key to the Universe, which everyone else wants and *will* kill for.

    As a side effect, she's transported to a bizaare world that she *really, really* doesn't understand, that turns out to be the wreckage of Heaven, taken over by demon crime lords and drug barons.

      Thank you.

  This webcomic is a good.

  I think the world is even 'rational' on several things.

  The multiverse presented has some very clear rules, and also not very clear information on how it's supposed to work.

    Your name is literally in one of the blurbs and there are comments with your handle dating back to 2013. 

    Impressive (assuming that was you, but it seems like a pretty unique name).

      Oh yeah that's me... I was following the story before it was a webcomic and just a forum-adventure.


      Honestly if you do a net dive for that screen name you will find me scattered across the ancient strata of the internet going well into the early 2001s... I honestly Can't recall if that screen name predates the millenium or not and there are not going to be any solid archives of the things I used it on back then because the name got purged, the platform no longer exists or both.

      At the very least I had a geocities account attached to it.

  I've actually run into this webcomic before, but couldn't remember any sufficiently distinguishing characteristics to find it again. In that sense, thank you for posting it here!

  ```
  It's actually a really interesting story up to this point, with a strange art style. I like it a lot!
  ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  This is really good!
  ```

- u/whywhisperwhy:
  ```
  The art style at the very beginning was bothering me a bit (but the plot was enjoyable), so I went to the latest offering and it appears the art gets much better. How long would you say it takes before there's any noticeable improvement?
  ```

- u/Towerowl:
  ```
  Well i just have to give my opinion now to nuance all those positive reviews.
  Basicaly it isn't for everyone. I personnaly hated the beginning enough that i didn't continue it ( and thats rare ). The heroine has no agency, the art and plot are too messy, and honnestly this isn't rational in any way ( but that gets a pass since we're having trouble deffining "rational" has anything more than "people on this subreedit might like this".)
