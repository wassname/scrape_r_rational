  For some reason people dissing Game of Thrones about things like this, without putting an obligatory "(but the books actually are dark and are pretty good you should check them out!)", annoys me. I know it's unreasonable, but after too many incidents of people hating on the show, and thinking that means they can also hate on the books, means that just seeing GoT hate in general annoys me. 

  But back on topic, I don't find all of those ideas completely idiosyncratic. Truth be told, I think that the original poster in the threads ideas on Dark and Edgy are actually something we, as the rational subreddit, should support.

  The original posters idea could essentially be summed up this; in 'Dark' stories, characters, including the bad guys, act like logical, rational human beings; all the cruelty has a purpose, a guiding intelligence behind it that makes sense. In 'Edgy' stories characters are cruel for no reason, even when it works against their own self\-interests. Essentially, Edgy is what happens when Dark stories are written irrationally. 

  And I think I agree with that. 

  The other posts below it are a bit sketchy tho.

    I agree with this, with the caveat that sadism must be considered a valid, rational reason for cruelty. Not that sadism in itself is valid and rational, but that sadism exists, and sadists will be cruel just for cruelty's sake.

    - u/CeruleanTresses:

      This is true. That said, when it comes to roleplaying characters in particular (which I understand to be the topic of the screencapped thread), my experience is that characters motivated by sadism are almost universally badly written edgelords. Inexperienced or lazy writers who want to write dark, violent characters gravitate toward "cruelty for its own sake" as a motive because it's easy, so the archetype is dominated by bad writing.

    > an obligatory "(but the books actually are dark and are pretty good you should check them out!)", 

    That screen is from tg. Believe me they know the difference between GoT TV and asoiaf books. The thing was discussed to hell and came full circle to the point of "the books aren't perfect either and lot of shit happens just to be edgy". 

    Anyway I agree with your opinion on OPs post.

      The books are great, and quite frankly underplay how brutal history is. I haven't seen the show, but from what I remember of the books there are only really a couple rapes. Medieval history, especially in war time, was loaded with rape. I don't think there were any excessively brutal executions either, which again are pretty common in history.

    Well said.

    I'm not sure cruelty has such purpose in real life. People are sometimes just broken.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      true, and that's fine; but it's when even characters that clearly aren't meant to be 'broken' are acting cruel, for no reason, that a work becomes edgy, rather than dark.
      ```

  "Edgy" is an attempt to push boundaries. It doesn't even have to be depressing, gritty, or noir. Five years later it's "Classic" or "Camp" depending on how well that went down.

  "Dark" is Apple's new Mac OS theme.

  I know this isn't cool to admit, but I love me some edginess in my stories. That said, I can't stand it when it's the only noteworthy quality of a story or done for its own sake. Like, for example, I enjoyed Akame ga Kill because despite its edginess, it didn't take itself seriously all the time and never tried to sell itself as something it wasn't. Elfen Lied, on the other hand, just tries too hard to shock the audience and takes itself way too seriously for such a ridiculously stupid narrative. 

  I really don't think edgy and dark are two sides of the same coin, where edginess is a failed attempt at darkness. Imho, it's more like "dark" is a type of theme or atmosphere and edginess is a stylistic choice in how to present your story. You can be incredibly dark without being edgy and you can be edgy without being dark. It's just that edginess if often confused with dark because they both work well together.

    Elfen Lied's edginess is aggravating cause its stretching probability beyond its breaking point. 

    Sadism on the whole, is rather rare. and the gruesome pointless "i really want to cut open a puppy" is really really fucking rare. To the point that if your story includes 2 unrelated characters with the trait, its already stretching credibility.

    Elfen lied gives this character trait to every non mc the girl ever interacts with, at which point the viewer starts wondering how this society ever functioned.

    Well now I have confirmation that all those "back to reddit" posts were not so false.
    ```

  Don't post images of text please.

  - u/t3tsubo:
    ```
    I'm quite happy with images of text, and less happy with comments that make it seem like the entire subreddit is opposed to images of text
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      I'm blind and can't read the text. If you post an image of text, I'm excluded from reading it.
      ```

      - u/cae_jones:

        Me too.

      It's a reasonable complaint. Images like this one aren't accessible to people with impaired vision, since their text-to-speech programs can't read them. Wouldn't be as much of an issue if we had one of those deals with the volunteer transcriber sub.
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        Or if we just started being those volunteer transcribers for this sub exclusively. I'm game.

        /u/Amonwilde (or anyone else), if someone posts an image of text here and there's no transcription, let me know and I'll be glad to transcribe it for you. (I'm /u/MagicWeasel)
        ```

        - u/Amonwilde:
          ```
          For me personally it's not a huge deal. I'm a programmer and I've created a small utility that lets me drag boxes on the screen and it will OCR the text and read it aloud. I have some residual vision so I can draw the boxes correctly. It's mostly my non-technical and totally blind brethren that I'm concerned about.

          I appreciate the looking out, though, and think it's a great idea to do a transcription if another text in an image pops up. I could even probably do a transcription myself if pressed, though I couldn't promise that the formatting would be correct.

          Anyway I could probably have provided more context in my initial answer. But this kind of thing happens a lot and sometimes you don't have a long response in you. The point isn't to make people feel bad or be self-righteous, it's just so we can read text that's posted like everyone else.

  ```
  I'm pretty sure rationality is not an useful scale by which to measure darkness vs edginess. I'm sure I could write a perfectly rational story while remaining perfectly edgy, or dark, or neither.

  The three are not related, I feel fairly comfortable saying.
  ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    How would you describe your definitions of darkness and edginess? A lot of people consider edginess as a bad attempt at darkness or darkness just for the sake of it, which is why we get the above conclusions. Even with this definition I agree with you, a text can be both rational and edgy, but I wouldn't *expect* someone to write that combination and for me to enjoy it. An example of it does not come to mind, so I may simply have misjudged my expectations.
    ```

- u/crnislshr:
  ```
  Attempts to make dark, which we don't believe, we call edgy. Yes, so what?

  The real questions are what we believe and how we believe.

  These people's attempts at classification based just on the belief in their own thin soup of "like\-dislike"... seem just superstitious mind masturbation. The statements might look enjoyable for people with similar state of mind, but they're not rational.
