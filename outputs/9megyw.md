## "I Am a Strange Loop" by Douglas Hofstadter and "The Elephant in the Brain" by Robin Hanson are now released as audiobooks

### Post:

I've just noticed that "[I Am a Strange Loop](https://www.audible.com/pd/I-Am-a-Strange-Loop-Audiobook/B07HJ9NHHM)" (a more straightforward and understandable version of GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach) and "[The Elephant in the Brain](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Elephant-in-the-Brain-Audiobook/1541446216)" by Robin Hanson (author of [Overcoming Bias](http://www.overcomingbias.com/) blog) are now  released as audiobooks. I figured you guys would want to know about that, if you like me prefer listening to reading. Also, in case you didn't know, [Rationality: From AI to Zombies](https://www.audible.com/pd/Rationality-From-AI-to-Zombies-Audiobook/B076ZY6Y9C) is an audiobook as well.

  I can't imagine trying to read a Hofstadter book by audio rather than having it written down in front of me, but I'm glad it exists.

    For harder to read stuff I like using both at the same time.

  I do find dense material easier to get through in audiobook form, I'll check them out, thanks.

  A few more recommendations:

  There is a starslatecodex podcast, with quite a good narroator. I found it much easier to get through than the written posts.

  Superintelligence by Bostrom was also quite a good audiobook.

  There are two recordings of Rationality from AI to Zombies available, read by differen't people. I much prefer from-ai-to-zombies.eu because it sounds like they are having fun, so you might want to check out both and see which you prefer.

  Thanks! I was hoping that "The Elephant in the Brain" specifically would come out as an audiobook, this is great news!
