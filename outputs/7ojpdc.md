## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

    Depending on how lenient "vague things" means, you can have some serious shenanigans happen.

    Carve large letters in the ground for each letter in your alphabet (and some characters for punctuation). Hire someone outside of the party to record which letters you step on.

    Then, ask your god for a path to a scroll written by the person you hired that answers the question:

    What are the instructions that will allow my party to control the country within 10 years?

    What are the design specifications and explanations that will allow for the greatest advancement from our current technology level within 10 years?

    What must I do to maximize my utility function?

    ...or any other arbitrary question. Also, if you don't trust your hired scribe, preface the question with "when decoded using the one time pad written in the book in my bag".

      It is I, the person who designed the spell and spoke of it to blasted0glass.

      Even within the context of playing the game as intended, these would be perfectly valid questions that would return the expected result.

      The first scenario would indeed show you to the room occupied by Mr. Black's murderer. It may not be in the hotel.

      The second scenario would show you the path to the *closest* person who bribed Lord GamblingDebts, unless that person would harm you for figuring it out. It would, in that case, send you to the next closest person, and so on.

      The third scenario would lead you to a magical weapon *you could wield and use proficiently* capable of slaying said vampires. It is implicit in the statement that the seeker wants a weapon they could reasonably use.

      Side Note: One stipulation that was not directly stated (but is implied) is that the Path is always true and cannot fail. If you ask for an impossible destination, there will still indeed be a path, but one that a mere mortal could not hope to follow - that's the only route available.

        So, it's not just dangers on the path - it also takes into account dangers at the destination caused as a result of the journey?

        So, if I were a diplomat, and I suspected the visiting diplomatic delegation in the other room was under orders to kill me; could I ask for a path to the visiting delegation, and thus find out whether or not they were trustworthy?

        > The third scenario would lead *you to a magical weapon you could wield and use proficiently* capable of slaying said vampires. It is implicit in the statement that the seeker wants a weapon they could reasonably use.

        Useful. So it's not just a literal genie, it actually tries to be helpful!

        > Side Note: One stipulation that was not directly stated (but is implied) is that the Path is always true and cannot fail. If you ask for an impossible destination, there will still indeed be a path, but one that a mere mortal could not hope to follow - that's the only route available.

        Hmmmmm. So, I could ask for a path to 'yesterday' and it would give me one, just one I am unable to follow?

        - u/SirRaiuKoren:
          ```
          > could I ask for a path to the visiting delegation, and thus find out whether or not they were trustworthy?

          Well, you could find out if they wanted to harm you on sight, sure. If that is the sole or primary requirement for trustworthiness, then I suppose so.

          > Useful. So it's not just a literal genie, it actually tries to be helpful!

          This is correct. The source of the spell is perfectly capable of intuiting your intent and will use that intent to determine the proper destination in the event you seek a non-specific target, such as "any weapon that can kill a vampire." It will always give a true path in good faith to your intent, even if that path would lead you to an unexpected result - in the vampire example, you may be intending a sword, but you find the path has led you to a magical garlic field because the source knows you could use the garlic to better effect than a sword. (In the game world, the source is fond of giving unexpected results that are both true and more useful than the seeker imagined).

          > Hmmmmm. So, I could ask for a path to 'yesterday' and it would give me one, just one I am unable to follow?

          There are two answers to this: a hypothetical answer, and the real answer.

          Hypothetically, yes, it would give you a path that a mortal could never follow on their own, such as a path that leads you to a shrine in the mountains dedicated to the Kami of Time, where you would have to pray and just hope that the Kami would grant you time travel.

          However, in my game world, time travel does not exist, with one exception. Hell is a realm that exists outside of spacetime, a plane of eternal darkness and endless nightmare, where time and space have no meaning and all that exists is the tormented minds of the inhabitants. There is precedent that if a soul somehow escapes hell, they could appear anywhere in the universe at any time. I'm not actually sure Tsukuyomi (the kami that is the source of the spell) knows about hell; most non-death/non-underworld gods don't, and even they don't talk about it out of fear. We can argue that hell cannot enter the spell's predictive model of the universe because it exists outside of the universe. I might have to think about where that path would send the player, but I know the spell is designed to always give a path that is true, so I must assume there is a correct answer.

            So, the visiting delegation could avoid that by waiting ten minutes before they try to kill me?

            (Of course I don't trust them in the negotiations. I *am* playing a diplomat, after all.)

            > (In the game world, the source is fond of giving unexpected results that are both true and more useful than the seeker imagined).

            I like this. It sounds like the sort of thing that would be great fun.

            > However, in my game world, time travel does not exist, with one exception. Hell is a realm that exists outside of spacetime, a plane of eternal darkness and endless nightmare, where time and space have no meaning and all that exists is the tormented minds of the inhabitants. 

            Well, then, *clearly* the One Path must go via there. Does it matter whether or not Tsukuyomi knows about it? (If it matters, then the path might first go to, say, a Kami of Knowledge who the party would need to ask a few questions of - not so that they find out the answers, but so that Tsukuyomi does, by listening in to their questions).
            ```

              > So, the visiting delegation could avoid that by waiting ten minutes before they try to kill me?

              Actually, I think I was unclear. The path will lead to your destination regardless of the danger if that destination is *specific*. **THE** delegation next door will take you there regardless of their murderous intent. **A** delegation anywhere would lead you to the closest delegation that wouldn't threaten your safety. If that would take you past the one next door, you know they bode ill for you.

              Additionally, if they know you have this power and might use it to that effect, they could not foil it in such a way. The power would know they were waiting ten minutes and thus leading you there would still threaten your safety (it is capable of perfect predictive models).

              We were talking yesterday about an assassin that knows you have this power and tells you, "Walk around these letters in such a way to dictate a perfect plan to rule the world or I will kill you." It is assumed this assassin is certainly capable of doing so despite your best efforts. She instructs you to then designate the other side of the room as your destination, and will kill you if you do not produce the plan before reaching that side of the room. What happens?

              The answer is that the path would lead you in such a way that - if you followed it accurately at a normal walking pace - would cause the assassin to Final Destination themselves in their attempts to kill you (some incredibly improbable event would occur leading to their death, such as tripping and breaking their neck). That is the shortest, safest route to the other side of the room.

              Tsukuyomi frowns greatly upon abusing people to whom he has given his gift.

              > Well, then, clearly the One Path must go via there. Does it matter whether or not Tsukuyomi knows about it?

              The Kami of Knowledge would certainly be the most plausible result, that's good thinking. If Tsukuyomi doesn't know and has perfect prediction models, he would know that the answer lies outside of the material universe and would then lead you to someone who DOES know about such things.

                Ah. An important point to bear in mind. So, a delegation who wanted to threaten my safety could avoid the entire trouble by making sure that there is a second, completely innocent delegation standing on the side of the room closest to me, then?

                > Additionally, if they know you have this power and might use it to that effect, they could not foil it in such a way. The power would know they were waiting ten minutes and thus leading you there would still threaten your safety (it is capable of perfect predictive models).

                But surely there must be some limit to this. What if the delegation is perfectly honest - but negotiations will unavoidably break down, leading to a war in which I have over a 90% chance of dying within the next ten years?

                >Tsukuyomi frowns greatly upon abusing people to whom he has given his gift.

                So, he *personally* designs the path every time?

    Set up a room with a door and a small viewport. The door has a lethal trap on it. In the room is a lever that arms/disarms the trap. Have a scribe lock himself in the room and watch stakes beyond the viewport. Ask for a way into the room. If the path leads to the viewport, then through the trap, find a scribe less susceptible to breaking protocol through bribery and threats such as the god's model of you can improvise. Protocol options:

    - Tell him to roll a d20 each time you walk around a stake, and disable the trap on any 20. The number of loops you see gives you an estimate of x.

    - Tell him to write text corresponding to the letters on stakes you walk around, and disable the trap after a thousand letters. The number of loops gives you an estimate of the security of the setup - a bribe or threat such as a god can divine, or the name which summons that devil which will gladly teleport you into the room for your soul, or Cthulean whispers that may break any number of preconceptions of reality. Needless to say, think twice before executing the divination of any text with at least this many letters.

    Give one trusted friend a crossbow, a second a knife. Write down three paths that you could take through a small section of forest to a small inn. Pray, and intend to walk very slowly while you walk.

    If you take the left path, tell your friend to shoot rob rich house A. Path middle is house B. Right path is house C. Any other path is no robbery today.

    If your friend is successful in his robbery, he is to meet you at the inn. Tell your other friend that if the first does not get to the inn first, he is to attack and stab you with the knife right outside the inn.

    Now you have the perfect robbery oracle machine.

  You have the ability to generate semi-permeable force fields that allow some substances to pass through but not others. So you could, for instance, program it only to be permeable to salt, and then dump a bag of pretzels over it and watch only the salt fall through. This substance has to be clearly specified and identifiable ahead of time, so you can't define the substance to be "only those Scrabble tiles that answer such-and-such question".

  Aside from the obvious uses, such as panning for gold or purifying water, what else could these force-fields be used for?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    I'm assuming you only want uses where the semi-permeability plays a role, so I won't mention the standard uses for forcefields such as shields or telekinesis.

     * You could use forcefields to make yourself immune to poisons, simply by covering your body with one that is permeable to everything except every poisonous substance you can identify (start reading up on some toxicology so you can do this better). And not just poisons in foods. Your forcefields can clean poisons in air and water just as well. Depending on how large or easy it is to create such forcefields, you could extend your poison immunity services to other people, or even large buildings/cities/planets.

     * If you can create sufficiently large forcefields and move them around, you could fight climate change by making gigantic forcefields that are permeable to air but not greenhouse gases, then using those forcefields to sweep large amounts of greenhouse gases out of the earth's atmosphere (either into the ground or into outer space). 

     * You can be a great customs officer by creating forcefields that are permeable to everything but drugs and other banned substances. Or join the police force and hunt down smuggling rings and drug dealers.

     * What is a substance? Just chemicals? Can you identify people and create forcefields that only let some people in but not others? That would be a great way to ensure no spies are sneaking into your base.

     * What about temperature? Can you create a forcefield that only lets hot items in but not cold items? What if the hot item is water vapor while the cold item is liquid water? If so, you may be able to provide cheap heating/cooling devices. For example, you could put a forcefield in front of a fan that is permeable only to nice cool air, not hot air. Since air typically contains molecules that are at a large range of temperatures, this should work to blast cool air at you. Just don't stand behind the fan where all the hot air is building up.

  You have the ability to 'paint' any sufficiently smooth, flat surface with a touch. This 'paint' takes the form of a two-dimensional plane which hovers a couple microns away from the surface to which it is affixed. It follows the movements of the surface, is suppressed temporarily if the plane intersects a solid, and is destroyed if the shape of the surface changes (with tolerances similar to the distance it hovers from the surface). The optical qualities of the image are always uniform across the plane, and can be tuned at-will. The plane's reflectivity over wavelength must be within (0,1) for all wavelengths and must be smooth, but is otherwise under your control. It's properties are symmetric across both sides.

  What do you with this?

  - u/CopperZirconium:
    ```
    I host a rave to show off my only moderately impressive flashing color wall. 

    I then try to make a giant parabolic mirror death ray to fry everyone who said my power is dumb, and then I realize that a giant parabola is a parabola and not a mathematically flat surface.

    I sulk away and black out my windows to mope in darkness.
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Can you clarify a bit more on how this ability works? Are you transferring paint from a bucket or are you just magically creating it out of thin air? Can you use any substance you want, as long as it forms a paint-like appearance? If it appears out of thin air, can you use your ability to mass produce substances?

    When I use my ability to paint with a touch, is the quality of the painting perfect? Or only as good as my actual painting skills? Can I mass produce indistinguishable counterfeits?

    When I paint on a surface, it creates a plane that hovers a couple of microns away from the surface. But, a plane is by definition, a smooth flat surface. So can I paint on top of my painting? 

    What exactly happens when a painting is suppressed or destroyed? Does the paint layer just vanish? Is the destruction localized to the point where the plane is intersected or the surface changes? Or does the destruction spread throughout the entire painting? If it is the latter, it could be used as a form of communication. Morse code could be sent by repeatedly tapping one end of a painting and thus flickering the suppression on and off on the other end.

    Also, does this paint weigh anything? If not, I could do fun things like making super thick layers and layers of paint on the outer hull of ships, vastly increasing their volume without increasing their weight, and thus making it much easier for them to float. Assuming that the paint isn't suppressed by water, and can be made waterproof.

  Suppose you could copy natural(read: anything that comes through genes and isn't learned) attributes from one living creature to another, replacing the corresponding(if existing) attribute in the second creature.
  Which would be the most useful attributes to get and from which genes? Which animals have particular interest? 
  For example you could give some human a bloodhound's ability to smell.
