  Huh, lots of timeskips here. 

  I can't see the agoraphobic astronaut not ending in tears.

  Hermoine and Ron? Really? I mean, it worked in canon, but the characters are quite different here.

  It took me a few seconds to realize where Elon Musk would be getting that many galleons. Asteroid mining is a hell of a drug.

  So is Felix Felicis. Yikes. That's SCP level science.

  So, are we ever going to get some information on what Harry has been learning from Ignotus?

    One hundred billion galleons is two billion dollars. It's a lot of money, but very doable for someone who's about to own the world's supply of FF. Or, to put it another way, it's about what Facebook paid for Instagram.

      It's also about 700,000,000 kg, assuming a galleon weighs about 1 ounce, like a piece of eight and is pure gold. Since the total amount of gold in the world is estimated at about 171,300 tons (about 150,000,000 kg) that's almost 5 times as much gold made into galleons as exists, in this one transaction.

      I mean, unless Horace is fine with being paid in fiat currency or the wizarding world invents credit. Then you're golden.

      ... I swear that was not a pun.

      10^11 * (5 * 10^1) = 5 * 10^12 , which is 5 trillion pounds, or am I missing something? That's like two times US National Debt at the time (at the time exchange was almost two dollars per pound). *Countries*, over the years, if they made a massive effort, maybe they could have paid it (especially if they'd disbanded their militaries). 

      And I think 10^11 galleons is within an order of magnitude from 'all the galleons in the word'. Making a generous assumption that there's 1 wizard per 1,000 Muggles on average (canon seems to suggest a rather smaller number), rounding that to 10,000,000 (ten million) wizards in the world, making further generous assumption that there's 100,000 galleons of money supply per wizard in the economy, it gives 10^7 * 10^5 = 10^12. So with this assumption 100 billion galleons is about one tenth of all the money in the wizarding world.

        There is now an exchange rate between Galleons and GBP.  Elon can pay him in GBP which sits in a bank.  Whenever he need Galleons he takes some of the GBP out, goes to Gringotts, and turns them into Galleons.

    Probably not. It isn't the part that interests me.

  Good story so far. FtP had, id my opinion, a much better resolution than HPMOR (not perfect, but oh so much better), and this seems like a faithful continuation, dealing with greater consequences of the two worlds coming together, instead of focusing on vanquishing one partly sympathetic sociopath. 

  This chapter is a bit too timeskippy, I'd say, but I assume that this is just the author getting away from this "eleven year olds acting like adults" silliness, and it'll be more 'conventional' later. 

  I'll trust the author to make Ron something more than the useless fool from canon, so I'll withhold my judgment of this ship carried over from there, until we see more of how it looks like here.    

  P.S. There's two minor consistency errors I've noticed: 

  * As far as I know, in FtP Harry didn't see Riddle drink unicorn blood, this happened after the departure point in HPMOR.
  * Joel calls Peri 'it' in his thoughts, while Hermione was pretty upset when Pat did this to Xeri. Maybe not all phoenix's companions personify them in the same way, but maybe it's an oversight.  

  Edit: Oh, and of course
  > but it was enough to make him continue "squiring the phoenix"

  Roll credits! Only don't, may this story be long and full of awesome!

    > Roll credits! 

    I did that *exactly* in the hope that someone would have this reaction. :>  Are you an "Everything Wrong With..." fan as well?

    > Joel calls Peri 'it' 

    Doh. Will fix, thanks. 

    > unicorn blood

    Bah. I'm having a lot of trouble keeping the three separate levels of source straight. (FtP, HPMOR, HP). Thanks for pointing this out. 

    Well, I can pull out the "saw it" line and just have it be another thing that Harry learned via the Stone. 

    > too timeskippy, hope it will be long

    I hate to disappoint, but it won't. I view this as an epilogue to FtP, not a separate story in its own right--shoot, I've been having trouble keeping the source material straight over four chapters! I'm not doing another 2YE-style epic under these conditions. 

    Finally, the reason I'm timeskipping is to show the changes to society instead of just a heroic narrative. That's the part I'm interested in -- how the larger world is affected by magic, not what Harry and Hermione are up to.
