  As requested. Lamora (the author) said the 4th part should be out before the new year, with a possible new year surprise.

  You used to need an account on DLP with a certain number of non-spam posts to view the WbA subforum; someone said any new account will do. Pastebin [here](https://pastebin.com/YQAf813s) for the lazy and/or desperate, expires in 1 week.

  Q: What is this story?

  > It's a Pok√©mon fanfiction by a user named L. Lamora. It borrows elements from the manga, the games and even the anime, and it has really engaging writing and world building. It was possibly the best Pokemon fanfiction out there, before the writer abandoned it. They still give small synopses of future plot, to give some sense of closure, as an alternative to writing it all in proper story format. - quote from /u/Jose1561 on [the last thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dyffyv/the_game_of_champions_just_updated_sadly_its_just/f80ua0y/)

    Just want to make sure to thank you for posting the pastebins of these. I don't know why they're initially being put up somewhere you need an account to read, but it's great to get some closure by seeing where the story goes.

    Where can I access the rest of the written fic and ending synopsis? I don't want to make a DLP account.

    Beyond this piece of pastebin, which only covers this part.

  Perhaps its the distance from the original story, but this synopsis seemed a bit less _magical_ than the previous one.  Red perhaps develops a bit as a character, but I guess the evocative writing just wasn't as strong, and the concept of Pokemon gods as a test for humanity seems a little cliche. I believe I preferred the story without that, but a postmortem critique would be in bad taste.

  Eager to see the conclusion soon, get the closure that I gave up on.

    It looks like it's clearly getting to the point where his notes were more sparse, things that were left undesigned in detail since he probably had, oh, a year or two's worth of writing to do before getting to this point.
    ```
