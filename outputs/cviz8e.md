  ```
  How interesting that Rozala has been communicating with the coup members. Such letters would be really hard to fake and you might even have to have a name directly related to writing, like clerk or secretary, to fake such a thing.

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  I love all the moments of humour in this fiction.

  "Hasenbach tricked some of the palace garrison into protecting her"

  'Oh no!  When we tried to assault the Queen, she tricked some of the palace guards into doing their one job!  How sly!'
  ```

- u/NZPIEFACE:
  ```
  According to the comments, the title is related to [excommunication by "bell, book and candle".](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell,_book,_and_candle)
  ```

  - u/PastafarianGames:
    ```
    Makes sense given the reaction of the Holies to Cordelia's decision to treat with the Arch-Heretic.
    ```

- u/razorfloss:
  ```
  I wonder what cats reaction to this is going to be. I wager it's going to be somewhere between amusement and cold rage.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    "this one's not my fault folks"
    ```

  - u/vimefer:
    ```
    Nevermind Cat, imagine what Rozala's reaction will be when she learns what her followers were tricked into doing...
    ```

    - u/razorfloss:
      ```
      Rage pure rage. They're fighting the dead king and they have the nerve to pull a cue on the one person in charge taking this seriously and able to keep the nation together, shes going to lose her shit and throw a fit.
      ```

      - u/morgf:
        ```
        > and they have the nerve to pull a cue on the one person

        That takes some nerve! Especially if you aren't a pool player.
        ```
