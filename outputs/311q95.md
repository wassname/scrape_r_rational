  I love how that sentence can be interpreted in two almost diametrically opposed ways. I wonder what it's like to be a sapient disease.

    Well soon, you can ask them!  Our homeworld's Kernel runs Updateless Decision Theory, so we enforce the equality of *all* life-forms, because Updatelessly, we could have been *any* of them.  So you should get ready to negotiate over how you'll split up the available mass.

      Why just life-forms?

      - u/None:

        Because they're agenty enough to count as optimization processes for the Kernel's purposes.  We know this was a really conservative move on our part, but there's not much we can do about it at this stage of ultraintelligence.

        You think we should have programmed it for the Updateless Intelligence Metric-extracted utility function of every particle in the universe?

          Of course not. You should have done so for every combination of particles.

  Nonsapient diseases? You mean that there are SAPIANT diseases too? I'm scared to ask. (cue Ebola-chan flashbacks).
