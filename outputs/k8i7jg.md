## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I'm craving some SCP content. Were there any interesting new objects lately? Preferably long-form. Also, are there any Tales/Canon Hubs with storylines comparable in quality to *There Is No Antimemetics Division*? [*The Cool War*](http://www.scpwiki.com/the-cool-war-hub) was pretty fun, but I'd tried a few others, and either the individual stories weren't written very well, or they were meandering and disjointed, not following a coherent plot.
  ```

    It’s not prose, but the *Confinement* series on YouTube is absolutely fantastic. Starts off as what seems like a bunch of shorts, but develops into a deeper, ongoing story surrounding the main character, who themselves is an SCP, and also works for the organization.
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    If you're not asking this because [SCP: Overlord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOxarwd3eTs) came out recently, you should definitely go watch that (and potentially the rest of the SCP content on the guy's channel)

    It's a live action movie of an MTF taskforce investigating an anomalous cult. It's really well done. The MTF members are just as competent-yet-overwhelmed as you'd imagine them being in real life.

    Edit: Also, not a direct work, but Susanna Clarke's new book [Piranesi](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0865TSTWM) gave me real SCP vibes.

    I liked [S and C Plastics](http://www.scpwiki.com/the-s-c-plastics-hub), but it is a bunch of separate stories with only a few longer arcs so you may dislike it for being disjoint.

    My favorite tightly written story is [New Age](http://www.scpwiki.com/new-age-hub).  It has a definitive narrative.  Also one of the cooler reality bender portrayals (powerful enough to be a threat, but precisely limited in a rational way).  And I hardly ever see it recommended, so I recommend it when I can.

    Rats Nests was a good grimdark set of tales, but disjoint.

    Apotheosis was decent, some parts disjoint, but it had a solid narrative arc through some of them.  I like it for the anti-grim dark... the Foundation might like to portray themselves as the only option for humanities survival, but it seems like there are alternatives of mankind could embrace the weirdness.

    The 2019 videogame *Control* is basically SCP in videogame form. The general writing and worldbuilding are pretty neat and definitely worthwhile, and it's got a lot of great aesthetic stuff going on (especially if you have a PC with a raytracing-capable videocard - but even if not, it looks pretty good). There're lots of great aesthetics and cool stuff in the game's world, told mostly via found documentation and audio logs and most noticeably live action videos embedded into the game world. The central storyline is decent and interesting. That all said, the game's actual gameplay is somewhat tedious and bad third person shooter stuff that is not closely tied into the good parts of the game that are worth experiencing, so that's ... not great, sadly. 

    The main game is pretty short - the main game is maybe ~15ish hours, with some additional expansion/DLC content and optional missions beyond that.

    I don't know how recent it is, but I loved 5004. I'm not going to link it because it's a US politics-related SCP, but it's a highly enjoyable and entertaining read.
    ```

  - u/MereInterest:
    ```
    Is your goal specifically things in the SCP universe, or things that have a similar feel?  If the latter, try The Laundry Files, a series by Charles Stross.  It has a similar feel, with bureaucratic organizations working to contain horrors, even if just for a time.

  Looking for novels/fics with teacher protagonist.

  Since fantasy novels tend to focus on a growing protagonist, they usually have MC in the position of a student. Protagonist being a teacher is a big rarity, and I have yet to find one that would also qualify as rational.

  And even among novels that do go this path, not many focus on actual teaching, the protagoist's work to see his students growth, instead going on solo adventures somewhere.

  Can you make some suggestions please?
  ```

  - u/FunkyFunker:
    ```
    Library of Heaven's Path is a fun if undeniably bad translated Chinese xanxia novel. The points in favour of it are that the translation is excellent, the Chinese cultural mindset really comes through, and it's occasionally very funny if you enjoy the particular sort of humour. Points against are that it is very long, very slow, pretty shallow, repetitive, and quite sexist (although not as bad as these Chinese novels can get).

    I'm not sure if it'll feel to you like the novel is fundamentally about teaching or if it just seems like window dressing, but I would suggest at least checking it out. It drags for a while before picks up again, but the very start might be interesting even if you don't read much further.

      LoHP is terrible. To be precise, it's *repetitive* to an insane degree; you saw the first 70 chapters or so - you saw everything. The world itself seems to be shaped in levels for the protagonist, each a repeat of a previous stage, just with higher average cultivation level. I persisted for a bit further than 900 chapters, and dropped. 

      One of my wishes is that someone writes a rational fic for/inspired by LoHP, because the premise is rather fun.
      ```

      - u/FunkyFunker:
        ```
        I'm at 1500. I agree that it's terrible, but I love the Chinese idioms and the comedy. The translators are also great on their own. I just ignore/ skim the progression/ cultivation stuff and treat each arc as an overblown mythology-style clown fiesta. I can't recommend anyone read to where I did, but I really think that those first 70 chapters or so are worth reading.

        [Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4) has somewhat similar premise and much higher quality. 

        Unfortunately it was suddenly abandoned, but you might get some fun out of it if you missed it.

        - u/vallar57:

          I did read it. The master-disciple bits were nice, but overall I didn't really like it. The protagonist has *soooooooo* much resources, both in-System and out of it, it stopped being funny.

    Humble Life of a Skill Trainer is all about teaching other people skills, to the extent that the main (physical) conflict is usually solved by the protagonist's friends/family while he is focused more on the mysteries behind the system.

    The Demon Lord's Lover has a protagonist who is a mentor and teacher to the current generation of heroes, and he falls in love with the current Demon Lord. Really sweet, with some impressively deep worldbuilding. 



    Great Teacher Onizuka? lol.

  Rationalist content about deeply strategic board games, real or fictional?

  Ideally games similar to the board game niche that chess/shogi/go/etc. occupy. Abstract board games with perfect information that take place on a polygonal grid, not games of chance but of position. The complexity should be close to or exceeding chess/go.

    Have you read Player of Games by Iain Banks? It's a story set in a futuristic post-scarcity civilization where people don't tend to have jobs, but often just specialised occupations/ hobbies. The protagonist is a dedicated player of games, one of the best among the literal trillions of humans in the culture. It's a great novel, and a decent stepping off point into The Culture series.

      Hikaru no Go (ヒカルの碁, lit. "Hikaru's Go") is a Japanese manga series based on the board game Go, written by Yumi Hotta and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. The production of the series' Go games was supervised by Go professional Yukari Umezawa. It was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2003, with the chapters collected into 23 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha.

      I'd second the recommendation for Book 1, but recommend against going any further.  Book 1 has a tight storyline and clear world building that ties back to the protagonist's struggle with the concept of free will.  Book 2 onward loses the time pressure, expands the world building in ways that make the framing device feel pointless, and slows the pace to an absolute crawl, even if you include the text updates.

    It's not fictional or necessarily rationalist, and it's not a game with perfect information (because there are dice rolls), but here's a [great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I&ab_channel=TheBritishMuseum) about an ancient Babylonian board game for which anthropologists have reconstructed core gameplay and several variations. My buddy and I drew a board on a piece of paper and played with chess pawns, it's pretty fun. Also, Tom Scott is a champ.

    EDIT: Ok, rereading your comment this really doesn't fit as it's quite a simple game. The video is so cool that I'm going to leave it here though.

  Has anyone read any Murakami? And what do you think of it? I'm looking for reviews from a /r/rational perspective
  ```

  - u/jozdien:
    ```
    Norwegian Wood is my all-time second favourite book, and several of his other books rank high in my complete list.  I like his prose more than any other author I've read, especially with how he writes emotion; Murakami's at his best for me when he's writing solitude in a character without being melodramatic. 

    I don't think his books would fall into the purview of rational fiction - not because the characters act in obviously stupid ways or the plot isn't well-structured (they're not), but because his books are rarely more about the plot than the characters and writing itself (The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle comes to mind as sort of an exception, but even there the story shares focus with character).  He's also a huge proponent of surrealism and magical realism, so depending on how you reconcile that with rational writing, you may love it or be frustrated with it.  

    I highly recommend his books.  It's hard to view them from an /r/rational perspective when the focus is heavily strange characters and emotion, but I love rational fiction, generally dislike dumb writing and characters, and I love Murakami's books.

  What are some works centered around a distinctly traditionalist conservative mindset? 

  By that I mean the broad mindset that solidarity with ingroups, loyalty to traditional institutions, transcendental moral order, and political acknowledgment of inherent inequalities between categories of people are all good things. 

  Mind you, I'm not looking for a wank either in favor or against conservatism. I'm looking for works that explore this conservative mindset in a rational way. It's obviously a topic that'd be extremely difficult for an author to handle neutrally. If it has a noticeable bias, I'd prefer the bias be pro-tradition rather than anti-tradition since I'm already very familiar with literature that's anti-. 

  It doesn't have to include all the traits I mentioned, but it should be eminently what someone would consider socially right-wing. 

  It also doesn't have to represent any specific historical or existing ideology/institution or category of traditionalist ideology. It could be Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Buddhist, Indigenous, some mixture of these worldview's traits, or something mostly fictional. 

  There are non-rational works which I'd consider as having brushed up against what I'm talking about, or at least appealing to subconscious aspects of a traditionalist mindset. Warhammer 40k being an example, even if the franchise has wavered from satirizing the mindset to playing it somewhat straight, depending on whose handling the lore.

  The book Starship Troopers is a better example (which WH40K and a lot of sci-fi take heavy influence from), even if the majority of people are only familiar with the movie which only superficially resembles the source material. The Book of the New Sun is an understated example. Of course, none of these works mentioned are rationalist fiction.

    This recommendation is tentative, because there are problems with seeing it as conservative, but: The first arc (7 episodes) of [*The Irregular at Magic High School*](https://www.crunchyroll.com/the-irregular-at-magic-high-school) has significant conservative-modernist overtones. Themes of anti-terrorism, class war and individual envy involving a literally French-named radical organization, and with a competent, non-egalitarian, hard-working, prudent and inspiring main character. The arc works fine as a self-contained story, and it really is one of the most remarkably effective right-wing-ish aesthetics I've seen, though it doesn't continue that way much after. Its also fairly rational in its description and use of the magic systems. Highly recommended, but mostly for the first 7 episodes.

    *Crest of the Stars* had an excellent pro-monarchist aesthetic at times, though I doubt the author is actually pro-monarchy- it just fit the story. Its a slow but sometimes profound meditation on human cruelty.

    *Psycho-Pass*'s Kogami sort-of fits, though his choice of politics isn't really clear. In the movie (which was great) he describes the offer to work with an anarcho-communist (?) group as "a fate worse than death." Manly, classically literate and a cop, it sort-of fits, though not clearly.

    Russell Kirk, godfather of American conservatism, wrote *Old House of Fear*, a gothic horror. An attorney takes a job for property on a secluded island and finds radical communists using it for some unknown purpose...It was surprisingly well-written for such a largely influential political thinker.

        Eh, we clearly have different tastes. Its true that Tatsuya basically becomes invincible after the first arc and the story quality just isn't nearly as good, but the first arc was a very well-told story of social rank and of disciplined use of personal talent.

          Definitely can see why people can like it. The anime stuff ruins it for me. The nearly naked sister with a brother complex. All the girls show skin in weird scenarios. It's all standard stuff that I think a lot of people can look past but it's just so cringe that I can't stand it.

          - u/EdenicFaithful:

            Yes, the incest jokes was one of the reasons I hesitate to call it conservative. Though in a sense the fan service is itself pretty conservative- the school uniform is unusually modest for anime, Tatsuya disappoints every harem protagonist ever by literally saying "According to current dress codes, I think your outfit is a little too provocative" to the less modest nurse, and Erika gets as embarassed over barely showing the tops of cleavage in a perfectly normal shirt as a typical harem heroine would get embarassed from being seen naked.

        Can second the rec on the novels- I have the first three (don't know about the translation however) and they're pretty good. Heightens the feeling of a protagonist who is very socially aware and chooses his words carefully.

        I'd say there's something firmly right-wing modernist about it all. The only hint of traditional religion is in techniques. All the scenery is firmly form-follows-function, with a hint of urban violence lurking in the corner. Its probably why I didn't enjoy the parts after Enrollment, where these things were more in the backgroud, as much- its more or less accepted that if one is to protect those he loves, he has to be a little ruthless, even to the point of thuggishness. At its core it seems to be a story of overachievers who, arming themselves with a fundamentally scientific ethos, maneuver through amoral loyalties- clans, military obedience, the law and its subversion- to attain some measure of ordinary peace against the enemies that constantly threaten their security and their friends.

    starship troopers sucks op.  heinlein is probably the most significant conservative writer - this was of course from a different era, where being a conservative indicated different policies than it does nowadays.  this is somewhat the issue with your request - there's not really such a thing as a traditionalist conservative mindset, because the ideology of conservatives is a moving target that has historically changed very constantly.  for instance, during heinlein's time, the republican party - and conservative ideology in general - was the dominant ideology among people with college degrees (although not necessarily across all degrees, if that makes sense).  during this period, conservative policy was synonymous with very traditional liberal, laissez faire policy.  over time, with the rise of neoliberalism and the general movement and positioning of conservative parties as the xenophobic party, this has changed.  much can actually be written about this - its a pretty complex phenomenon but its pretty interesting, at least in my opinion, and it is of course the case that certain traits have remained an element of conservative ideology (militarism of course being the biggest one).  ultimately, what im getting at is that it is very hard to give demonstrations of things written by what we would consider now to be conservatives because the definition of conservative ideology has shifted massively over the last century.  in particular, one of the biggest issues with this from the point of view of sci fi writers is that heinlein is somewhat unique in that era of sci fi writers as being one of the very few writers who never saw any actual combat - most of the ones who did had a considerably different view point on society at large - and most of the remainder of sci fi writers were academics of the arts who were less inclined towards conservatism.  if you really want to find conservative writers of scifi, though, you can probably look up people associated with the sad puppies - although im not really sure why you would want to read what they write.

      For anyone interested in how conservative ideology has changed over time, I recommend [The Reactionary Mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Reactionary_Mind) by Corey Robin. It can be a bit opaque at times as it's a very academic work and assumes some knowledge of political theory and history, but there's a lot of good information and analysis there. As a liberal progressive myself, I picked it up to try to get a sense of the mindset across the aisle. I don't really know if it worked, but I learned a lot.

      You seem to be using the terms interchangeably but it should be noted that conservative and right wing do not mean the same thing. (in politics) All conservatives are right wing but not all right wingers are conservatives. 

      That said, even after the 70's when he stopped swinging and got more staid and curmudgeon-y and hypocritical, I doubt Heinlein would describe himself as conservative. Libertarian, yes. Right wing, maybe. Conservative, never. Heinlein prided himself on being an iconoclast author, someone who made you challenge tightly held, unexamined beliefs; iconclasm is the literal opposite of conservatism. 

      (I did a paper on Heinlein in university, and I wanted to put that to use)

      I agree with your points, but I believe they are all reasons why Starship Troopers is "great". It's the conservative military utopia book. The book encapsulates a huge number of conservative ideologies and themes, coming from someone who is very representative of the people who believe them. 

      It's also a book of modern military ideals for USA militaries: the themes and ideologies espoused in the book are essentially what our militaries dream of being and what they tell everyone they are. It's the most typified "military ethos" book I've ever read in my life, and I think it's essential reading for trying to understand "military" conservativism. I don't know if it's fiction shaping reality or following it but military leaders and politicians "believe" the themes in Starship Troopers to a large extent. Things are changing within military leadership, probably due to leaders who don't know peace, but I expect this book to continue to dominate how politicians at least view the military for a very long time. Also if we bring back the draft for something other than WW3 this book will be why.

      I know that the definition of conservative has shifted considerably over the years, so has the definition of progressive. 

      Specifically, I was requesting traditionalist conservative literature, a specific strand of conservatism that has a more clear definition, albeit not a universal one.

      I've been considering reading books associated with Sad Puppies, although I don't expect it to be very worthwhile since it's literature meant to make a metafictional point rather than being rational.

    This rec is to answer your request and should not be interpreted as actually endorsing the series: 

    The [Sword of Truth series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43803-sword-of-truth) by Terry Goodkind is probably an archetypal conservative fantasy series. It is derivative(Ayn Rand/objectivism), it is preachy, it is heavy handed, it unsubtly addresses present day events(e.g. book 5 from 1999 features a Bill and Hillary Clinton stand-in who go on to doom their nation by not funding defense and subsequently opening its borders to foreign invaders), and lastly, it displays weird sexual hangups and female characters(e.g. literal magic dominatrices who are enslaved to the MC, also the primary female character has an innate magic that kills men if she orgasms). 

    I read these books as a teenager and it was a major contributing factor for why I went on to become an insufferable, self-righteous twat for a few years. Good times.

    **Cross-Time Engineer** is kinda an example, a typical "modern advanced person stranfed in the Medieval Age", story, but the author is well versed in technology and history for once. The titular character is a somewhat conservative and mostly rational (he approaches all problems like an engineer, but also struggles with his temper). The series is kind of a Red Pill but tries to be Rational as well (plus heaps of old school action like a 80's era movie).  


    The relationship this book has with conservatism is interesting. It explores 20th century conservatism, 12th century conservatism and how the two differ, and also the question how conservative a person really *remains* once they have royal powers and no one to answer to except possibly God.  


    For example, the protagonist over the course of the book becomes a near Feminist, but also strongly anti-LGBT.   


    As for just about every other conservative trope: be it religion, the role of the state, race, gender, sex, capitalism vs socialism etc, the protag faces problems that invalidate BOTH Conservative and Liberal ideas, and the plot explores the complexity of human character and culture.  


    To give you one example, the protagonist is kind of a douche in most things, but is also extremely against rape in any form. The co-protagonist is the absolute embodiment of Lawful Good hero....except also a rapist.  


    The series is not necessarily very good, but it is extremely entertaining, and often thought  provoking, especially if you, like me, disagree with a lot of Conservative ideas.

    Interesting question, and obviously there's a lot of conservative literature out there, but I get the sense that the generation or two coming up hasn't been exposed to what was common and recommended when I was in school. Recommendations were a little less partisan awhile back, and I was exposed to a pretty wide variety of conservative writing.

    G. K. Chesterton is an amazing writer who thinks almost nothing like I do, and not just politically. I like reading him because his books read like missives from an alien intelligence. I spent a lot of time with The Man Who Was Thursday during the pandemic. If you like altered states of consciousness, trot out your alterer of choice for this read, because it's pretty trippy. The Father Brown stories are more bite-sized but still pretty out there. Chesterton's Fence is a great thought experiment / rational observation that is fundamentally conservative.

    https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/

    If you like modern novels or the genre of literary fiction at all,Michel Houellebecq (French author, you can read in translation) is pretty good. He's critical of the meaninglessness of the modern continental order. A little like Chuck Palahniuk (Fight Club, Choke), but more realistic and better. And French. Try The Elementary Particles.


    Ayn Rand is probably a somewhat underrated author, (Bring on the hate!) if only because she's so widely reviled. If you make your way through Atlas Shrugged (yeah, go ahead and skip the big speech at the end), it will kind of stick with you. I really think you don't have to agree with someone to get something from engaging with them, and Rand is, at the very least, an interesting example of getting your worldview over in fiction. The Fountainhead is a decent read, I taught that side-by-side with a pretty readable book by Jack London (a socialist) and my students liked Fountainhead a lot more, she's a certain kind of accessible.

    Edmund Burke is the original anti-Jacobin or conservative thinker, and if you're moving into this area intellectually, I'd say Reflections on the Revolution in France is required reading. It's a little dense for the modern reader, but it's just an amazing piece of writing and a well-articulated argument for incremental reform over revolutions. He also defends Representative government, which is certainly relevant to conversations people are having today.

    I've been thinking lately that the conservatives aren't conservative anymore, nor are the liberals all that liberal. There's something to be said for these values in their original articulation, and maybe even a conservatism to a defense of the liberal order in the modern context. So I think I'm more receptive to these thinkers than I was five or six years ago as the overton window shifts. Regardless, reading only books by people you more or less agree with, or who think like you, is unwise. A por diet precedes a poor constitution.
    ```

    - u/aponty:
      ```
      Ayn Rand is only reviled as a countermeasure to her insane cult following that continues to worship her work as the cornerstone of humanity's future to this very day.  They have a whole Institute and everything.

      I myself fell victim after marathoning her works as a sheltered teenager.

      The only way to combat this kind of memetic hazard is to spread awareness.
      ```

      - u/RetardedWabbit:
        ```
        I also came to recommend Ayn Rand, having a similar teenage experience.

        It's also very important to recognize that philosophies, their interpretations, and how they are implemented are all entirely different things. Even when I was younger and bought into the philosophy much more I would have been horrified if I had talked to the real people who are fans of it.
        ```

        - u/aponty:
          ```
          it just irked me for someone to say Rand is underrated due to the backlash, when the backlash would surely die out were her work truly underrated
          ```

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        If what you mean is that, if you see flaws in a philosophy, you should tell people about those flaws so that they can see them for themselves, then sure. Pretty much the same as any other thinker. I mean, what philosopher doesn't have an institute (or 10). That said, yeah, that institute seems to have a lot of money to throw around. I think Rand made more sense to people when there was a big bad communist state across the ocean, but, eh, the pendulum could swing the other way again.
        ```

    - u/Freevoulous:
      ```
      I would not count Ayn Rand as conservative at all. Her actual ideas and writings completely dismantle Conservative ideas. She was adamantly against tradition, religion, family values, and the military. She was more Libertarian that Libertarians.  


      The only thing that she had in common with some Conservatives is her economic views.

      I'm familiar with Chesterton, Houellebecq, Rand, and Burke. 

      I appreciate the thorough answer, but I should probably have been more specific. I was looking for works in the rationalist genre, the post-HPMOR genre. I'm already very familiar with a lot of literature before that.
      ```

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        Honestly, I usually respond with recs for the whole group...I did get the sense somehow that you wanted rational works, but I don't think those really exist. Most rational stuff is as anti-conservative as you can get, not in the sense of being left-leaning but in the sense of doing radical transhumanist things that would completely destroy all traditional institutions. Practical Guide to Evil might be the most conservative / least transhuman and a conservative work it's not.

      I've read it before, it's a great hard sci-fi novel, but politically it's an anti-militarist author tract.

    Banks was already mentioned in another thread, so I'd point to his *Inversion*.  Traditionalist conservative is not protagonist but fairly important character, *is not* strawmen and >!the one who win in the end.!<
    ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    Thinking of typical stories it seems harder to be conservative since the stories tend to be about changing the status quo, so you'd have to have a hero's journey that starts with the status quo of progressive race mixing and then the conservative hero splits the populations into their own ethnostates or something.

    Harder to do something like that than classic hero's journey.

    Orson Scott Card is a pretty conservative author so probably the Ender series

    But I dunno about rational, hard to find

    [Infinite Realm: Monsters & Legends](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends) has three systems, one of which is cultivation. All the systems are really well balanced imo and consistent up to the top. The worldbuilding is also nice. Of the two protagonists, one of them is less interesting at first, but gets better later on. Reads a bit flat due to author's second language being English, but it's still much better than translated stuff. There is some good subversion of tropes too which hinge on how powers work.

    I've also heard good things about The Path Unending, which is a xianxia that started as a quest on SV and then migrated to Royalroad.

I liked it, Isekai'd orphan in a feudal world where everything is out to get you. I believe the first 150 or so chapters focus on the MC's rise and development of his power station/base/settlement before he goes out to travel the world.

    Dealing with Dragons by Patricia Wrede has dragons. A princess asks to be kidnapped by dragons because she is bored. It is written for a younger audience so it isn’t all that complex or rational but is a fun read. 

    It doesn’t have human forms.

  - u/None:
    ```
    Not too much to go on here, so I'll cast a wide net and hope at least one of them hits what you're looking for.

    The Dragonriders of Pern is a decent enough series in the science fiction / fantasy boundary. Dragons do not have human forms, and there's no overarching villain plot or whatever, but the writing is solid and some of the characters are quite good. Also has some solid songs, albeit not quite on tolkiens level imo.

    You've almost certainly read the hobbit, but every so often I come across someone who somehow has not and is looking for a story featuring something it describes so I recommend it just to be safe. Again, dragons do not have human forms.

    Eragon series starts out fairly solid, although in some ways its rather recognizably fantasy!star wars. Quality declines as the series progresses but I don't  regret starting it. Dragons do not have human forms.

    Moving into the realm of anime, Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid is great. Comedy focused anime, but contains dragons, dragons have human forms, quality is very high.

    In terms of fanfic, Embers by Vathara is an excellent ATLA fanfic with dragons taking a central role, both Dragons themselves (who have human forms) and the dragon-blooded descendants. It has really amazing worldbuilding and excellent overall writing, but suffers a bit from not being able to fully shed the fact that it began life as a for the want of a nail fic, and thus has to somewhat balance the fact that the stuff prior to the PoD occurred with the fact that some of the actions make less sense when taking into account the AU it's in. This is usually done fine, but there are a few moments when you really notice it.

    Harry is a Dragon (And that's Okay) by Saphroneth is an enjoyable Harry Potter fanfic. Saphroneth is an solid author in general, but the fanfic is rather long so ymmv on if that's a plus or a minus!

    Next up are works I recommend that contain dragons as a major factor of the setting or plot, but the dragons are not what the story is about, or are only what it is about for some of the plotlines. I'll expand upon them if you're interested in this but this is more of JIC since I suspect the above are more what you're looking for.

      Harry is a Dragon (And that's Okay) was described to me by someone as being competently written, but that it effectively drained every possible problem in canon of any tension. I assume the draw is slice-of-life, but that put me off enough I didn't read it.
      ```

      - u/None:

        I wouldn't go quite that far, but as descriptors go it's accurate enough. I think it probably would have been better served being significantly shorter, as while I did appreciate it for what it was that didn't translate into continued enthusiasm a couple hundred thousand words into it. I don't regret reading it at all, but I also don't regret not finishing it.

    This isn’t rational, maybe even not rational adjacent, but maybe give Chrysalis a try? The MC reincarnates into an ant monster, and the world building and story can be interesting, even if the characters do have idiot balls at times. The MC always stays an ant monster too, no becoming a human, breaking out of VR reality as a human, or ascending to be a human-esque God/Administrator here. 

    One of the better novels in the sorely empty monster reincarnation genre. Nothing really scratches the itch quite like Kumo Desu.

    Everybody Also Loves Large Chests also features a chest mimic MC, but it can be...a bit explicit. Very explicit. And gore. And a mix of the two. The ending is pretty terrible but it’s a decent monster MC novel, if you can disregard these negatives.

I was unfamiliar with many of the other settings and enjoyed it regardless, but since they are adventures bookended with the more familiar Worm setting it was enough to know a lot about the general kind of story. The setting switching aspect was interesting to me -- Taylor's universe is one form of gritty superhero end of the world drama, but very different from any random supernatural horror, comic book dystopia, etc.

  Second request I make in this thread, can someone recommend some fantasy series with a focus on munchkinry?. Pls only works with more than 200.000 words or at least 2 books and please assume that I already know WtC, all of wildbow's fictions, or the other works that are recommended every thread. Thx.
