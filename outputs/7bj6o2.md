  > “- we should run’. But then this guy was all like ‘Yeah, you better run’. So, you know, I shot him in the eye. And I’m going to be honest with you here, Catherine, they didn’t take well to that. At all.”

  I am *so* happy with the Woe

    ```
    What was she going to do? Not shoot him in the eye? That wouldn't have made the situation any better.

    Well, the peerless beauty whose approval I secretly crave can't be *wrong*.

  >“What happened to your spirit of adventure?” I replied.

  >“That’s a myth,” he said disdainfully, slapping away my hand. “Father’s dissected several heroes and never found any trace of it.”

  Masego has to be doing that on purpose, there's no way he's this funny by accident.

    ```
    I think it was hinted before he has this compulsion to be overly precise, and just can't help himself. It just makes it even more funny, in my opinion
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      He might be intentionally playing into his tic.
      ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  This series has some of the best dialogue and banter I've ever read.
  ```

- u/panchoadrenalina:
  ```
  i really like the quotes of the Dread emperor Irritant, he is great

    ```
    Me too. I'd like to read more on how he was "oddly successful".

  >I turned without needing to be hailed, and discomfort flickered across her face.

  >I clapped his shoulder, and even being careful nearly sent him tumbling to the ground.

  It's the little things like these that make this story for me. Casual lines that have no plot relevance but their absence would make the reading so much less interesting and the setting so much less defined. I should be taking notes, really.

  > “Let it be a surprise,” I said. “He loves those.”

  > “You know I despise surprises,” Masego said, glaring at me.  

  > Impressive, considering he had no eyes.  

  Hehehehehe

  What happened to Zombie?
