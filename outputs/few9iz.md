## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I may have asked this before, but recent events have made my old answer obsolete.

  A witch owes you a favor and will grant you the ability to transform into the animal of your choice. However, there's a drawback: you'll experience headaches and nausea proportionate to how cool the animal is. It's known that picking a tiger or falcon will make you pass out from nausea, while picking a blobfish or tapeworm will have no side effects.

  It's hard to exactly pin down how cool an animal is, but there are some guidelines. If it's at all likely to be a random ten year old's favorite animal, you're treading on dangerous ground. Any animal that's been religiously significant to any culture is sketchy. If you go to a bar and try to impress an attractive stranger with your transformation ability, and revealing which animal you can transform into is a letdown, that's a good sign. Obscure animals are dicey because their coolness is primarily determined by people who've heard of them, who tend to be animal nerds. The "pick a specific unknown version of a more generally known animal" ploy does not work - a Taita Falcon is still a falcon.

  This takes place in the modern world. Everyone knows magic exists, but it's rare and doesn't have any radical culture-warping effects.

  What's the best animal to choose?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Can I choose a human? Specifically, a nerdy wimpy unattractive human teenager?

    A random 10-year old is not likely to understand that humans are animals, and more unlikely to say that humans are the favorite animal. Humans are not religiously significant since they are the worshipers, not the worshipees. (There are religious gods that look human, but they aren't really human so I don't think they count? At best, they are hybrid demigods, with the genes of gods.) Finally, a nerdy wimpy unattractive human teenager is not particularly cool, and likely to letdown the attractive stranger. So I expect the nausea levels to be low.

    Now the question is, does this let me achieve immortality? Or at least buy me a lot more lifespan? After all, I can wait until I'm old, then transform into this teenager.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      Lol this is completely against the spirit of the question. But also very clever. 

      I think you've only doubled your lifespan, not achieved immortality. But that's still pretty good! I'd take that over flight too.
      ```

      - u/Papa-Walrus:
        ```
        I'm a little late to the thread, but I think how much you've expanded your life span depends on a few things. Does the transformed body age normally? What happens to your "original" body while transformed? If you live as the teenager long enough that you age into your mid-20's, return to your original form, then transform back into the teenager, are you still in your 20's, or are you a teenager again?

        If the transformed body doesn't age (as one *may* assume since the specific transformation includes "teenager" as part of the description), then you can just stay a teenager for eternity (assuming that your "original" body doesn't continue aging in some way *or* that when the original body dies from old age, that the transformed body is not affected until your try to un-transform).

        Or if the original only ages when you're in that body, and returning that form and then transforming again makes you a teenager again, then you would end up with a life span of (your normal lifespan * average time you spend transformed before "refreshing" the transformation) / how much your original body ages when you "refresh" the transformation.

    Common bird, such as a pigeon. You can fly now, but still have pretty good vision. Kids that like birds will choose parrots, owls, predator birds, etc. 

    City Rat. You can fit through small gaps and have a strong sense of smell. You can chew through things. Too common to be cool by most metrics.

    Wasp. Scorpions and spiders are scary and cool to some kids, but I think the vast majority will agree that wasps are fucking terrifying and uncool. Best choice might be Paper Wasp.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      Pigeons are pretty good, though they do have quite a few predators, so it's a dangerous form to use. The previous record-holder was a better flyer with fewer predators and a bad reputation, but >!Untitled Goose Game has made the awful behavior of geese cool now.!<

      I'm not sure what the utility of being a wasp is.
      ```

      - u/pldl:
        ```
        Depends on how fast you can transform.

        A wasp's only utility is that it causes pain and can fly, unlike other insects which would have to crawl in order to do so.

        A lot of the most painful/venomous wasps are typically not aggressive, so a smarter and more aggressive wasp would be terrifying.

    And no, you can't do any sort of conservation of energy shenanigans with magic. It operates under an equivalent exchange system that's so good at calculating value that you'll never win^(*). The only wide-scale economic use of magic is hedge funds observing the costs of magic abilities to extract information about arbitrage opportunities. They'll pay you about twice minimum wage to repeatedly transforming while hooked up to various sensors.

    ^(*) Climbing onto a lever and transforming into a heavy animal costs a number of calories that depends on how efficient of a generator that lever is hooked up to and how expensive the food you eat is. Your magic is safe from this for personal use because it's powered by a witch owing you a favor, but that's not an infinite power source.
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      Couldn't you hook the arbitrage detector up to a prediction market and get an oracle? If you ask it what will be written on a piece of paper, then write that prediction on that piece of paper, which way does it resolve the stable time loop? Maybe you get a phone line to Nyarlathotep.
      ```

      - u/jtolmar:
        ```
        They take a bunch of people who can do magic, try to get them to do the kind of things that /r/rational usually comes up with, and observe the costs of the magic / ask the users how hard it was. Like you get the guy who can turn into a hippo to stand on a lever, transform, and report how hard that is a few times, then you record the difference between the times where the lever is hooked up to a generator and those where it isn't, then you compare that to the usual differences, then you compare that to the experiments with leprechaun gold in the room next over, then you use this to adjust your fund's positions on power generation vs gold.

        It's just an extended joke about magic being so good at computing equivalent value to prevent itself from being exploited that its ability to compute equivalent value is worth exploiting.

        Is there actually a way to turn that into an oracle?
        ```

        - u/covert_operator100:
          ```
          This is probably stretching it too far, but you program a machine to hire people to do certain jobs, based on how much power it receives. Then whatever amount of energy it takes to perform the power generating process, is equivalent to your expected profit from the job. You personally can't gain anything from that, but your friends who can also profit from it, can then invest in the job that gives you more profit.
          ```

        - u/Gurkenglas:
          ```
          Have a program buy shares in "Bernie Yes" https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3633/Who-will-win-the-2020-Democratic-presidential-nomination and deposit any eventual returns to the shapeshifter's account iff a camera detects that you turned into a hippo. Depending on the calorie cost, the market will or won't resolve Yes.
          ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Thought of some more radical options:

    * The [Immortal Jellyfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis_dohrnii). Could choosing this give you immortality, provided you could create and maintain a suitable aquatic environment for yourself after transformation and never change back? Nausea may or may not be a problem depending on which rules have precedent over the others. If the "pick a specific unknown version" rule takes precedence, then since jellyfish are well known, and not particularly cool in general, the nausea levels should be fine. On the other hand, if the  "obscure animals" rule takes precedence, most people who know of the immortal jellyfish find it very very cool since its immortal, so the nausea levels will be devastating.
    * Pick any animal that reproduces by [fragmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragmentation_(reproduction)). Now when you transform, can you split up your body into separate bodies that are all you, then transform back to have multiple copies of you? Meaning free and easy self-cloning? This option is also pretty safe in terms of nausea, since many animals that do this are worms, which are icky and uncool.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      Immortality is a pretty good hack! You'd have to be a jellyfish though. I guess you need to build yourself a tank and a jellyfish-operable computer, and live most of your life online. Probably ration your human lifetime in case your care/maintenance workers do something sketchy? It's a lot like being paralyzed, but you live forever.

      I'm going to assume cloning yourself using worm magic goes all Sorcerer's Apprentice in record time.
      ```

    - u/GreenGriffin8:
      ```
      The fragmentation idea has many problems.  First, do you have any control over your fragments?  Given that most animals aren't capable of human level thought, your consciousness is likely disembodied and has a connection to your animal's nervous system.  If you reproduce while a worm, your consciousness may be detached, and remain disembodied forever, or simply cease to exist.

      Even if you can control all your fragments, when you reproduce by fragmentation, it's likely that when you turn back to human form, you will simply be left in pieces.  There would be no single worm to replace with a human, the original worm no longer existing.

      At this point it is unclear what would happen if you turned back into a worm before your brain died from oxygen deprivation, assuming your brain was even in one piece.  The first possibility is you'd transform back into multiple worms, in which case you'd have a permanent transformation into a conscious colony of worms.

      Alternately, you might just transform into a single worm, in pieces of a similar proportion to your human form.  If your worm can regenerate from said pieces, you might be alright, but you'd still be stuck in the form of a sentient worm colony.

    Turkey vulture.  Big flyer, high on the food chain, so few things hunting it.  So undesirable that it probably prevents potential headaches from happening.
    ```

- u/sparr:
  ```
  From my roommates:

  You have a traditional immovable rod, with a button that triggers its immovability, which is relative to the local gravity well (planet, usually).

  You also have a wand that produces one whole tomato per second when desired.

  Ignoring all the ways you could munchkin the immovable rod on its own, what else could you accomplish with the addition of the tomato wand?
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    If you find an efficient way to burn tomatoes, you can get up to 136kw of power out of the wand.

    I thought you might be able to use the immovable rod to mount the tomato wand very high and drop tomatoes into a turbine to harvest their energy, but tomatoes are pretty light and it's just not that much. It's roughly one watt per meter (mgh, mass ~0.1kg and g ~10m/s/s so they cancel out), so you'd need to mount it 136km high before it outperforms burning tomatoes. And of course they're not going to fall neatly to where you want them to through the atmosphere.

    Best bet is space travel. You've got a source of not only food (though it's tomatoes, ugh) and power, but also just organic molecules in general. There's probably a way to get oxygen out of a tomato. And you can use an immovable rod for propulsion.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Well, heat death is no longer a concern, so that's nice.

    You can use the immovable rod to get into geosynch easily, but I'm not sure how to use it with a tomato wand in any relevant manner. The tomatoes are made too slowly to change what gravity well the rod is anchored to. I suppose you might be able to do things with lagrange points, but we can already do those things with mundane technology.

    The tomato wand could be used to very slowly accelerate the death of a star by adding mass. This is also the most convenient means of transforming tomatoes into heavy elements.

    If you staple the wand to the rod, you could drop them just above the event horizon of a black hole, press the button, and then inject mass into the black hole from a perfectly safe platform. Biggest problem with this is the possible destruction of the wand through extreme temperatures in the accretion disk, so this might just be a bad idea.

    Over a very, very long period the wand could be used to make artificial black holes. I once determined that the schwartzchild radius of a cubic lightyear of just about anything except interstellar void is significantly smaller than a cubic lightyear. This is yet another means of transforming tomatoes into exotic elements.
    ```

  - u/D0TheMath:
    ```
    This could be used as a pretty nifty bomb. If you launch both into space, have them orbit the Sun for 1,000 years, desire for tomatoes to be created constantly for 1,000 years, then activate the rod to cease motion, and then deactivate it, the now planet-sized tomato (about 1.6 million km in radius) will accelerate down. If you choose where you accelerate it to, you could get it to accelerate down and hit the Earth, killing everyone. 

    On a related note, in 1,000 years you could also just have a tomato sized planet... so if you ever wanted that, you could do it. 

    There's probably a way you could play with momentum with the tomato wand. Say you're going very fast, like 99% of c. Then you start creating tomatoes for 1,000 years. Now you have a tomato planet going 99% of c, which has a greater momentum and kinetic energy than you had originally. 

    On second thought, the first part wouldn't work too well. The tomatoes would be going so fast that they'd probably just break through the wand, and only the wand would fall to the Earth. We'd then just be left with a tomato planet. 

    If we found a way to extract usable carbon from tomatoes, then we'd have a useful source of useful carbon. 

    If you're able to get the wand in someone's nose, ear, or mouth, then you could likely kill them. Even if you stabbed them with the wand, if you put a tomato in there, the wound would get pretty big. 

    Ooo! Take the immovable rod, if it is able to also bestow immovability to things around it, or we can warp it in some way, we can surround the tomato wand with immovable substance, then desire for the wand to produce tomatoes. The smaller the enclosure the better. Keep this going for a significant length of time, then heat it up. Now we have a high-pressured tomato bomb, we can trigger with the push of a button. 1000 years would be preferable, but in only 1 year, we'd have something with the mass equivalent of a tomato planet with 1/6th the radius of the Earth in an enclosed area. I'm sure if you opened this, it'd be the worst disaster in the history of the planet. Whether or not any countries would believe your feat, and be willing to negotiate for you not to open it is a different question.

    If we left the rod going for a year, its total mass produced would be about 3.6 million kg, assuming .115kg per tomato. We could burn this for fuel, however the amount of CO2 released would be enormous, and disastrous for the environment. If we are able to build a chamber able to withstand an enormous amount of pressure without breaking, we'd probably be able to generate enough thrust to enter Earth's orbit. It'd also allow us to generate free rocket fuel. This is where the momentum thing comes in. Generate a crap tone of tomatoes, launch them off the rocket. Now you're going faster than you were before. 

    **Final conclusion: Use the tomato wand to create a highly pressured tank filled with tomatoes. Put that tank on a rocket, and get into orbit, now we have a free source of fuel to the rest of the universe. This technically doesn't require the use of the immovable rod, and potential issues could be the lack of a way to easily take the wand out of the tank, or the potential damage the wand could undergo inside of the tank. The former could be fixed by simply placing the wand fully inside the tank, and making the openings small enough that the wand can't fall out, and numerous enough that the wand can't block the exit. We still have the issue of potential damage done to the wand.**

    EDIT: we could also just have a mechanism to throw the tomatoes overboard for acceleration. This produces less thrust, but is also less susceptible to failures that could result in unleashing a sixth-of-a-planet-sized-glob-of-pressurized-tomatoes bomb into your ship.

    EDIT2: I'm sure engineers could figure out a way to make the wand removable, through some sort of fancy plug system.

      1000 years is about 3E10 seconds. 3E10 3-cm-radius tomatoes is about 3.6E6 cubic meters of tomato, or a sphere about 284km in radius. Where did you get 1.6 M km?

    Assuming that the tomatoes are identical to each other, it could potentially be very useful in scientific research. One of the difficulties in experiments is trying to set a constant baseline for each trial, so having an entire tomato being identical regardless of other factors could be invaluable to biological research. The standardised tomato could become the new petri dish.

    In the same line, it could also become an easily measurable fundamental constant - you could then redefine units of measurement against this one, and have, for example, a kilogram being exactly 1.124 Matos.

    You can also look at how the tomatoes are spawned. If they expand outwards from a point, can you use it to crack open rocks? If it replaces air, can you use it to destroy gasses? Etc. 

    And if you want to use it in conjunction with the immovable rod... I have no idea. Maybe skewer the tomatoes with it and roast them over a fire.

  You are a 15 year old peasant girl in a secondary world fantasy that is equivalent in technology to around 14th century England (Late Middle Ages). The known world is about the size of continental Europe, and is politically and culturally similar, though the specifics of religion are different.

  Magic has been inert for thousands of years, but it is widely accepted to have once been a potent force in the world.

  Your mother, an alchemist, is blinded in an experiment moments after potency begins slowly returning to magic. The specific way in which she was blinded triggers a phenomenon called “Awestrike” – where the blinded person momentarily glimpses the current state of the universe. The experience is overwhelming and momentary, with much of the gained knowledge being forgotten as a dream melts away upon waking. A person cannot experience this twice.

  Your mother cannot remember the details but she convinces you that in around 500 years an existential threat to humanity will arise. She says that the only chance for survival when that day comes is if the threat meets with a united humanity that has one of her descendants in a position of power.

  Around the same time, you discover that if you maintain eye contact with someone (you can clearly see their retinas and they can see yours) while you issue a command with intention – they are magically compelled to complete that command. You learn from your mother that all your descendants will also have this power. A command can only be superseded by a more recent command.

  Your goal is to have a unified humanity in 500 years, with one of your descendants in a position of power. 

  You will not live an abnormally long life. You have no knowledge of what strange technologies or magics will emerge in the future. 

  You can compel people to follow your orders if you issue the order while maintaining clear eye contact, and all of your descendants will also have this power. 

  Nobody else has this power, though people are aware that such things could be possible with magic.

  **What is your plan to maximize the likelihood of that future and what difficulties do you anticipate?**
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Mind control and 500 years of prep time seems like way more than enough to accomplish the goal. The biggest problem I foresee is just making sure that your conspiracy survives 500 years, which hereditary mind control can solve too. Second biggest problem is suspicion about your hereditary mind control abilities leading to a witch hunt.

    You need a carefully phrased command for your descendants that tells them to go along with the plan, never issue a command that supersedes this command, give this same command to all their descendants at birth up until the deadline, and have lots of kids. And, you know, communicates the reason for all of this as nicely as possible so people aren't straining to resist it.

    Then you probably "seduce" (mind control) a noble for power, have as many kids as possible, and get them married into other influential families, preferably far-flung ones. All your descendants are bound to play along with the plan, so they can form a regular old network of nepotism and favoritism to get each other into positions of power, with no ability to turn into factions against each other. After a generation or two the extended family will have enough power that everyone can lay off the mind control almost entirely in favor of nepotism enforced by that from-birth command. You probably enforce discretion with this ability as part of the command.

      The world has to be unified in the sense that when the threat arrives all the world's resources and might can be quickly mobilized in whatever way neccessary to combat the threat. There will be little time for delay caused by distrust amongst nations.

      Your descendent must just be in a position to co-ordinate the threat response. For plot reasons I'd prefer that the end-state include your descendent as a public supreme ruler, but if there's a better way to accomplish the goal that's more important.
