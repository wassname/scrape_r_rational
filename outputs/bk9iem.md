## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

    Well the author /u/fawnmod has been active on reddit within the last month, so maybe they'll drop in? I enjoyed that story as well, hope it continues.

      After I got my PhD, I immediately switched fields, and have been trying to get re-situated for the last year.  Also weddings have a way of eating up a tremendous amount of your free time :D

      I very much would like to finish it.  Probably won't be able to dedicate time to it for another couple months at least, though.

  I have been trying to get into the arts recently. More specifically drawing and voice acting. Does anyone with experience in either of these fields have recommendations on tablets (for drawing) and microphones/recording software? I would prefer cheap/free recording/editing software for audio.

  Additionally does anyone have suggestions for online part time work? I'm not against freelance writing but would prefer a steady income over piecemeal gains. I'm not comfortable enough with my art to try and take commissions.

    Audacity for audio editing.

    As for tablets.. You really can't go wrong with a wacom. I'd say get a cheap or second hand one just initially to get the hang of it.. And then invest in a really good one with more pressure sensitivity.  It is frustrating beyond belief dealing with the hang ups that come with the cheap tablets.. i.e. Pen not detected, stuck point, slow brushes.. (I completely dropped digital art at one point rather than trying to coax my tablet to work) 

    Also you should have a decent amount of RAM to prevent slow brushes and crashes.

      Audacity was a god send. Thank you so much.

      I will definitely check out those traits for tablets.

    You can look into online transcription work, which can pay very well if you have a secondary language or "professional" vocabulary skills such as medical or other specific backgrounds.

    Piecemeal: I've always found the idea of writing college papers for pay online extremely interesting. High paying, high variety, and develops skills with only ethical downsides for you.

  An update on my spine and shoulder injuries: I started physical therapy last week and am in more pain because I've been using my shoulders for stretching and exercises they gave me. It is disheartening to be in constant pain but my PT says that will subside. The only issue is that I have trouble sleeping for more than a few hours.

  On a more positive note, I have started doing more than training at work and that helps me feel more fulfilled existentially and has brought up my self confidence. Ive been dressing better and my new healthcare kicked in on the first and now I can go see an orthopedic as well as switch back to my old PCP. I feel more like a proper adult and have been able to finance going to several events I couldnt previously afford since college.

  How is everyone else doing?

    Glad to hear that you're doing better! I hope you have a smooth recovery.

    I injured my foot last week while running with a weight vest. The doc said it was a stress reaction, the precursor to a fracture, and that my foot should be fine in around 4 weeks. They gave me a boot and crutches and sent me on my way.

    I've never significantly injured my lower body before. The decrease in mobility _sucks_. Nothing is walking distance anymore!

    While we're on the topic of injuries, allow me to rant about how much the US healthcare system sucks. **The US healthcare system sucks.** It's appalling that the only superpower in the world has such a shit healthcare system to care for its citizens.

    I spent several years living in a different first-world country with my partner. My partner would often tell me, "Ratthrow, I went to hospital today" and my US-raised ears would perk up because I thought something terrible had happened. But no, it was just a minor health-related issue and going to the hospital was no different than taking your car to the mechanic when it's making a weird noise. Which is how it should be!

    I am diligent, intelligent, have an extremely flexible schedule, and two of my closest friends are doctors. I do not skimp on health insurance and my doctor friends helped me pick my plan. I recognize myself as privileged.

    It still took me 2 weeks to get a routine physical and it cost me $500 because I accidentally went to a doctor that was out of my network. What the fuck?? In every other first world country it's just rolled into your taxes and you can go see whatever fucking doctor you want when there's something wrong with you.

    I can't even imagine what the burden is like for for people in the US with more difficult circumstances. This is a fucking travesty.
    ```

      I hope the physicians talked to you about running with a vest, if they did skip this paragraph: There's really no reason to do cardio with extra weight if you don't have to, it's extremely hard on the wrong structures. It's like adding 5x-10x the weights impact to your fascia and bones for (weight added/your weight) more muscle work. You can just run faster/further without weight instead, and lift seperately for far better outcomes.

      If it won't cost you an arm and a leg I'd recommend going to a physical therapist. You're their dream patient since you're already active, they can help fix what led to the stress fracture there, deal with post-boot muscle weaknesses, and head off other weak points that might fail as you push yourself in the future. But as a fellow US citizen I know it sucks that this kind of prevention and rehab can be so expensive. 

      Good luck with recovery, and keep in mind how absurd our medical system is even for those not disadvantaged!
      ```

      - u/ratthrow:
        ```
        Thanks, I'm aware that running with weights is almost all downside with little upside. It was the assigned workout of the day at my gym so I thought I'd just go with it. Won't be doing that in the future!
        ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    Definitely mention the sleeping issues to your PTs, they can recommend pillow and lying modifications to hopefully help. Put in the work and take notes for when the therapy ends so you can do some on your own or treat flareups/tightness, it will help in the long run!

    Good to hear you're working on recovery and making progress at work! Good luck!

  I'm getting close to posting the last of my backlog for [Donjon](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/donjon-worm-oc-seattle.734914/), and I'm worried about being able to maintain my update schedule. I know I'm capable of writing the necessary 750 words a day, but I keep finding myself getting distracted or caught up in other things and it ends up not getting done.

  Do any of the more experienced writers on here have advice on creating and maintaining a writing habit? I know there isn't any silver bullet or way to avoid hard work, but I'd really appreciate a starting point or some principles to keep in mind.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    * Write at the same time every day, to help train "it's writing time"
    * Write in the same place every time, see above
    * Don't push yourself too hard, because that leads to burnout
    * If you find yourself distracted by other things, try introducing trivial inconveniences to those behaviors. Things like removing Steam or Discord from the taskbar, or more intensively, installing a Chrome extension that will make you jump through a lot of hoops to get on reddit during writing time. The specifics here really depend on what it is you wind up doing when you've said to yourself that you should be writing. Maybe put your cellphone in a Mason jar that's screwed tight? The point isn't to hamstring yourself and force yourself into writing, it's to break the muscle memory of your distraction habits.
    * Streak as much as possible, though tracking streaks is a bit of a double-edged sword, because for some people, breaking a streak of "X days writing" would cause them to just fall off the wagon entirely, or they would feel like any smudge on an otherwise perfect record makes the whole thing meaningless.

      Having separate rooms and laptops for leisure and work also helps a lot.
      ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    One trick I used to use a lot was to go somewhere (e.g., coffeeshop, a park) with just a notebook and a few pencils. This let me write distraction-free. It kind of sucked, because I had to type my writing into the computer later, but it was worth it because it actually got words written.

    Now that I've built up the habit, it's not really necessary anymore. (Although, you know, here I am on reddit, instead of writing, whoops.)

  Hey people here might be interested in a website I just discovered on r/nootropics.

  It's called [Nootropics City](https://nootropicscity.com/) and it's meant to be an easy way to buy the pills determined by the subreddit for the best and safest improvements.

  Obviously, study the wiki on the subreddit, spend some time doing research, and possibly consult a doctor if needed before making a decision to start taking nootropics. But if you choose to, then the website makes the whole process of obtaining the needed pills so much easier.

  EDIT: I should supplement this comment with the standard warning that "No nootropic is a substitute for a good nights sleep, a healthy and active lifestyle and learning to motivate yourself." So if you have to decide between spending money on pills or on eating, sleeping, and exercising well, go with the latter.

  Been reading the unwanted undead adventurer I want to say it had a few dashes of rational in it.

    Oh hey thanks for posting this, I forgot the name of that novel and lost its details with the issues with my old computer.

    For anyone unfamiliar with it, I think it does a great job building up the main character's place in the world in his own mind and contrasting with the perspectives of other characters in the first novel. The second and third are just solid adventure novels that don't really compare to the scene setting of the first though, and the fourth I'm about to read on my phone now I found this novel again.

    If anyone else likes light novels that flirt with rationality, I'd recommend Overlord for the depth it explores character motivations and the main character's caution in all his actions, but the amount of "flying by the seat of his pants"-esque luck may be a downer to some folks.

  I have been looking at getting a 3D printer.  Looking at it. Wouldn't getting a a little CnC machine actually just be more efficient and cool?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    [This printer](https://www.conrad.de/de/p/renkforce-rf2000-3d-drucker-1395717.html) has an expansion kit that can [turn it into a CnC machine!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoTuJVILzjM)

    I use the printer at work, it's really sturdy and I don't doubt you can machine wood and plastics with it. Not quite sold on the use of adhesive tape as a printing surface, it's a bit finicky to get to work with anything but standard filaments, and when you really want to crank the heating bed temperature up it leaves nasty sticky residue.

    ----

    The main question you should ask yourself is: "Why do I want a 3D Printer?"  
    If you're just curious about the fad, I don't recommend it unless you've got too much money and free time. Better find a local makerspace and see if you can try it out there.  
    If there's a single, specific part you want to manufacture, it's probably still easier to have it done on someone else's printer, either in a makerspace or with an online shop.  
    Really the only reason to get one is if you anticipate making a lot of different, complicated plastic parts. Small gifts to friends and family, little repairs and replacement parts, perhaps mockups of parts you want to build out of metal...
    ```

  - u/traverseda:
    ```
    It's going to be a lot harder to actually turn design files into parts. If you're thinking about this, I'd recommend first finding a model and turning it into a tool path for a CnC machine, as practice.

  well, firefox just shot itself in the foot on a friday night. very glad it was so easy to import all my bookmarks to chrome, which can use ublock.

      Some time ago, Firefox implemented a security system for addons.  Yesterday, it failed and blocked (almost?) everything.
      ```

    - u/Teulisch:
      ```
      adblock, ublock, and a ton of other addons removed themselves, and cannot be redownloaded.

    Not Firefox's problem; the signatures on many extensions depend upon certificates where the intermediary certificate between the signing cert and the trust root has expired: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1548973
    ```

    - u/VirtueOrderDignity:
      ```
      It absolutely is Firefox's problem, because Firefox automatically blocks "insecure" extensions rather than trust its users or even ask for confirmation.

  Anyone who's thought about job hunting via triplebyte but has been putting it off for whatever reason: there's a promotion at the moment where if you are referred, and end up getting (and accepting) a job via them, the referrer gets a $5000 bonus. If you're interested anyway, and feel like helping a random fellow subreddit user out, DM me and I can refer you.

  The referral process is a bit odd but basically there's a form on their website that I'd submit your email address to, and then you'd receive an email from triplebyte for account creation.

  I'm at a point in my life where $5000 would be very useful but not life-altering; if someone else can also refer people but has more need for the money then drop a reply (and don't be bashful; I'm not super well-off currently but I'm about to graduate and already have a job lined up, plus I live in the UK so I don't need to worry about healthcare).

  (triplebyte is/was in the SSC sidebar; they find you a coding job by giving you coding tests to do, rather than looking at a resume. They're US-only as far as I know)
