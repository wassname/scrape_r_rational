  Holy shit. Walk through this with me here, because Visser 3 has a horrible, horrible card up his sleeve. And possibly, so do the kids. 

  > Clearly, the morphing technology took more than just a DNA sample. There had to be some kind of scanning going on during the acquiring process, or else all kinds of things would have been different—I'd read, for instance, that height had almost as much to do with hormones and nutrition as it did with actual genes.

  It is confirmed that when you acquire a morph you don't just get the genes. 

  Now look at this: 

  > One—the Andalites had successfully replaced a human girl, with mimicry on par with that of a Yeerk. Conclusion: someone else in the Andalite chain of command had discovered Alloran's little back door.

  Alloran has a "back door" and the reason that this is brought up is because an Andalite has displayed "mimicry on par with that of a Yeerk." 

  Meaning? Acquiring a morph grabs the person's memories as well, and Alloran knows how to access those memories. Meaning that Visser 3 knows how.

  Which means that Visser 3 wouldn't have to put a Yeerk in, say, Jake's head to find out everything that Jake knows. He would just have to acquire Jake, morph Jake, and then use the Back Door. 

  The one silver lining here is that the same goes for the Animorphs and accessing Elfangor.
  ```

    ```
    Yep. I think that might actually be the key (or one of them) to giving the kids a fighting chance in this AU... or how they all get killed/Controlled :D  It's important to note that morphing already gives you the creature's instincts and whatnot, so unlocking the memories hidden in the neurology should be a cool "aha" moment.
    ```

    >Which means that Visser 3 wouldn't have to put a Yeerk in, say, Jake's head to find out everything that Jake knows. He would just have to acquire Jake, morph Jake, and then use the Back Door.

    If Visser 3's backdoor is related to the intereference in nervous systems between two instances of the same morph at once we saw in the previous chapter, it may be possible for him to get at Jake's memories by being morphed into the same morph as Jake at the same time. Any bets on whether Visser 3/Alloran has acquired Elfhangor?

    If this theory is confirmed, I have to wonder how the Frolis Maneuver will factor in to this AU's altered morphing abilities and what that means to the plot, if it will exist in this fic at all.

    Given these morphing developments we learn in these last two chapters, I wonder if that means a Frolis morphed person can access not just the shared DNA but the shared memories of the morphed individuals. I hope we'll see soon when Ax shows up! It could probably cut out a lot of Ax's brand of buffoonery with getting used to Human Stuff when/if he does the Frolis Maneuver.

    Not just trolling, and I appreciate the thoughts, but I still can't get over his name spelled with the number "3". Visser Three is threatening to me when it's spelled out.  Same reason no one spells "Dr. Who".  

    Sorry I just discovered this sub and my nostalgia is pumped as hell right now!

  This is my favorite chapter. 

  > Conclusion: someone else in the Andalite chain of command had discovered Alloran's little back door.

  I think we have confirmation that morphed bodies have their original memories. 

  I like that V3 is keeping open different possibilities as he thinks, and not just deciding that one or the other is *the* correct solution. 

  > Even the coercive demorphing field, so close to functional, might no longer hold any promise.

  That... does not sound like a good thing. 

  > (((Oh yes, they were made for one another, if only the warrior could see past the narrow interests of his native species, and take the larger view—)))

  Larger view. *Larger view*. That doesn't sound like V3 is just interested in being Head Honcho of the Yeerks for the sake of being Head Honcho. 

  > For a moment, Esplin enjoyed the feeling of camaraderie as he and his host were united by their shared frustration at the eternal incompetence of underlings.

  Ahaha.

      I also love stories that give you perspectives from all sides, like this one is doing. I like seeing where they get it wrong and where they get it right. 

      There's a fic out there from the POV of Lex Luthor, where he meets with Bruce Wayne and has a little conversation with Bruce. "I know the truth: *You're funding Batman.*" 

      And yeah it's wrong but Lex gives his reasoning and... it wasn't silly or anything, Lex was just missing a couple of key pieces of information.
      ```

      - u/notentirelyrandom:
        ```
        "Inviolate," I believe. I liked that fic, especially that scene.

        And then in the climactic showdown at the end, the narration still refers to the guy wearing the Bat-stuff as Matches Malone, because from Lex's point of view that's just obvious.
        ```

        - u/callmebrotherg:
          ```
          Yes it is. 

          I liked that part too. 

          The fic also made me want to see an AU where things were how Luthor thought them to be, and The Joker wanted to be Batman again.
          ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    > That... does not sound like a good thing

    It's from canon, no less. Worked too; put them in the box and they'll demorph, letting you pick those tasty Andalite brains. (The Animorphs faked it out by letting Tobias be captured and tortured.)

  - u/TimTravel:
    ```
    > I think we have confirmation that morphed bodies have their original memories. 

    Tobias morphed Marco without noticing morphed memories.

      There wouldn't be an "Alloran's back door" for "someone else in the Andalite chain of command" to notice if it were obvious, would it? >:]

  > Seven? Fourteen?

  I like that they have a different base number system, probably due to Andalites having 7 fingers. It really makes no sense for aliens to have base 10.

    ```
    Ho dang, I didn't catch that. I *like*.
    ```

    - u/CopperZirconium:
      ```
      I know right! For aliens to use base 10 is slightly ridiculous because many different earth cultures have used [different bases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_numeral_systems), and ten isn't even the best to use. (Base 12 or 60 makes much more sense, rationally.)
      ```

- u/junkbait:
  ```
  Wonderful job to the author of this fic, and the authors for this chapter! My only complaint is that the parentheses can be a bit confusing, are they used as an aside for their shared thinking, or are they thought-speaking to each other, replacing the greater-than/less-than symbols? Amazing fic overall, so far!

  It's incredible to see the, IMO, very believable breakdown of how their thinking would work in this AU. What took book-canon Esplin three years to realize, only took him three days in this fic... These kids are in some deep shit.

  I'm glad that it seems as though Esplin still has starts of being just as paranoid as his book-canon self, if not more so. It's one of my favorite things about post-TAC/THBC Esplin, and it'd just make no sense and be pretty boring if that were eliminated entirely from his character, no matter how competent and confident he is in a rational AU.
  I'm excited if their shared POV chapters become a regular thing, but if not, then I'm glad we at least got this chapter!

  > Maybe some of the lonelier sort would morph and seek mates among the humans, as rumor said had been done during the conquest of the Hork-Bajir, on the homeworld of the Arn—perhaps Esplin and Alloran would give it a try, together?

  Hahaha! Oh Esplin, just couldn't help himself.

  Though now that this was mentioned... I wonder if we'll find out how THBC and TAC worked out, if I'm understanding correctly, if a morpher loses their personal sapience when they nothlit? Will Toby even exist in this AU? Or can the nothlit issue be explained by there being new and altered Escafil devices by the time Elfangor gives the kids the morphing power?

    I agree. It also seems like a fair flaw for a character with a rational to still have.  He is so competent at most things, he can't empathize well or understand his incompetent underlings.  He can think of all kinds of ridiculously clever schemes and attacks, so in turn, he is constantly on guard and expending effort on absurd possibilities (actually, this still might be useful if they are anything like canon!animorphs).
    ```

    - u/junkbait:
      ```
      Paranoia, coupled with the stress of being a high-ranking Visser and being constantly frustrated by his subordinates, could possibly do a lot of damage and hinder Esplin and the invasion. If the author does choose to go down this road, I'd love to see how it's done to fit the AU in a way that isn't some cartoonish, Yeerk-Plan-Of-The-Week type of villainy like in the books. And if there's more Esplin/Alloran POV chapters to come, it could explain Esplin's seemingly irrational thought processes and behavior in a way that's completely rational *to him* (and the audience) given his circumstances. Would that still count, I wonder?

      Honestly though, no matter what the author plans to do, I'm excited either way.
      ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Yeah, the parentheticals were an awkward solution.  I was trying to show deeper/nested layers of thought, moving from highest priority/mainline thinking down to less-attentive sub-thoughts.  Parentheses were the only way I could think of to do it on ff.net; if I were publishing on printed pages, I would have done progressively-more-indented blocks of text.
    ```

    - u/junkbait:
      ```
      Ahh I see, that's what I originally thought but wasn't entirely sure. Thanks for clarifying!

      Maybe [] for thought-speak and () for traditional parentheses?

- u/Drazelic:

  My first reaction to that 'snack' thing at the end was basically "Holy shit, Esplin 9466 Lesser is Visser Three in this one".

  Now that I think about it, that's not very likely. Why would anyone tolerate Esplin the Lesser cannibalizing other Yeerks? Why would Esplin the Lesser even need to, if he had access to Kandrona rays?

  I could come up with some justifications for that (Esplin refuses to leave Alloran for any reason, even Kandrona, because why would you make yourself vulnerable like that), but at that point complexity penalties negate any benefit for explaining the 'snack' thing so I'm not hinging my hopes on my idea being right.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    I didn't think about that when I read it, but it's possible that kandrona has a "flavor" (or subjective experience) that's difference when it comes through a Yeerk rather than in its pure form, and that V3 just likes the taste of it. 

    EDIT: Esplin refusing to leave Alloran might *become* a thing, if it isn't already. Was it just maple sugar or whatever that made Yeerks crazy, or did eating Yeerks do that too?
    ```

    - u/Arandur:
      ```
      It was a flavor of oatmeal... Maple and Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal.

    Could an Andilite even digest a Yeerk? They eat through their hooves. I suppose they must have teeth of some sort.

  Hey TK17Studios, I know you list HPMOR as one of your inspirations--I just want to let you know that so far you've surpassed that story in my eyes. I love HPMOR, but so far I love this more. Keep up the really good work, and I can't wait to see where it goes.

  This is my least favorite chapter so far, probably because I don't understand Visser 3's objectives as well as I do the human characters'.

  We start off with him having just received a report. We, the readers, don't get to know to know what the details of that report were.

  Visser 3 takes those details, and at one point suspects that the morphing tech has been revolutionized and that he now has something to blame besides incompetence of the yeerks for all the obstacles and delays they had faced. There's satisfaction and rationalization in this simple conclusion.

  And then things get less simple, less rational, more complex, and we still don't know what exactly was in the details of that report. The character is now holding some kind of Omniscience Ball in place of actual problem-solving. What we have now is an very powerful character leading a large organization and making risky decisions off of irrational conclusions.

  - u/failed_novelty:
    ```
    I disagree. We see what he gets - the messages we see his reactions to them.

    Then r!Visser notices the confusion of his host. There's facts that don't fit the mental model that has been constructed: Visser and the host are confused because no Andalite would leave the Controller alive. They are confused because they cannot explain the shape of the world.  This is the basis of rationality. That lead to the conclusion (still flawed, still not a perfect fit) that Cassie is working with the Andalites.

    We are literally walked through the character's realizations, and we see how it simplifies the mental map of events and makes them better fit the territory.
    ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    The report Visser Three receives is Ispec's testimony, including Ispec's conclusions regarding what "she" saw.  Initially, Visser Three takes these conclusions for truth, because they match reasonably well with what was observed, and (as Cassie pointed out) a morph-capable human is somewhat inconceivable.  It's only once Alloran is confused that Esplin remembers to switch on some skepticism, realizes that he can trust what his underling SAW but not necessarily what his underling THINKS about what was seen, and starts trying to reorder facts in a sensible way.
    ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Also, I disagree with whoever downvoted you for sharing your opinion.  It's not a reader's fault if the text isn't clear, and it's not a flaw to have disagreements about ambiguous things if you have arguments to back it up (which you did).  I do side with failed_novelty on the broader issue, though.

    >__Occam's razor__ (also written as __Ockham's razor__ and in [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) *lex parsimoniae*, which means 'law of parsimony') is a problem-solving principle devised by [William of Ockham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham) (c. 1287–1347), who was an English [Franciscan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franciscan) friar and scholastic philosopher and theologian. The principle states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. Other, more complicated solutions may ultimately prove to provide better predictions, but—in the absence of differences in predictive ability—the fewer assumptions that are made, the better.
