  I think calling it a deconstruction, or even a rational fic, is overselling it. I like this series quite a bit, but it's xianxia played completely straight, and not particularly rational. What it *is* is solidly-written.

      I think a large part of that is that most xianxia is either 1) available only in amateur translation 2) English-language original written by amateurs for free, and almost all of it is serially-published. "Amateur" doesn't mean "bad," but it usually does mean "rough around the edges," and everyone in this sub is probably familiar by now with the issues with serials. *Cradle* is significantly more polished than the web fiction, and because it's released a book at a time, we get things like "arcs" and "closure" and "not a constant back-and-forth escalation for hundreds of thousands of words without room to breathe" (looking at you for that last one, *Pact*).

      Wight wrote a blog post about the genre which I think is very illuminating for understanding what *Cradle* is and where it's going: http://www.willwight.com/a-blog-of-dubious-intent/the-ancestors-of-cradle

      (Speaking of 20-syllable-long attack names, I was super charmed by Yerin's commentary about the Blackflame technique names in the third book. I'm guessing Wight isn't a huge fan either.)

  I do not recommend this series. Characters are one-dimensional, non-sympathetic and lacking the empathy. The plot is straightforward and predictable. I tried to like the books... But after the third book I just felt hollow. I'd rather not live at all than live in that world.
