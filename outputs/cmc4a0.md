## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  A lot of rational stories tend to be very serious and a bit depressing. What I'm looking for are stories that have semi rational goal oriented protagonists while also being a bit more fun and light hearted.

  The best examples of stories that fit this that I've found are:

  **[Nemesis](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nemesis-worm-au.747148/reader)** - Worm AU where Taylor becomes a comedy cape, not for the LOLs but because its a smart choice in her situation.

  **[What's Her Name in Hufflepuff](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/reader)** - Harry Potter SI where the protagonist uses her book knowledge to try to help but doesn't immediately overturn the whole world. 

  **[Dragonspawn](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dragonspawn-my-hero-academia-si.696280/reader)** - My Hero Academia SI where the protagonist doesn't know anything about the world and has the power to turn into a dragon.

    I loved the very silly high-tech/high-sex-drive [*Super Science and Fast Romance*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23539/super-science-fast-romance) that was posted here a while ago. Extremely smart characters who seem to be living during the transition to post-scarcity society, limited only by their huge imaginations.

  - u/Frommerman:

    Just an aside, but I don't really like it when fanfic authors change canon characters' sexuality, as happens in Nemesis. For Worm in particular, Wildbow decided to make Taylor straight specifically because the bullied lesbian high schooler trope is so overused. He didn't need or want that to be part of Taylor's struggles. I feel like trying to drum up sympathy for a character by changing something so fundamental about them, something which actually changing in the real world would be more like a form of soft death for most people, is both somewhat lazy writing and a little disrespectful, both to the author for throwing out a huge part of their character on a whim, and maybe even a little to members of those communities, though I would never try to speak for them.

    I can get it in worlds with no apparent gay characters, or with side characters whose sexualities didn't come up in canon. The Wormverse, however, does minority representation well enough that neither of those are reasonable excuses.

    Anyway, this is just a personal preference, and I don't think less of anyone for disagreeing. I just find it strange that people do that with characters.

    /rant
    ```

    - u/wertwert765:
      ```
      I think I fundamentally disagree. I think whats awesome about fanfics is that you *can* throw out huge parts of characters on a whim. Because while Wildbow might have had a reason for writing the story that way, this isn't Wildbow's story. This is someone else's story, using Wildbow's story as a jumping off point. If you want to write a story where Taylor becomes a kpop star, you can. If you want to write a story where Taylor is a psychopath serial killer, you can. If you want to write Taylor as an asexual trans man, you can.

      Now we can talk about specifics and determine if we feel it is lazy pandering or not. I don't know if the author of Nemesis made Taylor a lesbian for some story reason or because they wanted to see more lesbian representation or they just think lesbians are hot. But I don't believe the original work is some sacred text worthy of such respect that we are afraid to change things about the characters because it might be disrespectful.

      I guess for me I don't see changing a character's sexuality as any different as changing anything else about them. And for me the fun of fanfics is changing things. If I wanted everything to be the same, I would just read the original work.
      ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      In wormfic, it's just naked fanservice.  For whatever reason, the SB readers in particular *fucking love lesbians*.
      ```

      - u/sephirothrr:
        ```
        eh, I think it's more the case that the (mostly male) readers prefer pairings with women, and as the majority of the major characters in Worm are also women, it sort of becomes the default
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I don't mind it on principle, throwing out parts of cannon is what fanfics are about, but it's rarely well executed. The Taylor/Jess in Nemesis is a example of that.

    The Worm fanfic [Path to Munchies](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/path-to-munchies-worm-au.5435/) (~~note that the version on [SpaceBattles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/path-to-munchies-worm-au-complete.449493/reader) is not as complete~~) is surprisingly rational for a light-hearted fic. Rational-adjacent elements include:

    * figuring out how to work around superpower limitations
    * realizing that making short-term improvements can have deleterious long-term effects
    * the value of getting a second opinion

    It's also complete. At one point the author toyed with a couple of ideas for a sequel, but ultimately decided that they wouldn't work out.
    ```

    - u/Green0Photon:
      ```
      Eh, the one on SpaceBattles isn't complete? How?
      ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        After cross-checking the versions on SB and QQ, I see that I was wrong: the version on SB is complete. Some SB chapters are listed under "Sidestory" and "Apocrypha"; I didn't notice them when I was reading the story there.

  [Destruction Flag Otome](https://mangadex.org/title/22637/otome-game-no-hametsu-flag-shika-nai-akuyaku-reijou-ni-tensei-shite-shimatta) is the funniest manga I've read.  I don't usually enjoy >!oblivious protagonists!< even as humor, but this really makes it work somehow - maybe by >!making clear which alternate theory the protagonist has fixed in her mind; and by having everyone else be sane in unison, rather than everybody in the story being insane.!<
  ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    I think the reason it works, at least for me, is just >!how earnest and friendly the protagonist is!< but also it's really funny >!how seriously she takes her "throw snakes" and "learn to be a farmer" plans!<
    ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    I just read this on your recommendation, and it was surprisingly enjoyable. I suspect it's nearing its end though, as I'm not sure where else the author can go after this arc and a wrap-up arc. Maybe >!an outside observer looking in and thinking that the protagonist must be secretly an incredible schemer putting up a convincing facade, to have got herself so entrenched in high society as she has?!<

  I'm interested in more civilization building fiction. Something where man vs nature is a big part of things, but the man is a society instead of a lone survivor. A good example that was recently on the frontpage is [Luna Is a Harsh Mistress](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/439981/luna-is-a-harsh-mistress)

  On that note, I'd also be interested if anyone wants to reccomend some generally good rational pony fic. I've enjoyed what there is of the above, and [The Moon's Apprentice](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice) has also really sucked me in, but I bet there's a ton more that I'd never find on my own.

    I got a perfect story for you. Like 100% what you are looking for. [A Crooked Man](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-crooked-man-marvel-si.759274/) is a Marvel self insert fanfiction where the SI is inserted into the universe with extreme reality warping powers. The fanfic scratches all the itches and questions of what will someone do if they can play god. It is pretty tame so far compared to the wish fulfilment full blast harem scale where normal OP fix-it self inserts are commonplace.
    ```

    - u/sephirothrr:
      ```
      eh, I'm going to contradict this recommendation - sure, it's certainly among the better examples of the genre, but at its core it's still OP Mary Sue powerwankery, and blatantly glosses over the implications of the existence of a being with godlike power

      so far the only statement it seems to be making is "i'm stronger than you, so i can do what i want", which is still as true as it was on melos, despite that being used as a defence when the protagonist is objectively in the wrong

    There's [Absolute Power Sucks Absolutely](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/absolute-power-sucks-absolutely-young-justice-dc-si.694933/) where the main character is self inserted into the DC comics with literal omnipotence within 50 meters of him. The story *starts* with him having god-like power and figuring out what he should do with it.

      There was so much angst and edge in chapter 1 that you can figuretively cut your finger by touching your monitor. Could never get past it.
      ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        Having read through it, the first chapter was poorly chosen. The author drops you into an angst-fest that while probably justified by the timeline in the story as a whole, needed a build-up for the reader to be on board with it. In Media Res was a poor decision here, and I suspect it will have driven off quite a few prospective readers.

        That said, if you can get past it it's not like that all the time, and it's generally better-handled/justified when the angst does come up.
        ```

- u/nohat:

  I really admire and enjoy authors who can write intelligent people talking past each other. Basically where you can tell what each character is thinking, and what they think the other character is thinking, but both (or more) are wrong. Importantly they should be smart and have understandable reasons for this belief. Obviously its much better if this is conveyed through the dialogue and context instead of just telling you what the characters are thinking. It can be used for humor or dramatic effect or just characterization. Does anyone have recommendations which have this type of dialogue / situations?

   An example that comes to mind is JacobK's A Young Woman's Political Record which is all about the main character being quite smart and simultaneously really bad at reading people and conveying her intentions. This definitely goes beyond the realm of plausible, but is mainly humorous and character building.

  As an aside I find writing this way difficult, my dialogue tends to be too samesy or to the point, perhaps partly because I can't stand poorly done meandering dialogue.

    Overlord fits the bill. It is in light novel format or you can watch the anime. The light novels go into way more detail of characters talking past eachother.

  I've been getting into Apocalyptic Litrpgs lately and I am saddened by the fact that there is rarely any munchkinry. In Apocalyptic Litrpgs the physics of earth gets replaced by an RPG leveling system where people have to get stronger by leveling up in order to survive the spawning monster onslaught. This is a prime environment for munchkinry where people can min/max and abuse the system in place. However, the main reason the MC gets ahead of the curve powerwise is either by extreme luck or a benevolent omnipotent being graces a cheat skill to them at the start.

  [Change:New World's](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/1729/change-new-world) MC dabbles with munchkinry by abusing a goblin spawn point. It is probably the only Apocalyptic Litrpg that munchkins at the start.

  [Life in the north](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35596177-life-in-the-north) MC makes a good point to his min/maxing mage friend that he can kill him in one punch because he did not put any points in constitution and he should not treat the system as a videogame. (This book is sadly an example where the MC gets extremely lucky kill and is riding off that high throughout the book.)

      An apocalypse story presents us with a world in disequilibrium - it's one of the chances to show something clever and doable without it being asked why it wasn't done before.  We do still need to ask why others cannot imitate.  Broadly, I think it's fine for a Munchkin story to start from an unusual power, but it should require much cleverness to make good use of the power, it must not be an obvious path to godhood.
      ```

  - u/Reply_or_Not:

    I just finished all seven books in the *the system apocalypse” series (that starts with life in the north) and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

    Excellent writing, deep world building, and believable characters where everyone tries to take the system as hard as possible.

    I highly recommend this series

  So I would like to make three different recommendation requests today.

  First are books that play with being in a surreal reality like Alice in Wonderland, Phantom Tollbooth, and Harold and the Purple Crayon. The issue is that the only such books I can find tend to be for children. Are there any such books for adults?

  Another request is for any stories about escaping a simulated world like the Matrix. It seems like such stories would be a great fit for this subreddit, but I have barely heard of at.

  Last but not least, is a request for anything with a scene where someone realizes that they are not the hero but the villain instead. I'm trying to write about a similar emotional scene, but it's not easy going and I was hoping for inspiration from something similar.
