## [BST][HSF] Hermit Scientist on a Budget discovers "vampires"

### Post:

So I'm working on a story.  The main character has pretty much abandoned society due to painful interpersonal conflicts, but is an educated scientist with a broad education (PhD, biomedical engineering, Masters in Cybernetics).  Early in this story he meets two people with superhuman strength and speed who do indeed feed on blood.  The character continues to publish and do online consulting but doesn't have a high degree of disposable income.  What kind of a lab might he have thrown together in the few years preceding and what should his first experiments be?

  *Blindsight* by Peter Watts, mentioned on the TV Tropes Rational Fic page, involves scientifically consistent vampires. Watts made a [fictional documentary](http://www.rifters.com/blindsight/vampires.htm) describing the efforts of the research team that discovered the extinct human subspecies responsible for the vampire myth.

  So wait, does he actually have a vampire he can run tests on? If not, consider that step one.

  Things to research:

  * Vampires need blood. What does that mean? There are multiple components to blood, and multiple types of blood. Do vampires need red cells, white cells, platelets, plasma, or some combination? Can they subsist on animal blood? Can they subsist on blood substitutes like PolyHeme? What is the minimum level of blood that can sustain a vampire?
  * Vampires are (usually) weak to the sun. What does that mean? Are they weak to a specific type of light, like UV? Are they weak to reflected sunlight? Can their weakness to sunlight be negated in some way, like high SPF sunscreen?
  * Vampires are strong and fast. What are the limits of their strength and speed? What mechanism provides them with this strength and speed? Does their strength and speed surpass their caloric intake (in the form of blood)? How close to human-normal are their vital signs, and how do those vital signs change with exercise?
  * Vampires can (usually) make more of their kind. What physiological changes occur to make someone a vampire? Can vampirism be induced in flesh absent a connection to a human (say, a fresh organ)?

  Depending on what rules are immediately apparent, there are a bunch more tests that you would want to do. Some vampires exhibit seemingly psychological conditions, like an inability to cross running water, recoiling from a cross, inability to enter a home without an invitation, etc. Some vampires can't be reflected in a mirror. These are all things that you would want to test in various ways; the experimental models would be pretty simple in the beginning. Some of the experiments you would want to do would be ethically questionable, or at least pose safety risks to your vampire, but the vampires would have a fairly high incentive to cooperate in order to expand their own knowledge and gain some sort of advantage.

    Some people on tumblr found out that coconut water has been injected into people's veins as a substitute for blood plasma in extreme circumstances. This naturally sparked a discussion of tropical coconut vampires.

    Naturally, coconut water is a terrible substitute for whole blood, and any vampire that could live on coconut water could probably live on plain water, bananas, and a salt lick. But it's still amusing to think about.

  I mean... Does he have their cooperation? Does have them captive? Or does he have nothing but the experience that some kind of vampire like creatures are out there? *The Rhesus Chart* by Charles Stross features a group of newly minted vampires who do a decent job of researching their own abilities and weaknesses, and that might give you a few ideas. It's not the first book in the series, but you should be fine to read it anyway.

    He has their cooperation yes.

  This is an incoherent background. Someone with that level of social phobia would have found acquiring that breath of education very difficult. 
  What you do instead is simply state that the character became a hermit because he or she discovered vampires, and reacted with an appropriate level of paranoia. Because the existence of vampires without that being common knowledge implies an insane level of control over society or information. So the formerly brilliant academic now avoids all contact with everyone lest they get dealt with by the time-traveling death squad or wandering band of mind-controllers.
