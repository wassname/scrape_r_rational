## How to nail down the origins of a martian transhumanist society

### Post:

So I've had this setting idea rattling around in my idea for a while, and I want to make sure it makes sense on close examination. Basically it takes place a century to a century and a half from now, with humanity existing in colonies throughout the solar system, with the largest concentration being on mars. I want Earth to simply not be available because of the challenges and complications that would pose. My issue is thinking of a good reason for that to be the case, since I can't think of anything that could make the Earth less hospitable than literally anywhere else in the solar system. My only idea so far is for a rogue AI to take it over and just dedicate itself towards keeping the remaining humans away from Earth. That of course raises a lot of questions about why it wouldn't just hunt them down or whatever. So basically I'm asking for ideas.

Edit: Thanks for the ideas everyone! I'll think about them. In the mean time I'm going to make a post detailing martian society, which is where most of my thought about this setting has gone into.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    To add to your excellent list: 

    Moderate nuclear exchange (maybe middle east or india/pakistan) triggered huge nuclear winter, some feedback loops whent out of whack and now temperature has plummeted. 

    Advances in the biotech field made for an extremly ugly period of biological warfare. Taylored strains of 100% lethal long-term incubation ebola targetting red haired people,  the isreali population or people with the genes for the epicanthic fold. Total devastation.

        Of course not colder then mars. If the single criterium you have is "which is going to be more habitable" then earth is going to win out in almost any scenario. Even giant dropped asteroids leave you with pressurized atmosphere, probably oxygen (though not necessarily) and heaps of surface water. 

        Thus if you want your Civ to choose mars you either have to choose a disaster that makes Earth absolutely unaccessible  (goo, AI gone wrong) or impose political or other motivations on your colonists (new frontier, fear from mutated human cannibals, solar modules not working under heavy cloud cover) etc.

  Probably the best thing you can do is to start writing. It is said that every writer has about a million bad words worth of writing to go through before they can produce anything halfway decent. Best to get through those as fast as possible and learn all you can from that.

  That said, don't worry about getting it perfect. The story you want to tell isn't about what happened to Earth. You are basically at a point where you will accept any plausible idea to explain away that annoying detail so you can move on. So don't sweat it! Just let that be a free variable; have it be something so horrible and emotionally charged that it just isn't mentioned in polite company, or something along those lines.

  Do some brainstorming about the setting. Start somewhere in the middle with characters that interest you. Write about their stories and exploits, and try to imagine what life is like for them in this world. Like a grain of sand that is the catalyst for a pearl, let your story coalesce around these ideas. The other details will fall into place.

    Nah, run it the other way. Earth fully networked and hit post-scarcity at about the same time as the off-world colonies reached a decent size. Then technological and cultural advancement started to happen at really frightening velocities on earth due to well over ten billion minds all being in low latency contact and not engaged in the work of survival. Due to the light-speed delays in communication everyplace much beyond low earth orbit decoupled from the accelerating earth culture, and shortly after that, it became common sense to avoid even contact with it like the plague because the informational firewalls and memetic immune system of a typical belt ship or martian colony would just melt like a snowflake in the core of the sun if hooked up to The Internet. 
    The belter joke goes that they blew up the com link with earth after their latest anti-virus software update offered to remove the known infohazards of "religion, neo-classical economics and pre-tizzard psychological theory"
    Occasionally earth launches  aid packages that.. while obviously designed to be as harmless as at all possible.. are still extremely scary. 

    Auto-doc Medical kits with the ability to preform full shape changes into any biologically plausible form.  

    Self-help books that actually work. 


    Ect.

    Then there are the things that go up that are not aid packages, which tend to just be incomprehensible. And The Event that happened to the moon, which decent people do not speak of.

      Or for comedic works, there is this:
      The singularity hit, the Republic of Earth slapped a warp drive on the allen belt and.. left. There is a sign in the orbit it used to occupy saying "Parking reserved. Back in a millennium or three."

  Earth is still there, has a population of 49 billion (4 pure ai per originally-human mind), and the rest of the solar system shuns it as the great whore of babylon on the grounds that anyone foolish enough to visit either never comes back, or comes back... changed. Heck, just talking too much to earthlings has been known to result in being persuaded to let your radio eat your brain. (Moravec upload) Done, dusted. This isn't because earth is horrid - it's just undergone a heck of a lot faster cultural change than the much lower populations elsewhere. Also, there is the unpleasant fact that earth-side minorities that care about off-world people tend to be... radical.

  Several specific ideas here have incorporated this, but I feel the general concept could use expressing.

  You don't have to make Earth completely worthless, you just have to make it less worthwhile than other planets in the system.  Given how ludicrously uninhabitable some parts of the solar system are, the easiest way would be to severely damage the viability of Earth to human populations.  /u/alexanderwales's asteroid, /u/SvalbardCaretaker's nuclear exchange and biological warfare, or a big dumb grey goo (as opposed to a full-blown AI) are all viable ways to serve this purpose without the need for an intelligence actively keeping humans away.  This has the benefit/detriment (depending on your story) of potentially having a fixed end date for its inhospitability that those off of Earth could calculate.
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Yes. The problem with grey goo is, if you have grey goo its immensely valuable to make other planets hospitable. Obviously not the failed goo, but all the other related nanotech.  You either incorporate them (and can easily create a power creep you did not want in the first place) or you get some inconsistencies in your setting.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Excellent point; the Grey Goo scenario doesn't arise in a vacuum, so you'd have to go to some lengths to remove nanotech from the general tech level of humanity.
      ```

  ```
  1. Religious extremists with both technical expertise (possibly stolen) and a death wish have destroyed the Earth. If you need an answer to "how?", the easiest way to destroy Earth given near-future technologies involves gaining control of an asteroid mining operation and ramming a sufficiently large one into the planet at maximum speed. Slingshot it around a few planets, skim by the Sun to avoid detection on the final approach, and then kill almost everyone on Earth.

  2. The Earth was destroyed by scientists trying to do something stupid, like messing with cosmic strings, or strangelets, or an Einstein-Rosen bridge, or something that humans a hundred years from now might be able to manipulate but not quite understand. The less you explain this, the better, unless your story is about the destruction of Earth.

  3. You don't actually have to say, since it could happen quickly. The opening line of Neal Stephenson's new book is, "The Moon blew up without warning, and for no apparent reason", which I think is a perfectly fine thing to do.

  Some Earth scientists were experimenting with teleportation. They found out how to create wormholes with one end in their own reference frame (attached to the surface of the Earth, essentially) and the other in a different reference frame. They tried to test this by putting the other end along Earth's orbit but got the numbers wrong.

  Right now, there's a moderately large wormhole on Earth's surface that connects to the outer stretches of the sun's corona. It's slowly boring a hole through the Earth, venting superheated gases, etc. It's about as inviting as Venus, except it's eventually going to destroy enough of the Earth to smash it into pieces.

  Besides, the only great thing about Earth is the ready supply of volatiles.

  ```
  If you're interested in the AI with orange/blue morality, consider having the AI be religious or highly environmentally friendly. It doesn't want to destroy humans, but it also doesn't want them on Earth. Earth is its own, its precious.
  ```

- u/EliezerYudkowsky:
  ```
  AI is practically the only major x-risk that *doesn't* make *only* the Earth uninhabitable.  Out-of-control replicating nanotech, engineered pathogens, extreme radioactivity, etc.  The *distinguishing* factor of strong AI as an x-risk is that it will come and get you on Mars, which is the reason why Elon Musk is worried.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    But it doesn't *have* to make all planets uninhabitable, depending on what its utility function is. A bad utility function could produce all sorts of plot-convenient behaviors, like killing everyone on Earth but nowhere else. By definition, a utility function can be practically anything, and given that it's making the Earth uninhabitable we already know that the AI is exhibiting unintended behaviors.

    (The question isn't whether the depicted world is one that you would expect given someone saying "AI killed everyone", it's whether it's plausible as a background detail.)

  > That of course raises a lot of questions about why it wouldn't just hunt them down or whatever.

  It wasn't programmed to keep humans off Earth, but was programmed to do Some Whatever Thing that, *incidentally*, makes Earth out to be Not An Option At All, No Sir.

  You might want to read the Eclipse phase RPG setting books.  Much of what you describe is in it's history.

  ```
  Have you considered grey goo? It's basically rogue AI on a budget.

  It presumably doesn't know or care about space travel, but it's either poisonous or corrosive or it's just outcompeted every living thing on Earth. People don't visit Earth because they don't want to risk carrying spores away.

  And maybe it can only grow properly in Earth-like atmospheres; so space stations and pressurised colonies are at risk, but it can't colonise outdoor areas on Mars or Venus.
  ```
