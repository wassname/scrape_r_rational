  These are great. A few of my favorites:

  > A group of people find themselves in an inexplicable Kafkaesque maze of cubes. They are paid to sit there for eight hours per weekday.

  > A changing climate threatens humanity. Since the time constant of the change is much longer than the average political term, nothing is done.

  > A computer network achieves sentience. It continues trying to do its job while being distracted by games and social media.

  Man, I needed a good laugh today.. Thanks for the find  :P

  > Genetically engineered, super-intelligent sharks escape from a research lab. They feast on plentiful fish while avoiding dangerous humans.

  > Teen hackers infiltrate a secret military database containing designs for a new superweapon. They deface the database with ASCII genitalia.

  > A model of droid requires its owner to studiously develop a comprehension of its strange bleep noises. It is a commercial failure.

  > Four turtles discarded into a sewer are weakened by ingesting toxic waste. A rat finds them and consumes their flesh.

  > A starship captain becomes intimate with a voluptuous alien temptress. Alien authorities charge her with bestiality.

  ..I could just keep listing them.
