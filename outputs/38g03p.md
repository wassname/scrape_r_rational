  This is damn good. It's only the second chapter and I'm already rooting for Red and hoping Blue dies forgotten in some unremarkable ditch (soon). I was actually quite surprised at the levels of hatred toward Blue that this chapter engendered in me.

  I'm generally uncertain about this chapter. A particular concern is that there may be too much exposition towards the beginning. Curious to know if it reads too much like an infodump.

  Other than that particular question, criticism in general would be greatly appreciated.

  EDIT: Horizontal lines are coming up extremely inconsistently for me. I've edited the chapter several times, but they keep vanishing and reappearing. There should be two in this document, after "You *bastard*." and "He looked like a Champion." Is anyone else not seeing them?

    It's SLIGHTLY heavy on the exposition, but it's described vividly enough to keep it from being boring. Plenty of more famous authors do far worse. If you want to trim it down a little, that's your prerogative, but don't feel like you HAVE to.

    I, for one, quite enjoyed this chapter. I was starting to get annoyed by the scene with the reporters, but then I realized that was PRECISELY the intent, and it worked out great. And it only got better.

    I agree with coda for the most part. While perhaps exposition-heavy, it was extremely enjoyable for me to read, and gave a lot of background detail. Granted, I enjoy what most people would call filler, so long as it's not boring, which this most certainly is not.

    The lines work for me. But fanfiction is known for messing things up all the time :P

    Nice chapter!

  Loved it. Didn't feel exposition heavy.

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  Ah... Is the subtitle of your story reminiscent of the video game Spec Ops: The Line?
  ```

- u/Bowbreaker:

  That ending was priceless.

  I also liked that detail about Pallet Town's gate opening inwards and what it meant. Is that fact based on anything or did you just fancy the idea?

  What I understand less is why Oak puts so much weight on prestige and media narrative. I mean, judging from all Pokemon media I know of, the world is chock full with trainers. Surely only the tiniest fraction can be getting any media attention of note at all and yet they are still at it so it can't be the be all end all. So letting Blue's audacious and probably criminal act just slide and go without consequence simply because it makes for a better story seems to make little sense in a world that isn't based on Shadows in the Limelight like rules. Not to mention that in a world where pokemon dominate everything and where there are age old trainer initiation rituals there must be more to aspire to as a young trainer than to become Champion.
