  Note: the author had previously been posting Bunker Core/Nomad Core on SpaceBattles [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/bunkercore-post-apocalyptic-dungeon-core.622189/), but it's all been taken down to satisfy Amazon's publishing requirements. (I guess.)

  Can anyone tell me if there's more than 27 chapters? I want to double check to make sure that there's no new content I've missed, or something like that. >!Last thing that happened was W killing that enemy, whose name I can't remember.!<

  Bunker Core was a story posted here before by the author of Threadbare that people here liked.

  It's a rare sci-fi example of the dungeon core stories where the protagonist, Wynne, is an amnesiac human turned AI with dungeon core mechanics in a post-apocalyptic setting.

  He has to deal with self-improving his 'dungeon', missing memories, and an untrustworthy boss/assistant while quickly learning about just what happened to the world in the first book.

  The sequel appears to be about escaping from his enemies in the first book and becoming mobile, but I'm not too sure since I haven't read the book just yet.

  PS The protagonist's name is meant to be a reference to Winne Pooh.

    ...Not sure you're serious about the name bit.  Because I thought it was established in the comments that the name was pretty clearly 'Core Wynne'  >!aka Corwin of the Amber series by Zelazny !< ?
