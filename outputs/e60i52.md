## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  What have you always wanted to see explored or mentioned in a Toy Story fanfiction? Keep in mind it’s a setting with a Masquerade.
  ```

    I've been watching "The Toys that Made Us" documentary series on Netflix, which is OK, and thinking some about the intersection of commercialization and toys, especially from mercenary toy companies (rather than, say, someone toiling away to make the best toy for a child as a gift). The episode on My Little Pony talks a lot about "feeding the beast" and the company's desire to always have a Hot New Thing for each year in order to milk the market as much as possible. Toy Story 1 was *a little bit* about that, in that Buzz is the Hot New Thing, but it doesn't take a very critical/aware approach to the toy churn, it's just kind of there in passing, or as a joke.

    Aside from that, I guess I'd like to see some of the ideological splits among toys, either the ways that the conform to or reject mainstream toy values, or the subcultures that routinely develop in different kinds of households, or the ways that two ideologically aligned toys might be *slightly* misaligned on minor issues.

    (Note: I haven't seen Toy Story 4 yet, which probably raises questions or provides answers in some way.)

  This may belong in the Monday thread, but since the question is about settings, may as well ask it now: can anyone recommend any urban fantasy with a well-integrated and justified Masquerade? What I mean is not the standard "people will panic, stocks will plummet" or "oh yeah, and everyone has a cantrip that only works on the unpowered and is only used in that specific situation", but rather something continuously relevant and intrinsic to the power system, such as it is?

  Truth be told, a lot of urban fantasy deals with maintaining the secrecy, but it's more often than not an afterthought, something to elevate the exciting from the mundane that was kept by the author in order to leave the readers something immediately relatable. So, more on-topic for the thread, what happens if you build the magic around being unknown, and its interactions with the material world as something to be avoided?

    The web serial Pact written by Wildbow I think has a very well justified masquerade.

    This is of interest to me too, especially in the social/legal aspects of maintaining a Masquerade, which I don't think I've seen explored in the way or to the extent that I would want it explored. Obviously you can have the Masquerade created through strong incentives and/or ease of enforcement, but it's still a matter of keeping hundreds if not thousands of people from opening their fat mouths to the wrong people. You can magic it all away, but that's not very fun or satisfying.

    To your question of the unknown as integral to the supernatural, I think you could pretty easily make a magic system where that magic simply doesn't work around the mundane, in one way or another. A wizard *can't* go into a lab and replicate his results, and any magic user who goes in front of a non-believer like Randi will find that their magic simply stops working (which is what a lot of people claim in the real world, that e.g. their ability to soothsay is hindered by a skeptic asking questions, or that the spirits are disturbed by the presence of a non-believer). It would also allow for some interesting action/chase scenes, as a high-powered magical battle spills out onto the crowded streets ... and suddenly becomes a fist fight.

    (Tangential to the question, but I think one of the interesting things to do with the Masquerade is to have it be out but not "out", in a sense. In other words, treat it like other "conspiracy theories" about things that are, on balance of probability, true, but which no one can prove. The Masquerade is "broken" in the sense that a sizable minority of people are in the know, but it's intact in the sense that the majority will write off the supernatural with mundane explanations, which gets helped along by official government/department policies that deny the existence of the supernatural.

    For this to work, you would need the supernatural to be fairly small and quite contained, enough that the group of hangers-on and groupies was larger than the actual group of supernatural, and also small enough that the surface area is minuscule. In this kind of a world, every high school probably had fairy-girl with wings glued to her hoodie, and wolf-boy with his fake fake and long hair, which is generally the image that the public has of such things. You'd get ten news reports about copycat or false supernatural stuff to every one true one, so most people would (correctly) assume that if they heard about a fairy charming someone, it was a lie told by an unfaithful husband rather than the victim of a supernatural crime. Again though, you would probably only do this in a relatively low-powered setting.)

    the Laundry series by Stross, which is actually eldritch horror meets tech support. 

    did you notice? oh dear, now we need to use binding magic to keep you quiet. and maybe conscript you to work for us now. 

    the setting includes a basilisk gun, a higher-dimensional symbol that turns people who see and understand it into parasitic vampires, and all sorts of other horrible ways the world is going to end soon. also, using magic makes extra-dimensional critters eat tiny holes in your brain. 

    early books of the series are really good, later books feel less good. the series as a whole is moving towards the end of the world, which cannot be stopped.

      In later books in the Laundry Files, the Masquerade fails, and managing that becomes part of the plot.
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Maybe the Dresden Files? There, the Masquerade works because magical communities are either very small, large but with very little individual or collective power or knowledge, or not on Earth proper. Taken together, this means there are reasonably large "covens" who can only do the supernatural equivalent of bending spoons or giving people nosebleeds, small numbers of powerful supernatural actors who see no reason to upset the status quo, and entire nations which are irrelevant to the masquerade because only other in-the-know persons can ever access them.

    Basically, the total amount of obviously supernatural stuff happening where normals could see it is quite small. When things do get out of hand, people rationalize it away. Snow in June caused by a war between Winter and Summer is called el Niño. People getting eaten by supernatural predators are assumed to have vanished for mundane reasons. Murderous rituals to create a new godling (interrupted before the murder part by our hero, of course) are assumed to be college pranks. 

    When someone sees something they can't explain any other way, they either try to forget it, join one of the mostly-ignorant "covens," or get sucked in with more powerful actors, for better or worse. Basically all of Harry Dresden's friends used to be muggles who thought he was nuts, but harmless, until they saw him do one too many clearly impossible things.

    There are no outright prohibitions on outing the Masquerade. It's just not done. The supernatural nations, while quite powerful, would fold before the rage of billions of normals. Individual wizards can live to be hundreds of years old, but they mostly don't interact with the normals. Harry Dresden is seen as eccentric for being in the Yellow Pages under "Wizards," not a dangerous deviant. Because almost no normals have ever interacted with a Wizard of true power, they can't tell Dresden *is* one, despite telling them to their face that he is. It's only when the fireballs come out that they start believing.

    Less a recommendation as a discussion from me but...

    The way Magecraft works in the Nasuverse is interesting. It relies of *Mystery*, that which is fundamentally possible but not understood. As things become understood, they move from Magecraft to the realm of science and magecraft loses the ability to do them.

    The whole point of having a Masquerade is that things look basically like they do in real life, so that the author only needs to world-build about the parts that are different from real life. And yet, 40% of Americans believe in UFOs. 20% believe in witches. 33% believe in ghosts. 25% think astrology is real. 40% for ESP, 30% for telepathy, 20% for reincarnation. If the Men in Black managed to keep belief in UFOs down to half as mainstream as it is IRL, I'd call that a wildly (perhaps even implausibly) successful Masquerade, despite the fact that one in five of my co-workers would statistically be an X-Com Truther.

    Clearly, the key ingredient of a Masquerade isn't a total lack of public belief, it's the idea that the police will tell you 'go home, you're drunk' if you report a Bigfoot related murder. If you're aware of vampires and want to do something about it, you have to form a militia group that wants to "take back the night" from "violent crime" and only drop the vampire bombshell on your inner circle. Everyone else, you have to keep the secret or else they'll laugh you out of the room and openly question whether you might need to see a psychiatrist.

    In [El Goonish Shive](http://www.egscomics.com/comic/2014-03-10), people who know about magic can gain magic spells that reflect their personality. So what sort of people would get the most dangerous and violent spells?

    In the tabletop RPG *Mage: The Awakening*, materialist physics are a lie. Reality actually operates on Neo-Platonist rules. The "real world" that we percieve in our day-to-day lives is just an imperfect projection of ideal forms that exist in the Supernal Realm.

    Once upon a time, the phenomenal and ideal worlds were much closer, and many humans achieved a connection to the ideal world through esoteric revelations. This connection granted humans knowledge of the ideal world, and the power to manipulate the Supernal forms to rewrite phenomenal reality. Such humans were known as Mages, and they could wield their powers among ordinary humans freely.

    But then a group of Mages built a mystical structure called The Celestial Ladder, that allowed them to transcend their material forms and enter the Supernal Realm. Once there, they overthrew the Old Gods who had thus far held sway, and installed themselves as the new rulers of all reality.

    But another group of Mages attempted to stop the usurpers, and uphold the natural order. The resulting war lead to the destruction of The Celestial Ladder, and the formation of the Abyss - a vast void of unreality, seperating the phenomenal and ideal worlds. With this separation, humanity found it harder and harder to tap into the powers of the Supernal Realm. Fewer and fewer Mages awakened to magical knowledge, and the Mages that already existed found their powers stunted and limited.

    The phenomenal world became The Fallen World, and only became darker as the Abyss grew.

    Fast forward to the modern day, and the universe is ruled by the Exarchs - the ascended Mages who usurped the Old Gods. They seek to maintain their power by keeping humanity blind to Supernal knowledge - the only thing that could threaten them. By the will of the Exarchs, all humans are subject to the Sleeping Curse. So-called "Sleepers" cannot remember Supernal magic if exposed to it. Supernal artifacts wither into mundanity around them. And attempts to cast Supernal magic in front of them cause horrible backlash for the Mage responsible.

    But the Sleeping Curse is not perfect. Mages are still awakening, though in very small numbers. So the Exarchs are served by the Seers of the Throne - a hierarchy of mortal Mages, who seek to curry favour with the demiurges in return for wealth and power. The Seers work to make conditions in the Fallen World as hostile to awakenings as possible, generally by making life miserable for Sleepers. War, poverty, hatred, slavery - all are encouraged by the Seers, by the will of the Exarchs.

    The player-characters are usually members of the Pentacle - a coalition of Mage orders, focused on resisting the Seers and their Supernal masters. The Pentacle's ultimate goal is to storm the Supernal Realms and overthrow the Exarchs, wipe out the Sleeping Curse, and allow the light of the Supernal to shine on the Fallen World once more.

    TL;DR: In *Mage: The Awakening*, you play as Gnostic Neo-Platonist wizards, seeking to destroy the Masquerade by waging a guerilla war against the tyrant god-kings of reality.
