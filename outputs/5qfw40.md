  I just want to say I really liked the..writing I think? I really felt like we were in April's head and that this is a worthwhile place to be?

    Thanks a bunch. It really makes my day to hear that.

  I'm assuming this is an alternate universe version of Cincinnati that has this restaurant, because I've never seen it in the city, and it honestly sounds a bit adventurous for Cincinnati cuisine, but I don't necessarily have a better suggestion that isn't just a major metro city like New York or Chicago.

    Alien Eats does not exist (same goes for the Grand Star of Kuwait, shown in the previous chapter).

      Alien Eats is the most Peter Watts-y concept I've read outside a book that wasn't written by the man himself.

        What? Really? Well, I can't claim much credit for it. Invasivory is an actual practice. The only bit that I added was realizing that it would make for a really neat restaurant.

        I'm glad that you like it though.

          > What? Really?

          It's got that same feel of some bizarre, futuristic pop-culture you'd get by boiling down cyberpunk into crusty bits.
