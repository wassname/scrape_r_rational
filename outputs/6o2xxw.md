## ImmerseOrDie Anthology: A smart way of testing how good a book is at drawing readers in

### Post:

On Amazon, there are two great anthologies of stories to read where the editor accepts reader submissions at his website and puts them through the test:

> The premise of the Immerse or Die challenge is simple. I get on my treadmill, open a book, and start the clock. Then I do my best to stay immersed in the story until I reach the end of my 40 minute morning walk. If I make it, that book qualifies for all the attention ImmerseOrDie can bring it. But if I canâ€™t stay immersed, the buzzer sounds and the book is closed.

I just heard that two ImmerseOrDie Anthologies were **free** on Amazon today. I can't promise they are rational, since I just bought the ebooks and haven't read them yet, but the testing is a clever way to actually test the books on being genuinely enjoyable. So I felt they were worth posting here.

  Hey, I'm glad you find ImmerseOrDie to be rational. I'm the guy that started it, and rationality is kinda the reason I did. I figured there had to be a more reliable/repeatable way to get a quick take on which indie fiction was ready for prime time and which ones weren't.

  Along those same lines, you might also like [PageFight!](http://page-fight.com) which is another project I started, aimed at helping authors figure out which title, tagline, blurb, and cover ideas will work in the market. It does this by pitting them against each other in a reader-driven game environment where different book elements go head-to-head and players have to choose which one they would be more likely to investigate. It turns out to be lots of fun. Readers get a cool discovery tool and authors get valuable A/B testing *before* they launch their books, rather than having to wait for sales data *after* launch.

  I'm not sure how this is particularly more rational than just you know, reading a book and stopping if you don't enjoy it.
