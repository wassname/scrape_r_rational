  Hahaha! Yes! Parent kid tag team yeah! 

  Warlock + Hierophant vs Diabolist + Akua's Father
  Black Knight + Squire

  Hierophant and Warlock are there to subvert all magical dangers. Black and Cat are there to kick ass and take Names. 

  Oh YEAH! THIS WILL BE GOOD! 

  ALSO FINAL CHAPTER FOR 2017. DESPAIR AND LAMENT FOR ITS ONLY NEXT YEAR WE MAY READ AGAIN!

    Unfortunately I think it's been foreshadowed that Black is going to very soon become another obstacle for Cat to overcome. The way the three legions in this most recent battle pretty much have no loyalty to her and tons for Black, the way Black is "breaking down" or w/e and thus may be willing to sacrifice Callowans in a way that Cat will feel obligated to oppose, and the way Malicia has apparently been trying to replace Black with Cat for a while now all seem to point to an unhappy reunion as being likely. 

    Good guys get to fight with their dads and take up their mantles when they fall in the final confrontation with evil. Bad guys get dads who don't actually view their apprentices as anything other than a means to an end.

      Perhaps... However it's not uncommon for the Knights to fight alongside their Squires. And I really doubt Black would not assist Cat here. Remember the longer they dick around with Akua the higher the chance that Cordelia decides to join the fight. 

      Remember it was Malicia who said that Black is dangerous to be around now to Cat. I take EVERYTHING that woman says with an aircraft carrier worth of the salt. 

      From what I saw of Black's thought processes at the conclusion of his fight with White, after he learned of Sabah's fate, was that he shoved everything in a box and cast the box into the cold oblivion because such sentimental feelings are useless to him. He's cultivated that personality for a couple of decades at a conservative  estimate. He's not likely to "forget" it now. 

      I assign EXTREMELY low probability mass to the hypothesis that his behaviour is uncalculated.

        Oh, I agree he'll remain calculated. The problem is as follows:

        Cat's arc throughout this book has been coming to terms with the idea of 'sacrifice for a greater good'. It started with Kilian, went on to others forcing her hand and the loss of men, then Nauk, and now her being personally willing to throw away the lives of her men for an advantage. She's becoming steadily more and more accepting of the necessity. 

        There's a capstone to that kind of arc, though, where she encounters the *actual* limits to what she can accept (rather than the instinctive 'icky!' response that led her to breaking up with her lover at the start of the book). She sets her line in the sand and accepts the consequences of not passing that line.

        If Black's shut-down-emotions lead him to full-on "HARD MAN MAKING HARD DECISION", he's going to be the one that forces her up against that line. Maybe it'll be blood sacrifice of the Callowans, maybe it'll be something else. But there'll come a point during the upcoming conflict where the two disagree. Forcefully. And since neither will be emotionally capable of backing down at that point, it's likely only one of them is going to walk away from that.
        ```

          ```
          I concede your point. That is how it looks like it's going to go. 

          ...I'm still hoping for a subversion though.
          ```

        - u/Schuano:
          ```
          Black can back down if it's practical to do so.  

          Remember hpmor and voldemort's lecture about learning how to lose. 

          He doesn't give a rat's ass  about backing down if that gets him closer to his goals.
          ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      Isn't Black *actively* trying to replace himself with Cat?
      ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  I told y'all, it was a bait!

  She's finally embraced the evil, in her deepest of hearts.

  Edit: Oh shit he's back!
  ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  Hooray!  We find out what Black's up to now.  Maybe he's crazy?  Maybe the Empress was just fucking with her and he's fine?  Maybe he's sexing up Hye, who knows?
  ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  It was good to see some introspection on Cat's part. She's been on a moral high horse since the beginning and her hypocrisy was getting a bit grating though I feel like she went a bit too far in this chapter. 

  As for Thief, running in alone as a Hero in a sacrificial mission against a much stronger opponent will surely play a role from a narrative point of view. I will eat my hat if she doesn't succeed by the skin of her teeth.

  Next chapter will be super interesting. Black can go either way imo, though I'm leaning towards "reasonable but psychopathic". I don't think he'll sabotage himself by getting into conflict with Cat... unless it's part of her succession.
