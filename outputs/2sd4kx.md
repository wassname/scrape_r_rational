  I am a fan of this one, and it is pretty smartly written. Clever strategies are definitely its focus and its strong suit. The plot and characters are also interesting, even if the story focuses almost solely on the cerebral aspect at times. One monologue from the story sticks with me even now.

  "People SHOULD be doubted. Many people misunderstand this concept. Doubting people is just a part of getting to know them. What many people call ‘trust’ is really just giving up on trying to understand others, and that very act is far worse than doubting. It is actually ‘apathy."

  The female protagonist Nao Kanzaki is pretty much the dumbest person I've ever seen. But the male protagonist Shinichi Akiyama is pretty cool.

    This is exactly the problem I have with Liar Game. The female protagonist is so annoying and sometimes it feels like the author is substituting Nao with the reader.

    While the way Shinichi hacks his way into winning makes it interesting I didn't find the story all that compelling. Gave up by chapter 10.

      Thanks for the counter-recommendation. I always find those helpful in deciding what to read, but I feel like people don't post them often enough.

      I will say that she does start learning and applying the "teachings" of Shinichi later in the series. She keeps with her goal of being the kind of person who would always comply in the prisoner's dilemma and tries to be a good example of why it would be in the best interest of everyone to comply too. This does not mean she remains a pushover.

      I can't force you to do anything but I would recommend that you read further, it does improve.

        [Her behavior in chapter 18 annoyed me](#s "She's out of the game but she let's herself be convinced to be part of a revival round even though she has very little chance to actually win and help Shinichi ") 

        Now on chapter 59 and I agree with you, she's much better later in the serie.

      I wish you had stuck a big longer. The female protagonist had her own character development which did not start until the plot progressed quite a bit. 

      The story does have episodes of down time, some chapters feel like fillers. However, overall quality is pretty good.

      On a side note, I have been compiling a list of rationalist manga/anime for a while, hoping to post on this subreddit once it's finished. Liar Game is among them.

    Hey, don't call her dumb or you'll find yourself on the receiving end of a friendship speech.

      As long as it isn't a heart of the cards speech, I think I'd survive.

  Haven't read "Liar Game", but I've enjoyed the first arc of [Kaiji](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsuBt6Aq3B8&index=1&list=PLweslq_DKeVKbsjWTPWbfvki8JEX6AXK-), another manga (and anime) about gambling and playing games. Haven't made it past the second arc (which is pretty weak as the game played in it isn't interesting) yet, but the first storyline is fairly clever and very compelling (and works fine as a standalone story).

  The part at the end of round two confused me, where Akiyama shows his vote.  [I watched the other players ](#s "go crazy trying to figure out how to not lose, and the whole time I was thinking to myself:  you agree that you're going to draw the round.  The three of you choose how you're going to vote, you walk up together, you don't fold your votes as you submit them so that all of you can see how you vote.  The first person votes 'Yes' so it's a Y:1 / N:1 split.  The second votes 'No' so it's Y:1 / N:2.  The third can either vote 'No', thereby putting zirself in the majority and losing, or can vote 'Yes' and make the draw as was agreed. You can see each other's votes, so you can tell if anyone defects.  Defecting is not in your interest because you are either putting yourself in the majority or getting the draw you wanted in the first place but taking a reputational hit in the process.  Sure, Akiyama can do the same early-announce trick next time, but you just keep doing the same thing over and over so that every round is a draw.  Eventually, either Akiyama will change tactics or the organization will change the rules.")  This seemed pretty obvious to me, so I wasn't sure why the characters didn't see it.

  Cute.  [http://www.mangareader.net/164-10853-1/liar-game/chapter-41.html](http://www.mangareader.net/164-10853-1/liar-game/chapter-41.html) says that the site has moved over to [http://www.liargame.net](http://www.liargame.net)

  The move is a lie!
