## Potterian Economics - Research Paper

[Potterian Economics](http://iset.tsu.ge/files/wp_02-17_Levy_and_Snir_-_Potterian_Economics.pdf) 

 >We study the Potterian economy, which we compare to economic models, to assess how Harry Potter books affect economic literacy. We find that some principles of Potterian economics are consistent with economists’ models. Many  others,  however,  are  distorted  and  contain  numerous inaccuracies,   which contradict professional  economists’  views  and  insights,  and contribute  to  the  general  public’s  biases, ignorance, and lack of understanding of economics.

  On a vaguely related note: [The Theory of Interstellar Trade](https://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/interstellar.pdf) by Krugman. 

  >This paper, then, is a serious analysis of a ridiculous subject, which is of course the opposite of what is usual in economics.

    > [Extending] the analysis to trade between planets with large relative motion ... is left as an exercise for interested readers because the author does not understand the theory of general relativity, and therefore cannot do it himself.

    Page five.  The whole article is pretty funny, both in the jokes sprinkled throughout and the complete implausibility of both the physical and economic premises of the analysis.  It *is* a reasonably serious analysis though!

      ... but... but... you don't need general relativity to deal with planets with large relative motion. Special relativity covers that. Now, if you had planets with different masses, then suddenly general relativity becomes important because time will pass differently due to different gravity.

      Slight nitpicking aside, this paper is absolutely awesome.

      > These complications make the theory of interstellar trade appear at first quite alien to our usual trade models; presumably it seems equally human to alien trade theorists.

        It is indeed awesome.  

        There is a much more legible version of the paper [here](http://www.standupeconomist.com/pdf/misc/interstellar.pdf), typeset into LaTeX and crisply rendered, rather than a scan of a typewritten paper.

        And I don't want to turn this thread into a list of all the best quotes (you might as well post the whole paper), but this is one of my favorites: 

        > This is an inertial problem—which becomes a weighty problem in a gravitational field—requiring an economic analysis, provided in the next section.

        It's thoroughly infused with excellent wordplay.

        >> the author does not understand the theory of general relativity

        And even says so in the paper ;-)

  >80 pages

  Um, thank you? Saving this for a rainy day.
  ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    That page count includes 2 title pages, 1 page for the abstract, 39 pages of quotes from the *Harry Potter* books (the "Supplementary Online Appendix"), and 7 pages of references.

  Once again, we see how these crazy Muggles have to rely on things like "economics" because they don't have magic!

    >they don't have magic

    Ah, but you just contradicted yourself. And for further proof, I present [gyroscopes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cquvA_IpEsA), which are well-established to be thaumatological in nature.
    ```

      ```
      *Clearly* a gyroscope is a kind of magical device. That video was probably made by a squib.

  ```
  Price of goods was one thing young me fixated on when my mom read the first few Harry Potter books to me, I thought it was ridiculous how wand, book and potion ingredient prices compared. Ron even says that he's never even owned a galleon or something like that.
