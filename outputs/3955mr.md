## [BST][RT][FF] How to depict unique trauma responses in a fantasy setting?

### Post:

This question stems from my efforts in writing my first Naruto fanfic, and trying to create a more interesting, but far more unpredictable and mentally unstable (dare I say sociopathic?) Naruto.

The fic is [here](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11077254/1/Fuujin-Chronicles-of-a-Jutsu-Smith), for those interested. I haven't broached this particular topic in the story yet, which is why I want to discuss and refine the idea before putting it out there. Now, as a general idea of the circumstances surrounding said trauma, and the resulting questions:

1. The orphan child (in this case, Naruto) starts off mostly normal, but has no knowledge of the overwhelmingly negative social stigma around him (in this case, due to the demon fox sealed away inside him).
2. A freak disease, similar to the aftereffects of the fox's rampage, sweep through the town, killing hundreds. Through mob mentality, insecurity and lingering war memories, public opinion starts to come to the conclusion that this disease is the "fox's revenge", even though there is a rational explanation for it.
3. The child finds himself at the mercy of said public soon afterwards, leading a particularly incensed group of civilians to engage in beating the child to near death. The child eventually recovers, but remembers nothing of his life bar a few names, and develops a minor speech impediment (cause unknown; possible brain damage).
4. The child, unfortunately, loses his primary caregivers in the wake of the disease, and is eventually given up to an orphanage. This universe's equivalent of the Secret Service (ANBU) are forced to swear the staff to a binding oath to never intentionally harm Naruto. The fact that this is necessary, and the fact that some civilians are entertaining the notion of 'martyrdom' by making attempts on the boy's life despite the inevitable execution, does not bode well at all.
5. All goes relatively well for a few years, until certain tensions boil over, and the child is grievously attacked again, this time by means of immolation over the course of several hours, well out of sight and earshot of most authorities. The child only survives due to the near-inhuman regenerative properties of the demon fox within him, and some timely interference.
6. Due to a certain political power struggle around the boy (who could very well be maladjusted enough to play into the hands of unsavoury, war-mongering folk who want a walking human weapon), the child is forced to live as a street urchin, but not without a highly skilled patrol tracking his every move and keeping him out of immediately lethal danger.

From here, I intend to develop Naruto as being strangely affected by the demon fox's attempts to keep him alive. In a normal scenario, Naruto will be depicted as a boy harboring a near-obsessive desire to survive by making as little human contact as possible, opting instead to eavesdrop, sneak and steal. When he recognizes a threat to his life, however, he makes a psychological 180 to hyper-aggression, essentially amounting to 'remove threat NOW, at all costs' and acting akin to a frothing berzerker. My questions are:

1. Is aggression as a trauma response a viable and consistent reaction? Can it occur in children? (Assume 10+ years old)
2. What are some of the physical and mental tells of an aggressive traumatic response? How does a person usually build up to such an explosive reaction?
3. Can a child have such massive temperament swings because of a trauma response, or does it only lend itself to older characters?
4. Are there any lasting negative effects of such a condition?

  This notes some stories of dealing with triggers. I would particularly note how they modify their behaviour to avoid triggers. Waiting is stressful, so avoid activities that involve waiting for example.

    I'm starting to think I may have underestimated just how crippling a traumatic response can be. In the context of a fantasy setting, it can be twisted somewhat to the story's advantage, but god*damn* is it emotionally jarring to hear about. In ANY context.

      Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

      In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

      Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

      “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

      The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

      Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

      Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

      L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

        You managed to rationally explain strong = crazy, holy shit. Totally going to incorporate this concept. Thank you!

      Severe trauma is generally pretty bad. And yeah, it's very jarring to hear about.

  That's some really complex stuff, I'd recommend asking a subreddit on psychology or childhood development. I wouldn't trust anyone without a degree on the subject, anything else could be conjecture.

    While hard facts are nice, I'd still be reasonably happy with references to fics that address similar problems in a convincing manner, rooted in rationality. I'd take it with a grain of salt, naturally, but if I can draw parallels between said fic and science, then it can certainly be worked with to some extent.
