  #Summary:

  Players once trapped in a video game world find a way to connect it to the original world... but since the video game world is a real world in its own right, they get to keep their powers, and people back on earth can figure out how to use them as well. Politics ensue.

  Log Horizon fans will get the most out of this, but it's written so as to be relatively understandable by people not familiar with the source material.

  #Other notes:

  I'm looking for a beta, PM me for details.

  Many thanks to the posters who spellchecked/grammar checked the previous two chapters. I've decided to post fixes on saturdays, then update on sundays.

  I may or may not have gotten Tetra's personality a little confused with Pinkie Pie's on account of the hair and the whole dissapearing/reappearing gimmick.

  The part with Michael originally wasn't going to be there-- I deleted a scene and put it in because of popular demand. The scene I deleted is still canon, and will eventually be posted, but it didn't really advance the story.
