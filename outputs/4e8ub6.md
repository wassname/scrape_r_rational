  In which Hermionie gets sorted into Slytherin and is both smart *and* Hermionie about it.

    Some of the characters are also rewritten a bit to develop them more as characters (than in canon).

    The slight reworks are akin to what HPMoR did to Draco (from whiny sycophant to cunning Sith spawn). In my opinion, Applied Cultural Anthropology does this well and this greatly adds to the story.

  Just FYI, the fic appears to be originally hosted on spacebattles (https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/applied-cultural-anthropology-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-cruciatus.256787/).

  If you prefer reading it with other readers and the author's discussion included, go there instead.

  Yeah, and the story is great.
