## Rational causes of pressure for going into space in science fiction settings

### Post:

While I enjoy the sci fi space setting, one thing has come to bother me of late:

It seems that even if we were to get more efficient with developing mechanisms for space travel, that it wouldn't seem to be rational to go about colonizing space, even elsewhere in the solar system, much less other star systems, simply because of the enormous advantage to staying on Earth. 

It's easier to stay in contact with friends and relatives. You get the latest and greatest (medicine, technology, goods, etc). You have access to the most options, the most stores, the widest variety of products on offer. The air is immediately available for breathing, and water is widely available. Valuable mineral resources are right beneath your feet, and don't require enormous airtight operations to mine. Life support is not necessary and not a worry. It doesn't cost $10,000+ a pound to go somewhere. Even if overuse of resources makes the earth a wasteland, even if climate change turns the earth into a very hot planet, it would still be magnitudes more habitable and economical than going to another world.

Given that, what would be some realistic causes that would apply sufficient pressure for mankind to colonize space? And are these addressed in any good space travel themed sci fi?

  You've created scenarios where everything on Earth is basically perfect so there's no reason to leave. Most times, people leave because things aren't going well them. And your listed reasons to stay they can be easily flipped to much more realistic reasons to leave.

  Reasons to stay| Reason to leave
  --- | ---
  It's easier to stay in contact with friends and relatives. | Overpopulation, overcrowding. Or maybe you're persecuted (race, religion, politics, etc.) and surrounded by enemies.
  You get the latest and greatest (medicine, technology, goods, etc).  | Scarcity of resources, either because they've been used up or you can't afford them 
  You have access to the most options, the most stores, the widest variety of products on offer.  | Wealth hoarding, people can't afford products/services 
  The air is immediately available for breathing, and water is widely available.  | Environmental disasters, contamination/degradation. Polluted air/water. Depletion of aquifers.
  Valuable mineral resources are right beneath your feet, and don't require enormous airtight operations to mine.  | Mineral resources are depleted, but abundant in space. Or there are too many regulations for it to be profitable, while you also don't have to worry about in space 
  Life support is not necessary and not a worry.  | Earth is inhospitable (climate change, nuclear fallout, disease, environmental disasters, etc.)
  It doesn't cost $10,000+ a pound to go somewhere.  | There's nowhere *to* go (either the Earth is dying, or you're too poor, or because of war or persecution, etc.). e; Also, the actual cost is about a quarter of that, and dropping.

  The mineral resources reason is actually true - we're running out of easily accessible minerals, like high quality ore that is close to the surface. You have to dig deeper to get a worse product that you would get a few decades ago. I remember at a workshop hosted by Vale Inco (a large mining company), the company guy flat out said that they were tapping mines that a few decades ago they wouldn't have even though about because they were such poor quality.

  Space mining is supposedly the next big thing. many countries are preparing for it. Also, It doesn't necessarily need to be airtight to drill/mine. For smelting, yes, but that's a different story.

  >Even if overuse of resources makes the earth a wasteland, even if climate change turns the earth into a very hot planet, it would still be magnitudes more habitable and economical than going to another world.

  That really depends on the world in question. Most stories focus on finding/travelling to a world that is similar to Earth, or terraforming a planet to be habitable like Earth. The "Is it worth it economically?" argument also depends on the state of Earth. Many stories have people leave Earth because it is simply unlivable, for whatever reason.

  You can even look at real-world examples of why people leave their homeland today. Look at what the [Vietnamese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_boat_people) did at the end of the war. They got in boats and tried their luck (800,000 left, 200,000-400,000 died) rather than stay in Vietnam. Or the Syrians just a few years ago. Regardless of how risky it is, people will leave if they believe there's a better life somewhere else.

  You can look at historical examples, like American manifest destiny in which many people settled the frontier despite the multitude of dangers. Cheap and unclaimed land and resources.

  - u/Valdrax:
    ```
    Perhaps another American model for a rational reason for going to space would be to look at the religious settlers of colonial America, who struck out to find a space where they could be themselves without interference from larger competing cultures.

    I expect that once space habitats become affordable for groups of middle class people pooling money together to acquire, all sorts of cults and semi-affluent disaffected young adult groups (beatniks, hippies, would-be Galts, etc.) will want to set up shop on their own little "island" in space.  You could also see some groups we haven't seen before, like transhumanists looking to escape the "Luddite pearl clutching" of bioethics regulations against experimentation on enhancing their children.

  > even if we were to get more efficient with developing mechanisms for space travel

  > cost $10,000+ a pound to go somewhere

  In the vast majority of recurring-space-travel stories, the cost is reduced by orders of magnitude. People often buy tickets from one planet to another, or even between star systems, for the cost of a few days or months of labor, what might be ones or tens of dollars per pound in today's money.

  > Even if overuse of resources makes the earth a wasteland, even if climate change turns the earth into a very hot planet, it would still be magnitudes more habitable [...] than going to another world.

  No, it wouldn't. If the Earth's climate shifts even 5% towards Venus' climate, Mars would probably start to compare favorably. And that's just considering our solar system; in any story with interstellar travel you'll eventually find a planet or gas giant's moon with a climate and atmosphere more hospitable than Earth.

  > Valuable mineral resources are right beneath your feet, and don't require enormous airtight operations to mine.

  The cost and danger to mine lithium and coltan go up every year as we exhaust the easy to reach deposits, and we need more of them every year for high tech industries and products. The cost and danger to mine the asteroids go down every year as we get better at space travel. Those two curves will cross far before reaching the future settings of many scifi stories.

    The problem with that reasoning is, if you had enough energy, knowledge and resources to ship the entirety of humanity to Mars and terraform it or make it liveable, you'd have hundreds of times more energy, knowledge and resources that are needed to geoengineer Earth back into whatever the fuck you want it to be. I agree with OP's view if you apply it to full migration of the entire species. That sort of plot is usually nonsense. See Interstellar, where somehow they decide moving to another planet is the best solution to some kind of *crop disease* - never mind that it would be tremendously easy to just carry the disease over in whatever seeds, seedlings, soil, or even air they bring over from Earth to initiate agriculture on the new planet.

    The thing is more, when it comes to *regular* space migration, there might be a ton of reasons for people to do that. Maybe a bunch of Mormons want to found Space Utah. But that would still leave the bulk of humanity on Earth.
    ```

    - u/sparr:
      ```
      > ship the entirety of humanity

      You seem to be assuming that people only pursue solutions that work for everyone. Most stories present the scenario that a small minority of people are going to Mars, in part to escape the crowding and people of Earth.

      It's much more viable to get .1% of us living on Mars than 100%, and that's enough reason to "go into space", regardless of how many people they leave behind.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        I'm not assuming one thing or the other, I'm saying the criticism of the OP rightfully applies specifically to those plots of movies, novels, games etc. that involve that sort of mass migration. I agreed that smaller groups would be much more viable.
        ```

        - u/sparr:
          ```
          OP did not mention mass migration. "Colonize" does not mean everyone leaves Earth. "Travel" does not mean everyone leaves Earth.
          ```

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            Yes, and what I said was: those criticisms ONLY apply to the scenarios where everyone leaves Earth at once (which are indeed very common in popular sci-fi). But as you point out, those are not the only scenarios, so OP applied a bit too much of a broad brush and threw out the baby with the bath water.

    Just to add to this point, it looks like OP's figures are out of date and probably using the Space Shuttle as the launch vehicle ($12,000/lb.). However, prices have been steadily decreasing, and as of 2020, the Falcon Heavy can put a pound into low Earth orbit for about $430. SpaceX's Starship project is planned to be able to put a pound into orbit for under $10, and supposed to be ready for manned test flights by 2023. I'm not certain how feasible that goal is, but the fact they've even set that as a planned goal makes me think that getting below $100/pound within ten years is probably very feasible.

      To be fair, LEO is not equivalent to space travel. What are the best numbers right now for geosynchronous orbit (which still isn't far enough, but much more comparable)?

  Have you studied project rho? 

  http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/macguffinite.php

  http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/approcketcatu.php

  Among the featured reasons: 

  - "build it and they will come" approach, seems to be what Mr Musk is going for, eg if marginal costs drop low enough applications will pop up. 

  - military applications, SDI satellites 

  - new space race, might be between private entities (musk/bezos)  

  - Special space ressource - Helium 3 for fusion being the typical example, though moon ore mining is not feasible due to low yield. For this you'll want gas giant aerostat mining. 

  - noble metal asteroid mining has always been an evergreen. Might become even more relevant in the coming decades when en-masse electrolysis capability is being built (platinum used as electrode material). Offset by fossil car cat recycling. 

  - escape from nation states, eg. religious reasons, think Utah in space, or maybe transhumanists that want to escape the worldwide human fetal modification ban. 

  - asteroid hit and subsequent standing asteroid redirection capability - what happens if Chicago or Denver or Rome are wiped out? 

  - we have a couple windows the next decades to redirect 100m asteroids into stable close earth orbits, Apophis - subsequent mining makes it a great basis for the rest of the system.

  - new drive tech that takes the distance out as a factor. Eg. plasma magnet sail works only sol-outbound but can very cheaply get up to 400km/s, you "only" need a way to brake. 

  Any way you cut it you need some way to drive cost down A LOT, laser launch/linear accelerator/reusable rocket/launch loop/canada uses north pole to get clean(ish) orion drive or something to even start the process.

  EDIT: I forgot one that actually works somewhat well: rich space nerds. There are a lot of high pay jobs that can be done remote, software as the leading example. So a small minority might prefer owning a tunnel in phobos instead of owning a house in silicon valley. Just takes a rather minor extrapolation of launch cost falls and SF house price increases.

  EDIT2:    one thats *actually* realistic. Humanity as a whole has decided it'd rather bear the consequences of global heating instead of cutting CO2 emisions drastically. There will be a time in the near future where it'll be cheaper to engineer the climate instead of dealing with the consequences of heating.  The current cheapest plan to do that is dumping 100k tons of sulfur into the upper stratosphere, seeding clouds, reducing incoming solar energy but brings acidic rainfalls. That runs to 5e9 $ yearly, pretty cheap - but politically infeasible in current eco-hippy atmosphere.    The one plan that can be done unilaterally without running afoul of my very cynically modelled eco-crowd is solar soletta plans.

    > politically infeasible in current eco-hippy atmosphere

    While I’m not against climate engineering in principle, if the political atmosphere really was “eco hippy” we wouldn’t be in this shit. Being extremely wary of interventions on a complex system we can’t fully model or predict and whose functioning we depend on is common sense.

      I don't have a better name for the type of pseudo environmentalism that forbids one-time use plastics in the name of pollution+global warming. Some type of NIMBY-ism for CO2 and other related blind spots.

        ```
        It's often called "greenwashing" - the process of focusing on very small actions that mostly fall on consumers to create an illusion of environmental progress to relieve pressure on regulators and major industrial operators to enact anything like real effective change.
        ```

- u/CreationBlues:
  ```
  Everyone else is focusing on getting off of earth, so lets talk about what causes travel once people are *already* in space.

  First of all, travel is cheap cheap cheap. Once you have an industrial base on the moon, you're more than halfway to anywhere. Asteroid belt, oort cloud, the moons of the gas giants, the sun, all of them are relatively easy to get to.

  If you've got the tech to make O'Neil cylinders, then most places in the solar system are the same as any other. In fact, through the use of [Cycler Orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycler) pretty much any ship/station can be turned into a trade city as it efficiently transports wealth between the major/minor bodies of the solar system. 

  Second, there are trillions of dollars worth of value locked in the rest of the solar system. Yes, metals will be vastly devalued *relative to the dollar.* But water is both necessary and cheap, and if there was a bottleneck in water the productivity in the economy would drop massively. In the same way, the *value* of metals would not change as they have the exact same uses as they did before. The difference is that they'd be freer to be used both in necessary and less necessary ways. While metals would be worth less, the total economy would explode in productivity. 

  Finally, you need to consider the role of technology. Try to forecast not only the needs of our current society but the future needs and abilities of humanity.

- u/AngryEdgelord:
  ```
  One of the main drivers for relocation in the past has been competition. If food, housing, healthcare, and opportunities rise beyond the cost of moving into space, then people will move into space. That could be because of war, famine, massive overpopulation, class stratification, you name it. People will pack up looking for greener pastures, even if those pastures end up being in space.
  ```

- u/vakusdrake:
  ```
  In the short term people will be incentivized to live in space in order to capitalize on space mining and manufacturing. That doesn't necessarily get you a very sizable population of people in space however. Once technology (primarily automation) advances to a certain point however (and this needn't even be close to AGI), suddenly the dynamic changes completely. 

  Once you can have self replicating machines mining planets ([say Mercury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4aXmnQzJ0o)) and asteroids to pump out massive numbers of satellites made mostly of a thin foil solar sail, suddenly scarcity becomes almost nonexistent for most essential goods. Moreover individual people can afford to commission their own stellaser to send out massive numbers of Von Neumann probes. Importantly this also flips many of the sorts of scarcity you mention on their head. Suddenly anybody can potentially afford their own O'Neil cylinder with many square miles of space and live like a king in space, but particularly as the population grows the value of land *on Earth* will skyrocket.       
  VR/Mind Uploading/AGI also create massive incentives to move into space: Since resources are cheaper in space and if you already live in a simulated world the physical location of your body only becomes relevant insofar as it comes to lightspeed communication delays. Hell digital mind could just alter their perception of time (and run speed) so hours of lightspeed lag wasn't bothersome. Digital minds also change the colonization dynamic, because they may just send out lots of Von-Neumann probes prepare systems for their arrival and then just transmit over copies of their mind.

  [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTAxjJ6KY7M&t=29s) describes some of what that early asteroid mining would look like and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyLPPXaGl5A&t=17s) describes the dynamics of early interstellar colonization. An important takeaway is that people will probably start colonizing other star systems *well* before post-human civilization is close to fully utilizing this solar systems resources. Since sufficient automation and resource/energy abundance makes such tasks accessible, and many people/groups will have motivations for such colonization with the isolation likely being considered the whole point.

  If your objective is long life and creature comforts, then yes I would agree space travel is for the short term not a rational, and perhaps even logical stand. 

  However rationality is not the execution of a logical goal, it is the method in which an objective is reached. I could have the objective of being the man to balance the most spoons on my body, and the daily training I go through and iterate on as I learn new techniques, perhaps even contacting and learning from the others in the world with the niche skill, is rational. It would be irrational to call up the Guinness record keepers and demand a judge without a day of practice.

  Now, on a personal note on the reasons for space exploration and the want to spend ungodly amounts of time in a tiny tin can, breathing in recycled air, drinking recycled piss, and fearing that a single failure in the delicate systems keeping me alive? I can only blame personal [wanderlust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YH3c1QZzRK4), I want to be there, and even if it costs me my life at least be confident that I've helped move Humanity forwards. 

  Every colony effort in history has been paid in bodies, and space will be no different.

  On the long term, I've got the objective of getting my own black hole to place an Instanced copy of myself in orbit of very near the event horizon, watch the Universe die just to see it. A little grandiose I admit, but better to dream big than not at all I think.

- u/Watchful1:

  The biggest reasons for colonization in history have been availability of resources and escaping political/religious oppression. Space offers lots of resources, metals, cheap solar energy, lots of unclaimed space, that aren't easily available on earth. But the biggest reasons have always been when one group of people tries to tell another group of people how they can live their lives, so the second group just up and leaves.

  One of my favorite sci fi stories has a plot line where the countries of earth signed a treaty that included a ban on individuals proselytizing. It was actually illegal to talk about your religion unless the other person asked you first. So both muslim and christian groups went off and built their own colonies on different planets so they didn't have to agree to that. Beliefs like that can be so strongly held that they are worth giving up all the creature comforts you talk about.

  Lesser reasons would be scientific research and outside pressure. That's likely how it's going to happen for us, we'll build a scientific colony on mars that will slowly grow over the years as it gets cheaper to go back and forth. In sci fi, you could also have a pressure of either an impending natural disaster, or outright invasion. Given enough time, earth would surely expand simply out of a sense of self preservation. In another sci fi story, advanced aliens place a bubble around earth that slows down time at a rate of years per second. Earth reacts by throwing together a colonization mission to mars, which builds an entire society over thousands of years which takes place in minutes on earth.

  Lastly, we can turn to the reason we went to the moon, in the words of John F Kennedy, 

  > We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
