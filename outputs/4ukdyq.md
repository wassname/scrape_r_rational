## [RST][HSF] The Talos Principle

### Post:

So the Talos Principle is a puzzle game from a few years ago where the player character is an AI (hopefully an AGI) in the final stages of its development. While the gameplay itself isn't really anything special beyond some really great puzzles, the game's story and characters are all pretty interesting. Very little of the philosophical ground and concepts in AI development will be new to people, but here I think it's still worth checking out for a pretty solid story that focuses on the interaction between the three main AI characters, as well as all the little background details and lore like the audio logs from the Lead AI Researcher and the messages left behind by other AI.

  There's also [an HPMOR Easter egg](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3efc4o/hpmor_easter_egg_found_in_the_talos_principle/) in it. So, you know, Our Tribe.

  If you do want to watch an LP, I highly recommend [Dan Burns' (CannibalK9) Let's Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_kL6tclhB0&list=PLN9s4vA_ONwAN8v3nAFNv4WdRdkg2b5Jv) of this game. He shows every bit of text and lore in the game, and provides quite high-level commentary and context throughout. Semi-scripted, and pretty funny at times. On top of that, he completes every single puzzle in addition to finding every easter egg.
