  I'm looking to get into a new story. Do I need to have played the games to understand this one?

    It's fandom-blind friendly.  Since I've changed so much of the lore, I have to re-expound everything relevant so that an informed audience knows what hasn't changed.

  I loved the game, and I think you've captured the characters here pretty well.

  This chapter release gave me the excuse I needed to get off my ass and type up all my thoughts on the story so far!

  As I mentioned in the last thread, I'm a big Fire Emblem fan and loved 3H, so this has been a great read. I'm also a writer and know how gratifying it is when people read your work and give detailed thoughts, so I'm hoping this will help motivate you to keep at it.

  We start out with a nice little summary of relevant world info, as well as our introductions to... two lords. I was waiting for Edelgard and was surprised to see Jeralt, though thinking about it's clear why we don't see this scene of hers. I did think it odd how little the opening narration focused on crests, for how large a role they play in the story, but their importance will be made readily apparent as things unfold!

  >*When nobles within the Kingdom were found to be complicit in aiding the assassins, a peasant revolt followed, led by a heretical prophet who challenged the divine right to rule granted to the nobility via Crests*

  ...huh. Unless I'm forgetting something major, this seems like new backstory. Faerghus in the middle of a revolt is definitely different, and this prophet... well, I'm putting my chips on TWSITD right now, but let's see where this goes. I'm also interested to see exactly how much the investigation into Duscur uncovered, and if there are any secrets left (a major difference between this and canon, in general, is how many secrets are just kinda out in the open from the beginning).

  >Despite his uncle’s promise to meet him here three hours ago, Dimitri had needed to barge into his uncle’s room and rouse the Grand Duke from his hungover, whore-covered stupor.

  Oof. Poor Dimitri. We didn't get to see much of this in canon, so I enjoyed seeing it fleshed out more here.

  >Is there some huge meeting of all the biggest and baddest nobles where I need to get on stage and dance

  White Heron Cup winner=Claude confirmed?

  Honestly, Claude is too good for Oswald. 

  I guess we're getting a little window into how Jeralt came to Remire. There's apparently some added intrigue involved. I feel like there's more here than we ended up resolving a few chapters down the line -- Jeralt got put right into the path of the Knights of Seiros AND a crest-beast -- but all the info we have right now makes it out to be coincidence.

  >For weapons, he carried an arming sword and a heater shield

  As someone who both doesn't have much of an education in medieval weapons and doesn't like having to stop reading to google things, a couple adjectives would have come in handy here.

  >“As you can see,” our nervous greeter began, “we’ve been attacked by a demonic beast."

  Ok, so this is how the Remire incident goes down in this story. While it makes a hell of a lot more sense than >!Edelgard ordering bandits to try to kill her!<, I was worried that this is the beginning of a ficwide rehabilitation of the Flame Emperor's image. I still am, but given later events, to a much milder extent.

  It's also interesting that knowledge of the beasts is so widespread. In canon, they're kind of just *there*, but kept secret until the Miklan incident to keep it a surprise, and never really mentioned -- though judging by the frequency with which they appear in off-day battles, they aren't particularly rare. It makes sense that the general public being aware of them enough to classify them into different names is the only coherent explanation here (although death wyrm is a new one).

  >“Goddess, Byleth,” said Colm

  We've got some familiar faces among the faceless mercenaries, heh.

  >The beast appeared aggressive, but seemed to be having trouble deciding which of its assailants to attack as its hide became littered with bolts.  It turned this way and that, baying at each one of us while the others continued to fire at it.  Finally, the thing turned its snout to the sky and bayed once again before jumping back over the moat and fleeing into the forest.

  You lost me here. This is the opportunity to establish the beast as a threat, and I don't come to the end of the paragraph feeling threatened.

  >“Pah!” decried Arthur.  “Funny how the one guy who decided to shoot the beast while it was right up in his face is the only one who got offed.  I guess he wasn’t listening when the Commander said not to be a hero, eh?”

  This is another (I assume inadvertent) undermining of the beast as a threat, as the casualty specifically has been called out as only dying because he did something dumb.

  We don't have to go full Endbringer this early in the story, but fleshing out the fight a bit more and having it almost turn into a disaster before Jeralt steps in (showing off his abilities and establishing his credibility) and salvages things enough to get the beast to flee might have worked better? I don't know what considerations and tradeoffs you were considering, but that's my outside-looking-in take.

  And since this is as good a time as any to bring this up, constantly cycling in new dialogue tags like 'decried' is a trap. In >75% of circumstances, 'said' is the proper choice, and the best situation is one where you have no need for dialogue tags at all.

  (RIP Cord, we hardly knew you)

  >Barst—one of the mercs on our volley team

  Well, of course Cord died! You had to go and split up the dream team!

  >My new plan was simple: I would serve as the bait so I could draw the beast in and light up the cart.

  I would like to register my preference for a more complex plan, with tension where things go wrong followed by clever improvisation to deliver a victory. I was hopong for an opportunity to believe in Byleth's intelligence here, and to believe that the mercenaries were up against a credible threat. 

  As well, it could have been a strong choice to reward fans of the game by putting some more tangible nods to beast-fighting strategies. I can *kinda* see them right now if I squint (use the explosive barrel gambit to wipe out the beast's yellow squares, stunning it, then swarm with your units), but it could have been leaned into more imo. 

  >When it cleared, there was only the rock, no longer glowing, and a human with long, white hair.

  Oh shi--

  >“This is what demonic beasts are,” Father explained.  “They’re just people or animals that touch these rocks—Crest stones.  No one without a Crest can handle them safely.”

  ...huh. And here I'd always assumed most demonic beasts were naturally-occurring, with crest stone-induced transformation being relatively rare. (I'm not the biggest Fodlan lore expert, so I could be completely off-base).

  If this were common knowledge, I'd expect a major focus of the continent's forces to be rounding up and securing crest stones to prevent demonic beasts from wreaking havoc, but I guess it doesn't have to be. Jeralt *is* someone who could feasibly know that when others don't.

  One then wonders why he didn't tell Byleth until now, or why Byleth doesn't treat it like more of a revelation (other than his emotional capacity being utterly stunted).

  Hmm.

  >“Damn the Dagdans and their stupid invasion.  If not for them, we might’ve been able to stay in Brigid forever.”

  Huh, young Byleth dealing with the Dagda and Brigid war sounds like it could be an interesting fic all by itself.

  >“After Herstal,” I said, “you told me the Church couldn’t be trusted.  That they would try to control me, because of my Crest.  That they did something to me, when I was a child.  There’s a reason why my face doesn’t emote properly, why my blood flows even though my heart doesn’t beat, why I don’t sweat or shiver in any temperature.”

  So we're just dropping all the info left and right. Makes me wonder what twists are being held in reserve. 

  >“I was a coward. I took you and ran, rather than confront the Archbishop.  She was your grandmother; she might have told me what she’d done, explained it to me if I was willing to listen.”

  So the whole conceit of restructuring the story so it's less about people making choices based on lack of/misinformation and more about conflicting ideals still has a pretty major choice made based on a lack of information. Granted, you'd have to change a LOT to get around this particular plot point.

  > I’m feeling like I’m only middle-aged, and I was born towards the end of the tenth century—she’s older, but you’d never guess it.

  Yeah, ALL the information. 

  >I greeted the local priest and explained to her my interest in the well-being of the beast-turned boy.  To my surprise, the child was already awake.  He was sitting up in bed and turned to look at me when I entered the room.  His eyes were yellow with huge irises, constricted such that his pupils were tiny.

  I was very surprised that this guy survived. Clearly a TWS experiment, but what's his story? I'm interested in where this goes.

  >Each Crest could come in either a Minor or Major variant, with the Minor variant of a Crest granting a single supernatural power to its bearer: for example, the Minor Crest of Seiros granted superhuman strength—it allowed its bearer to exert far greater force than should be possible for the size of their body.  The Major variant of a Crest granted the power of its Minor variant in addition to a power exclusive to the Major form: for example, Father’s Major Crest of Seiros granted him both superhuman strength and extended longevity.

  It's fun seeing the actual crest powers translated from their gameplay benefits. Not sure how the different manifestations of "increased strength" are going to be differentiated, though. Hopefully there's a plan for that.

  Also, this is about when I realized Sothis hasn't shown up yet. Did she get retconned out of existence?

    >To my surprise, my fastest friend in the Knights was Gilbert

    It's a little unrealistic to have ALL the important knights of Seiros on this single mission, isn't it? Alois was present in canon, and I could buy Shamir coming along because they're now tracking something... I GUESS it would make sense for Catherine to be there since relics are important assets against demonic beasts. Adding Gilbert too strikes me as gratuitous. 

    >I was impressed by the detailed craftsmanship that went into these statues, for the individual rings of riveted mail were visible, and Seiros’s long hair flowed down her shoulders like it was truly soft.

    >!Assuming that in this more rational version, people think Seiros's appearance is different than it actually was...!<

    >She ran up to me and hugged me tightly, pressing the side of her face up against mine.  I just stood there, unsure of how to react.  “All these years, I thought I had lost you, but you’re back, here in my arms, safe and sound...”

    Real subtle there, Rhea --

    >“Enough, Jeralt.  You’ve brought my grandson back to me

    Oh right. He's also that.
    Side note: I'm sad you went with male Byleth for this story, as female Byleth makes so much more sense to me.

    >“Well, if I may make a suggestion, then—in his report, Alois told me of how you’d been teaching one of the Knights the basics of sorcery.  How would you like being a teacher?”

    Oooh, nice. This makes way more sense than... whatever the hell the game pulled.

    >Alois remarked that Jeralt credited you with the plan that let your under-equipped company defeat a demonic beast,” Rhea said.

    This would be more impressive if the plan hadn't been so simple and obvious, tbh

    >and the Flight instructor. 

    Oh phew, classes work somewhat intelligently in this universe, and Byleth isn't on the hook for teaching everything from bows to white magic.

    >“As a matter of fact, I am as well.  I’ve long come to rely upon magic for waking me.  I can cast a similar spell on you, but be warned, it will wake you at the designated time each day without fail for the next thirty days, after which I will need to renew it.  When do you want to wake?”

    I don't have enough information on this universe's version of white magic, but it seems like a bad idea to trust this.

    >Tears started to well in Felix’s eyes, and soon, he was sobbing.

    >We’ve got to get him to open up to us.  Ingrid, I think you should show romantic interest in him.”

    Oh Sylvain.

    As a more general, ficwide note, I think you have a solid grasp of each character's essence, though the dialogue itself is a weak spot...

    >“Father,” Lorenz Hellman Gloucester said with a bow.  “I am ready to depart for Garreg Mach.  While attending the Officers’ Academy, I promise to bring excellence to the Gloucester name through both words and deeds, to find a wife whose marriage will nurture House Gloucester’s prestige, and to discover the measure of our rival house’s heir.  May the Goddess bless me on this journey.”

    ...except in Lorenz's case, as he actually talks like that.

    >antlers

    I'd imagine there's a shorter slang term for commoners, though Lorenz would still use it. "Bucks" is perhaps too cheeky, but I'd experiment with monosyllabic alternatives :P 

    >“Sorry for the earlier deception.  My name’s not Nagir, and I’m not a holy man.  I’m Lord Claude von Riegan, the duke’s grandson. 

    Other people have said this already, but you nail Claude.

    >“I’m afraid Grandfather has found this kind of subterfuge a necessity ever since my uncle died.”

    Of course this is what Claude WOULD say to excuse the fact that he felt like dressing up as a holy man.

    >“It’s a Crest manifestation.  Someone who bears a Crest can cause it to manifest with a basic sorcery—it’s an easy way to prove someone’s a Crest-bearer.

    This seems like a pretty convenient addition to the world. Hanneman's machine seems a lot less necessary now. Is there a difference between a major and a minor manifestation? And do crest heirs without sorcery have a way to prove their blood (I guess they could always demonstrate their increased strength/speed/etc.)

    >“Excited to head to school, Hilda?” Holst asked.

    I am a little put out that the characters we've seen ingame get described, while Holst gets nothing. Filling in the gaps like that are an important thing for this type of fic to accomplish.

    >“Wait!  My book!” Bernadetta wailed.  “Oh Goddess, I’ll die if anyone reads that!  Don’t leave it!”

    Relatable. 
    (Loved those last few vignettes) 

    >“Hey kid, I’m Professor Catherine.

    Of all the people to meet, lol

    Okay, seven chapters in and I think I'll save commenting on the rest for another day. Looking forward to chapter 16 :)
