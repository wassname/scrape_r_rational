  Also, this:

  > “Most caterpillars die in the cocoon,” I said.  “They’re eaten by animals or injected with parasitic wasp eggs.  A majority of them never get to become butterflies.”
  >
  > “Do you still believe that?”

  > It’s a fact.  It’s not about belief.  But that wasn’t what he meant.
  >
  > I thought about Headmaster Tau, and his speech to me about destiny.  I thought about how close I was to a new body, a new life.
  >
  > “There were men and women,” I said.  “Crawling over each other’s corpses on Lyna Wethers’ yacht.  And Kaplen, he forced me to feed him – “  I closed my eyes.  “In a flash, the Silver Flask cafe turned into a mass grave full of rubble.  Your other mercenaries – the Shenti man, the woman with mortars – they both died too, on Attlelan Island.”  I stared at the ground.  “How many of them had hopes and dreams and ambitions?  How many of them thought this was just the beginning of their story?”  I clenched my teeth.  “Of course I still believe that.  How could I not?”

  This.

  This is the thing.

  I'm glad that Ana managed to, if not stand up to Lorne, at least risk losing his patronage before she got outed. She found her line and refused to cross it, she won't have to wonder "how far would I have gone, if Lorne had kept pushing me, if it hadn't all gone to pieces?"

  I'm hopeful that this results in Ana (and the rest of them, but mostly Ana) turning on Paragon. I'd be surprised if they straight-up joined Tunnel Vision, but I can see them becoming more aware of the inequality and injustices that their society is built on when they no longer have anything to gain from supporting the status quo. Ana *desperately* needs some class consciousness and this might just push her in that direction. Shame it'll likely ruin things with Tasia though.

  > “It’s nothing,” said Lorne.  “Just in our vault, my family has an Allen Norrys, a pair of Johen Wardes, a Luca Hagan, **and a vintage Maxine Clive**.  That one’s female, but it’s the first-ever chassis model that was sold in the Eight Oceans.  Worth a lot.”

  Well, we know where Ana will be stealing her replacement body. Karma's a bitch.

  (by the way, the brands of similar-looking bodies being given people names really reminds me of the initial teaser for Twig, the one that followed Fray around)

  > Her smile seemed forced, her words rote and formulaic.  Is she even paying attention?

  Huh. I wonder what her deal is.

  > A thrill rushed through my veins.  *He thinks I have a destiny?*  But I was just an assistant, a Grey Coat who came from nothing, who failed her admissions test three times in a row.  *But he thinks you have a destiny.*

  Ana, how are you *still* that starry-eyed?

  > Instead of returning to my capsule, I went to Hira’s house.

  Wait, what?

  Tunnel Vision explicitly told her she knew where they'd live, and she would bomb their house and snipe the survivors if they pissed her off.

  I'm really surprised they didn't go on the run after learning Brin didn't manage to off her.
