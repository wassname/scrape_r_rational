## Rational media using the 'traditional' laws of magic?

### Post:

Pondering a game's magic system based on old-school golden bough laws: contagion, association, similarity, polarity, True Names. Has anyone seen/read any rational media that features these?

  [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/) is by the same author as Worm, and is in a similar 'rational-adjacent' place. At the very least it has excellent worldbuilding, and plays a lot with its magic system.

    The ending fell a bit flat for me. I did love the magic system though.

  https://www.amazon.com/Master-Five-Magics-Lyndon-Hardy/dp/0345334256 has reasonably well thought out magic systems that include some traditional staples, and which also include rational-ish societal integrations.  I'm not sure the plot or most characters would qualify as rational.

  If I don't remember badly that was how Ursula K. Le Guin's "A Wizard of Earthsea" magic tended to work. Especially the True Names part. That said, it wasn't exactly rational maybe but I don't remember any major plot problems or contrivances in it either - the first novel of the cycle, at least. I think it sort of got lost after that, but it's good that it also works well as a stand-alone story.

  Charles Stross' The Laundry Files series has smart characters and heavily features all those.
