## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

    Unless you're sitting on a huge nest egg or your wife can shoulder the family's expenses for the foreseeable future, giving up your job is a very risky gamble right now. Worrying about employment is way more stressful than any 50 hour week.

    If you're thinking about a major career transition, it's safer to first give yourself time to sleep on it and set up foundations. Don't bail out on a "grass is greener" mentality. 

    In the meantime, look for ways to wind down after a long day/week. Maybe ask your wife for her input? It sounds like both of you are honest with your feelings and there's a lot of stress relieving activities that are made infinitely easier with a partner.

    In my personal experience, Coding Bootcamps are a gamble, but also the fastest way to switch to a programming career.

    The more you need out of a Coding Bootcamp, the harder you will have to work AND the less likely the gamble will pay off. If you just need work experience to put on your resume so companies don't skip you over, (Coding Bootcamps should have a big capstone project), it honestly isn't much of a gamble. You are trading in money for time. 

    If you need to learn actual coding/need help passing technical interviews/etc., then it depends on how badly you want to get out of your current position. It will require a lot of hard work and constant networking to make it pay off. I'm not sure if it's worth it in general, but it may be worth it for you.

    Get a vacation if possible, if not go to a doctor or dentist friend and munchk a work paid leave paper for a few days with a random excuse. Or make your work more bearable in whatever way you can. If you're planning to quit you might as well slack off a couple weeks on pay while you prepare.

    AFAIK, bootcamps give a structure to the learning. After that, their main boost is the networking - getting a job via a referral is a lot more effective than cold submission.

    It won't help you not be burned out. Usually it's worse - I think you're the first person to talk about burnout in a non-software field.

  Making a good hard magic system is one the harder logical puzzles I have done.

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    How does yours work? How hard is it? For my main story I like to think the magic gets explained quite well and is internally consistent, but I could never, for example, put numbers to it like you can with science.

      I am trying to make a really hard magic system.  I am trying to explain the rules well so that the reader can purpose a spell and I could explain with the given rules why or why not it would work.

    > I do, however, believe that the "no discussion of US politics  whatsoever" rule should be relaxed to a degree and not be enforced quite  so strictly in the Off Topic / Open Thread 

    IIRC, once upon a time that's the way it was, and it was shifted from "only in off-topic" to "none at all" because it *still* devolved into insanity on a regular basis.

        It was the whole thread. A whole thread that had more activity in it than all the other weekly posts combined sometimes, it was just a mess.  The rule isn't just about hiding it from people who don't want to see, it's cutting off the reason for anyone to brigade and cause trouble and requiring moderation energy.

        It wasn't just 'derailing'.  It incited slapfights and brigading and all the other culture war mainstays.  Frankly it was just more trouble than it's worth.  It sucks that it means we don't discuss important and divisive current events here, but it also means we don't have to listen to Outgroup trying to peddle their wares and pick fights, either.

    > I believe that Black Lives Matter

    This subreddit has a blanket ban on US politics. Read the rules before commenting.

    To answer some obvious objections: yes, "black lives matter" is considered a political statement, in the same way that I would consider any slogan of a political movement to be itself political, even if the slogan itself is obvious or anodyne when considered by itself.

    And yes, a blanket ban on politics favors the status quo, or if not the status quo, then whoever is winning a cultural, ideological, or political war. That said, the cost of allowing politics is that this subreddit becomes yet another battlefield, which it's been in the past. People need places to take care of themselves, escapes from the constant anxiety and tension of the real world, and a subreddit that's primarily for the discussion of fiction *should be* one of those places.

    Yes, this means that it's also a place for odious people to not get confronted about their odiousness, and no, I wouldn't want every place to adopt our policy. I'll also note that this subreddit has a lot of readers who aren't from America (though they might still be impacted by or care about American problems, or have their own similar problems).

    On a personal note, I live in Minnesota and have been feeling stressed, anxious, angry, and helpless. I have friends and family living in the Twin Cities that are helping to organize and provide aid to those who need it, both with the protests and riots. This will probably be the last mod note that I write on the subject, and I'll let the other two mods handle reports for a bit, since this particular topic has been wearing pretty heavily on me, and I doubt my ability to remain objective and/or mentally healthy. /u/ketura, /u/PeridexisErrant
