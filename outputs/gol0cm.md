## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I wrote [a short FAQ on writing serial fiction](http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2020/05/serial-writing-faq.html), which might be of interest to people here.

    This is great! Why not post it as an actual post on the subreddit?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Sure. It's mostly not specific to rational fiction though. (Actually, on second thought I'll wait until I have it up on my website, rather than my old blogger account, should be later tonight.)

  Got a postdoc offer yesterday! At least a verbal one via zoom, nothing in writing yet, though I also got a follow-up email that HR had approved / confirmed funding availability and was preparing the official paperwork. Very excited! It's at the school my wife matched to for her residency (Stanford) and we'll be working in literally adjacent buildings. First person I reached out to, too, and the #1 recommendation of a former postdoc alum from the school (as a really impactful lab with an absurdly nice, life-work-balance-y PI). Also a bit of a pivot from my PhD focus (in Anthropology -- postdoc is in Pathology + Computer Science, doing computational multiomics methods development in a Bayesian, neural framework); chatting with lab members they were all "why yes I have but a Master's in high-dimensional tensor calculus, only a few dozen papers published, really looking forward to taking advantage of your expertise" lol, but they were not dissuaded by my disclamations. Guess I won't be going into industry after all (though the lab has outstanding industry placement). Should be a lot of fun!

  Otherwise this week has been pretty solid! Monday we came home from our evening walk to $40 of misdelivered steaming hot takeout for two -- called the restaurant up and they said to keep it. Coincidentally also vegan! On the same day I received a lens (Sony 24-105 f4) for the camera I just upgraded to (a7iii) -- gave it [a quick spin](https://i.redd.it/o8zbc0own4051.jpg) and am looking forward to really putting it through its paces. Sold my old camera gear to friends on FB pretty much instantaneously. And a non-centered reparameterization of a model that'd been giving me lots of trouble increased my sampling efficiency by three orders of magnitude. 

  edit: also realized that this upcoming Monday is Memorial Day! So I don't need to prep lecture! Ooh, and I think y'all would like [this image](https://i.imgur.com/lJyWCe4.png) I tossed together for a talk. Still gotta smooth out the lines on the face, but quite like how it turned out!

  For those of you following along with Space Trains, it is now [out on Itch.io](https://noisy-owl.itch.io/space-trains). Steam is stuck in some limbo state awaiting approval.
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    How much have you expanded the endgame, or other content, from what we saw in the demo builds?
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      Depends on when you saw a demo build. I kept posting them pretty far into the game's development. The endgame is two technologies that allow you to win the game and a congratulations screen with scoring. There are two more powerful logistics technologies past the endgame ones for people who want to push the tech that far.

      I think the versions most people here saw had four "weird things in space" and now there are nine of them.

      The last things I worked on were a tutorial and a complete overhaul of the way research works.

      My plans for post-launch content additions are one more victory tech, one more regular tech, several more "weird things in space," and some balance changes.

    Steam approval came in midway through the weekend, so now it's [available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1291610/Space_Trains/) as well.

    It's been a ride, thanks for coming along.

  I'm a fan of mobile games, but most of the market is garbage. I only play games that have a one-time fee to remove ads/play. Anything trying to sell me bonus lives has bad incentives. I also like games that allow me to stare off into space between moves, which cuts down on the relevant possibility space.

  A few games I like:

  1. [Hoplite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magmafortress.hoplite): Turn-based strategy
  2. [Backgammon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.aifactory.backgammon): The option to put in dice rolls yourself helped while I was learning to not feel like it was cheating me on rolls
  3. [Holedown](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grapefrukt.games.bore): There's a million brick-breaker type games on android and this is the only one that doesn't keep trying to sell me extra lives
  4. [Underhand](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.gdiac.underhand): Neat little card based Cult Simulator.
  5. [Hyperrogue](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roguetemple.hyperroid): Roguelike with hyperbolic geometry. Very little of the traditional looter-stabber mechanics of traditional roguelikes, but the gimmick is real cool.
  ```

    Here's a bunch I like (may or may not have ads in them):

    - [Dungeon Cards](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.The717pixels.DungeonCards&hl=en), a turn-based grid-based roguelike puzzle dungeon crawl.

    - [Rustbucket](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nitrome.rustbucket&hl=en), also turn-based, and a puzzle adventure. Nice graphics.

    - [Dungeon Tales](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.homecookedgames.dungeontales&hl=en), a card-based roguelike dungeon crawl. Like Slay the Spire, if you've played that.

    - [Rogue Adventure](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.sharklab.rogueadventure&hl=en), a card-based roguelike dungeon crawl. Also like Slay the Spire.

    - [The Battle of Polytopia](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.midjiwan.polytopia&hl=en), a turn-based strategy nation-building game. Sort of like Civilization.

    - [Zhed](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.groundcontrol.zhed&hl=en), an abstract puzzle game in 2d space.

    - [Calculator 2: The Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simplemachine.calculator2&hl=en), a puzzle game based on combining numbers using different functions.

    - [The Devil's Calculator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cinqmarsmedia.devilscalc&hl=en), a puzzle game based on inferring sequences of numbers. More mathy than the above.

    - [The Guides Axiom](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kevinbradford.games.axiom&hl=en), a puzzle game where you're given images and things to interact with and have to figure out hidden secrets and answers. Probably the hardest out of any on this list.

    - [Assembly Line](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olympus.assemblyline&hl=en), an assembly-based game of efficiently placing machines to create products. Sort of like Factorio, but only the machines.

    - [Mindustry](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.anuke.mindustry&hl=en), an assembly-based game of efficiently placing machines and defending a base. Basically Factorio.

    - [That Level Again](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iamtagir.game.android&hl=en) (and [2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iamtagir.thatlevelagain2.android) and [3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iamtagir.thatlevelagain3) and [4](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iamtagir.tla4)), a series of puzzle games with out-of-the-box solutions.

    - Anything by [Arnold Rauers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Arnold+Rauers) (like [Card Thief](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinytouchtales.cardthief&hl=en) or [Card Crawl](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinytouchtales.cardcrawl&hl=en)), being strategy games with interesting mechanics.

    - Anything by [Barte Bonte](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Bart+Bonte&hl=en) (e.g. [blue](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.bartbonte.blue)), being puzzle games with interesting solutions.

    I really like Underhand. I also recommend Simon Tatham's Puzzles, collection of completely free puzzles.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    Simon Tatham's Puzzles are good; a bunch of randomly generated logic-puzzle type games. Another that you might enjoy is Antiyoy, a turn-based strategy war game.
    ```

- u/Nivirce:

  A bit of a meta question, but is there any particular reason we don't put a banner or try to give the subreddit a more unique aperance? I mean, at the end of the day it's just a minor thing, but since we're all stuck in quarantine, I figure we might as well.
  ```

  - u/PublicMoralityPolice:
    ```
    How many people actually enable subreddit themes? For me, it's a useless distraction, I prefer a consistent look across the entire site.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      I leave them on, but I'm pretty quick to turn it off for any given subreddit. It's nice when they're just a banner, flares, and maybe a unique color scheme. But a lot of subreddits rearrange navigation elements, break functionality, or even somehow manage to make the page lag. So those get turned off.

      I just set up a subreddit with heavily themed CSS and while it's not that hard, it is pretty annoying. Reddit's default CSS has a lot of elaborate selectors that do the same thing. And I still haven't really made sense of the extra CSS that RES adds.
      ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    As in most things, it's effort, and unless someone is motivated to do it it doesn't get done.

    If someone were to create a candidate I'm sure it could at least be *considered*.
    ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    Eh I personally won't notice; I run on old reddit carbon, but I doubt we have any coherent aesthetic where a banner would provide a net positive.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      If someone started drawing amazing ratfic crossover art then that'd be a case for a banner.
      ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      Since this sub is focused on works of fiction, I think it would make sense for the banner to display cover art from the most well known/popular examples of the genre. Something like they have at /r/books might be nice.
      ```

  - u/BoxSparrow:
    ```
    I'd personally agree that a banner and logo, at least, would be nice. I normally have reddit on whatever default settings it gives me, and I've come to associate a lack of banner/logo with unpopular, unmoderated, and/or very new subreddits. 

    It's like passing by a bunch of coffee shops with colourful decorations and interesting designs, then arriving at this one and seeing it completely unfurnished with exposed power cabes still hanging everywhere.
