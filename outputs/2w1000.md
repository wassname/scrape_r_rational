    In this case, he doesn't even need to do that - a simple password would suffice.

    Ideally, he'd think of a new one each morning, to use that day if time travel required it.  If he forgot, he could simply decide on one randomly before opening the note, commit to including it in the note, and only trust it if present.

      When Harry receives a message from his future self he looks at his watch. If this time is not coded in the message, it's fake.

        Flip a coin N times and think of a large integer.

          Just don't flip the coin too many times... after all, the universe threw a fit at factoring a six digit number.

          You won't even get to 15 coin flips before "timelines where weird stuff happens" outweigh "timelines where authentication succeeds", assuming the factoring problem is representative of how much optimization power you can exert. (Finding a 15-bit hash collision requires on the order of a 100 tries, similar to the number of primes less than 1000.)

      A password system is risky.  If you use a password in the future, someone who discovers it can use it against you in the past, even before you're aware of having given them the opportunity!

      More mundanely, someone can simply intercept and change your message, aside from the password.

  Can someone point me at where we had at least come as far as "To memory-charm a student, imperius a professor?"
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    Certain magical actions in Hogwarts, which are beyond a certain level of harm, trigger the Hogwarts wards to alert the Headmaster to the time and place of their use. Professors however are whitelisted in the wards, and will not trigger them, presumably because the headmaster would otherwise have alarms going off during regular classes. 

    As such, if we accept that a student was Memory Charmed - presumably a prohibited action - then the caster must have been a professor. 

    So, to memory charm a student without alarm, Imperius a professor.
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      Yes, I understood that part, what I was trying to ask is where in this or the other subreddit we had already said that general rule explicitly.

  Why did Volde refer to Harry as Tom Riddle? Is the real so

    Harry's mysterious dark side is (a portion of) Tom Riddle.

      Didn't the sorting hat deny something like that?
      ```

      - u/sciolizer:
        ```
        The sorting hat denied that there was a ghost residing in Harry's scar, which I interpret to mean that Harry's scar has no agency of its own.

        Still, it's probably more accurate for me to say that Volde believes Harry to be Tom Riddle, in some sense. Even more accurate to say that Volde wants Harry to believe this.
        ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        "I can tell you that there is definitely nothing like a ghost - mind, intelligence, memory, personality, or feelings - in your scar."

        More likely Harry's brain is Tom Riddle and there is nothing in the scar.
        ```

        Yes.  Quite explicitly.  But it could have been wrong.

          Not 'wrong' - lying. It said so itself (something like "We both know I could just be saying whatever it takes to fulfil my utility function quickest, and you have no way of verifying that so shut up and move on").
          ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  Why'd Voldie try to trick Tom via a route of thought that requires a breaking of suspension of disbelief if that's the only thing that keeps Tom allied with Voldie?

  What happened in front of that door seems like a plan that's much more complicated than is needed if it only needs to get Snape out of the way and Harry trying for the Stone.
  ```

  - u/MaxDougwell:
    ```
    I think he wanted Harry to know, so he could render him more predictable. If he kept up the facade but Harry had an epiphany at an inopportune moment, Voldie would be at a slight disadvantage as he had to pull out his gun. Now he's just a trigger-finger away from disabling Harry if Harry doesn't do exactly as he says.
    ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Why are you assuming that Quirrel is still going for the Stone? It doesn't make sense to me that if he wanted the Stone, he would use Harry. It's better to use other students as the unwitting minion. Of course they could fail and Harry would be more likely to succeed, but it doesn't feel right to me.

    I think Quirrel is going for a confrontation with Harry for something relating to the Horcruxes. Remember that all of Harry's information on the Horcruxes came from Quirrel and there could be an unknown benefit such as Quirrel is capable of moving his brain-state from his current body into Harry's or something like that.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    It needs to get Snape out of the way, Harry going for the Stone, and no involvement from aurors or other pesky people, nor any way that Harry can easily contact the aurors or other pesky people with Patronus, magic mirror, Time-Turning etc. That accounts a lot of the shenanigans and the complexity required for the plan.
    ```
