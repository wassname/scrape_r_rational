## Rational films?

### Post:

Can anyone recommend good films told by the principles of rational fiction?

### Comments:

  Decently rational:

  * [*Annihilation*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Annihilation2018), science fiction. Follows an expedition into an anomalous, slowly-expanding area which formed around a fallen extraterrestrial object. Rare case of the movie being better than the books.

  * [*10 Cloverfield Lane*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TenCloverfieldLane), psychological horror. After a car crash, the protagonist wakes up in a bunker. Its owner doesn't let her leave, claiming that the outside world was "contaminated" while she was unconscious.

  * [*Circle*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Circle), sci-fi/psychological thriller. Fifty people wake up in a room. Every two minutes, a device kills one of them; either whoever the majority of them votes for, or a random person. What follows?

  * [*Twisted*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TwistedTheUntoldStoryOfARoyalVizier). Well, it's technically *a play*, but it's still a live-action moving-pictures work, so is there really a difference? ^/s

  Somewhat rational:

  * [*Primer*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer), science fiction. A consistently-written & complex time-travel conflict.

  * [*The Cabin in the Woods*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCabinInTheWoods), horror. Cliché premise leads to a very rationality-esque deconstruction. *Worm* : Superhero fiction :: *The Cabin in the Woods* : Horror fiction.

  * [*I am Mother*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IAmMother), science fiction/thriller. After an extinction-level event, a lone robot raises a human girl from an embryo in an underground bunker. Notably competent portrayal of AI.

  * [*Miss Sloane*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MissSloane), political thriller. Follows a very competent and ruthless lobbyist as she attempts to pass a challenging bill.

  r/rational-adjacent:

  * [*Pontypool*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Pontypool), horror. A group of people operating a basement radio station in a small town start receiving reports about worrying incidents during one of their broadcasts. Features one of the best examples of a >!memetic threat!< I've seen outside of text-based fiction.

  * [*Resolution*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Resolution), horror. I'd suggest going in blind. >!A supernatural entity is trying to orchestrate a horror story in reality.!<

  * [*Oculus*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Oculus), horror. The beginning (first ~30 minutes?) features a decently munchkin attempt to defeat a powerful hostile supernatural entity, but the protagonists take leave of their senses shortly thereafter.

  * [*You're Next*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/YoureNext), a deconstruction of slasher movies with a competent protagonist.

    +1 for Circle. I've seen it like six times, it's brilliant psychological suspense.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      I watched Circle when looking for more films like Twelve Angry Men (1957), which is IMO a better film, so you might well like that as well if you haven't seen it.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        I've seen the play a couple of times, never the movie! Will check it out.
        ```

  - u/ForeverGM:
    ```
    *Twisted* was such a great take on Alladin, rationalist Jafar is the best character ever
    ```

- u/NZPIEFACE:
  ```
  Well, not really rational fiction, but if you want a film governed by logic, go watch Primer.
  ```

- u/VorpalAuroch:
  ```
  I recommend this a lot, so I'm probably biased. But Lucky Number Slevin. There is approximately one place where someone makes a stupid error for the sake of the plot, and it's believable. There is a *substantial* twist ending, but it's a Fair Play Whodunnit; the characters don't have all the information to see the twist coming but the viewers do. The character's motivations are not really proportionate, but they're consistent and believable.

  The Martian. Based on a rational book of the same name, there are a few medium adaption changes such as the ending which was made more cinematic and to me is somewhat meta in that that kind of ending is joked about in the book.
  ```

- u/DuplexFields:
  ```
  **The Edge** is a 1997 American survival film writen by David Mamet, directed by Lee Tamahori, and starring Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin.

  Hopkins plays an eccentric fashion designer billionaire on an Alaskan photo shoot. He's a skittish fellow, an intellectual who isn't used to the wilds of Alaska, but who is confident he can figure out how to survive if given the need.  And boy, is he ever!

  CHARLES: You know, I once read an interesting book which said that, uh, most people lost in the wilds, they, they die of shame…Yeah, see, they die of shame.  ‘What did I do wrong? How could I have gotten myself into this?’ And so they sit there and they… die. Because they didn’t do the one thing that would save their lives.

  BOB: And what is that, Charles?

  CHARLES: Thinking.

  Sneakers.

  Actual skilled people getting caught in spy stuff and paying attention to details and putting together information to succeed.

- u/LazarusRises:
  ```
  The protagonist of 10 Cloverfield Lane is extremely smart & rational.
  ```

  - u/DuplexFields:
    ```
    And the antagonist >!may not be the antagonist.!< But it takes a certain amount of figuring to reach that conclusion.
    ```

    - u/Flag_Red:
      ```
      It was a while ago that I watched it, but I don't remember that. Was it something easy to miss?

        >!He is, in fact, protecting Michelle and Emmett. He was wrong about what happened up there, but right that leaving would be fatal (unless you're a total baller with top-notch survival instincts and a conveniently placed bottle of high-proof alcohol).!<
        ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  *Primer*, *Circle*, *10 Cloverfield Lane* are usual recommendations.

  *Moneyball* and *Catch Me If You Can* are both intellect and hacking based, both true-ish stories.

  There's a whole genre of "people in a room" which is pretty popular for indie films for the obvious budget reasons, and most of them will *tend* to be more on the rational side if they have any problem solving at all.
  ```

  - u/JusticeBeak:
    ```
    A great "people in a room" film that I enjoyed and found rational was [The Man From Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_Earth).
    ```

      ```
      I just watched this a couple weeks ago and it was really interesting.
      ```

  ```
  [Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100519/) is a fairly faithful adaptation of the Tom Stoppard play. It has characters who know only that they have been summoned to see the prince and do their best to figure out who they are, the nature of their world, and what's happening around them as they are railroaded through the plot.

  Gary Oldman, Tim Roth, and Richard Dreyfuss give a really memorable performance that I think would appeal to the r/rational crowd.

  EDIT: Someone happens to have [uploaded it on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YHHHEg3ioc) if you care to give it a watch...
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I don't know if Theater of the Absurd can ever be remotely rational. In the case of Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are dead, it's intellectually interesting and one of my favorite works of literature, but I don't know if they can be seen as trying to break the cycle they're stuck in and well aware of.

      I always felt like R&G were more than passengers on the plot train- they were desperately searching for a way to exert some sort of agency and be more than spectators of their own lives and bit players in Hamlet's story. The movie has a few scenes without dialogue that weren't in the play, where the characters do various scientific experiments or just wonder or delight at various bits of their environment that don't make any sense rationally. I walked away with the impression that the characters were rational and did the best they could with the tools they had, but they were caught in a situation where science and rationality couldn't help them... so they did the best they could with philosophy. Here are some of the scenes that come to mind:

      [Logic/juggling and gravity experiment](https://youtu.be/3YHHHEg3ioc?t=1697)

      [Water  displacement/buoyancy](https://youtu.be/3YHHHEg3ioc?t=3580)

      [Paper airplanes](https://youtu.be/3YHHHEg3ioc?t=4604)
      ```

- u/stochastic_bit:
  ```
  [Limitless](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1219289/) \- Has pill that make the user smarter, but has positive presentation of being rational. [Some old discussion in LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/g3z62J7bCReHB7Zyo/rationalist-movies-spoilers-for-the-film-limitless).

  I think [Ex Machina](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752), [WarGames](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/) and [Her](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709), all have good aspects in portraying AI (none is perfect).

  Maybe [Contagion](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778) and [Apollo 13](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112384) can fit also, as the characters and decisions are mostly rationals (although they not very fictional).
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Contagion definitely fits for me. It's a fictional story but a very realistic depiction of its premise (a deadly pandemic, for those who don't know), which in itself is a common theme in disaster movies, though never explored this well.
    ```

- u/CronoDAS:
  ```
  Twelve Angry Men?
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    I was thinking of it. I loved that movie, not sure if I'd call it "rational" just because it's not necessarily the kind of movie that usually would *not* be anyway. It's basically an investigative court thriller, set in real time, so it's hard for it to be very fanciful. Still, beautiful investigation of human psychology, bias, and justice (though apparently, not very faithful to what the *legal* system says in theory: jurors aren't supposed to further investigate evidence!).
    ```

    - u/subduedreader:
      ```
      There's actually an [episode](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0653684/) of Murder She Wrote that may have been inspired by that play/movie. While no one on the jury, not even Jessica, leave to investigate on their own, they do wind up realizing that the real situation is more complicated than the police & prosecutor thought and that's all I can say about it without revealing the rest of the plot.
      ```

- u/Lacertidae:
  ```
  I recently saw [*Yesterday*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Yesterday2019) and it pretty much qualifies, not necessarily for the protagonist being a rationalist or anything, but definitely for the premise. All around a fun movie, if only because it made me imagine myself in similar situations repeatedly afterwards.
  ```

- u/dimwitticism:
  ```
  I haven't seen it in a while, but perhaps [Locke](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2692904/).
  The whole movie is set in a car with Tom Hardy, as he deals with various problems. It's hard to describe but I found it fascinating
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Surprised by the thus-far lack of mention of **Arrival**, which is so rational that it's based on a short story that was chronically recommended here even before the movie was announced.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    I'd argue the key concept behind the story is scientifically wonky, but if you accept that as your one free suspension-of-disbelief ticket, then the rest is indeed really good.
    ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    What short story was it based on?
    ```

- u/Hivemind_alpha:
  ```
  A bit of a left field suggestion, but *The Draughtsman's Contract* by Peter Greenaway is, on one level at least, a whodunnit where sufficient evidence is supplied to solve the case, but the film itself doesn't present a solution or indeed an investigator. You just have to follow along and make your peace with your own solution, without being told by a voice of god that you are right.
  ```

- u/CronoDAS:
  ```
  *No* (2012). Spanish language movie. A dictator is ousted thanks to the efforts of the unlikeliest of foes: a television advertising director. The best part of the movie is that *it really happened*.
  ```

- u/CronoDAS:
  ```
  The MASH episode "Adam's Ribs", in which the cast attempt to use what we now call social engineering to get some food from their favorite Chicago restaurant delivered to their camp in Korea.
  ```

- u/subduedreader:
  ```
  Any properly presented fair play mystery movie/miniseries should hit the marks, so while most Sherlock Holmes adaptations wouldn't fit, most Agatha Christie or Dorothy L. Sayers should work.
  ```

- u/CronoDAS:
  ```
  Some episodes of *The Twilight Zone* would count. I'd tell you which ones, but I don't want to spoil any endings!
  ```

- u/CronoDAS:
  ```
  *The Founder*. Tells the story of Ray Kroc and the McDonald's Corporation, and the problems he faced in trying to turn the McDonald brothers' unique single restaurant into a profitable large-scale franchising operation.
  ```

- u/dinoseen:
  ```
  Moon, by Zowie Bowie/Douglas Jones (yes that Bowie).
