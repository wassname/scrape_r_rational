## Experimenting with Time Travel

### Post:

**Story**

Very recently, there was a clever person who came up with a radically new theory relating to how gravity works. It seems like it fits the current data and observations on gravity, but it postulates that under certain conditions, not found in nature, anti-gravity is possible.

So that exceedingly smart person decided to test it. She gathered a team of fellow scientists. You are part of this team of scientists. Everyone worked together and a device was quickly built to test the darling theory.

At first, its a failure. Nothing happens. The team goes back over the principles and discovers a few errors. Fortunately they are easy to correct and the device is quickly adjusted. At first, its a failure...until someone notices something odd about the lights on the device. They flash milliseconds before anyone touch the button on the device. Further testing is done.

The darling theory is tragically wrong...but something new has been found in its ashes.

......

I've been working on coming up with a coherent and consistent model of time travel. One of the stumbling blocks for my fledgling story idea is the the history behind the discovery. I don't know how the scientists would test and discover the theory and laws behind time travel. So I'm going to play a game with /r/rational where you, the commenters, are the scientists doing the testing.

**Rules**

1) Any experiment can be proposed, but you must say what the scientists are trying to test and discover in the process of the experiment. Provide details. If there is too little details for me to understand how the experiment would work (or how the scientists *think* it would work), then I can't say how it interacts with the time travel.

2) Time travel ability is currently limited to sending a signal back in time. You press a button, and at some (currently unspecified) point in the past, the device will make a blue flash. More information than flashing lights and physical time travel comes later in my story and is not currently allowed.

3) If you are intending to do something depending on the results, tell me. We are dealing with time travel and therefore your future actions are already 'known' (for a given sense of the word). So don't try to outsmart me, you shouldn't be able to outsmart Reality. However, it's fine if you don't know how you would react to certain results as long as you are not trying to constrain your future behavior as part of the experiment.

4) Experiments where the scientists are trying to cause a paradox are allowed. Although if you can come up with a literary reason for why anyone would try to do so would be greatly appreciated since I only have the inventor fleshed out in my head and am planning on basing other team members on the commenters.

5) Characterizations and your motivations for trying each experiment is welcomed, but is not a requirement.

6) Usage of the time machine to do something like winning the lottery is fun and interesting to think of, but they are not what I'm looking for. You are a scientist, not someone out for money. Any abuses are accepted if and only if it somehow tells you something about the rules behind time travel.

7) Unless you explicitly say otherwise, I will be assuming I have permission to plagiarize anything that anyone says here.

**Description of the device**

It's a small dark grey box weighing about 20 pounds and about two feet in width, height, and depth. The bottom is flat and unmarked. The top side has some sensors and transistors exposed. Some soldered wires are trailing from the left side to the right side. The back side has an electrical socket to plug in the wire powering the device. The front side has a single button with a blue light next to it. The blue light was meant to be an indication that the device is currently in operation, but ended up as the indicator that someone in the future will press the button.

**Helpful Tips**

Whenever talking about time travel, people often get confused when they are talking about the sequence of events/actions. There are always two timelines to keep track of:

* The Chronological Timeline where something happening yesterday is considered to have happened before the events of today, even if you later go back in time to preform an action after you experienced the current event.

* The Personal Timeline where something happening yesterday is considered to have happened after the events of today, if you experience the current event first, and then went back in time to yesterday.

Another possible confusion is when people are mixing up which version of themselves is doing something. Just pretend that they are different people going by the names of: Past-Me-1, Past-Me-2, Current-Me, Future-Me-1, and Future-Me-2. The distinction only matters for as long as they are separate people and when one version become another version, just pretend that version of you has changed names, not 'identity'.

Thanks and good luck!

  So what would happen if I waited for the light to turn on, and then we all agreed that no-one would ever touch the button?

  Would the light even turn on in the first place if this was an experiment that I was planning to do?

    I will assume that you run this experiment multiple times. The following two cases will occur.

    1) If you and your fellow teammates promise beforehand to not touch the device after a light will flash, then light will not flash.

    2) If after a light flashes and no one has touched the button yet, then people decide to run the earlier experiment and promise to not touch the device. For the entire day, no one touches the device and when it's time to lock up and go home for the night, you set up a camera to film the device overnight. The following day, the team watches the recording. It turns out that a pile of books left next to the device fell over and hit the button. Over multiple reruns, it turns out that either someone will accidentally touch the button (they forgot, tripped, or got impatient and wanted to run their own experiment), or something else will occur to bump the button (falling book, bird flies into the lab, jostled and banged device next to the wall, or something will happen). If the light flashed, the ***button will be pressed***.

      Based on this result, your device obeys Novikov and allows engineering based on "future-pruning".  Once a device activation has been established, an arbitrary future event can be forced if enough care is taken to ensure that the device activation depends on it, and there is no more probable event which could cause it instead.  See "Timemaster", by Robert Forward for some examples of this.
      ```

      - u/xamueljones:
        ```
        Maybe...do you want to try an experiment to test this idea?

        Also who is Novikov? The mathematician who appears when Googling doesn't seem to have any obvious relationship to this.

          > Novikov

          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle

          If you like.  Most of those "device accidentally activates" results seem like more than 1-100 odds (particularly if you're keeping an eye out for them and taking countermeasures, Final Destination style).  Commit to rigging the device to activate based on the results of a random number generator, but not the specifics.  Wait for a flash.  Set the RNG trigger to activate the device only if it returns 50 (with a range of 1-100).  Wait.  Expect to get a 50.  Should work every time, even with repeated runs.

          Extend this to useful engineering.  Take some process that, on average, produces a bell curve of output amount or quality, like nanotube manufacture.  Commit to rigging the machine to the result of one production run, but not the details of the rigging.  After a flash, set the machine to activate only if the results are a few sigma right of center...possible, but not common.  Wait.  Now you've vastly increased the efficiency of a probabilistic manufacturing/chemistry reaction, because you can do this repeatedly (at least, for processes that can be completed within the time window of a pre-flash).  It may not save you time (ha), since you have to wait for a flash and that delay may follow the same original bell curve (does it?), but it should save you materials costs since you only "realize" the best possible runs.
          ```

            ```
            Wow! Yeah this is very similar to what I was thinking of.

            However, the bit about your RNG would mean that the device would rarely activate. For instance, if you have the RNG picking a new number every second, then the RNG will be expected to get 50 once for every hundred trials. Therefore, the device will statistically activate once for every hundred seconds. So yeah, you aren't going to necessarily guarantee a certain event happening if the light flashes since the light can just not flash at all, but it can be used to 'check' for only successful attempts.

            I know you understand this, but I'm mostly typing this up to better explain the downfalls for anyone else reading this.
            ```

              Yep.  Though you could always have trials happen much faster than once per second, when you control that end of the experiment as well.

              In a more visceral example (a wholly unethical experiment, but a practical application), say there's a hostage crisis.  You commit to activating the machine only if everyone is rescued, with no friendly casualties.  Then have the DF guys wait on standby, with orders to deploy either at the last possible moment, or immediately after a flash if one happens first.  As you wait, you're effectively getting lots of "free attempts", due to changes in initial conditions as seconds tick by and everyone takes (would have taken) slightly different actions as a result, and the flash tells you when the initial conditions will lead (will have led) to a perfect success.  Assuming one isn't so unlikely it wouldn't come up...say if hostages had *already* been killed, without your knowledge, making a total success impossible.
              You could even multiply your search space by drawing up dozens or hundreds of different mission plans, and putting them on a rotating schedule, such that the exact timing of the flash determines which plan is used (with the "judged best" plan used if time expires without a flash).

              Actually, more immediately, you could draw up dozens of experimental plans for the machine, commit to activating the device only if you get a "promising" result from whatever plan is used, put *them* on a rotation schedule and wait for a flash.  That means you'll spend most of your effort on productive experiments (and also that dangerous attempts to force paradox as other people tried would have "luckily" never come up in the rotation).

  This seems directly related to the earlier thread about Primer. Is it possible to construct new devices (or disable and reenable the function of the existing device) to constrain the timespan by which a signal is sent back?

  Firstly I would attempt to determine the distribution of time-distances that the signal is sent back by. If construction of new devices works, then my first step would be to build a great number of these devices and test that they functioned according to a similar phenomenon. Any differences from expectation would be noted (each device would be numbered). If new devices cannot be constructed, multiple trials would have to take place over time instead of both time and space. Devices would be enabled, observed for light pulses, then if there was a pulse (in 60s), the experimenter would disable the device without pressing the button, and if there wasn't the experimenter would then (after 60s) press the button and disable the device.

  RPing scientific experimentation is a very fun idea.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    This is a slightly complex question for me to answer since there are multiple things I have to answer. They are very nice ideas to test and I'm jealous that I never thought of them! Let me know if I miss something.

    First the team work on constructing multiple devices before daring to take apart the original device. The team successfully builds multiple devices, but it turns out that if any single device's button is pressed, then **all** devices' lights will light up (but not necessarily all at the same time). The team attempts to bring the (currently only) two devices very far apart spatially to see if distance might have an effect. It doesn't appear any effect, other than a very small tendency for a longer time span between light flash to button press, in the few miles the team tries.

    Waiting for a light to flash, disabling the device, and then re-enabling it, and pressing the button works to allow the light to flash before the device was disabled. But if the device will be disabled permanently, before the button is pressed, then the light won't flash. Since any device can cause other devices to flash, then any one device can be disabled while another device's button is pressed to send a signal in time to the currently disabled device when that device wasn't disabled.

    This is meant to work in the sense that the device can detect any signal sent back in time which is the same type of signal sent by any possible device.

    It appears as if the signal can be sent arbitrarily far enough back in time by any device. For example, the team disables the device for 24 hours after the light flashed and then re-enabled it to press the button. However, if the device is disabled for more than two days, then something will happen to restart the production of devices such as someone getting impatient to run a new experiment or a device is accidentally re-enabled. It takes you swearing everyone to wait for a week before something unusual happens. After three days, a stranger from a different department stops by and saw the device. As someone who loves to do some engineering, he decided to take a look and see if he could fix it anyway (you put up a notice telling everyone to NOT fix the device) and managed to do so and pressed the button. Similar events occur around the three to four day mark.

    You decide to try locking all disabled devices in a safe-deposit box and wait a full week. The bank returns the devices in five days after there was an earthquake breaking the bank's vaults. Multiple workers ended up in a hospital and two people died. You decide to re-enable the device and press the button and resolve to not try that again without a better understanding of how the device works.

      [](/twismug)An immediate use would be a security system where alarms are hooked to the button, and the signal alerts guards to step up patrols. There would be a mechanism to enforce a time delay (e.g. the button takes 20 minutes to unlock for manual use after a future signal is detected), during which time a breach would most likely be found. If the alarm is tripped, then the button isn't activated manually. If it isn't tripped, it is, but my current model says that would be exceedingly unlikely. Forcing activation A through two paths of least resistance, where 1 has greater resistance for a longer time than 2, possibly means that P(2|A) would be correspondingly greater than P(1|A), and we don't care about ~A.

      [](/twiright)The above security protocol rests on that assumption, which can of course be tested. (All other devices except those being used as experimental subjects are disabled) *An experiment could be run thus:* A Burglar flips a coin and enters the area if the flip was heads. If they are not apprehended, they cross a sensor that activates the button. A Guard watches the light. If it does not activate, they do nothing. If it does, the Guard moves to the area and waits for the Burglar until the set delay is reached. They go back to the light and activate the button manually, with either a Burglar or no Burglar. Either way, breach is prevented or there was no breach to begin with (with a very small probability that the protocol failed).

      [](/twisad)Unless my model is wrong. This experiment can be simulated on a computer as well, under the same principles and under a much greater variation of parameters. This could be built (a USB-pluggable version of the device, and a software simulation of the experiment) in case the  results of the physical experiment are confusing.

      [](/twismile)Another useful mechanism would be chaining signals. The signal could itself activate the button with a non-1 probability, although there would need to be more information than the one bit to tell how far in advance the signal is received.

      [](/twiponder)Some more ideas:

      * Spatial distance seems to have no detectable effect, but would inertial frame? A constant velocity difference, an varying velocity difference, and a gravitational gradient difference all have to be tested.

      * We have one device design, with fairly identical parameters, except our prototypes have a variation in the advance-time reception of a signal across the lot. This can wait until later, but the devices eventually need to be examined for physical differences, and designs need to be manufactured with intentional variations.

      * We need to see if the design can be separated into two different designs, one for sending and one for receiving.

      * This is probably again related to physical differences, but we need to determine if the signal is of a single consistency or if there's a spectrum of e.g. frequencies, time-distance, or other informative variations.

      * We need to find out if local patterned activations of the device (e.g. 4 random bits) remain coherent on reception. 

      *Experiment:* with button and light causally separated, record activations of the light and activations of the button (being pressed in a random stream of discrete bits). Examine the recordings for correlations. Do a similar experiment with activations of random duration.

        Your alarm security idea seems interesting so the team runs an experiment where one person (who doesn't know anything about the time machine) tries to break into the lab at a random time over the next two weeks.

        1) The thief trips the alarm (in the yet unrealized future) and you get alerted. You wait for the thief, catch him (with him collecting the payment as part of his agreement to try), and manually pressing the button, or the alarm yourself, to ensure self-consistency.

        2) The thief doesn't set-off the alarm (in the yet unrealized future) and you don't get alerted. Thief escapes scot-free and collects bonus for succeeding.

        Over multiple experiments, you decide to compare frequency of success versus failure and compare it to how well the alarm system does without the advantage of the time machine. It turns out that the alarm is equally statistically likely to go off for both cases, albeit with the guard being more likely to catch the thief if the alarm+device goes off. This means that if the thief is capable of slipping past security without setting off the alarms, then the device won't go off and the timeline proceeds without the device going off.

        In other words, the device is only checking ahead if the button will be pressed, not multiple possible timelines where if the thief is caught in any one of them to force the device into flashing.

        It's certainly helpful if the thief is likely to trip the alarm, but it won't make the alarm any more effective in catching the thief in the first place.

        For your randomized experiment, I already talked about something similar in response to fljared's comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/32m6di/experimenting_with_time_travel/cqcjilp) and I know you've already read it with your comment "A log-normal distribution?" so I don't understand what you are trying to do/test differently.

          It doesn't matter how likely the Burglar is to trip the alarm, that's entirely dependent on the alarm design. I wasn't proposing actual break-ins, the roles of the Burglar and Guard are metaphorical. It's much quicker to run the experiment with three separate rooms.

      A few miles won't cut it. Put two devices on opposite sides of the planet. That's about 40 light-milliseconds away. As long as you have nobody observing the device, the flashes should be happening consistently enough to make light delay effects clear. There are three results that might be expected:

      1) The far box lights up just under 40 milliseconds after the button was pushed.

      2) The far box lights up just over 40 milliseconds before the button was pushed.

      3) The far box lights up a few milliseconds before the button was pushed under some reference frame.

      4) Something unexpected happens.

      If 3 happens, and it's possible that the reference frame is the boxes, it would be best to check that. There doesn't seem to be a cheap way to do it though. Even sending one of the boxes into a low Earth orbit would only add a half a nanosecond delay. Also, trying to abuse faster-than-light information transfer to act as a time machine is pretty pointless when it was a time machine to begin with.
      ```

  ```
  Find out how far back the signals are sent. Do this by hooking up a button presser to a computer with a random number generator. Record the flashes of lights, and compare it to the computer's records of when the button was pressed.
  ```

  ```
  Since the other commentors are apparently not being careful to not cause a paradox, fuck it, I'll have fun.

  I assume that testing revealed that the data is consistent with the 2-0 hour delay being independent of whether there are other flash-press event pairs in the temporal vicinity. If not, tell me (and describe what happens differently in such situations?). If so, try to send information back further than 2 hours with the following protocol:

      Lock a Class-D in the room with these instructions.
      // Except for these commented out parts.
      // Do not enforce the instructions; we want the natural safety net of the universe not being destroyed if nobody is explicitly pruning the universe in that direction - the class D inexplicably doing something else is a convenient breaking point.
      Whenever the light flashes, he is to press the button as many times as it flashed.
      When the clock in the room says he has been there x hours, he is to press the button one additional time.
      // Substitute x for 2, 4, 6, ... on successive tests.
      Ten minutes later, he is to leave the room.
  The proceedings are to be recorded, but only to be examined 3 hours after the end. We hope that the subject acts as a relay to send the signal sent after x hours ever further back in time until the causationally last flash occurs chronologically before he entered the room. (Insert a few control runs where he is to leave after x hours without an additional press.) Millisecond-delays should just be immediately retransmitted according to the instructions. If miscounting of successive flashes causes the subject to miss a press an annoying number of times, a flash counter is to be placed in the room to help him. The researchers are to be sane and to abort the line of experiments and report back to me if the log of recordings starts to look like an SCP entry.
  ```

  ```
  Precommit to attempting to cause a paradox as best I can unless a coin comes up heads ten times in a row. If that happens, be very scared that the universe will "decide" to kill me to prevent me from experimenting with time travel.
