  I've got another one for you: infinite free spacelift capacity.

  They have two gates, the Antarctic Gate and the Egypt Gate.

  Put one gate in the SGC, carry the other gate into orbit.

  Send satellites through the SGC gate to the Alpha site. Plug in the DHD to the gate in orbit, making it the primary gate. Send the Satellites  through the gate directly into orbit.

  Create modular space-station components which just barely fit through the gate. Send those up too.

  Get some power and construction stuff going in orbit. Create orbital ore-processing yards and factories for use in creation of more orbital infrastructure. Haul in some asteroids with stolen or home brewed ships depending on location in the timeline. 

  Put a naquadah refinery up there after the delivery of the ManThereIsALotOfPhlebotinumHere rock. 

  Oh, also, go public with the Stargate at some point here, so you can actually put the whole output of an industrialized world of 7 billion people behind, y'know, preventing the extermination of all life on Earth, rather than trying to make due with what can be fit into the black budget of the US Air Force. 

  Spacegate can also be used as a security precaution. If you think baddies are going to dial in, plug in the DHD and let them suck vaccuum.

    What's the point? The useful spaceships all seem to be able to get into orbit for free. So why not just build them on Earth? I guess the rare ores in asteroids could be a reason but perhaps the raw material mining wasn't the bottle neck in ship production.
    ```

      Even if you assume the delta v is negligible, it is still just plain easier to do large scale engineering in zero-g. There must be significant power, machine, and labour costs to move around heavy chassis or armor components in gravity, and that would be significantly reduced in space.

      Also there is, well, more *space*. You don't need to worry about buying more land to upgrade your throughput, just build another spacedock. Get as much infrastructure in space as possible  and you can keep transport costs down as well - though that is also effectively eliminated once Asgard Beaming is standard on ships.

      This is really for the early game, before you have enough ships to have effectively infinite spacelift capacity. If you've only got 1 interstellar ship, and half of its time is spent saving SG-1 from the Goa'uld of the Week, you need some other way to do general background construction.

      There's also the fact that although we don't see the power ever run down except in plot important moments, there is at least some kind of cost to keeping a starship up. Even if we assume it runs on completely free power, people aren't considering that eternal mother of war- logisitics. 

      Salaries, maintenance, repairing bullet holes, bullets, nukes, fuel for anything that needs fuel, refitting with ever-new technological upgrades, and opportunity cost all apply to using a ship instead of a Stargate for placing satellites. 

      And of course, the more you put in orbit, the more jobs and economic growth in orbit, the more businesses want in on that. You can start constructing O'Neill Cylinders (no relation) at L1-5, get a moonbase going, do large scale asteroid mining, etc.

        But all that infrastructure and logistics in a vacuum! You need to build a massive structure in space with gate sized pieces, hardly a simple undertaking. Moving around heavy stuff on Earth is a problem we have solved pretty well. Doing the same in space we would have to start from scratch. If there isn't a good reason to do it I think building a ship on Earth would be much cheaper. Also it'll use up a lot of stargate time, time which you could spend establishing bases elsewhere.

        I guess it would be convenient for lifting satellites, but why do you need so many satellites in the first place? And all the cool stuff to build in space seems like it would take a much lower priority than building ships or building bases on other worlds. The practical reasons for colonizing the solar system sort of disappear when you have an entire galaxy of habitable planets at your disposal.

    Good ones. 

    Also, turns out that naquadah IS scarce. They had an episode in season 7 about prospecting for it and it turned out that the mine was in the sacred ground of a too-many-to-shoot group of Unas. They were all on about "ooh, this mine site is 10 ppm naquadah!" and I'm sitting here going: "don't you have this giant solid naquadah asteroid just a few fractions of an AU away from Earth?"

    EDIT: oh, just realized -- the DHD got blown up when they borrowed it from the Russians.

      >>oh, just realized -- the DHD got blown up when they borrowed it from the Russians.

      Details. *Prometheus* is a season 7 episode, so they should have a homegrown interstellar warship at this point, go steal a DHD from an abandoned world near Earth. Grab some extra Stargates while you're at it - you never know when you'll need an extra one or two.

      Hell, do like the Go'auld did in Season 1, and keep one on your ship to override the one in-system if needed for quick transport or resupply. That was actually a clever trick.

    Yeah, I did always wonder about that -- how does the team know when it's safe to go?  Presumably SGC broadcast a signal back saying "okay, iris is open", but that's never actually mentioned.

  ```
  Once you have Replicators running around, you should also move your heavily armed gate room with remote cameras to inside a salt mine. You can't build much if all you have is NaCl.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Removing the screen in the gate room is a good idea, but solely relying on cameras is not so good - electronics suck and can always fail or be made to fail. How about some kind of optical system with mirrors?

  re: the last one, disposing of nuclear waste

  The Time Monks in *Night Watch* by Terry Pratchett used time-travel to dispose of human waste in a volcano some billion years ago rather than pay Harry King to carry it away in a bucket.
