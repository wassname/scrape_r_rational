## [Worm FF] Agent of Cauldron

### Post:

https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/agent-of-cauldron-worm.345669/

A Worm AU, where there was another trigger with Path To Victory shard before canon events. Worth recommending, in the presence of Weaver Nine link posted recently. This fic rationalizes the Cauldron's approach to end of the world event and the writing seems really decent as well (overall I find this one in my top 3 list of the worm au, following weaver nine and cenotaph). 

If you think this kind of submission does not belong in this subreddit, please respond in the comments.

  This is really excellently written.

  The protagonist's sheer level of incompetence at using her power is physically painful while reading, though. Her segments are like reading Worm with Panacea as the protagonist. This is clearly *deliberate*, given the heavy use of other perspectives and the fact that the other characters mention it; but it is very annoying.

  It's interesting; this is clearly *rational* fiction, but it's *almost* rational*ist* fiction, as well (going by the sidebar definitions.) The only difference is that the **main character** isn't the rationalist, the - Antagonist? Mentor character? - is.

  It's kind of reminiscent of HPMOR!Quirrel, really, but without that sense of commanderie with the rationalist hero.

  I love this fic for the way it characterizes Alexandria.  The fic does not shy away from showing her more sociopathic side yet it still manages to make her relatable and human.

  Bonus points for featuring Taylor as a main character.  I'm frankly sick of her.

    Is there a "not" that's supposed to be there? I've never read the story but based on the "I'm sick of her" comment, I assumed you meant to say she was not a main character.
