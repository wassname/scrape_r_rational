## The Steerswoman series [HSF]

### Post:

Quote from [Jo Walton's excellent review](http://www.tor.com/blogs/2008/10/not-only-science-fiction-but-more-science-fictional-than-anything-else-rosemary-kirsteins-steerswoman-books):

> The world of the Steerswomen looks at first glance like fantasy. It’s low tech, and there are wizards. The Steerswomen are an organization of people, mostly women, who go around charting the world and inquiring into the nature of things. At the beginning of the first book the heroine, Rowan, is in a tavern trying to find out about some mysterious jewels. Fantasy, fantasy, fantasy. But it’s all a cunning illusion.

The one bad part about the series is that the fifth book isn't finished yet, after nearly a decade.

### Comments:

- u/None:
  ```
  [The first book](http://www.amazon.com/Steerswoman-Rosemary-Kirstein-ebook/dp/B00HH1U8Z2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391478374&sr=8-1&keywords=steerswoman) is available from Amazon. The subsequent books are not in print.

  It's nice to have these recommendations actionable.
