Political brinksmanship comes to the Dominion of Man.

Pyrebound is a high fantasy serial that's been going since February.  The world vaguely resembles the ancient Near East (theocratic riverside city-states), and is quite complex.  Our hero is a sort of quasi-Semitic Man Who Knew Too Much, thrown into a horrible situation and trying to keep his head above water.  The story starts [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thanks for reading, all!

  What a great chapter. Ram tests the limits of his power and gets what he wants. Even if he cooperates from here on out, or if he gets overruled from time to time, he has set a precedent.

  Ram is clearly brave, fairly cunning, and a solid tactician. He has what it takes to rule the realm, and I think we could see him become a young Napoleon, Alexander, or a corpse.

    The last, at least, is somewhat unlikely, since the powers that be really need him to be completely incinerated.  Glad you liked it.

  Ram's outrage at the treatment of the boys being brought up in the temple was beautiful.  The guys he's dealing with seem so sympathetic that it's easy to forget what utter creeps they've been.
