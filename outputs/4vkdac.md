  I'm curious what Unsong's take on the Holocaust is. Yes, it happened before the sky cracked, but it had a huge effect on Jewish culture in real life, whereas it's not even been mentioned thus far in Unsong, as far as I recall. Did the events of the sky cracking simply overshadow it to the point of irrelevance? I somehow doubt it.

  Is it a coincidence that our rocketry programs, which destroyed the beautiful order of things everyone had settled on, relied on the employment of Wernher von Braun, an engineer who worked for the modern empire that made the most credible attempt of wiping out God's chosen people within that beautiful order?

    The Holocaust has been mentioned. The Rebbe who created the Liberty Golem was a Holocaust escapee, and he mentioned that "As New York saved the Jews, it is time for the Jews to save New York."

    Other than that, no.

      Ah, yes, of course; I think that's what originally brought it to my mind, and then I forgot.


      I would still think this is a matter of enough significance to get explicitly, personally discussed at length by Aaron in the narration.

    You know *exactly* what you are reading.

    Hitler and the jews they killed have been mentioned in the Broadcast.

  Maybe my favorite chapter so far! Learning about the Comet King and the history of this world has been my absolute favorite part of this story, so this was a solid hit of satisfaction

    Lol I'm the exact opposite. I'm hungry for Aaron to actually do something. The disappearing in the middle of interrogation and other "action Aaron" parts of the story were my favorite and if I could sacrifice other parts of the story to get those developed, I would.

      Yeah, it would be great if the normal human we can relate to were to do interesting things instead of demi-gods just generally being there, siring bastards or holding meetings and fighting wars against a mostly undescribed demon horde (all descriptions of fights agains demons are way too vague).
      ```

      - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
        ```
        I find it a lot harder to relate to Aaron, with all of his all-too-obvious blunders.

  Wait a second. Ronald Reagan is a weaponized meme being piloted by Gadiriel. 

  This story is nuts in the best way.

  > “Like you did, Jalaketu ben Raziel?”

  So this makes Jala's father, Comet West, Raziel.

  Raziel was previously mentioned in [Chapter 20](http://unsongbook.com/chapter-20-when-the-stars-threw-down-their-spears/):

  > Raziel was missing, as always, out doing his thing, whatever Raziel’s thing was.

  > ...

  > “Sometimes there comes upon us the desire to seek out and explore new parts of God’s creation, that we may appreciate ever-greater portions of His glory. ... Thus Raziel, who has absented himself from this assembly to traverse the gulfs beyond the world.”

  > ...

  > “Raziel?”

  > “Off somewhere,” said Michael.

  Jala's other patronymic, "ben Kokab", appears to mean "son of a star" (or *the* star; I don't know how the grammar works there).

  In the comments of this chapter, Scott said:

  > I really wanted her to actually call him “Jalaketu bar Kochba”, but I remembered at the last moment that angels can’t speak Aramaic.

  This is the aramaic translation of "ben Kokab", and it refers to [Simon bar Kokhba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_bar_Kokhba). He led a revolt against the Romans and established an independent Jewish state that was conquered within 3 years.

  Given what we know of Jala's eventual (presumed) demise and the fall of his empire, it seems kabbalistically appropriate.

  He was also a Messiah candidate, but that wasn't bourne out for obvious reasons.

  It seems likely that Raziel was aware of the kabbalistic connotations of siring Jalaketu. So what was his plan? I can't remember if he's still around. Apparently he was giving Jala dreams throughout his childhood, so at the very least he didn't die in coitus.
