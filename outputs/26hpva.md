  Interesting. I'm really enjoying this look at Superman's abilities and how Lex could counter them, since they really don't make much sense. I'm guessing that Superman's abilities work the way he believes them to work and that's why he can't see through lead even though he's probably not actually using X-rays. It would also explain being able to hear things from very far away. It'd be funny if Superman accidentally destroyed his world as a baby because he had a temper tantrum and no reason to think that it was outside his capabilities.

  Clark Kent is a Lutheran, eh?

  Maybe by the end of this, he'll be a *Luthor*an.

  The case of Shoe vs New York discusses unreasonable infringement of the right to liberty under the Fourteenth amendment in reference to probable cause resulting from Superman's "x-ray" vision.  The Fourth Amendment protections against "Unreasonable Search and Seizure" would be the more appropriate amendment to sue under in such a case, in my opinion.

    With the caveat that I'm not a lawyer or historian:

    Due to the fact that we're set in 1934, the 4th Amendment hasn't actually been incorporated and doesn't apply to states. In our timeline it was ruled in 1949 (*Wolf v Colorado*) that the 4th Amendment partially applied to the states through the "liberty" clause of the 14th Amendment. Full incorporation of the 4th followed in 1961 with *Mapp v Ohio*.

    [Minor Chapter 6 spoilers](#s " In this world, essentially the same ruling is made with Shoe v New York.")

    I may change the passage to indicate that it's both the 4th and 14th in play, but it's hard to write about how history diverges without resorting to a more omniscient point of view, and I'm a little bit leery of writing more about conlaw when I'm just a conlaw enthusiast rather than someone with even a scrap of legal education. I also have no idea what the level of average legal knowledge of readers is, nor of how much anyone wants to read about an alternate history of the law in light of the arrival of Superman.

      >alternate history of the law in light of the arrival of Superman.

      I would be interested in this, but it's a very different story from the one you're telling here.

        Does it at least work as something that's going on in the background? I mean, can someone read that paragraph and think to themselves "yeah, there would be some legal implications of Superman's abilities"? Or should it just be junked?
        ```

        - u/trifith:
          ```
          I think it works well in the background. I just (on my second read through) noticed the amendment number and it didn't ring true to my understanding of conlaw. I learned that the way I think the law works doesn't match up with how it worked in the past. I'm going to guess that your spoiler above will provide that education to any future readers, and it doesn't need to be changed, since the new chapter is due on Sunday. 

          Not that I would object to an early release. :)
