  I'm one of the two authors in this quest. I hadn't really considered whether it was rational, so it didn't occur to me to post it here. I see how it might fit the bill, though. Here's a quick intro:

  National Spirit is a quest in which the players control an constructed intelligence made of magic a low-fantasy early middle ages / late antiquity setting. Magic operates on infrastructure rather than on individual skill, and during the height of the empire's power, a wizard was able to foresee its downfall. He began work on a magical spirit, the only one of its kind, that would protect and grow the empire. His successor, a more paranoid and cautious man, completed work on the spirit, laying in several restrictions to control its actions better.

  Hilariously, the players immediately started plotting how able they are to smite their allies and end the succession crisis that way, or to grant powers to people and smite them later to get it back. I had to reply to a question with this:

  > Ioannas was a paranoid guy and there are restrictions on what the National Spirit can do, especially regarding smiting legitimate rulers and loyal citizens. For the most part, you are constitutionally unable to break the law.

  It'll be interesting to see how things go. This quest updates every Sunday. /u/EagleJarl gave me some advice on getting set up. Thanks!
