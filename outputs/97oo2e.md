## [Challenge Companion] Xenofiction

### Post:

**tl;dr: this is the companion thread to the [weekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/97ofsb/biweekly_challenge_xenofiction/), post ideas, recommendations, or general chit-chat here.**

A *strict* version of this prompt would be that the work should focus on alien aliens, and tell a story through their uniquely non-human viewpoint. Fiction like this is actually pretty rare; Starfish Aliens are somewhat common, especially outside of media where they're expensive to show, but generally speaking, they're depicted as black boxes, doing things that are incomprehensible for incomprehensible reasons. Proper xenofiction explores them in depth, from their perspective.

Recommendations:

* Vernor Vinge's "A Deepness in the Sky" gives one example (about half the viewpoints in the book), though they're >!filtered through humans, so don't count as much!<. "The Children of the Sky", which takes place in the same universe, is a better example

* "White Fang" by Jack London, which takes a wolf's viewpoint

* "Nor Crystal Tears" by Alan Dean Foster

* "Deep Rise" by Nighzmarquls

* "Embassytown" by China Mieville

  I'd love to see something psychological in a scenario where like, it's Han and Chewy, a human and the alien have known each other for a long time and they depend on each other in their work. The good thing about this sort of thing is you still get to tell the story through a human lens, while still making it all about knowing the mind of the alien.

  Don't actually do Han and Chewy though, I don't think wookies are very interesting aliens, it'd just limit you.

  I imagine these sorts of relationship would be very difficult IRL. Lots of moments where the human is just so frustrated with the alien and they want to walk away from the job and never speak to them again. That said, that doesn't always happen with relationships between humans and animals, so I'm not sure where this intuition is coming from.

    I dunno, have you seen the *Star Wars Holiday Special*? It's the most utterly alien thing I've ever witnessed.

    Why would the human have to get frustrated?  Seems like there could be plenty of things the alien could be upset over.

      Oh I'm sure the alien would be frustrated as well.
