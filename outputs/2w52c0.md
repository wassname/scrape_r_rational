  Well... Now I need to go back and re-read every Parselmouth conversation Quirrell and Harry ever had.

  So, let me see if I have the sequence of events correct:

  1.    Dumbledore hides the Stone in Hogwarts
  1.     Quirrel finds out that the Stone is there and discovers that it's behind some protection that he will need Harry's help to bypass
  1.     Quirrel approaches Dumbledore about a teaching position and is hired. Dumbledore doesn't see through his disguise.
  1.     Quirrel spends an entire year training the students and making them stronger. At no time during this year does he make a try for the stone. He spends particular time building an emotional connection with Harry -- a very strong one. So strong, in fact, that...
  1.     ...Harry is willing to believe Quirrel (with no evidence) about Bellatrix being not-evil, and then help Quirrel commit a major criminal act by breaking her out of Azkaban. Presumably this is so that Quirrel can use her in the canon ritual as a fallback if he can't get the Stone. There are a lot of failure modes here -- Harry could be caught by Aurors, or eaten by Dementors, or just see/hear something that makes him not trust Quirrel anymore. If any of these happen, Quirrel's primary plan (the Stone) is ruined.
  1.     During the breakout, Quirrel uses a cannot-tell-a-lie language to say to Harry "the plan was to have you rule the country." Maybe there's an unspoken "with me as the power behind the throne", but the statement itself still has to be true.
  1.     Quirrel frames Hermione for Draco's almost-murder
  1.     Quirrel kills off Hermione. Possibly this was so that he could later say to Harry "if we get the Stone, I'll resurrect Hermione" but that seems pretty foolish -- killing her has a heavy reputational cost with Harry, and Quirrel could have instead said "I'll resurrect Lily and James, or anyone else you say."
  1.     Two days before graduation, Dumbledore detects that there might be a problem soon, so he sends Snape to guard the door. He does not come himself, or tell the Aurors, or send any backup with Snape.
  1.     Quirrel knows, somehow, that Snape will be there guarding the door and that he will be alone. For some reason, he can't make his attack at any other time. He also can't just say to Harry "hey, help me get this thing that will let us resurrect Hermione, save the life of your dear mentor (me), and hopefully make everyone in the world immortal as per your fondest dream."
  1.     Quirrel decides that he can't beat Snape on his own, implying that Quirrel really is deathly sick, although clearly exaggerating somewhat. (Note that we have reasonably good evidence that Quirrel really is sick because Madame Pomfrey has been treating him all this time and has not noticed anything odd.)
  1.     Quirrel Imperio's Sprout to take out Snape, but decides that she probably won't be able to do it unless Snape is already distracted, even with Quirrel there and able to backshoot Snape because Snape will think that Quirrel is out of it. Quirrel therefore arranges for the Magical Girl Squad and Draco to show up.
  1.     Quirrel fakes a Time-Turned message to Harry, but does it with wizard parchment/quill instead of realizing that Harry would have more likely used paper/pen(cil). This is a pretty significant failure for a super-mastermind who never misses a detail.
  1.     Quirrel has been playing at being so sick that he needs to be carried places. Despite that, his explanation for why he's here is "I saw Snape looking suspicious so I followed him instead of telling anyone else." That's pretty thin, and he has nothing better to offer Harry after all the shooting has died down.

  The hundreds of hostages deadman switch makes perfect sense as a fallback plan.

  Have I got this sequence right? Because it seems way complicated, and like it requires far more than three things to go right. I suppose that can be answered as "well, Quirrel is just that good at playing Xanatos Speed Chess", but it still seems nuts.

    Yup, it seems absolutely nuts. I am guessing/hoping that there are more details that will make this series of events make sense, but ... I don't know what my alternate hypothesis is which would explain all of Quirrell's actions. Here are two of my best guesses:

    * If, as in canon, Voldemort *actually did want to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts* then perhaps teaching there for the full year satisfies that value and is incidental to his other plans.
    * If Voldemort *actually does want Harry on the throne* then perhaps this is all a setup to staging a miraculous defeat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named by the Boy-Who-Lived and the Philosopher's Stone is incidental to that plan - it only gives a setup for the narrative that Voldemort is trying to craft.

    ... but I'm not sure that squares with the psychology of Quirrell as we've been shown it, and I still think that his plan is a bit overcomplicated for all that.

  ```
  Problem: Harry would have gladly gotten the stone without being blackmailed if Quirrell had stayed incognito, without so carefully asking questions, for the purpose of saving Quirrell. Edit: Additionally, if the procedure for getting the stone is identical to canon, any student could have been manipulated into doing it (and hpmor!Harry, in particular, could not have done it).

  What are the implications concerning Quirell's interests and plot, and the implications concerning what one must do to get the stone, in light of this?

  Well crap. Harry is in a really bad situation. Planning helps.

  ```
  The parselmouth thing reminds me of the Liar Liar thread that was posted here a few weeks ago. Surely its just "to the best of my knowledge" truthfulness, otherwise every equation can be proven/disproven and hence become a small step towards omnipotency.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Aaaaand the power of the Philosopher's Stone turns out to be more-or-less ripped straight from *Fullmetal Alchemist*.

  - u/NotUnusualYet:
    ```
    Human transmutation! ...I mean, transfiguration.
    ```

  - u/Arandur:
    ```
    I wouldn't agree with that.
    ```

- u/fljared:
  ```
  I'll spitball a theory here:

  Parselmouth conversations are not entirely truthful. We have all of one possible, known liar to explain it, and one experimental result to prove it, and it the result could be explained in a number of ways.
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    I think [this comment here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2w526t/chapter_105/conojq6) proposes an explanation pretty cleanly:

    >In an ordinary language, each participant in the conversation has his own mental mapping between sounds-spoken-or-heard and concepts-transmitted-or-received. Anyone who wishes to understand or speak the language must learn that mapping. If Alice and Bob have learned somewhat different sound-concept mappings, then the concepts transmitted by Alice will not match up completely with the concepts received by Bob.

    >Parseltongue is not an ordinary language. You either magically speak Parseltongue or you do not; you cannot learn or choose the mappings between sounds and concepts in Parseltongue. You cannot redefine a word in Parseltongue, so it is impossible to mean one thing by an utterance in Parseltongue and be understood as meaning something different.
    ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    He also said that Parseltongue's truth-forcing effect can't be beaten by Occlumency. Could it be beaten by Obliviation? If not, it would seem it functions as an objective truth test, in which case you could theoretically use Parseltongue's "forced truth" to determine whichever truths you wished.

    E.g. "The real function of the Philosopher's Stone is to..."
    ```
