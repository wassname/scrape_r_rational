  What will happen to all the people like that who didn't leave a diary for their dream girlfriend to read and then fall in love with them through?

    Hopefully they left a lot of excellent Reddit comments.

      I'm sure they could be cyberstalked, but that would be creepy.

  Charming, lighthearted "future utopia" wish-fulfillment. I enjoyed it. I'm always a fan of Alicorn's work.

    Alicorn is weird, for me. This one was pretty good, and I really liked Luminosity and Radiance, but I hated her Elcenia books. Even the best one just felt so fucking pointless.
    ```

      I liked some parts of Elcenia, where there was a plot larger than the characters, but even that wasn't as good as Alicorn's other work (e.g. the political subplot in *Blood* has weird emphases, and the other shoe never drops in Leekath's addiction.)  And yes, *Silver* did seem sort of pointless.

      But there're some good parts even there.

      As an alternative viewpoint, I really enjoyed all of the Elcenia books (as well as Luminosity and all of Alicorn's other work), including *Silver*, *Siaddaki* etc. Reading about normal, not world-shattering or "supergenius" characters, but in a fascinating, really well-developed fantasy world (or more exactly a collision of two fantasy worlds (ignoring Isatei)) was very interesting.

      I loved Ehail, as a character — how she tried to cure Shrenhood over tens (hundreds? — it's been a while since I read the books) of years and then Kaylo fixed it in a couple of months, just to make his girlfriend happy (rather than because it was a huge humanitarian problem...) or how she coped with one of her adopted children being taken away, because the birth parents who had shunned their child suddenly want them back when they were cured.

      I also liked the exploration, in the background, of fantasy societal issues such as the (horrifying) problem of Shrenhood and the stigmatisation of Shrens by dragons, the power-imbalance between Elcenia and Barashim and how their alternative attitudes towards the treatment of children, clashed. It's nice how the problems in the books are not just intended as metaphors for (or are a crude transplantation of) some real world problems, but organically develop within the fantasy world.

      Also, the universe is realistic — for instance, how the greatest recent jumps in progress were due to the interaction between two, until recently separate worlds and the sharing of knowledge/magic between them. (e.g. Kaylo is a genius, but he would have probably achieved slightly less if he didn't have access to Kamai).

      Iirc Elcenia was originally a series of role plays, similar to Alicorn and Kappas later Effulgence series, which is why it feels less plotty and more focused on relationships, etc.
      ```

  Took me a while to work out how Ginnifer was relevant.

  I'm really, really glad Alicorn is writing again.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    I'm still not sure. Is Ginnifer the ex? Is the idea that knowing her location at all times ensures she and Cory never cross paths?
    ```

    - u/HeckDang:
      ```
      That's how I ended up interpreting it. Maybe I'm wrong though.
      ```

        ```
        The story sections are matched almost 1:1 with the requests in the will, and her section was immediately after the cure for depression part.

    I'm actually happy to explain that, it just didn't fit within "Will".  There's a superintelligent AI singleton which can do most things but not break FTL or do Prime Intellect style magic or nanotech absolutely everything into behaving itself trivially, so everybody is still physically instantiated and the Singleton is budgeting its negentropy because there's a limit to how much it can harvest more and bring it in and that trades off against how well it will do at supplying human colonies within reasonable travel distance &c.  So it makes things very nice, but if you want something unusual you have to pay for a miracle.  Because Markets.

    Introduction of whatever immortality treatment?  Bringing back to life after what we'd call brain death (with less than a year intervening)?
    ```

- u/Evan_Th:
  ```
  Nice, bright, fun story.  I would love to read other things set in this world.

  And also... from that opener, I want *Templars of the Antares Desert.*  All sixteen seasons.
  ```

  I'm having some trouble with this one.  I mean, I definitely enjoyed the read, but...

  There needs to be a word, or at least a shorter way, to express the concept, "This is cute and heartwarming, but only because we stopped paying attention before it all went horribly, horribly wrong."
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    You could rewrite it as a horror story keeping the same events but changing the tone: 

    *You died and wanted to stay dead? Bad news, a stalker with a crush from the future read your diary, did some weirdly overdramatic things to impress you and modified your brain and body in ways you can't hope to understand. And now they want you to love them:*

    Like the ending of San Junipero?
    ```

    - u/SkeevePlowse:
      ```
      You mean [this San Junipero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Junipero)?

      I haven't seen it, but I don't think so.  At least in that one, the two individuals involved had spoken with one another before.
      ```

      - u/alexshatberg:
        ```
        Yup, that one. San Junipero is widely known as the only episode of Black Mirror with an ostensibly happy ending, but personally it always gave me the creeps. The implication is that only the people who are in love remain happy within the simulation.
        ```
