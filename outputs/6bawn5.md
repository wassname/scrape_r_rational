* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Claim: We need a better vocabulary for "non-standard brain configurations."

  I have ADHD.  

  Imagine wearing an earbud that has a voice reading possibly-relevant Wikipedia articles.  This earbud is running all the time. The reader likes to follow random links in the articles.

  This is a mixed blessing.  Short-run, it makes it astoundingly hard to follow conversations.  Long-run, it means that I've been semi-actively reading an encyclopedia since I was 12.

  I took abnormal psych classes in college and was impressed by the way they approached mental illness.

  Roughly (and from memory):

  > Mental illnesses are conditions, outside of societal norms, that: cause mental distress for the patient, cause distress for people around them, or make the person unable to fulfill their normal societal roles.

  Effectively, the illness as the cluster-of-symptoms that are causing problems.  The doctors aren't trying to "fix" my personality.  They're trying to solve the practical problems of "can't focus when I want to," "can't follow a normal conversation," or "fails classes for stupid reasons."

  So a "successful treatment for my ADHD" is an unambiguously good thing, and any unwanted changes to my personality become side-effects of medication.  This makes it a lot easier for me to recommend that people get treatment for ADHD.  

  But it means that I don't have a good vocabulary to talk about "positive symptoms" or "neutral symptoms" that are correlated with ADHD.  Similarly, I'd like a way to talk about "ADHD-type minds, after the negative symptoms are treated to baseline normal."

  I'm aware of "Neurodiversity," but object to the use and philosophy that come with it.  In particular:

  >[Neurodiversity] frames autism, ADHD/ADD, dyslexia, bipolarity and other neurotypes as a natural human variation rather than a pathology or disorder, and rejects the idea that neurological differences need to be (or can be) cured, as they believe them to be authentic forms of human diversity, self-expression, and being

  This forces a false dichotomy between "ADHD-neurotypes" and "normal".  In reality, I can (and do) look for treatments that remove the constraints like "can't focus when I want to", but leave all of my self-expression intact. 

  And I'm unhappy with language that tries to re-frame a negative into a positive.  It feels like dishonest obfuscation.

    The best way I've ever heard this described is "You are not your disorders."

    I have depression. Depression is not part of who I am. Taking away the depression does not take away a part of me, because depression isn't me. It's the same for everything else, IMO.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I agree for depression, but what about something like autism? I'm in kind of weird position in this case since I haven't faced any prejudice in my life and think of my autism as a disorder to be overcome, but have been informed by my peers who have suffered prejudice that it is integral part of our identity. I feel pressured to take pride in my neurodiversity, which I never have before.
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        There's an argument, for high-functioning aspies, that they do not have a disorder. After all, it does not interfere with their functioning in life because they have learned how to work around it or even use it productively.

        Disorders are things which prevent someone from being functional, like depression, anxiety, untreated schizophrenia, and the like. ASD doesn't necessarily do that.
        ```

  - u/Slapdash17:
    ```
    I have ADHD as well (emphasis on the H, as the therapist who diagnosed me phrased it), and I've also been spending lots of time thinking about how I should relate to it on a personal level. ADHD may technically be a disorder in that I can point to certain aspects of my life that suffer as a result of my ADHD, but I can also point to certain aspects of my life where it has been a boon. At the very least, it was extremely helpful to me academically once I taught myself how to "harness" it.

    I have a perfectly valid adderall perscription that I deliberately do not use. I think about my life if I lost all those costs and benefits that come with my ADHD, if I treated myself with adderall, and for some reason it just doesn't appeal to me. Sometimes I wonder if my reasons are bad-- maybe I like my untreated ADHD because it gives me an excuse for whatever shortcomings I have, maybe I like it because it helps me feel different from the crowd, maybe I'm just so used to it that I fear what life might be like without it-- but then I find myself in a situation where my mind is going in several different directions at once, and I can't help but love it.

    As a side note, you mentioned looking for treatment that doesn't affect your self expression. One thing that's actually promising is the currently trendy [fidget spinner](https://www.amazon.com/Street-Fidgeteer-Fidget-Spinner-Bearings/dp/B06XVXYC6Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494908413&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=fidget+spinner&psc=1), which has great utility for people with ADD/ADHD. We have an easier time focusing when we have something else going on in the background. In this case, a simple tactile activity that is repetitive and constantly provides at least a bit of feedback. Even if it's not that product, something like it that you can do absent-mindedly with your non-dominant hand can lead to a marked improvement in focus and retention for people with ADD/ADHD. I have a friend with ADD who started doing much better in high school once his teachers let him knit during lectures. He didn't even have a free hand for notes, but he got much better at absorbing the information. There's a potential avenue, if you haven't explored it.

  I think I've found something I hate more about the rise of populist politics than the blatant tribalism. It's the fact that the policies and politicians these movements are supporting don't actually seem to benefit or represent their tribe. I still find the values these people hold to be despicable, but I can't even respect them as competently attempting to optimize those values.
  ```

  - u/CCC_037:

    Are they attempting to optimise the values of their tribe incompetently, or are they more competently optimising for something else (like personal wealth or the *appearance* of competence instead of the substance thereof)?

      Definitely the former, since the latter would at least mean they're incompetence wouldn't be as obvious as it is while they continue to insist that what they're doing is working when it simply isn't. This isn't a political movement, it's cults of personality built around xenophobia and anti-intellectualism that have deluded their members into thinking they aren't in a cult of personality and any evidence that they are in one is enemy propaganda.

  I learned about the [PHQ-9](https://patient.info/doctor/patient-health-questionnaire-phq-9) (a screening test for depression) and now feel obligated to share it here.

    Yeah.  I had the same reaction in my abnormal psych class.  That was a pointless loss of a few years.

    **PSA: Your mental health is as important as your teeth.  Get regular checkups!**

    Go to the dentist before you're in excruciating pain.  A checkup every 6 months means that you can catch cavities early.  And fix then when it's easy.

    The same is true about mental health.  A 6-month checkup should be normal for healthy people.  

    Worst case, you spend an hour unburdening yourself on a therapist.  Best case, you catch depression early, and can do a mild intervention, without having to go through the years of suicidal ideation.

    My teens would have been so, so much better if I'd taken this advice.

    tl;dr: careful about over-fitting results, here.

    I like the _idea_ of this test, but it seems to have a bit of a wide-net issue:

    > Depression Severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe.

    Given questions such as "Trouble falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much?" and "Feeling tired or having little energy?", this scale seems incredibly biased towards fitting everyone into the "depressed, if mildly" area.

    Reminds me a bit of WebMD; I love the idea, but if every test you take claims you might have cancer the entire project loses a lot of value.

    > When screening for depression the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) can be used first (it has a 97% sensitivity and a 67% specificity).[5]If this is positive, the PHQ-9 can then be used, which has 61% sensitivity and 94% specificity in adults.

  Caffeine! Some love it, some hate it, some rely on it (and some are in all three categories). Do you use it? How do you consume it (coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, pills...)? Is it a good idea?

  I drink a cup of coffee on weekday mornings, usually with some milk. On particularly tiring days (or if I had trouble sleeping the night before) I will have another cup in the early afternoon. This happens probably once every couple of weeks. I know some people who don't drink any coffee at all, and some who drink much more than I do.

    Thermos of coffee on the way to work (1 hr drive), usually a cup of tea in the afternoon, around 3 PM.

    I'll also do a glass of fake-latte (cold coffee concentrate and milk, instead of water) on Mondays, my online gaming night with friends. Only drink Mountain Dew every now and then (once every few Saturdays), mostly because of the sugar content.

    In general, I find it does help perk me up in the morning, but doesn't do too much to prevent me from falling asleep. I might just be lucky in this.

    I have a mocha (homemade or from the cafe down the street, nonfat milk and no whipped cream) once a day around 2pm, which is when I start to flag. Of course, it might be that part of the reason I start to flag is that I've trained my body to expect caffeine at that time. I also have a can or two of soda once a week on Tuesdays, which is D&D night. Oh, and 5-hour Energy on road trips, but only for some pep, not as a substitute for sleep.

    I think the biggest issue with caffeine consumption is probably the added calories that can come with developing a dependency if you're not doing straight black coffee or unsweetened tea. I personally watch my calories and know what I'm allowed, so don't have problems there, but for a while I was starting to get fat, and part of that was an increase in sugary drinks (all of which had caffeine).

      I had problems with weight gain from sweet caffeinated drinks as well. I used to have an iced mocha with sugar every morning, which is of course a real treat, but not really something I could keep up once my metabolism began to slow down. I ended up swapping away from having too many sweet drinks after talking with my cousin (who is very into fitness) about it. He pointed out that it's a lot easier to drink calories without noticing than it is to eat them (along with some other advice) so now I stick to the way-less-fun coffee. Though, I do sometimes still get a latte or something with nonfat milk, this is pretty rare. I also used to drink sweetened milk with tea and tapioca, called by various names like Pearl Milk Tea, Bubble Tea, Boba, etc. Cutting that out helped me out a lot.

  Weird question I just thought of:

  Is the existence of billionaires a net evil? And assuming it isn't, would there probably be a cut-off point, like a trillion dollars or something like that, where we can confidently say no human should wield this much monetary power?

  One big problem is that owning a billion dollars almost inherently puts you above the law. That is, if you choose to kill someone or commit some other terrible crime, the lawyers and bribes required to cover it up are likely to be a small fraction of what your fortune earns in annual interest. This suggests that until completely bribe-proof enforcement is possible, permitting large fortunes to exist stands in contradiction to the notion of legal equality for all.

  Another problem is that it creates unfair advantage in business and other competitive games, which hurts smaller players (middle class / small business). As a billionaire you have a thousand huge fortunes, which is what a million dollars is to most people. You can in principle make anyone you please immensely rich on a whim. This possibility, while mostly counterfactual, gives leverage over people who hope to be beneficiaries, which you can then use to make yourself even richer. Less wealthy people don't have this kind of leverage, and the poorest end up unable to even borrow from the bank at a tolerable rate (often falling into high interest credit card debt, for example).

  Another ethical issue would be the Peter Singer argument, that there are places in the world where life is cheap, such that a single billion could save a million lives. While we are pretty much all somewhat guilty on paper, the drowning child in a pond analogy implies that billionaires are literally *thousands of times* more guilty of failure to prioritize distant lives than middle class people who make the same mistake. If it is at all right that ordinary folks should feel vaguely guilty they don't do more for children dying of Malaria, logically, billionaires should experience a thousand times the anguish.

  So why do we tolerate billionaires?

  One possibility is that we have no other choice. They are too powerful to get rid of (by which I mean "tax until they are merely very rich") and are good at resisting attempts to do so. They can hire violent people for protection of their assets, so there might be no way to confiscate them without the prospect of escalating to unacceptable levels of violence.

  Another possibility is that very powerful people are frequently a good solution to various hard coordination problems that can't be solved any other way. If these problems went unsolved, perhaps the world would experience significantly more disutility.

  We could also consider the possibility that private property is so important and foundational that it outweighs other factors, and that collecting tax is immoral and intolerable from the get go. This may be how some libertarians see the world.

  Also perhaps the possibility of becoming a billionaire drives people to perform great acts of goodness that they would not otherwise do. I can't think of a real world example here that doesn't fit under the "accidentally solves coordination problems" heading mentioned above, but perhaps they exist. That the prospect of becoming a billionaire drives some people to great evil is also worth considering, needless to say.

  The real answer could be a combination of the above. We may see some motivation to to better individual behavior as the result of aspiring to own billions (although scope blindness probably limits this vs mere millions), some coordination problems that couldn't otherwise be solved (what would be the way to test that?), some moral disutility for the prospect of confiscating wealth above 1000 million, and some inability to accomplish such a thing without an unacceptable cost in violence.

  On the other hand, it seems like prohibiting anyone from ever being a *trillionaire* would be easier because nobody is yet a trillionaire, the prospect of becoming one has never yet motivated anyone to do anything in the real world, and as an unknown phenomenon it doubtless carries economic and existential risks which could motivate such a ban. Billionaires might even support such a ban because their own chance of becoming a trillionaire is slim and they don't want to be lorded over by someone else who gets luckier.

    Progressive tax brackets exist to reduce financial inequality without distorting the market too badly.

    I'm curious what progressive interest would result in. A system where the more money you put in your savings the less interest each additional dollar earns. It wouldn't work in practice because the rich would just use international banks or move to another country but it is interesting to think about.

  Fun with cognitive dissonance!

  \- A person who has undergone facial reconstruction surgery  
  \- A person who has breast implants  
  \- A person who has a chin implant  
  \- A person who wears contact lenses  
  \- A person who wears makeup  
  \- A person who has an artificial heart  
  \- A person who has an artificial knee  
  \- A person who has undergone genital reconstruction surgery

  Which of these people are Inspector Gadget or Adam Jensen, and which are Frankenstein's monster or "Kabutomaru"? Or are they all at the same level? Or is there a gradual continuum (based on what criteria?)?

  Generally, I'm inclined to consider such people as existing on a continuum, based on the ongoing maintenance and inconvenience involved. Is setting off metal detectors like Wolverine or needing to replace batteries like a robot equivalent in grotesquery to needing to lubricate or pump up artificial genitalia manually, though? I'm really not sure...

    I'm not sure I understand the question you're asking.  I'd look at most of them and just see a person who's had surgery.

    The surgery might be more-or-less complicated, or more-or-less gross.  But "knee surgery is gross" feels like an aesthetic judgement.  

    I don't feel any particular dissonance with the idea that knee surgery is grosser than make-up.  Or that Inspector Gadget had a better cosmetic outcome than Frankenstein's monster.

    If the question is a round-about way of getting to trans-surgery: 

    I'm not convinced that there's an "innately male mind" anymore than there's an "innately male height" or "innately male muscle mass."

    Sure, some mental configurations / heights / muscle masses are more common among men than women.  But outliers exist.  Some women are tall.  Some women have preferences or muscle mass that's more common among men.

    So, the 'standard' progressive trans-position needs to convince me of:

    * Gender is "real" outside of social convention
    * Other people can sense their own gender
    * We should draw boundaries based on internal-sense, not experience or social convention.

    But, at that point, surgery wouldn't matter.

      Ooh! discussion of transness, alright!

      First of all, as a trans person, I'm really really confident that transness (I haven't heard of a good noun for "the state of being transgender" so I coined this one. Transgenderism is an alternative) is something which transitioning fixes. I have personally observed the symptoms of gender dysphoria in myself, and transitioning physically and socially has helped with those symptoms. I also know that the overwhelming majority of trans people who transition see similar improvements - moreso the younger they are. So the question of "is it a good thing for people with gender dysphoria to transition?" is settled - yes, it definitely is. Especially when they're young.

      But your questions are a little more interesting to me!

      > Gender is "real" outside of social convention

      Earlier today I found [this highly informative comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/6baxm8/parents_are_doubtful_keep_giving_me_science_to/dhl7u5f/) on r/asktransgender which - while sadly sourceless - was a great anecdote of what the commenter learned from a Physical Anthropology course at the University of Colorado about the causes of transness. Again, it unfortunately doesn't cite any sources (besides the commenter's personal experience), but there are some sources in the replies which support it, and it doesn't blatantly contradict any information I can find by googling for a few minutes about pregnancy timelines.

      The comment is about a 10 minute read and it presents a pretty convincing explanation of trans identities (including non-binary ones) which, at the very least, isn't *obviously* false. Check it out.

      > Other people can sense their own gender

      If you ever have the opportunity, I would suggest that you try presenting as the gender that you aren't - male if you're female, female if you're male. I've spoken with some cisgender men who, for various reasons, presented as and were socially read as female at some point. They described to me a strange sensation of discomfort when they were referred to as female - female pronouns, perhaps a female name they had adopted, etc. Their description of that sensation sounded extremely similar to my own dysphoria!

      In other words, you might not be able to "sense" your internal gender until your external presentation doesn't match it. I would poetically liken it to the way that you can't feel the air on your skin unless there's a breeze.

      > We should draw boundaries based on internal-sense, not experience or social convention.

      Actually, I don't believe in defining boundaries based on any of those. Or rather, I believe that trying to define boundaries carries an extremely high risk of gatekeeping - leaving someone who is trans on the "cisgender" side of the fence, and hence not forbidding them from transitioning. Rather than trying to define such a boundary, I think it best to let anyone transition if they want to. Far more trans people have been prevented from transitioning, than cis people been accidentally allowed to transition - and it seems that the first outcome is worse than the second, since a falsely-transitioned cis person won't be forced to continue living as the wrong gender. 

      That said, I do approve of RLE (real life experience) requirements for surgery (one year living fulltime as your true gender), and I do believe ASD youths who express a desire to transition should be watched carefully as they start puberty; I have read about cisgender people with ASD who, at some point, expressed such a desire temporarily - I know one such individual personally, actually.

      And if one day society is so accepting of trans people that cis people mistakenly transitioning becomes a big problem, we'll fiigure that out then.

      > But at that point, surgery wouldn't matter.

      I don't get what you mean by this? I don't see how those 3 points lead to this conclusion, let alone just the first 2. A mostly [female/male] brain with a [female/male] hormone balance is uncomfortable having [male/female] genetalia, that's my picture of why some trans people want bottom surgery.

        Entirely coincidentally, I've been through that experience myself. Someone (on an internet forum, with little to no cues to go from) misread my gender and referred to me with female pronouns. I found the situation surprisingly disquieting. (I explained the error, the other person apologised, and all was well).

        I think that people, generally, have a 'module' running in our heads that compels us to find tribes, imprint on them, and convey that social identity.   We feel dissonance if other people don't recognize us as parts of the tribes that we think are important.

        I think we'd both use an explanation like this to explain why people "come out" to their parents as atheists.   Or why people would get offended if I repeatedly got their occupation, name or nationality wrong.

        My model of transness is that some people's modules imprint on the gender that's maximally inconvenient for their body.  An agender person could fail to imprint on either group and feel dissonance when they're described as either male or female.

        I think this explains the examples you've raised, without needing any extra notion of a uniquely "male" or uniquely "female" inner life.

        We'd expect transitioning to help because it brings someone's public identity in line with their private model of themselves.

        I'd feel insecure about switching my gender presentation.  But only if I did it in pubic.  Trap me on a desert island, and I don't care what I wear.

        The idea of presenting as female to experience dysphoria is really interesting to me, because I've always been stymied by the fact that I can't imagine what it'd be like to "feel" like one gender or another.

        My initial reaction was the realization that it *would* be quite uncomfortable, and I thought I might have finally gotten a glimpse of dysphoria...but then you mentioned that getting misgendered was the uncomfortable part for the male friends of yours who had run the experiment. For me, that would be a huge relief. The uncomfortable part would be wondering if I was passing, and having female pronouns directed at me would make me feel a lot *more* at ease.

        Thank you for the fascinating insight. I will have to consider this further.
