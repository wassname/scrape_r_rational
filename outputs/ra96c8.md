## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I want to second /u/123whyme's recommendation of [The Last Orellen](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46901/the-last-orellen) which I just read through in one sitting.
  I followed the reading order brought up in authors notes of starting in chapter 9, reading until 23, then reading 1-9 which is a bit of a prelude, then 24. Do recommend that if the first chapter does not pull you in instanntly.

      I found it very cool not actually knowing the background of the main character (as he doesn't know either), and only finding out later.
      ```

  - u/netstack_:

    I'll have to get on that one. I devoured the existing chapters of their second recommendation for *Book of the Dead*, despite not expecting to like the edge, so I imagine this will scratch a similar itch.

  I have once again run into the problem that, be it in real life (*sigh*) or books, people take themselves and the world too serious. 

  Why does the big wizard always have to have such a grim look? 
  Why doesn't the wise one crack a joke? 
  Can't the villain also be in good spirits when plotting the revolution? 

  And $client, do you really think it is impossible to do good work while having a good time?

  So I'm looking for works that manage to be fun and angst-free while still having some sort of actually serious plot. 

  What i am trying to avoid is stuff that ignores human nature completely though. There is a ton of crack (fanfiction) out there where murdering friends and enemies alike is a jolly-good time. thats not what im looking for. 

  Bow that i have written this i notice how unspecific it is. Eh, gonna give it a try anyway. Thanks in advance, have a good week!

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    I mean, it's a classic, but *Unsong* might fit what you're looking for. It's a lot of fun, but not in a "crack fanfiction" sort of way
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Terry Pratchett. Pretty much the entire ouvre. Outright comedy, but comedy with a lot of humanity to it. 

    Bujold, specifically the Penric series. But also everything. Penric is fantasy, of various scope, though never with world ending stakes, and never grim. Her scifi should also match your desire, as nobody, ever, has accused Miles of being grim or overly serious. 

    Steven Brust, the Vlad novels, and if you enjoy very long winded, extravagantly, excessively, floridly verbose and also redundantly descriptive prose the dumas pastiches set in the same universe.
    ```

    - u/Charlie___:
      ```
      Yeah, I was going to recommend Terry Pratchett's Discworld. The later books are better (until the very end), so I'd recommend jumping into the books that introduce new main characters, like Small Gods or Going Postal.
      ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Angst-free is the kicker here.

    I could recommend, say, *Dresden Files* for a wizard who cracks jokes and appreciates the finer things, but it's not like he's able to avoid heavy, horrible events. Or *The Name of the Wind* for the rags-to-riches autobiography of a folk hero, but then there's all the poverty and beatings. Heck, *The Lord of The Rings* spends half its time describing singing and feasts and hospitality in between the pillaging and the desperate last stand of the free world. Angst and suffering are part of the package when it comes to making interesting conflicts.

    There's an infinite spray of serious-to-less-serious fanfiction out there which may or may not do it for you. Can you narrow it down at all?

    I have to say *Unsong* works for this request. It has some crack fanfiction energy while simultaneously being dead serious. Somehow.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I don't think you'll be able to have a serious plot that doesn't have at least some angst, at least generally. I'm sure some outliers exist though.

    Maybe Joe Abercrombie? Some of his characters are very serious, but he never shies away from awkward moments or comedy, even with the really serious characters. There's awkward sex, powerful characters acting like a dumbass, villains being jolly while villainous, and "good" characters being petty. Would count as grimdark though.
    ```

    - u/mkalte666:
      ```
      Your suggestion sounds enjoyable albeit (or due to, who knows!), i think, not being what im looking for. Will give it a shot, thanks!

      In regards to there being no angst - i admit it's unrealistic. On the other hand there are quite a few stories out there that are nothing but angst, so i thought id give it a try anyway and maybe end up with something close :)
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        It depends on the genre right, what you want doesn't really match the genre people here generally read. Scifi, epic fantasy, and litrpgs can't really fit that mold most of the time. 

        &#x200B;

        We're talking about people doing dangerous things that could lead to death or permanent injuries in order to accomplish an objective, it doesn't really match with light heartedness and joking around. Could happen as satire, but then it'd go to the other extreme which you also don't seem to want. 

        &#x200B;

        If I were you I'd look into other genres that better fit this requirement. I can easily see it done in a romance and it's subgenres. The stakes aren't as high and it doesn't need angst inducing tropes to create tension and advance the plot.

            No, but gallows humor is nothing new and not really my point, maybe I phrased it poorly? I'm talking about what's required by the authors so that their stories will have the impact they are meant to.
            ```

        - u/mkalte666:
          ```
          where would it exclude scifi though? I can "easily" (hah.. no) worldbuild and construct SciFi where the general feel of the world story is one of hope and good spirits instead of despair and impending doom. Not every journey thats worthwhile taking and also intersting to read about has to be full of dangers and death.

          I agree that if the whole theme of a story is impending doom though, even though gallows humor might happen, the entire theme wont be too uplifting.

          That said, i guess the fundamental claim i am making is that while things might be risky for whatever reason, you can construct a story around it that still is mostly just a fun ride. To give an example, maybe magic students journey from their high school to university, with the odd monster but mostly meeting people and learning stuff?

          I kinda have to think about "The Gods are Bastards" now, though its been way too long for me to accuratly place this here.

          Well that's whats going through my head. Its past midnight so its just getting more scrambled, im heading to bed. Thanks for giving me stuff to think about!

          EDIT: Also i see how i could  have done my original request differently, woops

            It can happen, it's just harder to pull off. Andy Weir does it for instance, but that's more the exception rather than the rule. 

            This is reaching a bit far but maybe it'll make sense, think of it like music genres, they each evoke different feelings in general. Some will make you happy or energized, others will make you sad and match your mood when you're down, others make you angry and motivated etc.

            Something similar happens with reading, what most people here like is a combination of power fantasy preferably in a way that requires brains, and or some satire / deconstruction that feels smart or is written by someone smart. 

            Other book genres may be more suited to providing the feelings / emotions you're looking for. 

            For instance romance is basically power fantasy for women, they get the hot guy fall HARD for them, and also the stud they wanted but didn't want them before. Romance also has this horny sexual side to it. But everything tends to be a bit lighter, because romance isn't that serious.

            As an example of a female power fantasy story try watching "Anne with an E", it's a really cute story about a weird nerdy girl moving into a new town and coming of age story. The ending is the biggest female brag ever, and it does it without being obnoxious somehow.. It likely fits what you're looking for btw.

            Anyway sorry for the weird tangent, hopefully it was interesting ;P

    Skulduggery Pleasant? It's urban fantasy with a mage detective who's a skeleton and his new sidekick. I only read a couple of the books but remember them as lighthearted.

    Crap just remembered it's supposed to be rational-adjacent at least (was gonna start throwing out stuff like the Belgariad) and I don't remember enough of this series to know if it fits..

    [Virtuous Sons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41330/virtuous-sons-a-greco-roman-xianxia/) \- My favorite long form webfiction in the last year. A masterfully done "Buddy-Cop" Xianxia in Classical Antiquity. It seamless mixes both settings, with familiar tropes played with in clever ways. Top notch banter and an engaging plot. Highly Recommended.

    [Doing God's Work](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25442/doing-gods-work) \- If you liked American Gods or Good Omens you'll like this. Bureaucratic divinity in the modern era. The premise alone invites comedy. Great writing, fun story.

    [The Zombie Knight Saga](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28307/the-zombie-knight-saga) \- I liked how down to earth this was, even taking into account that it's a contemporary fantasy novel. It's got a sort of dry humor that really appeals to me.

    [This Quest is Bullshit](https://www.amazon.com/Bullshit-Trilogy-Broken-Comedy-Adventure-ebook/dp/B08S29SNMY) is very lighthearted and very much a good time. The plot is kiiinda serious, but mostly meanders in a breadward manner.

    Since I'm rereading it right now, the Pokemon Adventures manga comes to mind as something that fits.  It's also a pretty great read on its own, and I think most people would like it regardless of their opinions on other Pokemon media.

    [Sylver Seeker](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36065/sylver-seeker) fits what you described almost perfectly.

    Plot and problems are serious, but the MC always has a positive attitude, is extremely genre and trope savvy, and calls people who take themselves too seriously out. He's also exceptionally relaxed about things out of his control, in the sense that he doesn't worry about the problems he can't do anything about.

    Alex Verus series. The first 2 novels are stand-alones the 3rd expanding the cast and the 4th is where the author felt assured he could construct a series long narratie and is where shit gets real (I know people who say it's their favourite but it's also the darkest so I preferred the 3rd at the time)

    Anyway, it's modern Britain. Society of mages living the masquerade. MC is a proficient Diviner, he's specialised in seeing the future, all possible paths, though much easier the closer to the present he looks.

    It's probably obvious, but Dresden Files is quite good. The first two books are pretty mediocre, however, and book 4 starts being more representative of the rest of the series. Bit of a dip around book 13, but I think it's recovered.

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I quite liked this: [The Devil's Dark Remnant](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39156/the-devils-dark-remnant-an-urban-progression-fantasy). It's kinda in between YA and adult fantasy. What I did like was that the characters, especially the protagonist, feel more realized than the usual YA fare. They feel self aware and thoughtful without feeling like adults in teen bodies. The setting is also more midwest occultism and witch covens rather than vampires and werewolves and such, which I liked. Action scenes are really well done.

    I've just started [The City We Became](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/42074525-the-city-we-became) by N.K. Jemisen and I think I love it? It's extremely fresh in that it was published last year and social justice features as one of the larger aspects within the work. It's not quite Neil Gaiman, but there's a sort of dreaminess to it at times. As a text, it's steeped in New York. To lean into the Gaiman comparison, the way American Gods is a love story to Americana and the idea of the cross-country road trip (and the symbolically large nature of traditions and pilgrimages), The City We Became loves New York City.

  Recently I've been reading The Way Ahead, Delve, and Dungeon Scholar, and I've gotten a bit tired of protagonists that are crippled by their social anxiety/angst/self-doubt. Are there any stories that manage to have introspective or thoughtful characters that also aren't like that? I'm not asking for fully self assured wise mentor or anything, just characters that don't get into depressive thought spirals all the time. Stuff that I've read that are similar to what I'm looking for:

  * Mother of Learning

  * Ar'Kendrythist (very good, and almost exactly what I'm looking for)

  * Dune books 1-3 (while some characters do get crippled later on, mostly they're okay)

  * [Quest of the Five Clans](https://www.amazon.ca/Blood-Tartan-Quest-Five-Clans-ebook/dp/B073XSWBW5) (also very good, and very close to what I'm looking for)

  * Sun Eater Saga by Christopher Ruocchio (starts off closer to what I dislike, but undergoes a lot of character development)

    > I've gotten a bit tired of protagonists that are crippled by their social anxiety/angst/self-doubt.

    If you're looking for a main character that's the literal, polar opposite of that, then you must read [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/). The main character, Sylvester, specced *everything* into Charisma and Intelligence, and dumped the rest, making him an expert social manipulator but horrible at fighting. Him and his friends are creations of mad bioscience wrought by a British Empire that took charge of the Frankenstein experiments and used the resulting zombie armies to conquer most of the world. They are still kids, but are already used as black ops/counter-espionage experts. The first few arcs read sort of like the "monster of the week" formula from breakfast cartoons, but it all starts tying together around arc 6.

    Maybe try [RE: Monarch](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37951/re-monarch)? My memory of it is a bit fuzzy given the author's irl situation went to shit so updates have been unreliable the past few months, but the tl;dr is that a drunkard prince who loathes his kingdom on account of his genocidal tyrant father/king and the "disappearance" of the peasant girl he fell in love with years back gets his coronation/abdication interrupted with the invasion of a coalition of every enemy of humanity slaughtering their way through the capital effortlessly. He then gets transported 10 years into the past and has to "RE: Zero timeloop" his way forward, except the main antagonist also had the whole timeloop thing going on (which was how she united several entire civilizations against humanity over the course of a decade), except the portagonist's loop trumps hers to the degree that she isn't aware of it.

    It's not about social anxiety, rather a member of royalty dusting off the socialite charms and politicking skills, while unpacking his trauma and anger.

    You may like [Wizard's Tower](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41881/wizards-tower). It's about a half-elf wizard who has had a career longer than any human could live and decides to retire and build a tower to research in. It's been a couple of months since I caught up, but from what I remember he's prone to introspection but doesn't at all let that stop him from getting shit done.

  - u/LazarusRises:

    Mistborn fits these criteria. Vin is very thoughtful, introspective, and suspicious, but she doesn't dwell or spiral.

    The Stormlight Archive also has very thoughtful characters, but the depression & PTSD of one of the protags is a pretty major plot point, and he definitely has doom-spiraly periods.

  Does anyone know of any good dungeon building novels? And by this, I mean novels that actually focus on the dungeon making and actually kill people. I’m so tired of every dungeon builder thinking they’re clever and unique for having the “pacifistic kingdom building” dungeon, that is apparently optimal yet no other dungeon in the world also does it. Either that or the novels are generally of very low quality.

  I’ll take web fiction, published novels, translated novels, hell, as long as it’s competent dungeon building that actually does killing, I’m good. Someone recced The Divine Dungeon to me, and it had some pretty good dungeon building...although virtually everything else was awful.

    Does with this ring get better? I got a few chapters in on my first read, to/just past the harpy-boat event with WW before I dropped. The order of events was just odd to me. He immediately goes off too an asteroid to mine gold and get rich, then agrees to be shackled to WW & Batman for a year in exchange for a lantern? Then he’s off and filtering plastic from the ocean, understands an island of harpies better than WW? Idk. 


    I picked it up for the uplift reasons. I saw reviews saying he gets the “cold” villains to do good work on the poles, I saw that he is working on the micro plastic problem, etc. Does that become more prevalent?

      It's very much "slice of life" throughout, the pacing is all over the place. I enjoyed the first 3/4 or so but after that it was too much of a slog. There are a lot more uplift bits than you're seeing, but the MC works at getting established enough first to be taken seriously.

      It's not so weird that he exchanges a year for a lantern though? He's got a few days of power at best without one and becomes a squishy mortal after that, which is a very bad thing to be in DC.
