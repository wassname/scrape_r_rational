## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Got some more of royalroads new stuff. In order of enjoyment - they're all very enjoyable though.


  [The Last Orellen](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46901/the-last-orellen)
  My new favourite. Really great world building, magic system and an amazing hook to draw you in. The characters are also really well done. Somewhat reminds of Mother of Learning in terms of its magic system. 

  [Book of the Dead](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47038/book-of-the-dead)
  Grittier litrpg world, where the main character is driven and competent. They have an outlawed class assigned to them and refuse to abandon it. This causes problems. 


  [Apocalypse Parenting](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47434/apocalypse-parenting)
  System apocalypse except its a parent with her children, very realistic portrayal of children. It does a great job of realistic motivations and behaviour in this type of setting. Pretty interesting progression system as well.

    +1 on The Last Orellen. The whole thing has a sprawling epic feel to it, and the author has done an excellent job with the characters and the world that makes you want to learn more.

  I've gotten into speculative evolution over the past year and I want to recommend Serina. It's something like 300,000 words and hundreds of illustrations.

  It's a story that takes place over 250 million years, starting with a terraformed moon that has a basic ecosystem put in place (microbes, bugs, etc) and then is seeded with only two vertebrates: guppies and canaries.

  Then it follows the story of how the guppies and canaries evolve over the next 250 million years, reaching diverse and strange forms.

  The format is with articles about the different species, explaining how they evolved and their ecology and behaviour.

  The writer has a solid grounding in biology (some of the more wild things actually have precedence in the real world), and the canaries and fish end up evolving into whole new, idk, what's the word, classes(?) of vertebrates because 250 million years has passed.

  It also goes into the evolution of the insects and plants. It is just incredible. It's been going on for 7 years and still gets updated. 

  Check it out:

    - u/MagicWeasel:

      It depends what you mean by "like this"

      like this = a "seed world", where one star organism speciates like the canary here. uh, not really. there's many imitators but nothing on the same scale. hamster's paradise on tumblr is the next best, and it's about 20% as good

      "like this" = speculative evolution, yep, /r/speculativeEvolution/ is the ticket

      Reminded me of this video by Alt Shift X about [All Tomorrows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imNtSPM3-r4). I think it's also in text form somewhere under the video in the description..

  - u/YayMeristinoux:
    ```
    This seems really cool! Reading the description on the website, it orbiting a gas giant would mean it's exposed to some very nasty magnetosphere effects, blasting it with ions, so it would need a strong magnetic field itself to not be constantly irradiated. Is this aspect touched upon in the book?
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Book is a bit of a misnomer since it's just a website with a list of articles that is updated in a quasi-random order.

      They kind of quietly retcon the moon issue, I believe they've decided it's just an earthlike planet, though they have plenty of articles mention the fact it's a moon, but not any new ones in the past several years mention it.

      It's not hard physics so much as hard biology, you could say.

  Past couple months I’ve fallen hard for ratfic, but now I’m chasing the up-to-three-am-binge-reading high I hadn’t felt since fifth grade that Worm, HPMOR and Unsong gave me and nothing has since! I’m looking to get my socks rocked and lose some sleep, what are the grabbiest ratfics y’all know‽ Also, I am daunted by high wc’s, which has held me back from PGtE for example, but if something is gripping enough I’ll want all those words.

    ```
    Yes yes yes to Mother of Learning.

    Also Worth the Candle for (lit)RPG deconstruction. All worldbuilding is of the highest quality.

     Animorphs:the Reckoning is one of the best reinventions of a canon you could ask for. Similar “how do we get this weird shit from canon to work” as HPMOR, but less didactic.

    The Waves Arisen does a similar thing for Naruto. It’s less serious and less elaborately plotted, following some stations of canon, but does a fantastic job reinventing the underlying *mechanics* of a batshit insane setting.

    Pokémon: on the origin of species is also absolute worldbuilding/reconstruction crack but is not yet finished.

    I will also shill qntm.org/ra as somewhere between rational fiction and SCP. It’s such a good conceit and I absolutely binged it.
    ```

    - u/degenerate__weeb:
      ```
      Man, Waves Arisen ([link btw](https://wertifloke.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)) was quite a trip off the canon rails. I enjoyed the read, thanks for the recommendation.

      I guess for a rationalist take, it makes sense, but [vague-ish mid-story spoilers?]>!oof a bunch of the various characters just dying without preamble was rough. I wanted to have my cake and eat it too, but all the main characters living wouldn't make sense in how dark the shinobi world really is!<.

            *Luminosity* (with sequels *Radiance* and *Flashes*) is part of the context that glowfic tends to assume :-)

              ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        Luminosity is not high context. You don't need to know anything about Twilight, I didn't. I'm sure there's some good references and easter eggs for fans but I didn't miss them. 

        It diverges from Twilight's plot almost immediately and I remember being gripped from the first few pages.

        RE Glowfic: There is Luminosity and its sequel, Radiance (which I 100% recommend if you enjoyed Luminosity), and some short stories (again, 100% recommend), but there's also a universe of glowfic that I haven't read. 

        ----

        The other thing I'd recommend is Animorphs: The Reckoning, but that is very long and you'll be lost for the first chapter or so if you don't understand animorphs, but plenty of people who don't understand animorphs have enjoyed A:tR fine.

      This could be interesting but with the short posts my TtS reader spends almost as much time reading the fluff(e.g. user name, posting time) as it does the actual text. Does anyone know a solution to this?
      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        Adblock those elements? In a pinch, copy the text, such as from the "Flat HTML" menu item, and use some regex search-and-replace to remove what you want skipped. Or replace the audio snippets your TtS reader uses for those words with sped-up versions. Or use a braille screen. Or, don't know if that exists, use a touchscreen app that speaks each word as you touch it.
        ```

      - u/ilzolende:
        ```
        With a userstyles app such as [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html), try adding the userstyle below. This assumes that your TtS reader respects `display: none;`, and if it doesn't, you'll need a different property there. Either way, I still consider this a better set of selectors than just blocking the elements, because sometimes a tag has no character name, and then you might well want to know the author name.

  ```
  I started watching [*Sharpe*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12749392/), and I'm enjoying it, with some caveats.

  The series is about a British television drama series starring Sean Bean as Richard Sharpe, a British soldier in the Napoleonic Wars. It's based on the novel series by Bernard Cornwell, who also wrote *The Last Kingdom*, which was also serialized.

  The show has some pretty impressive production values. It was shot in the early to mid-90s (season 1-5), and then later again in late-2000s (season 6-7). There's a huge amount of extras, all in period uniform, cavalry, cannons, the whole nine yards. It also looks great, a bit dated but still really good for something that was shot ~25 years ago.

  The acting is great. Sean Bean is a great actor, but those around him aren't any less impressive. Also, apparently Cornwell liked Bean's performance so much, he changed the writing of the character to be more like Bean's portrayal, and he "could not imagine Sharpe as anyone else."

  History-wise it's very good. I can't vouch for the historical accuracy of the events (I know that Sharpe himself is a fictional character), but the writer apparently did his research, and other have commented that it's accurate as far as the war goes and a soldier's life.

  The story really focuses on two things: the reality of war and how grueling and gruesome it is, and the class divide between the officers, who are nobles (rich, learned and affluent), and the common soldiers (poor, conscripted, illiterate, poorly supplied, etc.). There's also a fair bit of classicism between the "superior" English gentlemen and basically everyone else.

  This leads to on how Sharpe is competent as hell (he definitely falls into the "intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources" category), but isn't allowed to carry out plans because his superiors think they know better than him, even to their detriment. he has to constantly prove himself, but even that isn't always enough since he isn't a "gentleman."

  There were a few things I didn't like. One thing that really struck me as out of place is that being hit with a saber, even a glancing blow, cases insta-death, unless it's the MC, in which case he just walks it off (no joke, there's a scene where he gets charged by a guy on horseback, takes a blow right across the spine, is bleeding profusely, and is still able to hold himself up, talk with others normally). There's also a fairly large amount of plot armor for Sharpe and his men - if Sharpe is in command of 10 men out of a group of 30, and they're attacked and take 50% casualties, those 15 dead guys will by anyone but his men. As far as tropes go, these are pretty common and not a huge deal (killing off the MC and main supporting characters would be a blow for the show), but it does happen fairly often.

  All in all, it's a fun series, a bit dated but still fun to watch, especially for people who like military history and tactics, and are interested in the day-to-day life of a soldier during the Napoleonic wars.
  ```

  - u/sunshine_cata:
    ```
    If you're interested in the British being idiots, you should read 'On the Psychology of Military Incompetence.' It uses a lot of examples from the Boer War and Crimean War.
    ```

  - u/jaghataikhan:
    ```
    Tangentially related to Sharpe, I'm a fan of the warhammer 40k series Gaunt's Ghosts, which is straight up Sharpe in the 40k-verse. 

    It's probably among the best out of the entire oeuvre of 40k books (along with Ravenor and Ciaphas Cain, the latter of which is basically Blackadder/Flashman in 40k)
    ```

  - u/alphanumericsprawl:
    ```
    IIRC the books talk about how saber slashing from inexperienced cavalry often did nothing. You have to stab. I think in Sharpe's Eagle, after the French break a regimental square, they're chasing down the survivors and many are too high on bloodlust to kill efficiently, instead just driving them away in a panic.
    ```

  maybe a long shot, but does anyone know any decent fiction set in the world of Mount & Blade?

  Or just a steampunk fiction if the above are impossible.
  ```

- u/Vox-Triarii:
  ```
  What are some English xenofiction works, preferably rational ones, that explore existential themes such as the search for ethics/purpose/authenticity?

      I look forward to reading both, thank you for the recommendations. 

      17776 in particular looks interesting. Speculative athletics is a highly unexplored topic. I recall *Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect* explored it from the perspective of post-Singularity hedonism, but it didn't fully explore the possibilities.
      ```

  - u/grekhaus:
    ```
    Onward the Providence doesn't precisely explore a search for ethics so much as the viewpoint of numerous characters with wildly different conceptions of ethics (and everything else). But it is very good xenofiction.

    Coloratura, a text adventure. ~~It’s available on the web from some sort of writing contest site.~~

    The version I played is no longer hosted, apparently. You can read an adaptation (no interpreter, but still somewhat interactive, I guess) [here](http://apollowebworks.com/lynnea/Coloratura-twine.html). But I would suggest downloading the game [here](http://mirror.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/competition2013/glulx/coloratura/Coloratura.gblorb) in addition to an [interpreter](https://intfiction.org/t/list-of-glulx-gblorb-interpreters/51243).

  Strong disrecommendation against trying to start the anime "The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated"; it goes to icky places.
  ```

  - u/jaghataikhan:

      SSS-Class Suicide Hunter is honestly nearly the best you could expect when your Main Character has the power of unlimited tries, unlimited growth, and is in a tower climb.

      The novel is basically a series of interesting or best solutions, instead of the bash against the wall until it works that would be expected with such a stacked character.

      >!Some people hated the romance, I found it tolerable. The author wanted to 'nerf' his power without actually nerfing it. Understandable, but frustrating for wish-fulfillment AND for people who like more natural romance.!<

    Seeing how many similar anime tend towards portraying the morally suspect, with some still being reasonably high quality, I'm wavering on whether or not to give it a chance to improve.

    - u/Ridingh00d:
      ```
      Strongly agree with the Assasin Isakai. I get that some of the characters have had difficult pasts etc but I kept thinking almost no one acts like an actual human. They all seem like surreal AI programmed by a socially inept shut in trying to project his fantasies. Overlord's actual NPCs turned into people are more 'real' to me than this anime's cast so far.

      That and I kept thinking during the first episode "this would be great if they just skipped the Isekai and gave us a dark thriller about assassins". Though kudos for them giving us an Isakai with a unique MC at least.

  My Thanksgiving travels involved more time on planes and in airports than I would have liked, but it gave me an opportunity to sit down and read some comics, which I haven't done in a long time. Side note, I fully recommend reading comics on a tablet. Absolute game changer.

  [East of West](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_West) is an apocalyptic, techno-western. The lead is Death, the horseman of the Apocalypse. He's had something of a falling out with his siblings, to put it lightly. Strong recommend. It has expansive world building, a wonderfully complex cast of characters, and [some](https://retconpunchdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/blood-bath.jpg) [great](https://imagecomics.com/files/releases/spotlight-gh-eow-09-06.png) [art](https://cdn.imagecomics.com/files/read/east-of-west/018_eastofwest_01-18.jpg). I haven't finished it, but barring a marked drop in quality, I would say this is one of the best comic series I've read, easily.

  [The Superior Foes of Spider-Man](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Superior_Foes_of_Spider-Man) is a hilarious look at street level villainy in the Marvel universe. It centers around Boomerang, the current leader of the Sinister Six (which presently has 5 members) as he leads them on what will definitely be a successful heist, no question. It's goofy and surprisingly smart at times and [features imaginary violence against lawyers](https://i.redd.it/ur2f8owacyq31.png).

  [Superman: Secret Identity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman:_Secret_Identity) is a rather light, warm and fuzzy read. I read it years ago and I definitely think it holds up. The story follows a teen boy named Clark Kent who lives in Kansas, which shouldn't be news for most readers. That said, this Clark lives in a world where superheroes are fictional and he has grown up resenting his dumb name and all the jokes that come with it. Until, of course, he wakes up one day with Superman's powers. From there, the story follows Clark into adulthood, through marriage and fatherhood, and well into his twilight years. It's not a particularly dense or challenging work, but there's something very fulfilling about the fluff. Between being written  by Kurt Busiek, with [art by Stuart Immonen](https://imgur.com/a/gCPRy), it can be truly gorgeous at times.
