  having read the chapter my only comment right away is:

  ...well shit.
  ```

  - u/bigbysemotivefinger:
    ```
    I got the end and my only thought was "say 'April Fool's' right now."
    ```

  Calling it for Rain full force warded Velika and now he has to live with the guilt of Melka dying for his choice. Kinda hoping against hope that Melka gets greater restored again and one day gets some "how are you not dead you died twice you're like a zombie rogue what the fuck" class. Probably not though.
  ```

  - u/bucketsofmercy:
    ```
    I was thinking the EXACT same thing haha I was like what if this is the requirement to become some legendary secret class and we go full circle with Melka finally giving Velika her comeuppance like 100 chapters later.
    ```

- u/Watchful1:
  ```
  Taking bets who which named characters inside the barrier are still alive. Rain, Carten, probably the new adventurers who were in the lair, Val. I would guess she kills all the watch and guild. I really hope the Majistraal artifact has some offensive power to deal with the empire outside.
  ```

  - u/bigbysemotivefinger:
    ```
    I'm still curious what the hell Westbridge's game was putting a psychopath like her in charge of literally anything. Does he just want her and this city to mutually burn each other down or what?
    ```

    - u/BoojumG:
      ```
      My best guess is that he wanted someone else to be Citizen Fel Sadanis and set Velika up for failure so that she'd have to be replaced.

      EDIT: Seems more complex than that. From chapter 74:

      >“You still think it’s a good idea? Trapping her in there all alone?”

      >Westbridge looked at the gray-haired Citizen placidly, considering his response. Citizen Jarro was an archer, a real mage-killer as he recalled. The man had been in the Guild, though, so that meant he had mostly hunted monsters, not men. There was no sign of that past now. He wasn’t even carrying a weapon, the burdens of leadership leaving his face lined and weary. As worn as the old archer looked, Westbridge had to admit that the man did know how to run a city. The common folk loved him, even if he was unpopular with the other Citizens.

      >**“We cannot trust her yet,” Westbridge said finally. “If she survives the month, I will return and allow her access through the barrier.** Until then, Fel Sadanis will remain completely sealed to everyone.”

      >Jarro grinned. “What if you die before that? Who’ll lower the barrier? What are you, like a hundred?”

      >Westbridge snorted. “You are one to talk,” he said mildly. Jarro had already been old when he’d joined the DKE, and that had been years ago. “The barrier will remain, even should I die. Theoretically, someone could access the barrier stone to lower it, but there is no one within that bubble with the necessary skill to operate the artifact. It takes a true mage. Either way, it is a pointless discussion. I am not going to die. **The objective has been accomplished. Whether Velika succeeds or fails in her duty, it matters not.** The city will remain sealed.”

      So he doesn't care whether she lives or dies. I don't know how he thinks he's going to avoid repercussions if she lives, or why exactly he wants to force her to try to manage totally alone for a month. Maybe it's about isolating her from some other plot for that month?
      ```

      - u/Se7enworlds:
        ```
        To be honest I think he's using the city as a roadblock against the Empire. Fel Sadanis probably would have eventually surrendered against the Adamant's overwhelming strength, but the citizens need to supply power to the barrier to lift it, so the have no way to surrender even if the Empire doesn't see it that way.

        Velika is just a suitable candidate who's mother politicked her way into the job and I think it's probably hard to find high level candidates who aren't raised to be psychopaths as they surround themselves with people who can't tell them no.
        ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Westbridge cares about exactly one thing: keeping the teleport platform in Fel Sadanis out of the hands of the Empire of Adamant.

        The rest of it is just a sideshow to his main goal. He had to get *someone* elected citizen in order to justify the way he intervened in the city, and it just so happened that Velika's aunt was pushing for her to be elevated. 

        He doesn't think Velika would make a good Citizen (because there was a good chance she'd literally do what she did in this chapter), but he was willing to ignore that in order to achieve the greater strategic goal of denying the teleport platform to his enemy without permanently destroying it.

        So Rain will learn it in three minutes, tops.
        ```

        - u/ulyssessword:
          ```
          He might have to get to level 25 first.  Westbridge has training and about three times as many levels (and two extra class advancements) compared to Rain.
          ```

          - u/kaukamieli:
            ```
            Well the situation is at hand and he is kinda all they have, so I feel it's obvious it's gonna be him and soon.
            ```

            - u/MilesSand:
              ```
              Or the month runs out. It's what, a third of the way in?
              ```

              - u/kaukamieli:
                ```
                After they do this fight, he is dragged to try at least. Unless he runs there mid fight if it looks bad enough. He is not going to get levels to get better anyway.

                Unless... was it that you'd get the blue monster thingy if you kill a "player"?
                ```

                - u/xachariah:
                  ```
                  The best info we've got is that a blue's "essence should transfer, as long as it’s been less than a day."   Presumably if it's been more than a month, the essence won't transfer or it's a very small chance.

                  Then again their understanding of essence is incomplete, since they're very worried about making sure everybody gets a hit in, when Rain managed to get his essence from a 0% contribution fight.  It's possible it still transfers (at a lower chance maybe?), but we don't have any indication that's the case.
                  ```

                  - u/CreationBlues:
                    ```
                    Keep in mind that dungeons have different contribution rules than PvE areas. His trick wouldn't have worked in a dungeon.
                    ```

                - u/IgonnaBe3:
                  ```
                  we dont know the whole mechanic. Some people say that if you kill a human thats level5 its the same way as if you had killed a monster of level5. We know that stats from killing a lair are transferable like that. So its somewhat safe to assume that the same goes for level.

                  Another theory i have seen is that it only works if you killed the person just after they killed a blue.

                  Personally i would prefer if killing a human would count the same as killing a monster, would just kinda make sense if its transferable
                  ```

                    Feels like it would be too easy. Everybody would just die when they sleep or are low when fighting in a party... :p

        And if Velika fucks up badly enough, Westbridge would probably gain some political clout. Maybe enough that he wouldn't be outvoted next time.

        Even if Velika succeeds, Westbridge has her over a barrel with the barrier controls.

        Seems like a win-win for him.
        ```

    - u/FireCire7:
      ```
      Exactly. IIRC, Westbridge was basically outvoted on putting her in charge. Not sure what the rest were thinking, but I think one of them might have been a family member (aunt or mom?). I think Westbridge just wants her dead and not get directly blamed for it. As far as the city goes, Westbridge probably thinks it’s better for it to be destroyed than in the hands of the empire.
      ```

      - u/xachariah:
        ```
        Velika's relative is her aunt, Citizen Kallias.

        I concur that Westbridge doesn't really care what happens to her.  I think he does care about the city though, if only to keep the barrier up.  It sounds like those relics can't/won't be destroyed, so a lone teleporter platform is just as bad as a city fully captured by the empire.  

        He expects to be back a month after and for it to survive, and frankly people might have already started to die en-mass if it weren't for Rain.
        ```

        - u/Gr_Cheese:
          ```
          I think it was mentioned that attempts to relocate teleporter platforms in the past have destroyed them. 

          The DKE was probably afraid that Fel-Sadanis wouldn't destroy its teleporter platform, for economic reasons, and just roll over for the Empire. 

          The Watch and Guild are technically neutral, so, really, who could have been in place in the city and motivated to destroy the platform? I'd argue nobody. Maybe a silver ranker in the Watch, but it would be to the detriment of the people they were trying to protect so that would be a bit of a hard sell without more information.
          ```

    - u/BaggyOz:
      ```
      Westbridge didn't put her in charge. The citizens as a collective did. He was just the one to take the city. It's pure politics in regard to who Citizen Sadanis is. Velika is first time a family has had two citizens and Westbridge would rather his own candidate be Citizen Sadanis. If he traps Velika and waits for her to make a mess of things he can get her replaced.
      ```

  - u/ironistkraken:
    ```
    Even with his high clarity can he use the artifact?  I could easily see him trying to use it, fail but not be mind scrabbled, and having to over a couple of weeks turn his ring states all to clarity and try again.
    ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I'm a patron so I've read ahead and I can answer this question.

    >!You are 100% correct about the specific individuals.  We aren't sure about the Guild yet.  There's a couple of ~~Guards~~ Watch left, the senior of whom is actually reasonable.  Also, Lord Rill is dead.  He was Velika's aristocrat 2IC and the only one with the skills, resources and desire to keep things running.!<
    ```

- u/xachariah:
  ```
  Well, there goes my hope they were going to go Delve.

  I liked Rain's talk with Velika.  He's still so bad at talking to people with power.  Every one of those conversations has him beaten him up, almost killed, or treated like a potential mass murderer.  I imagine it's his otherworlder instincts, and that anyone who'd grown up in this world would much more viscerally understand that people can kill you in a flash of anger.
  ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    They just delved. Where else would they go? There is just one dungeon. If they could just dig out another, why wouldn't every city do that?
    ```

- u/EsquilaxM:
  ```
  I'm a little bothered by these everything happens simultaneously and thus goes to shit cliche but not too bothered.
  It's just...rabdom chance that the watch attacked same moment as the city was? Unless higher up members allied with adamant there's no reason why this didn't happen a day earlier or later
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    The Empire of Admant probably has at least some spies inside the dome communicating outside; I'd guess the Empire got word that Velika would be occupied for a few hours, and decided that meant it's a good time to initiate their attack (just in case she has some way of defending the city or calling for help or something).
    ```

- u/GreatNortherner:
  ```
  Everything's  happening at once. The attack from outside, a rebellion on the inside, Rain had just agreed to work with the citizen. I'm looking forward to how he will navigate what's the come.
  ```

- u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
  ```
  Moral of the story: whenever you send a scout/sacrifice ahead through a doorway, you wait for the scout to come back to report that everything is clear before you walk through that doorway.
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    But what is their option if no scout reports back?
    ```

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      Leap out guns blazing instead of just strolling into an ambush.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        She didn't expect being attacked in her own fort.
        ```

        - u/ulyssessword:
          ```
          > She didn't expect...

          That's when they get you.  CONSTANT VIGILANCE!
          ```

          - u/panchoadrenalina:
            ```
            is not paranoia if they really are out to get you.
            ```

- u/ironistkraken:
  ```
  Welp there goes the citys ability to defend its self.
  ```
