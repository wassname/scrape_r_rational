## More books in the Mother of Learning universe?

### Post:

The universe MoL is set in has become one of my all time favourite fantasy settings, up there with that of the Malazan and the Stormlight Archive books.

I'm hoping the author continues developing the world with new stories after this one's over, does anyone know if he's said anything about it?

  The author has a blog where he expands on the world:

  I’ve been thinking of the MoL universe as a bog-standard D&D setting (with bog-standard D&D spells, even), with a body of lore worked out to **accommodate** the complete complement of standard D&D sourcebook—and even splatbook—assets (e.g. lizard folk, animal bonds, psionics, Perfect Spell feats, an 8th-level Wizard spell called *Gate*, etc.) rather than the standard approach of working out a setting and then selecting/modifying the sourcebook assets into a form that fit that setting (as seen in *Eberron*, *Ravenloft*, etc.) The standard approach is what it is because bog-standard D&D is tuned to be a fun (if campy) setting to *play games* in, but doesn’t particularly make for a good basis for narrative works like tie-in novels. The various D&D “settings” are built so that they *do* form a solid foundation for tie-in novels—but at the expense of some of the simulationist playability of “anything goes” base D&D.

  But that’s not to say it’s *impossible* to make anything-goes “splatbook soup” D&D into a coherent setting. MoL does it. It takes a lot of work, but it’s possible.

  Presumably, any other novel that has tried to “take the anything-goes simulationism-focused D&D setting seriously as a narrative setting” in this same manner would end up with a similar setting (other than the “time loop” part.) So:

  * Do any of the official (TSR/Wizards) D&D-branded novels do this? (I haven’t read any, but is my understanding that they don’t, since each one comes from one of those settings that modifies “sourcebook D&D” into a more self-consistent setting.)

  * Does any unofficial D&D-“inspired” (i.e. basically ripping off) novel/series do this? (I feel like this is more likely.)

  Sadly, I don’t think any novel/series that’s just “based on someone’s D&D campaign” would qualify, because those aren’t really based on “taking the source material *seriously*” in a self-consistent-narrative-setting sense, but rather upon playing a fun game and then recording the fun you had. Media like *Slayers* are based on D&D campaign after-action reports, so they look less like a self-consistent setting and more like campy pastiche—if you describe them in terms of historiography, they’re a murder-hobo’s gonzo-journalist subjective experience of the setting.

  (And *Worth the Candle* is essentially what you get when you try to play a game set in a world with a self-consistent setting and rules favouring narrative interest over game interest—and I kind of doubt that people tend to actually desire to play an RPG campaign that way for any length of time. Though, if /r/rational were interested, we could try...)

    If we're being precise, *Mother of Learning* is the standard D&D universe fused with fanon *Naruto*. The author has a previous story in that setting, and you can see some of the relics of that: shaping exercises vs. chakra control; the similarities between raw mana manipulation and raw chakra manipulation; and a few worldbuilding details that seem to be inspired by it, like bloodlines. If we're really stretching, we could draw a parallel between the primordials and the tailed beasts, but it's such a generic plot element that I'm not super confident about it. Obviously, that's not the only thing that *Mother of Learning* inspiration from, but it's definitely a component.

        [*Scorpion's Disciple*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5166693/1/Scorpion-s-Disciple). I haven't read it, because it's abandoned, but I've heard nothing but praise about it.

            It's generally well-known in Naruto fanfiction circles - especially back when it came out - for having an interesting premise and being the best out of a batch of Sasori-focused fanfiction. At that time Sasori was one of the more popular Akatsuki members because of the first arc of Shippuden. The officially translated Manga volumes of Shippuden dropped just three months before the first chapter of Scorpion's Disciple, so despite Sasori being the first to die, he was fresh in everyone's mind.

            But if you weren't tuned into Naruto at the time, or only started reading fanfiction 2-3 years after it was abandoned, you probably wouldn't have heard of it.

              It has some weirdness, like how the fuck can Naruto actually keep that training as secret. They are fighting with huge amount of dolls and surely it has to happen outside...

              man. I need more good naruto fanfics

              Stuff like that or Chiaroscuro.  
              Everyhting else (Time braid, wave arisen) seems lower quality.

              &#x200B;

              please give me some name!

                I've read a lot of Naruto fanfics in the past two or three years (in addition to HP, Worm, etc.).

                One of my favorite Naruto fanfics is [Hear the Silence](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896), which I highly recommend. It's an SI fic, but that really only used for perspective, and rapidly drops off after the first few chapters. There's a wide, detailed, amazingly done cast. It's before canon Naruto, and even then, it's clear that it's real life and more realistic than an anime could be. People die in it. It's the only Hurt/Comfort fic I've seen done well, and everything that happens makes a lot of sense. The plot progresses at just the right speed. It's actively updating.

                It's definitely my most favorite actively updating Naruto fic, that's for sure. (Vs amazing fics like Sanitize, which has very slow updates.)

                I'm the type of person whose favorite fic is MoL. But *everything* about Hear the Silence is amazing. (I like it more than Chiaroscuro, though that's pretty good too.)

                Please go read it. It's amazing.

                (At some point I really need to look through all the fics I've read and get some solid recommendations I can copy and paste. I type out similar recs for Hear the Silence way too much.)

    Sword of the Bright Lady is another example of a setting that is built to incorporate D&D mechanics and setting elements more or less directly and fairly organically.

      ```
      yep, even if it focuses on lower level and takes leveling mechanics more literaly.

    I really enjoy the wandering inn, evem though it starts slow and isnt in any way rational. However, its the nost realistic dnd inspired world Ive ever seen.
