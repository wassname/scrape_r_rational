Comedy is pretty good in this one.
I do not like how easily the invaders are wining though. You would think someone would shoot the nades mid air soon as they saw them, but that would require some sorta super targeting computer and a robotic precision tool to do, also a cool outfit. 

### Comments:

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  Oh dear. That's quite a last few sentences there. I pray Junkrat's observational skills suck.
  ```

  - u/NotACauldronAgent:
    ```
    Junkrat has many talents. He's survived in the Australian wasteland so has encountered ambush tactics before, presumably, but I imagine all that working around heavy explosives might not be the best on your inner ear.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      I moreso meant I hope the conclusions he drew about what he did were incorrect. Considering what I know of riptire in the game, I fear they're not. And that could spell major trouble.
      ```
