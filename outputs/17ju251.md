## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Last week, /u/GlueBoy [recommended](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/17el34d/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/k676ibp/) [A Young Girl's Game of Thrones](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-girls-game-of-thrones.1095557/) and I must say that I really enjoyed it as well. >!I especially enjoyed the perspective shift (and growing disillusionment) of the MC in her relationship with her mother Cersei.!< The ways in which Myrcella has had to overcome the inherent disadvantages of her position, and start to be taken seriously even though she is a pre-teen girl in a highly patriarchal society don't seem unjustified.

  >!I feel it was a missed chance when Myrcella was returning Bran to Lord Stark. I kind of think she should have said something to the effect of: "Lord Stark, though we are presently opposed, I shall never consider you and your family my enemy or the enemy of House Baratheon." But maybe that wouldn't have played well on either side, and possibly gotten Ned in trouble with Stannis, or herself in trouble with the Lannisters. Don't know.!<

  **Edit:** spelling

    The first half is great. Quality-wise it's almost the best Tanya fanfic I've seen so far, even. 

    But then there's this entire... "plot arc", let's call it, in which prot first becomes mostly passive reactor to events, and then there's this drawn-out excuse plot to set the scene that would allow her independence as a military commander.

    Some other problems for the story's second half: 

    * fighting for the throne for the Lannister faction didn't seem to me as a viable approach.
    * the whole >!managing to convince a bunch of people to follow her — including the entire Stormlands — felt like Mary-sue-ish wishful thinking to me. More than that, as a strategic plan it would still be an unstable house of cards even if were successful (e.g. she gives too much control to Geoffrey over her), so the Tanya-esque touch of intelligent decisions / solutions was not only lacking here but outright working in the opposite direction. !<
    * too many non-Tanya PoV chapters

    That all being said, its first half is still an excellent read, and if the entire story manages to get long enough and to get finished, even the problems of the currently-written 2nd half will largely become an asset.

    So, having gotten to the point of your larger spoiler block recently: 

    >!Myrcella didn't need to say that, because she knows that the act of returning Bran says it already. Taking that much of a conciliatory tone would have diluted the effect of the words she _did_ say, namely her attempts to sow discord among the Stannis loyalist leadership.!<
    ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    I find it unusual in the Tanya genre in that the only misunderstanding of competence is with Cercie and >!that Cercie's incompetence is eventually understood.!< Usually the comic relief comes from Tanya misunderstanding literally everyone and this isn't so much the case here.
    ```

    I skipped this one initially after finding the author's grammar skills a bit lacking at the start, but I picked it up again after last week's recommendation. He improves reasonably quickly and gets a proofreader 17 chapters in, after which I've got no complaints. I like the story a lot and I'm looking forward to more.
    ```

- u/CatInAPot:
  ```
  I've been loving [Godclads](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59663/godclads-monster-mceldritchcyberpunkprogression) recently, the story has really hit it's stride, highly recommended. Rather unique characters, interesting world, good development... most importantly the author is a writing machine and basically uploads daily.
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    I really like Godclads but sheesh, it's so intense. It's like reading Neuromancer for the first time and experiencing that constant state of future shock, but like _all the time_ and also it's magitech and __also__, there's like a hundred different magic systems all smooshed together into the same elevator and that elevator is heading straight to hell.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      I would agree with that and also add that the whole story is dense with invented jargon which you can mostly understand from context, but which usually doesn't get fully explained until 20+ chapters further on.

    [NSFW] *Swiss Arms* (Historical SI Gamer)

    Isekai'ed MC with gamer powers. MC starts out on his own, ends up building a fort in the middle of nowhere, people flock to him for protection, and he eventually creates a group that would become Switzerland. It's on QQ, but really it's SFW except for a single NSFW chapter.

    *Legends Never Die* (Ahistorical/CKIII Gamer)

    Basically a random viking gets CKIII skills. Starts out with a farm, then goes on raids, then gets his own warband.

      Did *Swiss Arms* start out on QQ? I’ve got a tab with it open on SB.
      ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        Yes, it was first posted on QQ, then re-posted on SB. The SB version is only  68K long (34 chapters) while the QQ version is 131K long (74 chapters).

        It starts out as a "Historical Gamer" story, but the Gamer elements are downplayed in later chapters. The protagonist is strong enough to defeat any individual enemy (or a group of enemies) single-handedly, so the focus shifts to kingdom building, societal uplift and diplomacy. Lots of diplomacy.

  [*Thy Good Neighbor*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/asoiaf-bloodborne-thy-good-neighbor.1027683/), a ASOIAF/Bloodborne crossover, is back with book 2. Book 1 was great, I'm expecting the second one will be as well.

  [*Chasing Sunlight*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/73475/chasing-sunlight) looks interesting. It reminds me a bit of *Underland*, or at least the setting does, and the first few chapters are pretty good.

  [*Shimmering Mist*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shimmering-mist-hatake-si-naruto.1094612/) is officially off the rails. >!Danzo is dead, and the Third Hokage has been given the boot.!< That was expected, but the MC >!was captured by Madara and turned into his next host!< wasn't (major spoilers in that last one).

  [Do You Like Scary Movies? (Worm/Scream)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ruks-unimaginatively-titled-worm-snippet-collection-now-with-more-killer-clowns.491638/page-203#post-96220502). For Worm fans, it's a two-parter parody of Scream that takes place at Winslow High, featuring Taylor & co.

  [*Closure*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20662244). An ASOIAF one-shot that gives a different interpretation on Lyanna motivations for running away with Rhaegar. Really interesting.

  >Has anyone ever noticed that everyone writes Lyanna the same way? Here's my attempt to buck that trend, give her different motivations, a different personality. And in case it wasn't obvious, I loathe Rhaegar/Lyanna, and so here's my futile defiance, spitting in the face of it. Rhaegar is a foolish, rather pathetic man who wanted so much to be important and ended up a total failure who only didn't cause the death of all his family because his enemies were so magnanimous, and Lyanna is a scheming brat in over her head who has so throughly alienated the only two people who still care about her that they only keep her alive as a kind of trophy, though I suppose she has a few admirable traits if you consider pushing a pseudo-feminist agenda to be more significant than treating other people with dignity and respect (as some people seem to).

  Anyone got more stuff like [March Hare](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/64926/march-hare-a-pokemon-fanfiction)? I know Pokémon fanfics are a dime a dozen, but this one ticks some important boxes for me.

  A Pokémon lead character. Complex relationships with the human characters that make an effort to avoid the "trainer and their Pokémon" dynamic (though that isn't a deal breaker for me). Complex relationships with other Pokémon. Main character is clearly motivated, with big ideas, and is somewhat introspective. 

  Probably more things I liked as well and am just not remembering. Anyway, I highly recommend this story (though I'm not quite sure it counts as rational)- but the big problem is that it's on hiatus. The author recently left a comment on the latest chapter saying they still intend to get back to it, but in the meantime, I'm left high and dry. 

  I've already read/tried reading [An Electric Tail](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/an-electric-tail-pikachu-quest.88110/), [Pokemon Trainer Vicky](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pokemon-trainer-vicky-pokemon-si.1028636/), [A Normal Journey](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/66575/a-normal-journey-pokemon-sioc), [Borne of Caution](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36950/borne-of-caution), [Borne of Desire](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46050/borne-of-desire), [The Origin of Species](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species), [Twisted Garden](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/74211/twisted-garden-pokemon-au), and [The Most Evil Trainer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-most-evil-trainer-pok%C3%A9mon-si.1054896/#post-88506633). 

  Of them, The Most Evil Trainer and Pokemon Trainer Vicky were probably my favorites, but both star humans. An Electric Tail is probably the best other than March Hare that stars a pokemon, but has made even less progress through it's plot, and it's hiatus seems less likely to break. The only story listed above that I *didn't* really like is Borne of Desire. Other than that, I recommend all of them.

  So anyway... send me all your pokemon fanfic recommendations. Especially if they have a pokemon main character, or are otherwise like March Hare.

    Fair warning that this is a self-rec and has a human protag. [Diplomatic Overture](https://archiveofourown.org/works/44099640/chapters/110885952) is a complete short story (~20k words) about geopolitics and diplomacy when pokemon and the resulting peculiar governments are involved. I hope it scratches the itch you're feeling, if only for a bit :)

    If you're into Sci-fi/Fantasy, Brandon Sanderson has a few series that are wrapping up:

    *Defiant* is Book 4 of *The Skyward Series*, and the final book, and is coming out next month.

    Sanderson also put out *The Lost Metal*. It a Mistborn novel, which is a generally well-received series, and the final book in the *Wax and Wayne* series.
