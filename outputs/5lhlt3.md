  ```
  So yes, they are meeting Daimen, yes they are not forgetting Silverlake. His plan, I think, involves Bakora gates and those spiders that somehow cracked their secret.

  And yes, nice evidence that RR must have been a skillful mage when he hijacked the loop, so, not Veyers.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Yeah, I'm betting on a Bakora gate. The relevant Web wanted all the crystallized mana he could spare, and was evasive about their gate. I'm guessing they basically pay for a single activation, a one-way ticket.
    ```

  - u/valeskas:
    ```
    > not Veyers

    Unless Veyers somehow struck a bargain with Panaxeth. And got Body Mark II With Bigger Brain or something.

    Also, as a minor thought, the Gate itself is suspiciously well suited to avoid interference from other planes of existance.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > struck a deal with Panaxeth

      Yeah, no. There is nothing anyone could conceivably offer that thing, even assuming it's sufficiently comprehensible to negotiate with. And if he knew a way to force it to do anything, he wouldn't have needed to spend time optimising the invasion; he would have been successful already.
      ```

      - u/valeskas:
        ```
        > nothing anyone could conceivably offer that thing

        Panaxeth probably wants an optimized invasion, so it can get out of prison reliably when time loop is over.
        ```

        - u/GodKiller999:
          ```
          It's quite clear that the invasion is extremely hard to beat, even when the invaders lose the element of surprise they still manage to summon him.
          ```

          - u/valeskas:
            ```
            > It's quite clear

            1) There is Zach, so alternative to optimized invasion is optimized city defense.

            2) There is a chance that angels are more efficient than demons.
            ```

  Cheeky simulacrums. I love it.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I empathized with the simulacrums. Past me has made some pretty tough New Year's resolutions that present me doesn't like much.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I reckon he should treat his simulacra more like equals. In personality and intelligence, after all, they're almost the same as him. Maybe, rather than assuming he's the master, they should negotiate tasks more. But I guess that wouldn't help Simulacrum 2, since the whole point of going to class was to test the disguise, so the original couldn't take that job. And for life-threatening tasks like baiting the spider, original!Zorian is harder to replace.

      He could, at least, before creating a batch of simulacra, roll dice to decide which task each Zorian will have (including, when feasible, the original). Then they wouldn't have to wonder, Why did I get the boring job?

      And maybe they could have social events! Team-building! He doesn't like chess, but maybe he'd enjoy a party where everyone is him. Or a football match.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I was actually thinking if he uses the simulcrum to probe the minds of those people whom Xvim had mentioned in the list, since he restraining himself to do so.  But then again it comes with a considerable amount of risks if the simulcrum differs too much.
        ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          But why would his simulacrum be willing to do that
          ```

          - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
            ```
            Because one of his current major reasons against mind-probing non-criminals is that the very acts themselves will gradually change his moral principles and thought patterns (e.g. “I don’t like how that guy’s staring at me. → I should put a compulsion on him to go sit elsewhere.” or “I don’t know if my allies are still loyal to me. → I should [check the last 72 hours of their personal experiences](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wGczRx1Bd8) without warning them just to be sure.”).

            With simulacrums that only live <24 hours, gradual changes like this aren’t a concern. But as ani_12 said, if they see [something](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation) [really](https://i.imgur.com/2AXGtZfg.jpg) [nasty](http://www.scp-wiki.net/system:page-tags/tag/mind-affecting) inside the target’s mind, they could turn on Zorian!prime without him even realising quickly enough what’s happening.
            ```

            - u/RMcD94:
              ```
              But you would you'd just have make a simulacrum to make the compulsion on him
              ```

              - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
                ```
                If you mean you’d still be affected by the act of mind-wiping even if you used your clone as a proxy instrument, then I don’t agree. If you use a clone, you are shielding yourself from the the more “visceral” parts of the experience. 

                It’s like if you had to kill a person for some reason. It would’ve been much easier if all you had to do was decide that they have to be killed and they just died — you wouldn’t have nightmares about it, your human psyche wouldn’t have to re-align itself around this new important experience, etc. 

                It would still change you, but not as much on an unconscious level as the first-hand experience would.
                ```

                - u/RMcD94:
                  ```
                  No I'm saying that if you accept that doing something immoral makes you more likely to do something immoral, then using a proxy to commit that immoral deed just means that you're more likely to use a proxy to do something immoral.

                  The mental repercussions are a separate thing entirely, but I don't think it's important considering how many people's he has mindraped before who really though no fault of their own are on the side against him. It's not like all criminals are inherently evil.

                  Regardless if we simplify it to killing people ever, using a gun to kill people instead of your hands, doesn't mean you will kill people less (which is what I think he's worried about).
                  ```

                  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
                    ```
                    > I don't think it's important considering how many people's he has mindraped before who really though no fault of their own are on the side against him. It's not like all criminals are inherently evil.

                    It’s not about his targets being “inherently evil”, it’s about setting at least some kind of boundaries in his mind regarding who can be an acceptable target (e.g. eldritch entity summoners, their goons, their support network, etc) and who can not. Friend-or-foe differentiation is usually very important in matters like this for people, especially during wartime when soldiers have to kill or torture their enemies. For instance, even members of Unit 731 had to be trained to double-think around their victims being humans and think of them as wooden logs.

                    >if you accept that doing something immoral makes you more likely to do something immoral, then using a proxy to commit that immoral deed just means that you're more likely to use a proxy to do something immoral.

                    I agree with that, but only partially. What I was trying to point out in [my original comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5lhlt3/rt_mother_of_learning_chapter_63/dbx0hre/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=rational) was that immoral actions are not all grouped together in a single homogeneous bundle, and that if a person is ready to make immoral choice A then it doesn’t automatically mean that they’re also read to make *any* immoral choice at all.

                    Let’s assume there’re two versions of Zorian: one who’s ok with mind-probing non-criminals personally, and another who’s ok with doing that through a proxy clone. 

                    The first one mind-probes people day after day, and gradually starts to realign his morality principles in an even more drastic manner so that all his personal experiences of what he considers mind-probing of innocent people wouldn’t paint him as some kind of a monster in his own eyes. Eventually, this Zorian!A’s moral compass will change so much that he’ll not only be ok with mind-probing them, but also with mind-torturing them, mind-torturing their families for leverage, etc. And each immoral choice that’s one step harder will warp his morality principles even more. 

                    The second one, on the other hand, will know that he’s mind-probing people, but since this knowledge is more of the academic variety because he himself has none of the first-hand “personality-contaminating” experience, through time he’ll stay on the same level of only being ready to mind-probe non-criminals when there’s a very dire need for that. He *may* decide to make some harder immoral choices, but those decisions won’t be affected by his deteriorating moral principles as much as it would’ve been the case with Zorian!A.

                    *p.s. This all is of course only my current opinion. Also, this is likely my last comment in this comment chain. Thanks for the discussion!*

        He could also do collaborative activites as a team of simulacra, work with himslef to brainstorm plans, design spell formulae etc.

      Yeah, my first thought when reading Silverlake essentially trained the spider was, why not just find a different one then? It might be worth an investment of time to find another, younger and less experienced Grey Hunter that would be easier to subdue, after all there's no reason it has to be that particular one. Though if they're as rare as the author says, might not be possible.
      ```

      - u/Saffrin-chan:
        ```
        They're really rare, and you *also* have to find one with an egg sack, so they probably won't be able to find another one.

          It would be neat if they eventually decided to raise some of this grey hunter mother’s hatchlings in some natural reserve in the real timeline to preserve her species. The species is dangerous, but also a goldmine of magical research material.

    ```
    There must be ways they can do this. Maybe they should attack it in its lair, negating its mobility. If Zorian can cover the entrance with a gate leading to a trap, they could then bombard it through the gate... Potion grenades maybe?

    Or drop the trap right over the hole so it can't get past without touching it, and if it holds back, start psychically digging through its magic resistance.

    Or make a simulacrum army and overwhelm its magic resistance with psychic brute force.

    Or provoke it into jumping and catch it in the air. Once it's already off the ground, it will have a harder time dodging. Can they make a frictionless hemisphere of force for it to land in?

      ```
      If they could teleport it (it and the whole cave using a metric ton of mana crystals ) they could solve so many issues, just think lich vs spider or treasury vs spider or giant undead dragon vs spider

    Hmm, with all the dodging, I think they need to cast more Wall spells.
    Like wall of fire to herd it into a trap. Can't dodge a whole plane of attack.
    Box it in, then cast a non-lethal spell, so that if it dodges, it'll dodge INTO the lethal wall of fire.

    EDIT: IMO, 1st, put a ceiling to things. Horizontal Wall of Fire, just right above human height. Can't jump well without headspace. Heck, just Maze the whole battleground.

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  So, I've been thinking about how Zorian could better abuse the simulacrum and this chapter completed an idea. Zorian has been musing about enhancement rituals and the author stated that many of those straight up copy magical abilities from magical creatures. So, Zorian should figure a way to copy the cranium rats' hive mind ability (which is a kind of mind magic, so it should mesh well with his natural ability) then figure how to make the mental connection through his soul (or just use relays if that's not feasible) and voila, hive mind Zorian and his simulacra. That'd be interesting.

    It would be interesting to see how that spell would effect his sense of self.
    ```

  - u/cretan_bull:
    ```
    I have another idea for simulacrum abuse.

    Simulacra share Zorian's mana supply. If simulacra were to do the mana-regeneration meditation procedure near the Cyoria well they should be able to regenerate Zorian's mana in parallel.

    We have not yet seen any range limitation on maintaining the simulacra, or a numerical limit on the number he could maintain at once.

    The apparent lack of a range limitation should allow Zorian to effectively bypass the constraints on mana use when far away from a mana well.

    As Zorian can maintain a number of simulacra simultaneously while being principally concerned with their use of mana-intensive spells rather than any sort of constant mana draw, and on the other hand Zorian can regenerate his entire mana reserves in a matter of minutes when near the Cyoria well, maintaining such simulacra should provide Zorian with far more mana than they consume.

    This idea may not work as well if mana regeneration is principally limited by the ability of the soul to assimilate mana. In which case Zorian should still see substantial benefits from having a single simulacrum dedicated to mana regeneration, however he would not see additional benefits from having more.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Already discussed in a previous chapter thread, and resolved by the author. Yes, it sort of works: you could assign a simulacrum to sit cross-legged and assimilate mana, which would max out your assimilation rate, provided it didn't get too bored and wander off. However, your soul is the bottleneck; adding extras doesn't give any further benefit.
      ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      I think you seem to be missing a large problem: you can't really force a simulacrum to do anything.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Actually, the politics of the mana assimilation plan don't seem so bad. If a simulacrum doesn't want the boring job, then Original!Zorian can do it, and send the simulacrum on the mana-consuming job instead. And besides, whenever their mana reserves are full, they can tap each other's senses. Not such a terrible assignment really.
        ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        If the simulacrum is in Cyoria, it would have access to books, building materials, research notes, Kael, Kirielle, Xvim, etc. I'm sure it'd have no issue with spending a restart hanging out, giving Zorian a guaranteed max regeneration rate. The main issue is that Zorian hasn't been keeping any simulacra alive for more than a day, but it may be worthwhile to break the rule for this purpose.
        ```

- u/megazver:
  ```
  The simulacrum shenanigans and how quickly they've been shown to begin to diverge from the creator's best interests struck me as more material for the "Red Robe is a rogue simulacrum of Zach's" theory. 

  Other than that, I don't see extensive use of simulacra any less ethically challenging than marking people to retain memories in-between reboots. I'd like to see them explore the latter (and the other marker abilities) in future chapters.
  ```

  - u/Krossfireo:
    ```
    Do simulacra maintain themselves over resets? I guess Zach could be brainwashed by his simulacra to maintain the memory of it (memory packets) and then create the simulacra as soon as the loop begins.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I'm pretty sure a simulacrum would not survive the restart.

      The Gate recreates the entire physical world according to the template, then anchors the Controller's soul into the appropriate body. And the template does not include an ectoplasmic shell.
      ```

      - u/DerSaidin:
        ```
        Yeah, this. Both Zach and RR survive loop, which requires a soul. Simulacra do not have a soul.

        Could it be possible to give a simulacrum a soul? Maybe. But Occam's Razor says RR is not a Zach simulacrum with its own soul.
        ```

    - u/megazver:
      ```
      Well... We don't know the rules yet. Maybe Zach's simulacra actually share his marker, somehow. Maybe Zach actually knew a lot more about the markers and soul magic before his memory wipe, since he had one in the first place. Maybe it's the (very inventive) mechanism you've described.

      Or maybe simulacra do just maintain themselves over resets. They're weird-ass soul magic, who knows how weird-ass soul magic interacts with the weird-ass soul magic of resets? I suspect we'll see what happens when a simulacrum is active during the reset soon enough. Then, if they do, it probably took over Veyers' body, like people speculated in the previous chapter's discussion and off it went.

      Let's face it, the magic system in this story has new shit added to it every chapter and we could get new information that disproves this, then makes it possible again, then disproves it again several times over. But Zach's simulacrum just feels right to me from a storytelling perspective. It's very elegant.
      ```

        No? If anything the magic system has been extremely consistent, it's how we can figure out later plot points from explanations that were given in early chapters.
        ```

        - u/megazver:
          ```
          Consistent with what has previously been added, yes. But he does add exciting new areas of magical expertise quite often.
          ```

          - u/GodKiller999:
            ```
            But those aren't haphazardly added for plot reasons, it's quite obvious that they existed before we ever heard about them by the way they neatly fit with the rest of the magic system.
            ```

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        Except that Zach had no awareness whatsoever of his soul. No defenses whatsoever. It just seems to me like there would be some signs visible to someone with soul sight (like Alanic) if he ever had the kind of soul magic expertise necessary to create a simulacra.

        But then again, who knows. The author could choose to go that route regardless of what we currently know of how soul magic or the simulacrum spell works, or regardless of however I interpreted his writing.

        - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
          ```
          I completely agree. After the previous chapter, I argued that it's implausible for even a skilled soul/mind mage to completely erase a trained "skill" of Zach's: soul-sense. We know the soul grows with training, like muscles, and, especially after what we learned in this chapter about how trigger-happy the marker is, I find it highly doubtful that anyone could have altered his mind and soul enough to have completely removed his knowledge of and ability to control his marker AND set him back to square one when he tries to re-train it. 

          I still think the most logical conclusion here is that Zach never knew what was going on to begin with when the loops started.

            Is it possible that someone else could have cast Simulacrum *for* Zach?

        - u/megazver:
          ```
          I don't think that's the case either. I just listed it as remotely plausible, based on what we've been given so far.

          I suspect it'll be something we haven't even been told about yet.

        Zorian's been using simulacra for eight restarts so far; they don't seem to maintain themselves.

        The memory packets theory is definitely possible. It's possible that Zach had been trained in a lot of things pre-timeloop. There is one major flaw:

        Even Zorian would have a difficult time overwriting a person's life story that much. If Zach had been skilled enough to cast simulacrum, to have (novice or intermediate-level) unstructured mind shaping abilities like RR exhibited, etc., I don't think RR could have successfully purged that much information.

        Plus, it is unlike Zach to have the patience or temperament to undergo that level of training, then hide it from his peers to pretend to be untalented in school. All that mastery would have required a few years of training.

        It's still possible I suppose, but I find it really unlikely. Veyers also feels unlikely considering his volatile temperament, but we shall see. :D

          So far he has been reabsorbing them at the end of each day. I doubt he ever tried to keep one up during a reset. 

          And I doubt Zach forgot that much, yes. I don't think that's the solution, I just listed it as remotely plausible.

          I suspect if the theory is true, the "how" might not have even been introduced to us yet.

            Good point. He should maintain a simulacrum specifically at the time where restart occurs.

            > "How" might not have even been introduced to us yet.

            I hope we'll find out soon! But I don't think that's likely . . .

  I forget if I already mentioned this in previous threads, but Kael's coin has (temporarily) defeated Quatach-Ichl before, and Zorian was able to fool him into touching it. It probably works by making his lich defenses think he's undergoing a serious soul attack and severing the simulacrum automatically, but regardless, it's worth a try next time they fight him.

  That devious Silverlake. She'd better have some amazing knowledge.

  - u/Krossfireo:

      He hasn't used it because it has to touch the lich, and Zorian normally meets him with shields up.

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            Yeah, they probably need to design an anti-lich rifle. Something with a big caliber so that all spell formula needed to sewer his soul from his body can be put on a bullet, and then something else to insure it would pierce all his shields. No matter how strong those are, there has to be a limit-and if Z&Z were to convert all the mana crystals they can gather in a month into one incredibly powerful attack...
            ```

            - u/TimTravel:

              ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          At the time it was a desperation move from Zorian. He was about to get some firsthand experience in lich soul magic, so he went for it and it worked because he was not percieved as a threat by the lich. He has no way of repeating that.
          ```

    - u/nobody103:
      ```
      As the people below said, it only worked because of very specific circumstances. He wasn't *hit* by the coin - he deliberately caught it in his hand. In a normal encounter, Quatach-Ichl would treat any object thrown at him, no matter how innocuous, as an attack.
      ```

  - u/nobody103:
    ```
    >It probably works by making his lich defenses think he's undergoing a serious soul attack and severing the simulacrum automatically.

    Less 'severing the simulacrum' and more 'pulling the soul back to the phylactery', but yes, that is how it works.  

    Edit: Although a lich's body could be thought of as a kind of simulacrum, so maybe you're right. Hmm...

- u/cathemeralman:
  ```
  I have a theory for how Zorian might pull off transcontinental travel (besides Bakora gates).

  If Zorian's simulacrum goes to another continent and then gives him the memories of the place, does Zorian gain the ability to teleport there? That way he wouldn't have to waste a restart traveling. The only problem is the simulacrum would have to remain active for longer than a day to do this (unless Zorian has the simulacra teleport back, dispel, and then teleport back out on a day-to-day basis).
  ```

  - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
    ```
    > unless Zorian has the simulacra teleport back, dispel, and then teleport back out on a day-to-day basis

    Which is impossible if taking a boat or train. I may have to consult the world map again to see if that's necessary, since I had the same thought originally.

        ```

        - u/melmonella:
          ```
          They could stop the ship for the time they need to teleport there and back.
          ```

          - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
            ```
            /u/Bighomer had it right. I was assuming a commercial ship I guess, where they wouldn't have the authority to request the ship to stop once a day. I guess a private charter might be possible with the money they have, so it's not totally infeasible. 

            But there's still the distance limitation of teleportation to consider. The Bakora gates exist for a reason, after all. As far as I understand the magic system, teleporting 1 mile takes more mana than teleporting half a mile twice to reach the same destination.
            ```

          - u/Cheese_Ninja:
            ```
            Any series with teleports I start wondering about how it is affected by teleporting to/from a moving object, especially since the planet itself and everything on it is moving at different rates depending on latitude. 

            I feel like until the author makes a statement about it directly, teleporting to/from a moving vehicle is always an option. I can't remember if this has ever been addressed in the story.

            I also wonder about what happens to pre-existing matter in the location being teleported to, but that's not the question at the moment.

            The main issue here is that the basic teleport spell has a range limitation. It's not a big deal since we've almost always seen the characters stay in Eldemar: http://dodo-ptica.deviantart.com/art/Altazia-s-Central-Valley-525095257

            Last chapter was the farthest we've actually seen them go away from here, but we don't know if they were able to teleport directly or if they had to make multiple jumps:
            >In the Ishekatara Sea – the southern sea enclosed by the two 'prongs' of the Altazian continent – there was a pirate ship.

            Koth (Daimen) and Bianyrre are other continents entirely.

            The aranea colony with the Bakora Gate seems like the most likely route for Zach and Zorian.

            Other possibilities involve teleportation and Gate spell variants, or even an established teleportation route across the ocean using islands/boats?. I think there's sufficient reason to have a much faster transoceanic route available for information/small goods/small groups of people, that would be prohibitively expensive for individuals to utilize for themselves.  This chapter seems to argue against that because if it did exist Zach should have brought it up as an option, unless it's illicit knowledge that Zorian gained on his own.

    Why not just morph into an Eagle and fly there?

    - u/nobody103:
      ```
      Out of pure curiosity, I did some quick research on this. 

      Peregrine falcons are one of the fastest flyers in the world. Their speed in level fight is about 65 to 100 km/h. Assuming the maximum is probably unreasonable so let's say they can fly at about 80 km/h normally. Assuming 10 hours a day spent in flight, that's a travel distance of 800 km per day. 

      But wait! Peregrine falcons are migratory birds ('peregrine' means 'wanderer') and while finding information about their migration speeds is surprisingly difficult, the internet is telling me that some individuals travel as much as 480 km per day. This is considered very impressive. Although it's possible that peregrine falcons are just being conservative with their energy, I'm going to assume they have good reasons for traveling at that speed. Let's round this to 500 km per day for easier calculation.

      I have not thought too deeply about actual numerical distances in my world, but I consider the planet on which the story is happening to be the same size at earth. Since Altazia is temperate, and Koth is equatorial, that's roughly the distance between Northern Europe and Central Africa. Web calculators tell me that the distance between Copenhagen and Kinshasa is 6678 km. Since I assume actual peregrine falcons are way better navigators than shapeshifted humans, let's round that up to 7000 km. 

      7000 divided by 500 is 14, so the best case scenario says Zach and Zorian would need 14 days to fly to Koth as birds. Not unworkable. However, spending half of the restart traveling is clearly quite suboptimal. Not to mention that reality is unlikely to be ideal, and that they would likely encounter unfamiliar complication the first few times they tried that.

  [Quotation marks.](http://i.imgur.com/da4y8Oj.png?1)

  Ellipses generally have a space on both sides, although when a sentence ends with an ellipsis, you don’t have one after it. E.g.:

  >“I see,” I said. “Um. What are you doing here?”

  >“I am your batman.”

  >“My . . .”

  >“Not the notional hero,” Sith said, a bit of a growl in his voice. “Your batman. Your orderly.”

  >“Orderly . . .” I frowned. “Wait. You work for me?”

  http://practicaltypography.com/ellipses.html

  Notably, *CMOS* dictates an ellipsis that has a space between the periods themselves rather than supporting the preformatted glyph which you use (Word AutoCorrect).

  [Phrasal adjectives.](http://imgur.com/a/f59Jq)

  Oh, and em dashes are the preferred option in AmE publishing—no space on either side. AmE also uses it to show interrupted text, whether internal thoughts or dialogue.

  >“I know exactly what role she has in mind for me, Sir Knight. I am to”—her mouth twisted—“be at your convenience.”

  >Did you ever read any Spider-Man comics when you were—”

  Found out you were going to edit the entire story and sell it as a book—here’s some useful advice for starting out.

  On a side note, [*forwards*](http://i.imgur.com/lqUz2TJ.png?1) is generally not used in AmE.

  I trust the regulars are already penning down the typos, so I’ll leave that to them.

    I've never seen ellipses separated in any book or newspaper.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      CMOS asks for the ellipsis to be separated by spaces because the pre-formatted ellipsis glyph may show up as another character depending on platform. They prefer writers to use . . ., then an editor can do a search-replace on the document, replacing all . . . with three periods surrounded by two non-breaking spaces.

      In reality, this is not considered the best way to make an ellipse by many typographers, who believe that an ellipse should be three dots separated by *thinspaces*. To not have spaces makes it feel to scrunched together, but it doesn't look as crazily wide as . . . either.

      >For manuscripts, inserting an ellipsis character is a workable method, but it is not our preferred method. It is easy enough for a publisher to search for this unique character and replace it with the recommended three periods plus two nonbreaking spaces (. . .). But in addition to this extra step, there is also the potential for character-mapping problems (the ellipsis could appear as some other character) across software platforms—an added inconvenience. So type three spaced dots, like this . . . or, at the end of a grammatical sentence, like this. . . . If you know how, use two nonbreaking spaces to keep the three dots—or the last three of four—from breaking across a line.

  What exactly is the limitation on teleportation in this setting? Zorian is able to go anywhere in the country it seems, so long distances isn't it.  If he's limited by only being able to teleport to places that he's already been before, then he could make the trip to the other continent in stages across restarts.  Better yet, pay someone to teleport the two of them.
  ```

  - u/Tur4:
    ```
    I was thinking about this.  It should be easy to find someone to take them there thats been there before if the only issue is that neither of them have been to koth.  But because they haven't done that there must be something else at issue.  Otherwise Daimon, a avery skilled wizard who clearly knows how to teleport would be coming back frequently from koth to visit or whatever but it sounds like he hasn't been back in some time in the story.

    My only thought is there might be a distance limit to teleporting and since its across an ocean there are not relay locations to teleport in between.  This is backed up by the discussion regarding how it would be hard to teleport an entire army under the town from a great distance, then they found those gates that solved the problem.  

    My own theory to how he gets to koth is that he gave his mom an anchor stone to take to  Koth that way he could teleport to that.  That said, a Bakora gate would also solve the problem though we  haven't seen any evidence he has figured those out.  But we do know he knows how to make teleport anchor stones.

Even if Quatach-Ichl is the best mass teleporter in the whole damn world, the mana costs for such long jumps would be completely impractical on that scale.]

    I think that's because Simulacrum #1 was the first one created that day since Zorian wants to wipe them daily. The ones which came before him probably caused Neolu to diverge.
    ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    It seems Zorian has been using a simulacrum to attend class for at least a few days if not longer. It's likely a previous simulacrum noticed Neolu's interest and decided to mix things up on the off-chance that Zorian has to deal with the aftermath. It's harmless enough and will annoy Zorian enough that the troll that lives in Zorian and all his copies can't resist. ;)
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      It isn't 100% harmless, and I suspect it may have minor ramifications.

      If you have N divergent copies of yourself each revealing slightly different information to somebody as a joke, there's no guarantee those N bits of (mis)information won't allow the target to figure out something true.

      This simulacrum made a joke about having a time machine. If the next makes a joke about actually being 100 years old, it provides a clearer picture for Neolu. And since none of them are telling Zorian-prime, none of the simulacra know whether they've collectively crossed a line.

      To put it another way, if 100 witnesses each tell a fraction of the truth with no coordination, it will be possible to extract a much more accurate answer than any one witness revealed. Even if they've all got a motive to be deceitful, they'll all tell their fragment of truth in a slightly different way.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Well, there's no chance of accumulating 100 witnesses in this case, of course.

        And really, even if she figures it out - meh. They can ignore her, or recruit her. Still harmless.
        ```

      - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
        ```
        >Well… he wasn't the first simulacrum that was sent on this mission. And apparently one of the previous simulacrums was similarly bored out of his skull here and decided to go off the script and befriend her. And then never bothered to inform the original about it. Simulacrum number two didn't intend to inform the original either. The whole thing was harmless and imagining the original's reaction when he finally found out was kind of amusing.

        I think Zorian is demonstrating some minor IdiotBall \ blunder-level behaviour regarding his management of the clones. Even after that grey spider clone sent him feedback on how quickly and dramatically clones’ thought patterns can diverge from the original, Zorian still didn’t establish some system of check-up and “quality control” on the clones’ experiences and thoughts before dismissing them. 

        He just arbitrarily decided that <24h lifespan should be safe enough and went with it.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          I think doing a factory reset every 24 hours is probably sufficient quality control, but I do wish he treated his simulacra more like his equals instead of his servants. It's all very well for the original to be excited about sending someone *else* to be torn apart by the murder-spider, but he needs to remember that simulacra won't like doing anything that he would dislike doing *himself*.

          Which is not to say that he should stop sending them on potentially lethal or boring missions. The ability to copy himself is just too valuable to pass up. But a little more consideration and sympathy might go a long way.

          Consider: it was entirely foreseeable that when actually faced with the expectation of being torn apart by a super-spider, he would be scared. So he could have planned ways to mitigate that. Real-time memory uploads and a promise to promptly re-cast the spell afterward. Or letting it do something fun first, so it resented its existence less. Or planning a big victory party, so it feels like there's something worth being dispelled for, something to achieve. After all, these are copies of himself; it makes sense to care about their happiness.
          ```

      - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
        ```
        I agree with you on this, but I think the effect is mitigated. Each "witness" is a copy of Zorian Prime from that morning. Zorian is pretty discrete and private, so his simulacra shouldn't get too crazy with things. Things might spiral out of control a little, but it's only a month until the slate's wiped clean.

        Plus, Zorian knows that Zach has convinced Neolu that he's a time-traveler in the past and she was chill about it. That's probably why Simulacrum!Zorian is comfortable trolling Prime!Zorian with Neolu.

  So, we know that one part of the Key is held by our undead supermage friend, one part is somewhere within a ridiculously well-defended encampment filled with traps and with a small army of battlemages on short dial (aka treasury), one is somewhere deep within the Xlotic desert, one is located within Koth jungles and finally one is on Blantyrre. Here is what I think:

  * Crown will probably be either the last or the first part of the Key they will collect in the final restart. Collecting it first would involve first spying on QI, finding out where he is certainly located at a set time, and then catching him off-quard while he doesn't have his stack of buffs (haste, all his shields, likely perception magic, contingency teleportation, etc) up. This is best done as early in the restart as possible, to maximise the element of surprise (as invasion draws near QI will likely grow more and more paranoid). On the other hand, collecting it last would probably probably involve defeating QI during the invasion, if finding him before that point proves troublesome. Now, I can't guess how that would work, but I imagine it would involve a really big magical cannon that would be able to launch a projectile with similar properties to that coin Kael developed. It would have to be big because that projectile would have to be moving fast enough that QI wouldn't be able to dodge, and magical enough that it would break straight through all his shields.

  * Taking dagger might be attempted in two different ways. One way to do that is to go at it all stealthy-like, sneak into the treasury and nib it without triggering the alarms. Personally, I don't think that is very likely, as the treasury seems incredibly well-defended. Alternatively, they could break through with brutal force, and then it should probably be the last part of the Key to get-as we have seen, otherwise local military won't let them do anything for the rest of the restart.

  * We obviously don't know anything about the other parts of the key, but I think that the one on Koth will involve Damien, one in Xlotic will involve those wasp-creatures nobody103 wrote about on his worldbuilding blog, and finally one on Blantyrre will be in the hands of the lizardpeople. Personally, I don't see "you need to search a whole desert to find it" as much of an obstacle to them, since they could probably use a combination of simulacra and polymorph potions to swiftly search for it. Turn into an eagle->fly around triggering the key-searching part of the marker once every couple seconds->do that with 10 simulacra simultaneously and you can cover a whole lot of ground in a day. For example, Homing Racing Pigeons have horisontal flight speed of 177 km/h, or about 50m/s. Assuming marker can ping the key from 200 meters away, that's 20 000 square meters covered per second. I think that with the use of magical drugs and potions you should be able to make them fly for 16 hours a day, for a total of about a billion square meters covered in a day. You could cover something the size of sahara desert pretty quickly like that.

  So, what's the timing involved in the pipeline for a simalcrum memory packet? Ex: If a simalcrum sends over a full day's memories, how long does it take to a) make the memory packet b) send the packet c) for ZorianPrime to absorb the packet?

  It does seem like Zorian is using them to good effect (clone per job!), but I'm still curious as to what the improvement ratio ends up being.

  Hi, there. I'm new to this series. I've just had a huge binge read of Mother of Learning. It's great. I'm going to have to read it all again from the start. There's so much.

  The simulacrum perspective is really good stuff as it picks up on Zorian's questionable status as a copy. Nice that this is being explored, and I like that it's adding a new PoV. Potential for extra runtime and replace his need for Black Rooms.

  Nice that there are so many body/soul options that could all be possible escape exits from the Sovereign Gate. I have a hunch that Lich and Mayor Necromancer could become allies, or at least tools, for the duo's exit. This is tipped off by Red Robe's quick escape, and I think they may have to reconstruct RR pathway to get out.

  Still wondering if/when the story will circle back on the soul alteration that started this story. This is so mysterious to me as the story has established that Shifters get benefits from having animal souls within them and inherit special abilities from that infusion. Did Zach get something from Zorian? Such as an improved his Shaping ability? Did Zorian get more that the Marker? 

  Speculation: If Zack carried Zorian's soul outside of the Gate with him, he has enough mana to manifest Zorian in a simulacrum. Don't know if the magic system supports this sort of thing. I'd like to see more Zorian's internal conflict over having to "kill" his true self played out in his simulacrums. 

  I miss those damn cute spiders.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    There's no indication of Zach or Zorian picking up anything except the marker, but it would be hard to tell. Zorian's mana reserves might well grow a little bit more than he'd expect, but he doesn't have any precise way to measure that, since his magic missiles are way more efficient than when he started measuring.

    The author has confirmed on his [blog]( https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/golems-and-undead/#comments) that you could make a simulacrum of someone else, but you would need soul sight, not just personal soul awareness.

    Of course the lich will become a tool of escape - or, at least, they'll take such a tool off his head. To actually recruit him, though, would unbalance the story. If he said to pack up and go home, or to massacre the cultists before they complete the ritual, the Ibasans would do it.

    Sudomir also isn't likely to become an ally, but they will probably take the opportunity to disrupt the invaders' preparation by toppling him.
    ```

- u/Green0Photon:
  ```
  Unlikely but possible note on rogue simulacrums: Can you steal a soul? Considering simulacrums don't have souls, that means it's only how your magic works that's the difference. Imagine the Matriarch's packet and instead just copy your whole mind over and delete the other one. I think of it as an unstructured mind magic thing, but that would be too hard. So imagine that the simulacrum spell creates a blank mental construct, and part of that is copying your mind over. It would be "simple" to change it to overwrite someone else's mind then, right?
  ```

  - u/crivtox:
    ```
    stealing souls to power simulacrums seems easier than modifying the spell to take over people.I can imagine a necromancer premiering an army of simulacrums this way, it probably doesn't happen because you can't really trust the simulacrum in all situations , maybe whith mind magic like zorian's you can become a coordinated hive mind
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      I'm curious to what extent a mind packet could transfer *personality* itself. In the story, mind packets have been used to store a bit of data, but to rewrite a person's entire being with your personality? That's got to take a true mind magic master.
      ```

- u/Kylinger:
  ```
  As for getting the dagger, wouldn't it be easier to bring someone with the authority to access the dagger into the loop temporarily to convince them to help/mind magic them into helping him? I assume *someone* is allowed to access the vault, even if the only person who can is the king.
  ```

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    Telling the king or other high-up mages is risky: they might try to hunt you down and change your memories/soul to get in on the loop in the hopes of getting out of the restarts, and they have significant resources to try such things.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      Yeah, if a Royal hit squad was giving Z&Z trouble, imagine the fallout if the king thought he could enter a time loop. He'd throw everything at them with all the speed and subtlety possible—which may result in capture before Zorian can flip the soul marker switch and restart everything.
      ```

- u/ansible:
  ```
  So, assuming they do successfully get out of the time loop...

  What's the plan for living the actual month in question?  Obviously they're making notes to quickly generate a lot of cash.  So they'll go after the mana crystals again.

  They've got to assume that the minute they exit the loop, Red Robe is coming after both of them.

  Right before the end, maybe they should have a practice month to play out exactly how they want to handle the real world.
  ```

  - u/bludvein:
    ```
    On the contrary, Red Robe will be totally ignorant of their existence. From his perspective they should already be a done deal when he left the loop. They could make a fake corpse for Zach just in case RR tries to confirm and then totally take him by surprise.

    Practice would be unreliable in this situation. The best chance for practice already left when RR quit, and the invasion and the city plays completely differently due to no inside knowledge and monster incursions already putting the city on high alert.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      What's worse, outside the loop, the invasion should have access to the divine plane, so demon summoning may be a thing.

      But I bet Zorian on his own could defeat RR at this point, and with Zach's help, I think it'd be a done deal.

      The intel they *really* need is: Who is RR, where is he going to be, and can they ambush him? If they can bring along Alanic and Xvim, RR is toast. I'm sure something will throw a wretch in all that though.
      ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      And the total lack of demons.
      ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I think their most important goal should be to protect the shifter children.

    If the primordial gets out, then the nation, maybe the continent, is toast. If they interrupt the summoning halfway through, *they* are toast, and potentially the whole city, depending on exactly how widespread the effects are. So they should guard shifter children and stop the ritual from becoming feasible. Unless they were kidnapped before the loop started.
    ```

  - u/Tommy2255:
    ```
    Tell Alanic about Iasku Mansion. That pulls the entire invasion completely off-schedule and off-plan, the trial run happened while Red Robe was already out of the loop so most of his foresight is useless, and the reintroduction of access to extraplanar help is much less of a factor when dealing with a necromancer than it is when dealing with cultists.
