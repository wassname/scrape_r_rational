  It took me a while but I think I get why "Good Samaritan" is considered offensive. Samaritans were a group of people that weren't exactly liked by the people Jesus was preaching to, and Jesus was saying that a group that you wouldn't expect to be kind can still be your neighbor more than your fellow citizens. But saying the "Good Samaritan" implicitly says that all or most of the other Samaritans are bad. If we replace Samaritan with a group that exists in popular conception outside of the Bible, the offensive nature is clear. "The Good Jew" or "The Good Korean" would be horribly offensive phrases to modern sensibilities. On Aerb, it would basically be the same for the Samaritan Orcs.

  I wonder if the Amaryllis clones could use star magic, because most of the actual work of star magic is doing math. Even if they're unable to lay the actual lines due to DM fiat, they could still help enormously with star magic projects.

  I can definitely see why the WB doc says that the Doris Finch EZ would be a paradise if the person excluded was anyone other than Doris Finch. Being able to duplicate entads alone is absurd, and a person that could actually get along with themself could break the world over their knee even locked to a 31x31 mile patch of land. 

  I had the thought of using DF to duplicate Bethel, which is honestly pretty scary. Could easily get her excluded.

  I absolutely love Amaryllis' description of Doris. "She's the person who ruins everything. She is the tragedy of the commons". 

  The dynamics of a person that can duplicate themselves at an absurd rate is really interesting. Conservation of Dorises is super neat, and the hinted at evolutionary arms race of how Blood God Doris came to exist is really cool. Every Doris has the same blood, they're in a zone filled to the brim with blood, and there are huge selection pressures to become better at blood magic because every added bit of skill and power gives more survival power. A Doris who becomes slightly better than her neighbors at blood magic could quickly populate the entire zone with copies of herself, with no conventional limits on scarcity of resources, culminating in a god of blood.

  Absurd amounts of blood compression seems like it would give extremely good protection against void rifles, one of the few conventional things that Joon doesn't have a real counter to. Normally, someone shoots you in the head, it eats through the negligible amount of blood and skin, them into bone, and then eats a couple inches into your brain. But with extreme blood compression, someone shoots you in the head, and it has to tunnel through something like a gallon of blood before it can hit your skull or brain, which void just can't do. Plus, it reactively shoots a spray of blood right back at whoever shot you.

  Awesome batch, tons of things to love

    What I love the most about this batch is the turn, from Mary (and to an extent the narrator) believing this in the depths of her bones and holding Doris in the utmost contempt, to the relatability of everything Joon says while talking to Clone Zone Doris. At the end, Joon is pretty clear that he probably would wind up like Doris, given her power, and so is the (at least this) reader.
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      Doris as we know her started naked and alone, with the only tool available to her creating another Doris that's also naked and alone. Can you spare a set of clothes for your clone? Congratulations, you're now in an infinitely better place than Doris was. What Joon was saying wasn't that he *would* have ended up like her, what he was saying was that he understood every impulse that went into creating her because he could see those same impulses in himself. 

      Where Doris went wrong was that she cut herself off from any kind of social safety net. She had no reason not to defect because she had nothing. She wasn't hooked into the promises of society, that said if you cooperate you'll be able to harvest the slow fruit of cooperation. 

      Think about placing yourself in her shoes. You make your first clone, what do you do? Do you kick them out naked, or do you give them clothes and find them another job? Do you recognize that two clones have fewer needs than two separate people, for example, that sharing a house halves rent, that pooling your money together to get a nice toy means that you can share it, and so on?

      Sure, there are a lot of failure conditions. But there's a lot of stuff that you could do to fuck up your life right now, and with clones you're usually in a strictly better position than without clones. For a lot of people, the worst case is that you have a massive gang that doesn't have a lot of trust in each other working minimum wage jobs and not sharing resources. The middle case is that cooperate poorly, working less and spending money on stupid shit while not actually changing your circumstances that much. The good case is you do what Amaryllis suggests and leverage the massive amount of latent cooperation between all your clones to Get Shit Done and like, at least pool all your minimum wages together and buy stock or something, living off interest so that you can be fuckups without a risk of going bankrupt or something.
      ```

      - u/Gr_Cheese:
        ```
        I love the points you've made, but you seem to have missed that 'kick them out naked' is not quite accurate. 

        When Doris splits there is a coin flip that Clone A is the original or Clone B is the original. They do not know which is the clone and which is the original. The original's gear will persist past 24h. The cloned gear will disappear after 24h.

        It's the fact that no clone can persist past 24h without their standard of living massively degrading that was at the root of the Doris Problem, which escalates their need for an initial split to be resolved with one Superior Doris and one Inferior Doris. The Superior Doris gets to persist with gear after 24h, the Inferior Doris does not.

        If the splitting conflict is not resolved immediately, and Doris escapes herself... There's infinite escalation. As neither half of the split can risk waiting 24h and potentially losing everything, she must split to persist her gear by robbing her new clone. And the Doris population grows exponentially as branches grow without being reliably trimmed.

        Why rob your clone, and risk retribution, when you can kill it? Why not victimize other Dorises if you're already willing to 50/50 killing yourself via cloning? Why not continue to clone yourself, if that is your best offense / defense against other clones?
        ```

        - u/CreationBlues:
          ```
          I'm not talking about thw horrific dystopia she ended up in, I'm talking about when she first split and was still a part of normal society. Again, that's *Doris's* problem. She explicitly acknowledges that her initial behavior was due to psychological issues, and that by simply sharing her stuff and that by cooperating with her clone she would have been able to avoid this whole mess. The problem isn't the cloned gear, it's the inability to pool resources and engage in cooperation.
          ```

          - u/aeschenkarnos:
            ```
            We don't know for how long she got to run around as a part of normal society, with her power active, before she was excluded. I suspect the exclusion was immediate. The Republic of Doris Finch is described as very barren and bare, not just because the Dorises have absolutely stripped it, but to the point where it was probably 31x31 miles of nothing much to start with.

            If you "Dorised" right now, including the exclusion consequence, you'd probably be inside a house with lots of little duplicable resources, inside a town or city with an enormous amount of duplicable resources.

            For some reason it seems that she wasn't anywhere near anything of any use at all. Maybe the original Doris (wisely) conducted her research into potentially excludable magic way out in the boonies, in a tiny shack. Which speaks well of her potential to re-humanize.
            ```

            - u/CreationBlues:
              ```
              That's handled in the chapters we were just shown, it's implied that the literally billions or trillions of dead dorises have essentially salted the earth (not least because, you know, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, iron, and so on are extremely vital to the human body).

              If you Dorised right now you'd have half the resources you did before, because now you need to kill your clone. And it's important to note that it was confirmed that Doris is mostly just a fuck up, and isn't a sociopath or anything. She wasn't going to immediately resort to killing a copy of her just because it'd dupe something for her. Remember, every duplicated resource either dissapears in 24 hours or requires you to kill someone every 24 hours for the rest of your life. Are there things that might be worth that? Definitely, as long as you've got an insta kill closet and you're chill with patternist theory. It's still something of last resort that you don't use unless it's literally your only option. For example, you're stuck in a barren EZ where you can't buy anything of value and anything that is valuable is already hoarded and claimed.

              Again, "tragedy of the commons". The reason there is nothing of value in the EZ is because Doris can't cooperate and will defect at the first sign that she can gain a temporary advantage. Sure, they started with a lot of stuff, but then they ate it all and didn't husband it and shit broke and now there's a couple million doris's fighting each other for scraps.

        starting to seriously consider these questions - assuming it worked like the story and after the split neither knows whether they are the "original" until the 24 hour mark and gear disappears, one thing I might do is intentionally obfuscate which is which. at 23 hours, both put everything we were wearing in a box and shake it up.  Sit naked for 1 hour.  after the 24 hour mark passes, we re-dress and proceed with our lives, not knowing which one was "primary."  I think creating equality between the two clones is key to ensuring cooperation and avoiding abuse or resentment.

              No guarantee that twin poor criminals could earn twice as much. Especially fast enough to make up for all the previously existing belongings that are now being shared fast enough to satisfy someone who is used to prioritizing short term gains.

                I think /u/TheColourOfHeartache means two shares of *real* clothing, as in, the original Doris owned more than just the clothes on her back. 

                > The very first time we split, we found out the hard way that one of us had our clothes, money, books, and everything else, and the other was naked. She had everything, we had nothing, and she wouldn’t share.

                This is also my reading. That doesn't sound like someone literally living in a ditch with *nothing* to share.

            - u/Ginnerben:
              ```
              The problem here is that she wouldn't have known that the clothes on her back had a 50/50 chance of lasting just 24 hours. Imagine you've got the ability to clone yourself and everything you're holding. How many times do you do it?

              Because I can imagine a situation in which Doris realised what she could do, cloned herself while holding food or money, then repeatedly cloned themselves while gathering the resources together on one Doris until they had enough food for every Doris.

              And then 24 hours later, it all disappeared and suddenly they're without food or any other resources and there's a couple of hundred of them.

              Doris, burned by cooperation within a day of getting her ability, then realises that she's better off looking after herself rather than working with that *bitch* who wasted all their food.

            She was probably a talented mage though, everything about the story indicates that she can and does learn any magic she's capable of forcing herself to learn. She probably started off Int 14, Wis 8, Chaotic Neutral, and iterated herself downwards into the Int 18, Wis 3, Chaotic Evil specimens we see in the current time of the story.

            - u/t3tsubo:

              I figure she is talented at learning the same way a neural net is talented at learning. I.e. each individual Doris is not that talented, but given hundreds of "generations" from cloning, she can end up learning much quicker than normal.

    ```
    I didn't think of it until we met Blood Doris, but probably a big part of the reason that all Finches are horrible is evolution.  The very first duplication ended terribly because she was stuck in a bad frame of mind, which naturally made the next several end bad due to suspicion.  From that point on, cooperators died and defectors lived, until the sort of aggregate Finch moved all the way into defector territory.  Its a combination of normal changes to a person over time and selection pressure from differences in reproduction rates.

      maybe more gradually than this, though.  Not all cooperators died, but cooperators didn't reproduce as aggressively.  All it takes is one with the mentality that they are willing to reproduce to create a gang and use force to get her way; poof, you've got an army all with this mentality.   It's more like a cancer, really.  One individual starts a splitting explosion and eating up more resources, and then everyone is forced to play by "fight or die" rules.

    yeah the doris finch chapters really blew my expectations of what the exclusion zone would be away.  I was expecting some powerful weaselly manipulator; the libertarian hellscape we got was so much more rich and interesting.   It took a common rational fic trope ( kage-no-bunshin self-splitting) that is often munchkined into omnipotence in these stories and turns it on its head with some really interesting social insights. 

    it is interesting though that entads still exist that allow cloning, even though DF's cloning was excluded.  this seems different than other exclusions, where ALL instances of that magic just...stop working.  I wonder if there's a reason other than plot necessity that this one is a little different.

One of the important impacts of that is that entads are able to dodge the exclusionary principle; though portal magic is excluded, there are still functional entads that can create portals outside the exclusion zone.

  - u/LLJKCicero:
    ```
    I mean I don't think Jesus made up that label, that came later. And the story isn't so much assuming that Samaritans are shit by default, and more working off the shared animosity between the two groups.

    It's also relevant that we're talking about societies where most people are desperately poor and the rule of law is relatively weak (at least when traveling between cities), so spending a bunch of money on some random stranger is going to be maybe unusual even if they're part of your in-group.
    ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    > Samaritans were a group of people that weren't exactly liked by the people Jesus was preaching to, 

    I don't think that's necessarily true.  The parable itself works just as well if you use "a firefighter,  an accountant, and a Yankees fan," or any other set of 3 descriptors where the highest implied social status is obvious and goes first. The message was just "be like Sam" with a bit of spice thrown in to show the priest was not like Sam and did not set the correct example. The phrase "good samaritan" doesn't appear in any text until the 17th century, and by itself is enough to create the perception that Samaritans were, in general, bad, because most humans use lazy cognitive bias.

    Offensive,  in this context, means it's actually harming people in measurable ways.
    ```

    - u/Slyvena:
      ```
      Samaritans were definitely not liked by the Jews. Jesus didn't pick that story randomly, he took advantage of ethnic divides to make a point. Jews would have expected the Samaritan to be the robber, flipping the implicit bias of his listeners was part of the point.
      ```

      - u/MilesSand:
        ```
        Those claims come from sources more recent than the phrase being popularized, so should be taken with a grain of salt and understanding that there's some authorial bias going on.
        ```

        - u/Slyvena:
          ```
          Bias against Samaritans is documented both within and outside the Bible. Hell, even the woman at the well listed one of her main reasons she was confused Jesus would even both talking to her as her being Samaritan.

    Note that it's not just "go to another plane where you're not excluded". The other plane *has its own corresponding exclusion zone*, inside which the excluded stuff works, same as in the "normal" plane. Outside of that zone, it's excluded as usual.

    Apparently a huge part of the problem for the Finches was working out how to connect to the part of the Plane of Blood that was actually inside the corresponding exclusion zone, since otherwise they wouldn't be able to pass through the portal.

  Oddly enough, this entire affair with Doris Finch was incredibly uplifting to read and I was uncertain as to why for a good while.

  I think it's because of the sentence:

  >"She's the person who ruins everything. She is the tragedy of the commons".

  Normally this is where I expect to start seeing tragedy shortly after with flashbacks to [Meditations on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) on how easily tragedy of the commons can pop up and how hard it is to escape it. However, we instead end on a hopeful note where Doris has actually done so and is potentially building a better future despite being someone who everyone thinks is beyond saving.

  I also love the irony of how evolutionary arms races usually ends in Malthusian catastrophes, but here it resulted in salvation.

  My only disappointment is that there was a literal god of blood, but there wasn't anyone screaming, "Blood for the blood god!!!"
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    It's a little odd that it resulted in salvation, though.

    Wouldn't Blood Doris, on her way to godhood, have kept continually making armies of clones, so there would be an army of Blood God Dorises, not just a single one?

    That there's a single Doris left implies that progress was not linear, it was either exponential or by discrete stages. I would guess that Blood-Level-100 Doris unlocked a virtue that allowed her to kill all other Dorises instantly, including Blood-Level-99 Dorises.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      > “There’s a feedback loop,” said Raven. “A blood mage with an excess of blood can draw on the power of that blood in order to boost herself, and that boost can make it easier to squeeze more power from the blood. At a certain tipping point, which is more like a hundred times normal blood volume, they can get taken over by something else, unless they’re sufficiently skilled at handling it.”

      Killing a clone releases all of the Doris blood that she had. Drawing on the power of that blood boosts her ability to kill other clones, releasing more blood for the blood god. I think as soon as any Doris developed the ability to draw on the power of her blood to boost herself, the entire plane would only have a single Doris in minutes or hours, so long as she didn't pointlessly make a copy of herself midway through (the only copy with the ability to kill her). This would still hold even if the first Doris finished learning the technique an hour before some other Doris managed to do it, because it would snowball so incredibly quickly.

      Unlike for other blood mages, she wouldn't need to develop a technique of extreme hypertension beforehand, since she can hold usable blood in other bodies. She could learn the snowball technique, and make actual use of it, before ordinary blood mages could.

        I think it's a touch simpler than that -- Blood God Doris reached the level for a "boost skills using blood" virtue *while on the Elemental Plane of Blood*. She doesn't need to kill a Doris to get more juice, they're all constantly suspended in the juice.

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          Being able to boost skills using blood and the ability to control blood other than your own is more complex than being able to boost skills using blood. The blood in other Dorises is already attuned to Doris, and all she needs to do is steal it by killing them, but controlling blood other than your own is a separate skill. You'll note that the blood in the building is all Doris blood. If she could control the blood in the plane, there would be no need to use her own blood to coat the building

      It was pretty much outright stated that offense came to dominate in their struggles, and a single blood mage could alpha strike an entire colony of lesser Dorises. I would imagine the highlander result is just the natural outcome of that. Or Clone Zone just got so far ahead relying more on blood magic than duplication that she realized creating duplicates that might actually be able to fight her would be dumb and just wiped up the rest without cloning.

      Let’s say that every Doris in the plane of blood has the capacity kill every other Doris, and there is no chance of a successful defense, either one of two things happens, either every single Doris dies because they kill each other, or exactly one Doris is left after killing the others.

      Well if every Doris dies, then the Dorises from the material plane repopulate the plane of blood again.  Given enough time (even if 99% of the time all the Dorises kill each other and 1% of the time a single Doris lives) it only takes one “winner” to win forever and become blood god Doris

  It's incredibly impressive that the story can go from climactic non stop battles in Anglecynn to the team somehow finagling a diplomatic response to someone everyone has given up on being diplomatic with. I was engaged the whole way through, and even if they could have killed Blood God Doris it's really neat to see them take a step back and realize it might not be the optimal path. (On a side note it'll probably be helpful for Raven to see that quests are not ironclad and that they do indeed have agency.)

  - u/AnimaLepton:
    ```
    Not just in light of Anglecynn, but diplomacy has been very underrated throughout the story. It's interesting to think about the chain of events, quests, and approaching a SOC-oriented Joon could've taken through Aerb. Diplomancy is an unbalanced meme for a reason, even if that's not how Juniper DM'd or how most TTRPGs go. Some of the micro-level encounters could've changed, but midgame and endgame quests that have popped up multiple times (The Library, some kind of encounter with Fallatehr) would still need to thread their way through the story. And who knows how (or even whether) diplomacy style quests would scale or not.

      I do think that it is interesting to think about, but I also agree with Juniper that his start to Aerb really demanded phys. Kind of sets a tone for what the rest of the campaign would be like, and I think the story has largely born out that Soc is a poor path. (For example I'm not sure how the Mome Rath situation gets solved by Soc Juniper or how he would deal with the level up problem.) Their must be a possible path though because Juniper even mentions that all setup challenges must be potentially solvable. I just don't see it unless there are some truly obscene levels of DM manipulation going on behind the scenes.

        Soc playthrough means probably leveraging allies more. With higher soc he wouldn't have been fighting the student council, he'd convince them to work with him, and similar things.

          A  high SOC path for Mome-rath would have involved the necessary social  insight and weaving that he would have not only noticed that people were  acting oddly but been able to track down the cultists. He then would  have been able to turn around that fatalistic "Let's end the world" guy  and talk him down. Preventing Mome-rath from ever being summoned at all.  He also would probably have gained some powerful SOC skill unlocks  likely capable of overcoming some of the anti-memetic effects, maybe  even something like "Things trying to hide from your attention become  MORE obvious than if they were not". A sort of super-sherlock that is  also good with people.

          At a  certain point, a SOC character campaign becomes extremely collaborative,  delegating out and choosing the right people to unite Aerb in its own  defence. June only gets called in to flashpoint events that require the  perfect hail-mary diplomatic touch from left field. He becomes famous  not as the 'impossible warrior, Uther reborn' but as the 'great uniter,  Uther reborn'

          Max Level SOC June  is finding ways to stop the decline of Aerb society and social-engineer  its systems to prevent future exclusions.

            I get the idea in broad strokes, but that answer doesn't satisfy me in the two specific cases I mentioned. For Mome Rath you are taking as a given that Juniper would get some way around the anti-memetic effect in the Soc path. That seems like a big assumption to me. With anti-memetics in play he can't leverage his social skills to get an army as he'd forget about the problem the moment he left.

            Even if you can finagle some solution for Mome Rath it doesn't answer how Soc Juniper would deal with his level up addiction without mental investment. Also if they do go to P Space that seems like something that a Soc Juniper would not be able to do.

              Given how little we know of SOC virtues (which would have a bigger impact than MEN and PHS really) all we can do is speculate.

              Mome Possibilities:\* It's likely June wouldn't have even had to deal with the anti-memetic effect. Penetrating the cult before Mr Mome and his back lice were even an issue.\* Given how all other magical effects are slowly being discovered to be accounted for in the system somehow (bladeborn are PHS, magics are MEN) I think its actually quite intuitive that Memes and interacting with them are unlocked in varying degrees by pushing up SOC and SOC skills unlocking synergies similar to how multiple PHS unlocked the bladeborn etc.\* Even without though, June could do two-step removed social-fu on himself similiar to that chick that could resist Soul-fucking even though she was entirely under its thralls. A SOC June likely has many options like that, the ability to pre-condition and even retroactively post-condition himself to undertake tasks even if he himself no longer knows why.- The point is, there are possible ways. The game is still set up for conflict, and I consider Memes to be a form of SOC attack for which a high level SOC character should have defenses.

              Level Up Addiction:\* Probably the same thing here, where June can ignore his own wants and desires with perfect rationality if he chooses to. He would be utterly addicted to leveling up, but able to indefinitely act as if he was not.\* In fact, rather than slapping a bandaid on the level up addiction with Spirit Magic, a SOC June likely could have directly removed the cause of the addiction rather than magically hiding the symptoms.

              P-Space:A SOC June would utterly destroy anything they liked in P-space. In fact he would be insanely overpowered there. Its all about conceptual and abstract connections, a SOC character is a god there. In fact in might be advantageous for him to remain there and use the enormous power he could amass there to push influence back onto Aerb similar to how the original inhabitant did.A SOC June in P-Space is the equivalent of Blood-God Deloris.edit: In fact that's probably how a SOC June defeats Fel-Seed, they go to P-Space and find a way to erase the conceptual linkages of Fel-Seeds existence, unknitting him from reality.  
              Uther was powerful in P-space because of his Fame among other things, A SOC June would have amassed so much public and political influence he would be a tsunami of force in P-Space.

        There is presumably an optimal level of resources to possess for optimally moral behavior: not too much, not too little. In a similar way, growing up as a sane adult requires some adversity in childhood: not too much, not too little.

        This could easily be the core concept of the Gygaxian Religion: seek out challenges that suit your level. Too easy and you don’t gain XP, too hard and you fail and even if you survive the failure, don’t gain XP.

            Doris is interesting because she self-identifies as an outgroup that's entirely composed of herself, which could probably be interpreted as a convoluted metaphor for any number of mental illnesses.

            with the rich it's not so much about the physical resources as it is Power.  wealth is a component and trapping of that power, but fundamentally it is the ability to exert power over and objectify others that is damaging psychologically.  

            on the flip side, poverty is the same everywhere; it's the actual, absolute scarcity that is damaging.

          I think it's less the material privilege and more the material inequality which degrades empathy.

          I think a human born into a lush paradise with other humans will grow into a better person than a human born on a throne with slaves, even though the two have similar material conditions. The wealthy in our world are closer to the latter category. Meanwhile, within the latter society, the slaves will grow into better people than the one on the throne, but worse people than the ones in the paradise.

          In the real world, there's a strange effect where the former warlords can create sheltered bubbles for their grandchildren where they only meet other high-resource people, sort of mimicking some but not all features of the paradise. However, the moral conviction of these bubbled people can usually only go so far, because they ultimately have no incentive to deconstruct the blood-built edifice of their bubble. Especially once they grow up and must take on the mantle of power, with the incentive to maintain that wealth, they'll find their ideals becoming more... flexible.

            Anecdotally, out of all the scion class, the children of arts-industry (movies, books, pictorial arts etc) multimillionaires seem the most grounded and compassionate, especially the ones who follow their parents into the work. 

            I suspect this is because the success of art is directly related to its relatability to the masses; if the child of a successful actor is to themselves become a successful actor (eg Ben Stiller, Domnhall Gleeson, Angelina Jolie, Liv Tyler), then even with the leg-up past the initial barriers, they *still* have to be capable of convincing on-screen portrayal of some relatively ordinary person. They still need to seek out direct exposure to how relatively ordinary people live. If they are to portray a character from an author's book, they meet the author. If they are to portray a real person, they meet that person, and that person's associates.

            Fundamentally they are *role-players* that get significant professional success just for *role-playing*. Especially with modern directors and screenwriters encouraging much more improv, and actor input into character development. This is specifically why Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul is *so good* - Vince Gilligan encourages a very high level of actor investment and contribution into their characters.

              Acting and arts in general are also positive sum games where a lot of success comes from networking and getting on with people. Unlike say owning property or natural resources, which is inherently zero sum. 

              I think there's also an element where first generation rich people like actors are aware of the systemic problem of the later generations of wealthy families becoming useless and immoral. So they've deliberately crafted the education of their children to avoid that.

      How? Generally speaking, people can't just "decide" to be different, any more than someone depressed can just "decide to not be depressed" anymore. The solution requires systematic changes, partially from not living in desperation so that you have time to set up new systems, but also you have to set up systems that make the best/right choice the easy one.

      And systems like that take a lot of time and intentional effort to get right.

          There is an inherent tension between systemic problems that require systemic solutions, and individual solutions to escape (or exploit) systemic problems. An individual who has implemented a solution to exploit a systemic problem, then becomes part of the systemic problem and defects from attempts to solve it systemically. Mere escape from the problem makes one less invested in keeping it around, though attitudes to getting rid of the problem for others [can go either way](https://i.redd.it/q5tmfm14rpw31.jpg).

      I don't think she could just instantly make the EZ a paradise, since the clones diverge to some extent after creation. If one suddenly gets over her troubles, then even if she mass clones herself, the other factions may not get over themselves and kill them. The only way it could really happen would be is if 'getting over herself' was a baked in trait that would eventually be acted upon after enough time/an event, in the same way a person getting annoyed by something will eventually get fed up and lash out, and that this trait manifested at similar times for all or most of the other clones in the EZ.

Doris makes for quite the interesting case, the scenario of a completely ordinary type of person pushed to such an extreme. After long enough, others see her just as a completely irredeemable person instead of the result of the conditions and process Joon talked about.

  So, I'm still *very* curious about how their Heisenberg scrying works. This kind of magic has never been mentioned anywhere other than "that thing the Doris Finches can do".

  So she has a unique kind of magic to find people, and she has a unique kind of magic to clone herself. It seems... *odd* that she would just *happen* to have two kinds of entirely unique magic that no one else even knows about. So I've assumed for a while now that she somehow uses cloning for this, by Munchkining it together with some other magic, in a process that (presumably) involves killing loads of clones and at the end you have a clone that knows where whats-his-face is. Maybe through an entad that, I dunno, kills you if you lie or something, and they keep narrowing it down? But it can't be *just* that, it's probabilistic, and from the Larkspur thing there's maybe Library-style time travel involved as well.

  Really hoping we get an answer to this eventually - if it's horrible and barbaric, then I suppose putting an end to it could be part of Blood God Doris's (and Doris Finch's in general) character arc.

    When the power first came up, Amaryllis assumed the bad guys were using a large amount of elf bones.

    I'm betting that still the answer: a single elf bone, duplicated a ridiculously high number of times.
    ```

    - u/Green0Photon:
      ```
      I think I agree with your guess. And it would be a good callback, considering we haven't seen anything related to luck for a while. And Doris Finch and Luck were introduced around the same time-ish.

      Luck seems to be exactly the thing that should break through an anti-scrying entad. Partially because it's not actually scrying, and also because it's *luck*.

      It's also the same brand of dumb bullshit Doris would come up with.

      Yeah. 100% this.
      ```

    - u/alfador:
      ```
      That would be really cool, though if elf bones work for this, it raises the question of why everyone has been making deals with Doris Finch instead of using Anglecynn's strategic reserve, especially now that they finally have regained power in Anglecynn. Maybe the cost is lower to deal with DF, but given Amaryllis's surprise at Larkspur going to DF instead of using elf bones, it's likely widely regarded as not.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        If you need a thousand elf bones to get a reliable location at one moment, and you need a new location every five minutes, your strategic reserve is going to run out of bones fast (especially since that reserve was built up by secret means, eg pillaging elf graveyards).

        On the other hand, if Doris has one elf bone, then she has infinite elf bones.

    Was it really going off the plot rails? The way Blood God Doris was waiting for them, it sounded like it was specifically set up to allow this sort of social victory. Maybe the DM didn't think it very likely, but I don't think it was unforeseen as an option.

    >Really hoping we get an answer to this eventually - if it's horrible and barbaric, then I suppose putting an end to it could be part of Blood God Doris's (and Doris Finch's in general) character arc.

    Probabilistic binary geographical search using the entrails of slain Doris clones. You can only narrow things down with successive sacrifices because they're technically the same person, if you tried using random normal people each new data set would have orthogonal data.
    ```

  - u/Marand23:
    ```
    Well, it's not impossible that she discovered some unknown branch of magic by herself, that doesn't rely on her cloning. Like the chapters stated, the thing the Doris nation has got going for itself is a basically infinite amount of very skilled labour, as well as desperation for any possible edge. The Blues probably have hundreds of blacksites researching every possible branch of magic that they can think of, even ones that outside nations wouldn't fund because the applications seem too narrow for the cost of skilled labour. But that is up to AW, I look forward to seeing what he has cooked up.
    ```

    - u/blast_ended_sqrt:
      ```
      Someone else brought up Amaryllis's suggestion that it's elf bones, and I'm inclined to agree especially now we know the bones could be duplicated (is that new information? I forget how much has been established about Doris's abilities before this update).

      I can see how they have cloned sweatshops where they give a bunch of Dorises a bunch of books on known magic, and kill the ones who don't learn it. I'm less sure how they'd use this setup to invent new branches of magic - the success rate would be astronomically lower (it's 0 until it happens), so the Dorises in charge would produce no results and get *themselves* killed. (or it works, and they take over and kill the ones in charge - another risk they have no reason to take)

      The plan would be a moonshot (which probably means something different on Aerb and is offensive to elves, but fuck the elves), and that requires taking more risk than the Dorises can handle.

      That's optimistic.

      The Blues sound like they have something approaching a cohesive government, but not *that* cohesive. I'd guess a dozen blacksites at most.

    One theory about her divination was that if you assume she has a Luck stat higher than 0, if she made "random" predictions, these predictions would be true slightly more often. Repeat that a million times, and look for the global maximum. For example, have them blind toss darts at a map to determine where a target is, and look for which locations were hit most often.
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      A problem with this is that the predictions would be clustered even without Luck meddling, because they're all made by almost-identical people. 

      If you ask two Dorises to toss a dart, well, they have the same muscle distribution, the same eyesight, the same technique... They're going to hit similar spots a lot of the time. You could use Dorises from different branches but still.

    In this case, it's achieving relatability in layers.  Now that I phrase it that way, they did a very similar thing in Shrek.

    Let's take this a chapter at a time.

    Chapter 201:
    >We were expecting a double cross. You had to, when Doris Finch was involved.
    >
    >The attack came when I was ten feet away, but it wasn’t the attack I expected, not an attack against us, but an attack against them, Doris against Doris. 

    So, you come in with an expectation, a stereotype, and the character lives up to it.

    The first scene in Shrek is showing Shrek to live up to the stereotype of an Ogre: he's disgusting, scary, and hates people (except maybe for dinner).  A couple of times, it looks like it's going to contradict that, but then: nope, the thing he's painting is a "Keep out" sign.

    Similarly, Doris is shown to be a serial defector, and, in the first chapter, lives up to that every step of the way.

    Chapter 202:
    >“I don’t have the fucking time for this. You understand they’ll shoot me if I don’t do my best?”
    >
    >“And deprive themselves of a star mage?” I asked.
    >
    >“No,” she replied. “I split before I came in here. If I fail, then they kill me and keep her. If I succeed, they keep me and kill her. Either way, they keep their star mage, this is just incentive for me to actually do the work. If they didn’t have a guard, they would torture me for information first.”

    You've set up your character as a loathsome creature.  The next step is to make it clear that *this is miserable for them*.  So, you take your character and put them in a situation where it's clear that they know the consequences of being loathsome, but are helpless to change.  So, you get a sort of sympathy for them, but at the same time, they're no less of an awful person

    In Shrek, this is the whole sequence where the swamp gets invaded by the other fantasy creatures, up until the fight in Dulac.  He tries to deal with his problems by scaring them away, because he doesn't know any other way of dealing with them.  The problem is, he's just not scary enough for that to work on everyone.  But he keeps trying, being especially awful to Donkey.

    In WtC, we see a prime example of the pressure that a Doris faces: everything, even a simple magic lesson, is a life-or-death struggle, and if you fail, you die, and some other Doris will live in your place.  And all along the way, Doris is still, plainly, thinking of stabbing them in the back.

    I'm skipping Chapter 203, because we've about learned all that we could from Star Doris.

    Likewise, skipping the castle scene from Shrek.

    Chapter 204: 
    >She sighed, then nodded. “Look,” she said. “You told me that you would let me out if I told you the truth. You promised.”
    >
    >“You’re something different,” I said. “What have you been doing here, just waiting? I don’t believe for a second that you couldn’t open that hatch on your own. And this blood, that’s your work. The blood worms, also probably your work.”
    >
    >“Are you letting me out, yes or no?” asked Doris, stepping toward the ward and pressing her hand against it.
    >
    >“No,” said Amaryllis.

    The character's problem is based on a mistaken apprehension of the world, which gets confirmed.  They are betrayed, the way that they have always been betrayed, so, fuck it, go back to the normal way of life.

    So Shrek spends a good couple of days with Fiona, and actually starts to think that things could be different... but then he overhears her say something and mistakenly thinks it's about him.  He summons Farquaad to pick up Fiona, and goes back to his swamp.

    Doris is expecting betrayal, and probably is ready to go on a rampage here.  If she isn't let out, she's breaking out, and then she's going to be the one in charge.

    Chapter 205: 
    >I was explaining that the Dorises, as people, are completely fucked up. They’ve been suffering here, for a long time, at their own hands. And for this particular one, who is probably better off never splitting again, if that’s even something she could do, if it even matters given her presumed skill — for her, it’s important that she understands that she’s in a position where it doesn’t have to be how it was. Once she’s there, once she’s traipsed up Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, then we can start talking to her about what her life should be like, how and why to break herself of her current terrible habits that have been learned over the course of a lifetime of pain and suffering. But I think what comes first is just saying, ‘hey, it can be okay now’.

    In a word: therapy.

    Things are at their absolute lowest for Shrek, and we can *see* that while he's gotten what he says he wants, it's not what he *actually* wants.  Then, Donkey shows up and shows Shrek a different way the world could be. Fighting his instincts (and with the help of people who care about him), he manages to break his habit and actually *believe* things could be different, and along with a chance to start things over, that's enough to make things better.

    Likewise, Blood God Doris is probably among the most traumatized of any of the Dorises, ready to come out and rule as brutally as anything she's been through.  That's her next move, even though she doesn't really want that.  Then, Juniper comes along and shows her a vision of a world where life isn't just killing yourself over, and over, and over, and gives her a chance to make that vision a reality.

    Loathsome, to pitiable, to relatable, to likable (and even someone you'd root for), each layer being peeled away to reveal the next.

    Long story short, if you want a character with nuance and depth, give them flaws, and make them struggle to overcome them.  Not to the extent that they no longer have those flaws, but to the point where the flaws no longer define them.

        Don't you see? Doris is like Shrek, and Shrek is an Ogre, and Ogres are like Onions.

        Doris *is* an Onion, or rather, ***[Onion is a Doris!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMHgxGSuBG8)***

        We already know that there are Bladebound Dorises. We already know that when placed in a secluded environment fit to learning their craft, with only themselves to fight against, Dorises are prone to acting like a **Neural Network that culls itself over and over to achieve apotheosis.**

        In a much earlier experiment in the EZ, one such Doris surpassed the rest and achieved such a Mastery of the Blade that she could [cut away her very being, her ability to Duplicate, and thanks to that she escaped the EZ.](https://i.imgur.com/1Ly4SkL.jpg)

        We also know that Onion was sent to [Exclusion Zones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ssnw2GA657s) for Trials by Adversity multiple times... And that miraculously, he survived them all. OR DID HE?

        Really, all it took from that point is to get a shape-shifting Entad and take over the original Onion's body. It's practically canon at this point, so obvious.

        I'm not gonna pull out cites, but AW likes to make a character a broad stereotype and then give more details over time. Mary, Fenn, and Grak are all presented as stereotypes (ruthless and cold; carefree; gruff and goal-oriented) and AW gradually adds detail and nuance and has them show vulnerability. The Loyalty mechanic, meta as it is, is great for showing which statements and actions resonate with a character.

    A lot of times, flat characters exist because the character was created to serve a specific purpose (an antagonist, a love interest, etc.) but the author hasn't bothered to give the character any attributes besides the purpose they serve, or think about what drives them to be the sort of person that takes the actions the plot the demands they take.

    The way AW writes, characters generally act the way they do because of realistic motivations rather than acting in arbitrary ways to serve the needs of the plot. Even if they really do only exist because there is a specific purpose for them to serve, he still gives them a personality such that those actions make total sense for them to take. The act of actually ensuring that a given character's actions are motivated results in the character developing a degree of depth.

  Not the first time Grak has shown this kind of insight. Also demonstrated in the previous batch, assessing the capability of the zombies seeming to do nontrivial work.

  >“It could have been faster,” said Grak. His hair was mussed, but  otherwise he looked fine. “I was trying to figure out how to save this one.”

  This was enough to cause a brief mental tangent in which I contemplated the possibility of a onesided affection from StarDoris for Grak.

  >I really, honestly hadn’t thought that she would do it, but the  one I had said would stay pulled a knife and made to attack the other, who obviously knew that this was coming. I was faster than her, though, and I laid my hands on both of them, stopping them in place with still magic.

  I know Juniper lampshaded it, but I'm still a bit taken aback by the stupidity. The plan is to clone herself, then fight to be the clone that escapes? "You wanted to kill her so that we would let you make a new clone?"

    Yeah, there's a few details where I feel the Doris's power isn't quite applied to its natural conclusion.

    For instance, it seems the DFEZ is treated like a wasteland with occasional cities, but I feel it should be an uninterrupted megalopolis of slums and misery. Any space not claimed by a city would eventually be claimed by the occasional desperate Doris, and with the ability to make an army of herself, it would be pretty much impossible to maintain a no man's land.

    Maintaining an empty space in the DFEZ would take *logistics*; it would essentially require machine gun nests so that everyone knows that, if you walk into that space, you're going to die, no matter how many of you there are.

    I really don't see how there could be any empty space (including abandoned houses and the like) that isn't crawling with Dorises, unless that space is actively defended with terrifying violence.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      Doris' key problem is that she can't work with herself. She also views every clone as their own discrete person and not a continuation. For example Star Doris asked to make a clone with the full intent of attacking herself if not chosen just to give her a 50% chance of survival. Create an army ploys don't work unless there is overwhelming incentive to do so. She doesn't want to die and all her clones inherit that.

      There is an apparent (artificial) shortage of Steel Mage Dorises.

      Plus the fact that there was no branch of Meta-Magic Doris kind of indicates that things haven't played out for long enough to become homogeneous, and I'd extend that to homogeneous environment too as you pointed out with the 'empty land' and also the lack of proliferation of that Cleaning Entad^^TM .

      - u/NinteenFortyFive:
        ```
        I'd argue Doris is her own ecosystem. several core strains of Doris who've specialised into an eco-political niche, so you have Blood bound Dorises, Star mage Dorises, Pustule Dorises and others that have picked up other skills, magic, pseudomagic or entads to survive in and create their own "niche" in the doris ecosystem.

        Hell, the plane of blood colony was an example of that. Blood mage dorises rapidly adapted to the locale, and as soon as a beneficial mutation arose (Blood breathing) that strain of Doris rapidly grew and evolved it's own arms race, a-la cambrian explosion.

        Another example is Star Doris receiving a working flashlight. She's no longer just a Doris who fills a niche of amateur Star Mage, She's Amateur Star Mage and Flashlight (+ components) user, at least, until she's ganked for it. That's a massive economic niche for anyone who, well, needs light. The Blues weren't giving away their light sources, weren't they?

        I'd argue each Doris is drastically different, it's just that there's not enough differences. They all call themselves Doris.

        Well, void weapons are one example, but you could imagine others. We know that televisions (in timelines where they're invented) sometimes display magic images from an evil god that can mind-control people watching them; that god gives rewards to followers that do human sacrifices, until he's eventually summoned to our world (or something like that, I don't remember the exact details). Dropping a TV in the DFEZ would be disastrous.

        Or imagine an entad with a remote effect, like, I don't know, a gun that can kill an arbitrary person anywhere in the world as long as you keep feeding it human flesh, or something like that.

        It wouldn't be quite word-ending even then (people could always napalm the entire EZ to the bedrock), but there might be an entad combination that *would be*. Even knowing that exclusions and the Library act as safety nets, it's pretty cavalier of the Empire not to put serious effort into making sure so new entads (or long-range canons) ever enter the zone.
        ```

        - u/burnerpower:
          ```
          Well to quibble, the first is already world ending on it's own. Dropping it in the DFEZ doesn't really change that much except maybe to accelerate the timeline. The second would not be dangerous because the cloned entad should not be able to strike outside the zone and the rate of death for it on it's own would be slow.

          That said I get your point. There could be an entad with some outrageous effect that requires human sacrifices or something that Doris could then exploit without needing to clone it.
          ```

          - u/Bowbreaker:
            ```
            Okay, then imagine an entad artillery weapon that opens a portal to the elemental plane of tungsten, harvest large blocks, and then accelerates said blocks like a superpowered railgun. If it's balanced by reload time or energy consumption then Doris can make tungsten rain from the sky in streams.

              I did say I got it. That's why I began my first statement by calling it a quibble. I'm just too much of a pedant to let it go unchallenged even though I understood the spirit of what was being said. I'm tempted to quibble with your example as well but, yes I understand the point. There are probably entads she could break without actually needing to clone them.

  We finally have confirmation on where Arthur is, although I'm surprised that Doris gave that information out so easily, since it's the location of the single most searched for person in the history of Aerb. If Doris was going to charge ridiculous amounts for the finding of any individual, why not Uther? I'm shocked that she couldn't get concessions of some kind for the EZ with that kind of leverage.

  Then again, the information isn't all that usable, given his location...

    Most people wouldn't believe her. They'd take it as Doris trying to get the person asking killed, or as a spiteful answer that only serves to annoy the person asking. Maybe they would try to pay more to get an "honest" answer.

    It's only because they have independent confirmation that his location of "literally the most dangerous and well defended location in the entirety of Aerb" is taken seriously instead of being brushed off as a lie.

  This is one of my favorite batches so far.

  In addition to the spectacular characterization of the Dorises Finch (Juniper calls them "Doris Finches" but he doesn't understand the One True Way To Pluralize People) this batch shows a lot of growth for our protagonists. They finally arrive at a diplomatic solution to one of their quests.

  "Missing the social/diplomatic solution" has been a running theme since Fallatehr. From chapter 95,

  > “But that wasn’t really what he had misgivings about. He thought that we jettisoned any chance of a successful working relationship with him through aggressive mistrust.” She grunted as she made a long reach, going to full extension of one slender leg for just a moment. The only way that I’d be able to follow her route was going to be with my superior reach.

  And then it's brought up again in this batch with regards to Anglecynn,

  > I finally caught up to what Amaryllis must have been thinking, which was that if there had ever been a social solution in Anglecynn, we had mostly missed it, and if the Doris EZ was similar, then the thing that would guarantee we went down the combat path would be treating the Dorises how you’d assume they should be treated, just based on what you heard about them.

  Amaryllis comes in talking shit about Doris because she can't cooperate, because come on, cooperating with yourself is easy, you just have to decide to do it. In the end, it wasn't just Doris that needed to cooperate with herself, but it was Joon&party that needed to extend their own trust and cooperation to Doris as well. Extending their trust to someone else, that's fucking difficult - I can't overstate how difficult it is, especially in a world like Aerb - but that's the challenge they overcame today.

  > “You’re saying we should defect against Doris? That justifies a lack of trust in us.”
  >
  > Amaryllis was watching me, and I could feel her mismatched eyes boring into me, stripping me bare. She was good at reading people, but not that good if she was in the wrong mindset for a proper reading to take place. Maybe she could see that Doris wasn’t actually afraid of us, but maybe she thought that was because of typical Doris fatalism, not because she had the upper hand. Maybe she thought that I was being headstrong, not that I knew something that she didn’t. I wasn’t trying to make my face readable, because Doris was watching us, but I was hoping she would understand.
  >
  > “Okay,” she finally said. “You’re right.”

  And in the end they got to forge their own way with the quest.

  In other news, I absolutely love AW's sense of humor. I actually just laughed for a straight minute at this joke.

  > If that book the Dungeon Master had shown me, Worth the Candle by Juniper Smith, was written in my authentic voice, I had to believe I wouldn’t have just glossed over all the mundane stuff. The book of my adventures on Aerb would have had some grim and dark stuff, but it wouldn’t have been only that, not unless you were willing to cut out playing Ranks with Grak, or Amaryllis introducing me to rock climbing, or the long conversation that Fenn and I had about why anyone would voluntarily use the awesome power of the internet to watch some stranger play a videogame (and yeah, it would have taken twenty pages and then abruptly ended with a sex scene, but I would have included it all the same).

  It boggles my mind that even after so much discussion of the **Blood Plane**, an absolute mastery of **Blood Magic**, and a new **Blood God** Doris - there still wasn't a single point where *anyone* in the cast thought to bring up ***Aarde!***

  Do the Gods of Aerb literally not matter under any circumstances??       
  205 chapters in, and there's literally not a single development where Juniper has an excuse to tell us about them, or just mention how they might react to something like this, or compare Aarde's known powers to what BGD is capable of?

  I just don't get why the Five Gods are such nonentities in our perspective of the world... Is it a deliberate joke by the DM as the Only True God or something?

  If we reach Fel Seed without them mattering even once I'm gonna go crazy.

  What are we to make of the Earth flashback beginning chapter 203? The connection to the rest of the chapter and arc seems reasonably clear, but in isolation?

  >It was one of those awkward arguments, the kind that I didn’t like  when I looked back on it, but which had passed easily enough. No one  had really been mad at each other, but it had been uncomfortable, and  even running it over in my head afterward, I didn’t know quite how I  could have fixed it.

  Let's take some wild guesses. There seem to be points of friction within the group that go unaddressed. Reimer is resigned to hear about the worldbuilding, Craig is uninterested, Maddie *is* interested, Tiff is halfway interested.

  Grammatical nitpicking by the players at each other: "can"/"may" "hewed"/"hewn"

  So maybe the point is just that Juniper didn't have enough SOC to know what was the impetus of the mood of the room? Or that *Arthur* failed a SOC check, and asked a question that divided the group?

  Or maybe the point is just that the whole idea is too grimdark, a connection to the narration immediately following the flashback.

  Doris and her cloned stuff are confined to the zone; what does that mean, exactly?  Does cloned stuff vanish as soon as it crosses the boundary?

  * How high up does the boundary go?  
  * How far down does it go?
  * It is a dome?  A column? An irregular shape?
  * Whenever a Doris is created, she appears as an exact copy of her progenitor, meaning that the clone has air in her lungs.  If a clone breathes out across the boundary, does the cloned air vanish?  
  * What about light?  Does the light from those cloned flashlights vanish at the boundary?
  * Do void effects vanish?



  Imagine an open circuit consisting of a loop of copper wire and a light bulb.  In the real world if you close the circuit by attaching a battery to the two ends of the wire then electrons will flow and the bulb will light up.  The interesting part is that the electrons in the water behave like water in a pipe:  They all start moving the moment the (battery is added / faucet is turned on).  The [drift speed](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/circuits/Lesson-2/Electric-Current) of electrons is quite low, maybe 1m / hour.  If the wire is a few miles long it will be ages from then the battery is attached until the first electron from the battery actually flows through the light bulb -- until then the light bulb is being powered by the electrons that were already in the wire.

  Now imagine that the battery is cloned but the cable and the bulb were supplied by the Empire and are therefore not cloned.  The bulb is outside of the zone with the wire crossing the border.  When Doris connects the battery, does current flow?  Does the bulb stay lit as per normal until the battery is drained, or does it shut off as soon as electrons from the cloned battery cut off the flow by crossing the border?  If it keeps flowing, that means that Doris is the solution to the Empire's energy problems -- run a power cable in, have Doris clone batteries or coal or nuclear fuel or etc and send power out.

Of course I somehow forgot about Doris Finch. If Blood God Doris can be convinced to teach June how to clone himself then June has a much better chance. 

          There's also the time loop exclusion acting as a wild card here. If suddenly it's reseting time on all of Aerb (except the exclusionary principle exclusion zone in theory) then it might be that nobody wins. Eternal stalemate reigns instead.

    The impression I got was that when people or things are prevented from leaving an exclusion zone it's because the zone boundary acts as a physical barrier to them, and not because they disappeared if they tried. As for sending electricity out of the DFEZ, I don't know how the physics would work out if you had cloned electrons trying to cross the boundary directly, but even if it doesn't work you can still get electricity out of the zone. All you need is for someone to provide some electric motors. Doris clones batteries to run the motors, and the motors spin magnets to generate electricity that is free of cloned electrons. Hopefully you don't end up triggering a new exclusion, after all Captain Blue was able to sell his zombie made merchandise without drawing more DM intervention.

        ```
        Keep in mind, it's not just the tragedy of the commons, it's overshooting as well. You'll need a lot of resources to keep your new faction together.

        At the minimum, you need food, water, living space, and weapons.

        If you start with one gun and clone yourself 100 times, then the next day you have 99 clones without guns, clothes, or any other possessions, unless you have some sort of facility to produce large amounts of clones, kill them and take their stuff.

        Even if you want to cooperate in principle, you're terrified of death, and you absolutely don't want to go to the "clone yourself and get killed a bunch of times" factory, which means your society needs mechanisms to enforce attendance. The clones controlling the mechanisms of enforcement also don't want to go to the suicide factory, so they're probably going to end up as a ruling class.

        And keep in mind that, unless you're a steel mage, you start off with no infrastructure and no way to build it (and even if you can build things, the EZ is probably overcrowded anyway); which means you're going to have to fight other factions for living space (and other resources). Fighting other factions involves being sent to die for a war that doesn't directly benefit you; again, even if you wanted to cooperate in principle, you're probably going to change your mind when being sent into the (literal or metaphorical) meat grinder. Unless you have some kind of suicide squad collar (keeping in mind everything you make disappears after 24h), the soldiers you make aren't actually going to want to go on the front lines.

        With all those considerations, I can kind of see why the society would be so dysfunctional. I'm not saying it's an unsolvable problem, but any non-external solution has to account for the facts that clones both really don't want to die and need kill each other on a regular basis to get their food and keep their equipment.

    I wonder how well Valencia's approach works for Doris. The point isn't to understand or manipulate Doris, but to try helping her to be a *better* person. Meanwhile, Valencia is trying to learn how to be a (good) person. Maybe not the best fit.

    But she could certainly read a Doris like a book, to the point of anticipating everything Doris did. That fits with your hypothesis.

  Everyone's got the gushing covered on the brilliance of Doris Finch's reciprocal determinism and her EZ's commentary on human condition (plus the long awaited diplomacy ending), but this mini-arc was also a bunch of wishes come true. Paranoia, redeemably* grey villains, Joon successfully mapping his pattern to the lesson at stake in another step to his own actualization. But my favorite part by far was the social clues and cues foreshadowing the resolution long before Juniper laid out the correct answer - the inductive pay-off was marvelous.

  This was a fun sequence. Not just in terms of the obvious excellent characterization and so forth, but also in *showing what sorts of paths an alternate Juniper could have gone down*.

  Where the last arc was the arc of "sometimes the main characters are going to miss opportunities for diplomatic resolution" and the arc wherein we got to see what a physical-combat-focused Juniper might have looked like, this arc was the arc of "sometimes threats that seem unsolvable via diplomacy *aren't*" and the arc wherein we get to see a tiny slice of what a more socially-focused Juniper might have looked like.

  (Possibly I'm biased in this reading due to my overwhelming habit of playing face characters in RPGs; but it's not *too* much of a stretch, I think. And getting to see what sorts of options would have been open to a Face!Juniper is a lot of fun. It's made me start wondering what the diplomatic solutions to some of the *previous* arcs would have looked like, now that it's clear that there are frequently hidden options in that direction.)

  I can tell I am in the minority here, but I didn't love these chapters! Not that they went close to the "bad" territory or anything, I think everything here was just too "neat" so I felt it difficult to suspend disbelief. Like, them showing up just as the Doris EZ is having its largest crisis in history is brushed away as a plot hook by the DM, sure that's true, but hanging a lampshade on it doesn't actually resolve it. It is actually really rare in WTC for something to happen just so the DM can give Joon & Co quests; most have been set up by the DM but a long time ago, and the group either actively seeks it out (Falahter, Bethel) or it occurs in response to their actions/situation (Everett's Group, Larksupr, Raven). Even Lio was a bit of a ploy by Uniquities to get them involved. They even show up here randomly; they try to kill Blue-in-a-Bottle once via direct assault and then just give up and go Finch'ing.

  The resolution suffered from a similar problem - the idea of them all being Dorises sort-of papers over the fact that the central 'antagonist', who is their own person, isn't met till the last chapter and is pretty much immediately completely understood and reasoned with. From our perspective we know who Doris is, but from blood!Doris's perspective these are some random  strangers telling her her life story. She shows up and is immediately resolved. I think it would have worked a lot better if she was an active player through the whole arc, maybe having recently emerged and the Doris EZ is in an uproar over it. And of course now that its done they are going to just pop off to their main adventure, sight unseen, no big deal.

  The chapter had many strengths, don't get me wrong - I liked the dive into Mary's biases and hostilities around the tragedy of the commons and accepting weakness and feelings in others (connecting back to Anglecyn was great), and Star Magic was hilariously pedestrian, real "intro to calc TA" vibes from those tutoring sessions which was great. I just though a thin thread pulled it all together, maybe as a property of trying to move things towards the end-game, and I think the pacing & narrative logic were off-kilter as a consequence.

    The timing wasn't that tight. The Blues said the crisis had been ongoing for over a month when the team arrived. Blood God Doris was also not going to come out for another week, but they let her out early. The only suspect timing was Pinno, but eh library timelines. The timing was again not that tight because he went in early when he heard the team was going in.

    FWIW I don't think the plotline would have benefited much from more time spent on it. It was already as Juniper put it a sub sub quest that if they wanted to they could have easily skipped.
    ```

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:
      ```
      I still consider that to be very tight timing, game wise. I mean its textual - Joon & Co pretty much roll their eyes when they hear its happening "oh wow the DM really threw this quest hook at us didn't he?" If the in-game characters think its neatly wrapped up with a bow, who am I to disagree? it doesn't matter that they could have shown up a month or so ago, we never see those months as an audience - for us its a plot point mailed right to our doors, same-day delivery.

      And I would not spend more time on it either - I  am saying it should be restructured so it doesn't require that. Like with Blood Doris being present for a longer stretch, having multiple interactions with the crew so that her listening to them feels more realistic. Or the whole plot having been foreshadowed in previous chapters, or connected to them in some way (like say the Dorises noticing the End is Nigh signs and launching risky projects they wouldn't have in the past). I don't think you even need to change much, just integrate the plot more into the world.

    It's abrupt, but I don't think it's unbelievable.

    From Joon's point of view, they've spend some time getting familiar with Dorises, to the point they start understanding what makes them tick.

    From Blood God Doris's perspective:

    > “Fuck that’s good,” she said, tossing the canteen back across the ward to Grak. As it passed through the ward, the blood simply slid off it, leaving it clean. She looked round at us. “We traded with the Blues, as much as we could, but we knew that they weren’t happy about it. And eventually, there were too many colonies in the blood exclusion, too many factions that were stripping the place bare, even with the heavy losses we were taking from the natives. There’s some scary shit out there, when you can only see through your sense of blood, probably even scary if it were crystal clear water, but it’s damned near impossible to kill every last one of us, and we can wear down nearly anything, or clog their maws with bodies until they’re choking to death on pieces of us.” She looked proud of that fact. “It didn’t take us long to be the dominant lifeform of our exclusion. And it didn’t take long for there to be an arms race among the colonies.”

    She was *happy* in that brief period of time where her civilization was halfway functional. She's nostalgic of that time.

    I think it makes sense she'd be so willing to be convinced (besides the extra incentives, like food and warm showers).

      ```
      For a brief moment in time, the Dorises in the Plane of blood were United, first under the oppression of the blues and later a a matter of survival in the plane at all.

      What u/Memes_Of_Production might be missing is that Blood God Doris was already acting less terrible than her counterparts.  *Remember, Blood God Doris could have already taken over the exclusion or she could have split (and defected) as usual but instead chose to wait*.  Choosing NOT to defect is a Doris already halfway on the way to cooperation.
      ```

      - u/Memes_Of_Production:
        ```
        That doesn't really connect to my objection - I have no problem with Blood Doris being different, of course she should be, thats the plot. My objection is more "why didn't Blood Doris just leave the room and blow past them? Why did she even leave now, having been able to leave at any time?" I understand that in-story reasons are given for this, they just feel thin to me. Blood Doris is stripped of a bit of agency to make the plot work.
        ```

        - u/Reply_or_Not:
          ```
          It seemed super reasonable to me.

          *Is it really so hard to understand why someone might be hesitant to start a genocide/campaign of indefinite slavery and cannibalisms?*

          Because that is the only other option that is on Blood God Doris's radar.

          Other Dorises splitting is no longer a net negative for blood god, it is actually a power increase.  **the math is completely different for Blood God** the question is if she wants the hassle of running things or not, and she clearly doesnt

            The impetuous for her defection in the first place is her lack of physical resources, food, shelter and all that.  Blood God Doris has clearly transcended the need for all of that (she can breath and eat blood).

  So one thing that isn't clear is how the heck is blood mage doris keeping that portal open? A portal to another location  is stable for a few months, a portal to another plane is stable for a corresponding time where bother planes' star alignments haven't shifted significantly, but here they have the third challenge of keeping the gate inside the exclusion zone,  which should translate to a much shorter period of stability. 

  Also, the team has been unusually chatty about the library around the Dorises. I wonder if they left enough clues that the new ruling Doris can find out she needs to stop anyone from mentioning that she is ruling the world in book form, so the library folks don't come after her.

  Edit1: Also^2 , Did the dorises stop aging because the original finally died?  If so this would give us a timeline for when the Dorises likely started cloning each other to kill, or at least  when the original finally started doing it too.

  Are there any good reasons June has for not using their immense wealth to immediately;  
  \* Get Velocity Magic, I believe it speeds up your thought speed which is one of his main limits right now. It would also mean he doesn't need to burn bones to get speed all the time.  
  \* Get Fire Magic, because they could do it in a day and its the kind of thing that great to have as an option.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    I think they don't know the trick for velocity magic (remember it can't be magic assisted), and maybe they don't have a safe way of unlocking fire magic without risking death yet, but that one is harder to justify.
    ```

    - u/Slyvena:
      ```
      \- They can make new Velocity Mages, its just getting very hard so you need to have a lot of money and influence (which June now has)  
      \- June has mentioned earlier in the story there are entad combinations that remove both the danger and pain of being set on fire multiple times until fire magic unlocks.
      ```

  - u/DeepTundra:
    ```
    I think they might be avoiding meeting the unlock conditions for Velocity Magic on their own on purpose, because overshooting the minimum possible margin for that would have long-term negative impacts on whatever Athenaeum manages it (Might and Motion per the Wiki). 

    And right now they’re theoretically on a short clock with killing the Captain, so maybe they don’t see urgency in spending time brute forcing either Magic when Joon honestly already has a really solid multi-mage combat setup. There’s also the possibility that they’d end up picking other things for those slots, given the info Reimer is compiling for them.
    ```

    - u/Slyvena:
      ```
      Fair enough. If that ends up being an explanation down the track I'll accept it.  
      Right now though, Velocity Magic would be a \*major\* upgrade for June. The ability to move at insane speeds over vast distances would open up a host of tactical and strategic possibilities that his bone-speed burning just doesn't approach. Thats saying nothing of what using both at once could achieve (though he probably wouldn't, because now you're starting to push into exclusions risks)
      ```

  - u/grekhaus:
    ```
    June has limited skill slots (iirc 40 skills total) and decided that those skills were probably not going to be more valuable than his other options.
    ```

    - u/Slyvena:
      ```
      Really?  
      He chooses to keep Mathematics, Logistics, Repair, Analysis, Logic, Optics, Research, Alchemy, Thrown Weapons instead?  
      All of those trump being able to move hundreds of miles an hour and think at the speed of a bullet?  
      All of those trump being able to generate, control and perceive through flames and heat?
      ```

      - u/grekhaus:
        ```
        Yes, really.

        Thrown Weapons has the virtue Range Finder which doubles accuracy for the purposes of distance. This notably applies to everything, not just thrown weapons - it makes him more accurate with Gem Magic, Rifles and Entad ranged weapons, including those made via Ink Magic. Also Juniper personally likes thrown weapons, which tipped the scales.

        Research, Analysis, and Logic taken together gave Juniper the synergy Virtue Narrow Expertise: Multi-Magic, which doubles his effective skill for the purposes of using two magics at once and allows him to treat his effective skill level as 20 in skills for the purposes of multi-magic benefits. They're also generally useful when it comes to making good plans instead of bad plans.

        Logistics gives the Worst Case virtue, which imposes a floor on how badly Juniper can fail at logistics - not to the point where he can never fail, but to the point where his failures can never be more than somewhat bad. Because Logistics got a virtue at 10, there is hope that getting it to 30 will give something else good on top of this as a low-hanging fruit.

        Optics improves his vision and has strong synergies with Gem Magic - in addition to allowing him to significantly improve the clarity of a lens or prism shaped gem on the fly while ignoring the facets requirement via a Gem Magic virtue, the improved vision stacks with the improved accuracy from Thrown Weapons and the homing nature of blue-spectrum Gem Magic projectiles.

        Engineering offers Runtime Analysis, which allows him to automatically make a number of deductions about how a piece of equipment would work without actually having to use it. It is also important for making use of Earth knowledge with regards to importing technologies not otherwise available on Aerb. Ditto for Alchemy, which handles the chemical side of things and which is important for identifying novel subtances.

        Mathematics went in on the basis that it works well with a mental build and because they were hoping it would have a synergy with the Research/Analysis/Logic/Logistics/Optics/Engineering/Alchemy/Library Magic cluster of abilities that he already had. This hasn't panned out virtue-wise, but it might do something at level 30.

        Personally, I would argue that swapping the Gold Magic in-case-of-glass option (which could be done using a companion just as well) for Fire Magic would be a great idea if he's already rocking Alchemy, but I'm guessing they don't actually have the Entads handy to unlock Fire Magic and historically going to Athenaeums to unlock new Magics has resulted in Spontaneous Quests, so I can kinda see why they're holding off on that one.
        ```

        - u/Slyvena:
          ```
          Wow, first off, massive respect for you being able to bust out all those details off the cuff. You've won me over on them not being bad skills at least.  


          Still Velocity just seems too shockingly good. Velocity Mages are known to be able to act with twitch reflexes at hyper speed while still having used higher faculties of thought within those reflexes. This to me would synergise so ridiculously well with his multi-magic build, not even taking into account whatever Virtues would get lumped on top.  


          And one of biggest limitations on Velocity is air starting to slow you down at higher speeds, he already has air magic cutting out one of the big drawbacks Velocity would normally have.  


          Void is a big risk for June right now, and the Velocity/Air/Dodge skill combo gives him reasonable reaction time and capacity to avoid it. (Or at least maneuver his body to get hit in a non-vital part).
          ```

          - u/grekhaus:
            ```
            As far as not unlocking Velocity magic goes, its kinda hard to unlock it without making enemies of the Athenaeum responsible. They don't know the current benchmark and overshooting the benchmark makes it that much harder for new Velocity mages to be made in the future. I imagine it might be on the to-do list at some point (Velocity Magic IS very good, after all) but they'll want to do some research first and get ready for the whole Spontaneous Quests/Narrative Problems complication.

  Would any of you like to have Doris's power IRL? There's some minor benefits, but it seems more trouble than its worth, especially if you're in a relationship.

  Ignoring the issues of disposing of corpses, and items disappearing after 24hrs, would you be willing to use it for item duplication? 

  For me:

  * Sedated throughout cloning and killing: maybe...
  * Sedated throughout killing only: Initially no, convinced myself into a maybe...
  * No sedation: fuck no

  With the maybes I'm not sure what the long term impact would be. Would it get easier due to anthropics, or harder due to trauma?

  - u/CouteauBleu:

    Yes, absolutely yes.

    For starters, if I use the power only once, and send of the clones to a different country, the odds of both versions of me dying of a random car accident or something similar drop to almost zero. That's already pretty great.

    I can provide hundreds of test subjects to test for dangerous treatments, provided these treatments can be done with me anesthetized for the entire duration (for instance, cryogenics).

    It's macabre, but I can provide cheap food to starving people everywhere in the world (in most cases, the clones will probably be fed to pigs or other animals or used as fertilizers, rather than fed to people directly), assuming I'm not excluded.

    If I'm willing to have doomed clones live for a few days or more before execution, I can solve extremely complex math problems, engineering problems, programming problems, etc (though we run into the "9 women can't make a baby in a month" problem fast).

    Seriously, the number of applications is staggering.

  - u/Slyvena:
    ```
    500% yes. But I'm probably in the minority of people who would be more than willing to die/etc for the greater good of the clone Collective.

    I'd institute self rules such as the equitable sharing of assets along each split, etc. When someone clones themselves, they are essentially giving up half of what they have to pool their added manpower together.

    The main benefit of cloning is you gain access to a group of people who share similiar values and beliefs to you and that you have a very good idea of their mindset/loyalties up until when you split off.

    I can easily see 10-12 of me moving into a large townhouse together and co-labouring toward the Clone-Collectives mutual benefit. It wouldn't be a lock in thing, clones could leave if they wanted, the clones that wanted to stay could simply split off a copy of themselves.

  Hey sorry could someone actually remind me who Peisev is, the person who sent them to kill blue in a bottle? I can't find him on the wiki

  - u/quetschla:
    ```
    Perisev is one of the dragons who visited Poran, he is the more thinking one of the two who has stories as his hoard - since he believes Joon is closely linked to the same phenomenon Uther is a part of he doesn't really want to risk fighting him given how thinks may shake out but instead gave him a quest to kill blue-in-the-bottle

  This comment is a lot late, but does anyone more familiar with D&D have explanations for the vow of peace and what powers Pinno might have?

    Regarding only the 3.5E Book of Exalted Deeds, not WtC, there are several "vows" that you can take, each of which requires a feat. To get the Vow of Peace, you first need to take the Sacred Vow, then the Vow of Nonviolence, and then, finally, the Vow of Peace. Feats are one of the most important character optimization points for a character, so giving up three of them is pretty extreme. From the Vow of Nonviolence:

    > First, you are constantly surrounded by a calming aura to a
    radius of 20 feet. Creatures within the aura must make a successful Will save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your
    Cha modifier) or be affected as by the calm emotions spell. Creatures who leave the aura and reenter it receive new saving
    throws. A creature that makes a successful saving throw and
    remains in the aura is unaffected until it leaves the aura and
    reenters. The aura is a mind-affecting, supernatural compulsion.

    > Second, you gain a +2 natural armor bonus to your AC, a +2
    deflection bonus to your AC, and a +2 exalted bonus to your AC.
    This exalted bonus does not apply to touch attacks and does not
    hinder incorporeal touch attacks. Brilliant energy weapons,
    however, do not ignore it. It does not stack with an armor bonus.
    If you also have the Vow of Poverty feat, the natural armor,
    deflection, and exalted Armor Class bonuses granted by that feat
    all increase by +2. If a creature strikes you with a manufactured
    weapon, the weapon must immediately make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + one-half your character level + your Con
    modifier) or shatter against your skin, leaving you unharmed.

    > Finally, you gain a +4 exalted bonus on all Diplomacy checks.

    Basically, people are more willing to engage in diplomacy with you, you're quite a bit harder to hit, and you can break weapons against your skin. Sacred Vow also increases Diplomacy, though not by a huge amount.

    Overall, it comes with enough special requirements that even if you have the book, you're unlikely to take it, but especially paired with Vow of Poverty, a low magic setting, or a character that it works well with (monk), it can allow some leverage.

  Loved this update. DFEZ is the perfect kind of fucked up.

  > Imagine being so shitty of a person that you would ambush and kill thirty of your clones so that you could gain four slaves, who are also your clones.

  Amazing line.
