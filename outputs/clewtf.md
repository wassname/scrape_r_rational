## Secret Krampus Entry Deadline has Passed!!

### Post:

If you wanted to enter, toooooooo late! Go work in a coal mine for Krampus as a penalty!

I was surprised to get so many people with a whooping total of 25 writers joining me for this little whim of mine.

All prompts have been shuffled and sent to everybody. If you entered and haven't gotten a PM from me, let me know immediately!

For anyone curious about the methodology for choosing who gets which prompt, I used the List Randomizer on [random.org](https://random.org) a couple of times until I stopped getting people receiving their own prompts.

I was surprised at the sheer variety of prompts submitted and how a good number of people stretched my idea of what makes a prompt, a prompt, in ways I haven't considered before. Unfortunately, you'll will have to wait until a month from now to find out!

Post any questions about the contest in this thread.

Remember, the submission deadline is 11:59 pm (EST) on August 30th and there needs to be a minimum of 500 words.
