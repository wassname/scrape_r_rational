  The video ends on the big question of what happens when there's very little that needs doing. The classic argument (used by a lot of transhumanists) is that new jobs will open up because of the readily available labor ... but there's a floor to labor costs, and that's the cost of paying someone's room and board. Given current trends, there will come a time when there's not enough paying work to support all the humans.

  But what happens then? The *Star Trek* future has everyone living on the government dole, but that's always seemed too rosy to me - I don't really buy that it would happen, given that we in America don't even have government healthcare. But what's the alternative to that when so many people are incapable of contributing anything that's valuable enough for someone to pay for?

    Sometimes I don't know what to think about technological displacement. We have been hearing about low productivity growth in the economy for a while now.

    What not enough paying work means, I don't know. I like to think that productivity growth reduces the costs in absolute terms. You have to assume that people will not want to spend money on newer services and products and in the mean time believe that the benefits of productivity growth will not be shared as lower costs to the consumer. Without that I don't see work disappearing. If newer services do not grow, you could go the [Jaron Lanier](http://www.amazon.com/Who-Owns-Future-Jaron-Lanier/dp/1451654979) route and argue that the best way to ensure that people benefit from the transition to a digital economy is to enforce stronger ownership of information.

    Personally I believe that people are equating the recovery from the recession in 08 as consequences of technological advancement. That is a logical leap that is not warranted. We don't know if the fears of technological growth are even warranted. If the economy gets back on track ([it is not yet](http://thefaintofheart.wordpress.com/2014/12/12/the-feds-motto-mistakes-must-be-repeated/)) Technology once again cannot be blamed for unemployment.
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      I am inclined to disagree. If we've not yet recovered from the 08 recession, that means it's been going on for nearly 7 years now. That's my entire adult life. This state of affairs is what me and mine consider "normal". Any eventual upturn will be just that - an upturn, not a return to normal.

      (Just my opinion. I Am Not An Economist.)
      ```

      - u/rp20:
        ```
        You still have to connect that problem with technological displacement. I mean Rogoff and Reinhart wrote a book saying that financial recession are long lasting and that the long term effects of it are well understood. http://www.amazon.com/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691152640

        Still you can clearly say that the Fed and the federal government did not do enough. Austerity was a problem and was counterproductive and the Fed should have pushed for a higher inflation target or go the market monetarist route and pushed for a NGDP level targeting. 

        The understanding is that unemployment is caused by friction in the market and when the economy shrinks due to a bubble bursting or what not, the wages are "sticky" so they do not adjust and instead people are laid off. That is a harm to the economy that we are experiencing right now. Governments doing nothing to boost the economy and the Fed not committing to a higher inflation target is keeping the economy underperforming.

      And you have to make 2 different assumptions in the opposite direction for your argument to work. The first one, that people will want to spend money on newer services, no-one is arguing with. The second one, that the benefits of increased productivity will be shared with the consumer, I'm somewhat skeptical of, because productivity growth due to technology has been happening for a while now, and I haven't seen lower costs for many of the services/products I consume.

    I honestly think there's going to be a basic income grant at some point.  Reasons:

    * It's the smallest concession that lets capitalism even *try* to accommodate the Death of Work.  It preserves market economics in the transition between the Death of Work thanks to automation and the radical simplification of supply chains thanks to on-site small-scale production using 3D printing, matter compilers, and the rest of that scifi stuff.

    * It's cheap to administrate, allowing the neoliberal ideology to try to further cut into the power of the state to order people's lives and social relations.

    * It can be explained to almost everyone.

    * Judging by what I hear in polite society nowadays, large portions of the skilled, productive elite support it as a way to keep society going when they don't need the proles anymore.

    * Politically, it's gone from a damn-near-utopian-socialist radical proposal just a few years ago to a platform plank seen in mainstream publications and supported among the chattering classes.

    Basically, neoliberalism is collapsing, but remains distinct from capitalism itself.  So, as actually happened around the Great Depression and World War II, it's turning out that large portions of the elite itself, between capital and the skilled professionals serving it, would rather sacrifice the *purity* of their capitalist system by making some concessions to the more well-behaved and better-dressed sections of the working class than have the whole thing collapse into chaos.

    TL;DR: We stand a solid chance of actually winning this one, guys.

    Given the potential hollowing out of the middle class and disengagement with the electoral process, I greatly fear the medieval cyberpunk future we are likely headed towards.

    In acknowledgement this potential threat, I move that is time for the Conspiracy to go into full-swing and rise to the upper echelons of society using [80,00 hours](https://80000hours.org/) as a resource for determining which careers will allow us to earn the greatest amount of money as well as the various state legislators positions expected to run unopposed in the United States to begin to change certain things before everything is expected to come to a head in the 2040s.

    While we specialize in the highest paying jobs available for each of our individual platforms the only thing that should label our alignment with the Conspiracy would be our devoting 10% of our earnings to Effective Charities identified using [Give Well](https://www.givewell.org/) and [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) and allowing our philanthropist activities to do the greatest good, spinning each of our stories to better fit the local politics, and building up public support for each of us while taking out during the next set of elections for state legislature those who run completely unopposed.  

    As long as some of us can get into these positions we can begin to offset the influence of the private, tax-exempt organization ALEC, possibly by infiltrating smaller/lower-population states first.  Then, after taking advantage of the polarization of each district initially we can reduce the chances of gerrymandering to make it harder for highly polarized bills to pass where possible, gradually infiltrate larger/higher-population states, and gradually begin making inroads on the federal level.

    If we continue to do such we may be able to cause a considerable amount of change and exert a greater influence on the future of our nation as a whole.

    I mean, earning lots of money and running for public office just seem like the obvious things to do as far as I'm concerned.  If we have an impending dystopian future on the way I'm either rising to the challenge or I'm going down fighting it the whole way.

    Still, this idea is severely over simplified.  What are your thoughts on ways to best deal with this possibility?

      Extremely astute idea.  Really, I mean it.  The huge number of seats left completely open to any and all competition is a major weakness we can exploit.  Low population densities make it even easier to get a legislative seat, as does ideological homogenization (it lets us only spin to one tribe).  We can also use primary challenges, which are turning into The Way To Go now that general elections are basically runoffs between pre-decided coalitions.

      >building up public support for each of us while taking out during the next set of elections for state legislature those who run completely unopposed. 

      Municipal and county-level offices are damned easy to get, too.  A friend of mine in college once became a Town Councilor by running unopposed for a near-campus district and having seven friends vote for him.

      The cycle time is too slow to have much effect on the course of events currently and soon it will be too slow to have any measurable effect.

  Here's a question I've been wondering:

  * What does /r/rational think of Guaranteed Basic Income?

  It seems like a quite popular fix to the impending employment issues mentioned in this video, but I have my quiet reservations. How about yall?
  ```

  - u/Artaxerxes3rd:
    ```
    Plenty of quiet reservations too, but even so I feel like whatever misgivings I have, you could chuck out most of the welfare currently in place in most places and replace it with a UBI and while you might have problems of various kinds, you'd still be a hell of a lot better off than before. 

    But since that realistically isn't going happen anywhere anytime soon, it's a different and difficult question to think about how UBI would actually come about in the real world. 

    If I was an absolute dictator though, I know I would probably instate it basically immediately.

      >But since that realistically isn't going happen anywhere anytime soon, it's a different and difficult question to think about how UBI would actually come about in the real world.

      It won't happen, but it's gaining traction. There's the Swiss referendum on it, which will most likely fail, but there are significant political forces in several countries which are looking at it or would like to implement it. The Australian and New Zealand Greens come to mind.
      ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    50 years too early.

    There's a transition coming up, where the amount of work people are able to provide becomes more than the amount of work people need to do. Not completely post-scarcity, at least as you imagine it, but moving in that direction. Before that point, UBI (and similar proposals) would be bad, because people won't work although there is work to be done. We'll only need UBI when there's less work available than people want.

    And the solution doesn't need to be set up decades before the problem hits, in the way environmental or humanitarian concerns work. UBI is at its heart just a tax and welfare reform. It'll happen over the course of one or two election cycles.

    It's good to start talking about it, but it is neither necessary or advisable in this decade.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The thing is that demand for work is artificially inflated by an inefficient system of resource distribution, i.e. prioritising what can be paid over what is required, so the resources that could go into the reduction of unnecessary labour, instead go into the production of unnecessary goods.
      ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      > UBI (and similar proposals) would be bad, because people won't work although there is work to be done.

      Is there any actual evidence of this? Didn't the only study show there was no difference between welfare now and the UBI?

      You gain all the people who don't work because if they work for 15 hours they lose unemployment benefits for example
      ```

      - u/Arandur:

        The evidence actually opposes it, although the only evidence extant is weak. The studied that have been performed indicate that employment will not significantly decrease under Basic Income m

  It all sounds perfectly reasonable to me, but considering this is r/rational, where the particular brand of 'rational' in use is the LessWrong variant (due to Yudkowsky's HPMoR being the codifier), I feel like someone should really mention that while all the stuff about labour replacement and increased automation is relevant and a more or less probably highly accurate description of the future, the video doesn't really begin to take the next important step. 

  I mean, if you're in this subreddit you've probably heard it a million times already, but first AI gets better than humans at chess, then Jeopardy, then driving cars, then a bunch of other things (and lots of people lose their jobs), and eventually, the day will come when AI is better than humans at building AI. And then FOOM, right? Recursive self-improvement occurs and the result is possibly a 'superintelligence', an AI drastically better than humans at pretty much everything. All of a sudden the labour concerns aren't as big of a deal, and the big question is whether or not we've built the AI correctly, right?

  That's not to say that it wouldn't be a bad idea to make sure the labour concerns are dealt with effectively - I'm sure there are plenty of utilons up for grabs if we transition through increasing AI capabilities effectively. Personally I think UBI is very promising as a solution for the most part, but it's politically seemingly very far away from getting anywhere anywhere and ofc it might not actually be a very good policy for some reason I'm yet to know. 

  But the big one to get right, at least if we're talking about AI, is the very possible intelligence explosion. 

  Or, you know, any of the other potential scenarios people talk about, like for example the multi-polar malthusian race to the bottom by brain emulations or whatever. The future is kinda tricky to predict.

      Possibly. If society is falling apart, that could result in slower economic development which might mean slower AI R&D from corporations and governments and therefore more time to research the control problem so when the intelligence explosion eventually comes about there's a higher chance of getting it *Right*.

        No.  Society doesn't fall apart and result in exactly the same number of competent individuals working on FAI while fewer work on UFAI.  That contradicts all available models.

                  But there's *no rational point* in torture, either.  It just provably *does not work* to obtain useful information.  It's useless, it's stupid, it's evil, and it's illegal, *and so they went and marketed it to the public as the one way to save us all from doom*.
