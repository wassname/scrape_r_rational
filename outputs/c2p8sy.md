  A lot of the things that happened in these chapters were largely things I expected to happen: a new exclusion, another conversation with the DM, things getting politically dicey for our fledgling republic, etc.

  I did *not* expect to watch Bethel rape Juniper, nor did I expect June to soulfuck away the trauma of it. This is... oof. I'm REALLY hoping that's not something that's just gonna linger in the background for 30+ chapters before being addressed again, because EVERYTHING about that situation is just... uncomfortable, to put it mildly. It's gonna be hard for me to focus on anything else while that's just quietly lurking there.

    ```
    It was extraordinarily uncomfortable seeing Juniper both try to justify it to himself and simultaneously freak out.

    It is nice that he has a "turn trauma off" button, but I feel like this is going to end badly.
    ```

    - u/Don_Alverzo:
      ```
      Yeah, the fact that Juniper likely wouldn't call it rape is one of the most uncomfortable things about it. Like, he feels *guilty* and is afraid to tell Amaryllis because he thinks it's *his fault*. The fact that he's fucking with his soul/spirit with that in mind is genuinely disturbing. He knows how fucked up it was, but he can't really process *why* it was fucked up, and so he warps the fear and disgust that he can't properly process into guilt, which is something that he *can* process but which *isn't* actually the proper response to the situation. He then uses those warped emotions and explanation for those emotions as motivation to *alter his soul* without telling anyone.

      There are just layers and layers of disturbing and unsettling to this. It's like an onion, if that onion *also* had a profoundly unhealthy reaction to being a victim of sexual violence.

      As an aside, I'm... not happy, because it's fucking rape, but I'll say that it's *gratifying* to see that for once there's a work of fiction wherein the teammate with violent impulses and no conscience or respect for the boundaries or wishes of others is actually causing problems for the people on her team thanks to those qualities. All too often, the "murderous" teammate is played for laughs, with little thought given to how poorly suited someone who habitually kills people would be to working with others. Like, the teammate who's supposed to be a "violent psychopath" usually just ends up being slightly grumpy with a particularly dark sense of humor (my brain goes to Jack in *Mass Effect*, though there are probably better examples). Bethel here is actually *completely fucking nuts* and that is, naturally, hurting her team tremendously. Even if you ignore her mutilation of Raven, her repeated death threats towards Amaryllis, and the joy she seems to take in tormenting her teammates and violating their privacy, she's causing tremendous harm to Joon here, and it's not entirely clear if she's so broken that she doesn't realize that, or if she does realize it and just doesn't care.

            ```
            Its interesting to see how despiet becoming more friendly Bethel still fundamentally doesn't understand human minds/ethics. She's copying human behaviours (in this case sexual ones) based on observation, and doing so very effectively, but without an understanding of the significance of them (e.g. consent). 

            There's a chinese room analogy to be made there

              ```
              The person in the room, Joon, understands the significance of consent, but the room he's in doesnt, because the room he's in is a sentient house with limited understanding of humans?

        My peer group calls the usual situation 'Fiona Syndrome', after the Burn Notice character.  It is when you have someone whose is deranged and violent only and until it would be a plot point, at which point (s)he is a team member just like all the others.
        ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        There's another layer still, which is that Bethel is also, in a sense, a victim of sexual abuse. She quite clearly has a power complex from being used for so long, and this is just the most recent expression of it.

        It's really not fun to think about, and it's *really* good writing.
        ```

        - u/vimefer:
          ```
          The whole thing comes right after a loyalty increase, even. Bethel (basically a crazy, broken AI) clearly has a toxic relationship with Juniper, and it's only going to degrade the further it goes - apparently raping him is how she deals with her past trauma *and* expresses her attachment to him.
          ```

    - u/shinghand:
      ```
      That "turn trauma off" button is definitely just putting off the inevitable shitstorm when everyone finds out.

      With all the drama that's happened in these chapters, I really miss when Fenn was still around.

    A further point of discomfort is that when Amaryllis does find out, I feel like she'll fixate more on pattern-matching Bethel's interactions with Arthur and Juniper than on the event itself
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      Damn, there is some crazy narrative space to explore with Juniper the victim/reactor vs Arthur the perpetrator/aggressor. 

      That and Amaryllis is going to have Juniper doing his best to convince her of his warped view unless she convinces him to undo the changes.

    ```
    I'm surprised Bethel hadn't used sexual violence in the process of finding new ways to torture people. She was getting bored she'd tried enough things, so I'm surprised she missed it.

    But I suppose as she didn't recognise her actions as sexual violence, its not something she's done before.
    ```

- u/sparkc:
  ```
  I love how the characters live in their own world and don't just go along with the plot. It's easy to notice when a work has characters holding idiot balls and forgetting what drives them but WTC's characters don't give a shit what the plot wants to focus on, they react and behave in accordance with there motivations and values.

  Oh shit, skin magic was excluded!? Well I know you want to dissect that and it's awful and everything but for Valencia that means she might be able to pass as a normal person for the first time in her entire life and that's more real to her than the exclusions long term ramifications.

  The worlds in danger and Joon's the only one that can stop it and is currently dealing with major tragedy and political calamity? That's good and all but Solace cares about the Locus more than any of that and isn't afraid to push for joon's time and attention. 

  Ditto Bethel who isn't afraid to voice her complaints at being used to provide medical care for thousands of innocent civilians after an unexpected emergency because her self-identity and autonomy are more important.

  Many stories will pay lip service to their casts differing perspectives and character but they'll fall right into line when the plot wants to focus on a specific conflict. Everything's streamlined because the plot's decided what's *really* important. It's a more subtle facade than the standard faults you find in unrealistic character writing but the fact that WTC avoids it is one of the things I love most about it.
  ```

  - u/ivory12:
    ```
    You're right; it is rare (and thus, pleasantly surprising) to read free fiction in which the characters are true to themselves and not just the narrative. On the other hand, it can be incredibly exhausting to read. There's a certain vicarious, reflected tension that comes from these arguments being retread *ad nauseum*. At this point, I really just want to be done reading about whether the locus can be fixed.

        The problem is whether the "sometime" will be before or after Joon's apotheosis. We can presume which Solace hope it is, but we can also presume which Joon thinks is most likely.

      - u/eltegid:
        ```
        At this point I just want Joon to go down there and stay with the locus while he heals from trauma. And if that ups loyalty and that solves the locus problem that will be great.
        ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Honestly, it seems like Bethel eating the bottle is the best chance they have. Sure nobody knows if it will work, but "uncontrolled magical interaction with totally unknown results" seems right up the Locus' alley.
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Re Solace, it seems like she's increasingly pissed off at Juniper and he's really not taking it seriously. Will be interesting to see what an angry druid can do, especially as her powerset might be one of the few things he doesn't have a hard counter to (since its not explicitly rule governed)
    ```

    - u/AntiChri5:
      ```
      I really don't see Solace as having much grounds for that position. They may not have found a solution, but not through any lack of trying. She can't complain that they haven't found a solution in a few months to the problem her own people failed at forever.
      ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      Solace's anger feels unwarranted here. Juniper doesn't believe you can deliberately boost loyalty, and that's the only real step she recommended so he had a good reason not to be doing it. I think her anger is more from Grak encouraging or supporting her in general or some that a catastrophe, like what just occurred, could kill Juniper or the locus off prematurely.

      I also think Juniper's mental drive to understand and dissect systems, along with his huge suite of observational and processing skills, makes him basically the hardest counter to druid's we know of. Far less methodical and skilled people killed the majority of them, 1 vs Juniper doesn't stand a chance.
      ```

        He’s not hanging out with the Locus though. They have a sort of down time, and he’s going out killing Mome ____ instead. Its loyalty goes up every time they hang out and he’s not doing it.

  I never know how to respond to rape scenes. There's a part of me that understands and appreciates that they're logical in their contexts sometimes and that they're a part of human experience. Even more so in fantasy settings or historical settings. But there's a much, much larger part of me that is overwhelmed with horror, disgust, and revulsion when reading them. At least it faded to black. I do envy Juniper his ability to turn down the trauma of it, though I suppose it'll function as an extremely distasteful Chekov's Gun in the future.
  ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    While you envy Juniper I envy the ability of some readers to react so emotionally to a story.

    I have certainly been overcome with disgust and revulsion physically but never from reading. I feel like reading must be so much more visceral and satisfying for you.

      Some emotions transfer more easily through different kinds of media for some reason. I get disgust, fear, and anxiety very viscerally from television and movies (to the extent I can;t stand comedy shows that thrive on character awkwardness, even when they are objectively great) but through written fiction feelings like grief and awe are conveyed more

      I expect Amaryllis to find the modification to his priorities when she's checking his soul/spirit later and figuring it out after. Juniper is definitely the type to try to hide it with some hasty and flimsy justifications about group cohesion when really he wants it hidden so he won't seem/feel weak or out of control. I'm just hoping it doesn't go full CW and result in drama because of a misunderstanding when it comes out. I do hope it results in conflict, but I'd prefer that it be caused by people reacting to what actually happened.

      Dreams aren't that reliable a mirror of the soul though, any more than arousal. Even odds he gets a regular wet dream out of it and she feels vindicated.

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Bethel absolutely knew what she was doing. With all the entads she has access to, reading pulse/hormone response/subvocalizations is likely only a fraction of the access she has to Juniper's state of mind.

      An entad that let her feel what he felt might have this effect, or it might not. She very clearly doesn't have a problem with causing suffering.
      ```

      - u/RetardedWabbit:
        ```
        She's an alien intelligence that was sexually abused and had a very low IQ for most of her life. She has a huge bag of tricks but not the intuition, desire, or experience to apply them to most social situations let alone sexual ones. "He's aroused so he must want this" is something a lot of non-aliens believe, why not Bethel?

        Add in that physical responses to fear and arousal are closely connected, pulse and hormones for example, so if you're looking for signs of arousal you could easily misconstrue fear as a sexual response.

        Bethel is messed up, but houses don't rape people.

      - u/Gr_Cheese:

        Prior to this, Joon maxed out Spirit and put his extra points into Men. And, out of fear of pissing Bethel off and being... degloved... he faked it. Everything that was not 'Comply with Bethel' was put on a lower priority thread.

        So I think it's worth acknowledging that Bethel may have been entirely ignorant and incorrect about Joon's qualms with what happened, given his recent increase in skills.

        My personal opinion though, is that Bethel would have at least been given pause if she knew of Joon's reluctance. She ate Ropey, she's loyalty 18, and she's generally compliant with Joon.
        ```

          >My personal opinion though, is that Bethel would have at least been given pause if she knew of Joon's reluctance. She ate Ropey, she's loyalty 18, and she's generally compliant with Joon.

          After some time thinking about the subject, I came up with some conclusions:

          Bethel doesn't sees sexual abuse (the act, not the words) the same way we do. She does not feel violated by having to provide carnal pleasure to another, but she feels it when others try to forcibly tamper with her ego (by permanently adding entads to the house).    
          She pretty much admits in that 164 that that's the first time she's going to experience a sex act *actually* involving her/emotionally engaging¹ for her. But she also implicitly admits this when she told him (and to the others) what Uther had her do with him and then told what the *his* threats was, and then saying that she doesn't understand why they get disgusted/horrified with the *first* (which she doesn't care about), but not with the *latter* (which she pretty much *does*).    

          Bethel misinterpreted Joon's *motives* to be feeling what he felt.²    
          She thought he *wanted* it, but that his morals (all the "if I do, I'll be "cheating/betraying" all those people whom I have no real obligation to be faithful to" stuff) would not allow him to *willingly* accept it, but that he would roll with it if the choice was taken away from him(like in "I had no choice; my hands were tied; etc").³    

          Combine those two, and I find it very likely that Bethel thought that forcing Joon to have sex with her was more like her being forced to temporarily serve as an airship/hospital/indoctrination center, rather than more like Uther forcefully adding new entads to her.    
          More like something that to be uncomfortable doing because it goes against your moral values, as opposed to something to have an abject dread of.    
          And we even saw the effect of her being loyalty 18 in her actions at the end of 164 (not in the motions, but in the *dialogue*), she expresses a (slight) concern for Joon when he finally speaks to her, tries to assure him that she will not tell to Mary or to anyone about the sex⁴, even attempted to dissociate him from trying to pursue a relationship with her⁵, and saying that, in the rare case of her attempting to have sex again, it would not be with *him*.⁶    

          With that said, something that no one seems to have commented yet: Valencia knows.    
          Even if we consider that she is keeping the promise of not using devils in same room that Joon unless it is *really* necessary, even if we consider that Valencia and Joon had almost no interaction between 164 and 165, we still have an obvious moment in 165 where:    
          A) Valencia, Joon and Bethel are in the same room, and where;    
          B) we have evidence of that Valencia was using a devil.    
          That does not mean that she knows *everything*⁷, but she must have seen enough to be concerned about Joon, and to possibly self-justify some future use of devils in Joon to find out what is wrong.    

          1- "Engaging" like in "participating or becoming involved in".    
          2- And was later sufficiently fooled by Joon's self-preservation mechanism to continue to believe in her initial misinterpretation, or at least enought for not try to probe further about why joon sounded so strange at the end of 164.    
          3- When it really was "my body is betraying me and I really, *really* do not want it, but I'm going to roll with it for fear of the possible and *violent* consequences of denying you it."    
          4- And bearing in mind the alienness of the Bethel's mentality, and how she seems (dis)cosider sexual acts, I think it is more likely that she was *genuinely* trying to reassure Joon that she will not tell about his "betrayal" to anyone (because she thinks that's why he's acting weird, that he's afraid others will find out that he "betrayed" them), rather than hiding a rape committed by her (since she does not consider it by what it is, for her it can be just casual, if hidden, sex).    
          5- Because Joon's self-mind&spirit-fuckery was making him seem, from outside, as if he was *actually* considering becoming her lover.    
          6- Although this latter may also have been for somewhat more selfish reasons, besides her perhaps not wanting to put him again in a position morally difficult (for him).    
          7- Because, again, Joon's self-mind&spirit-fuckery, but too because Bethel has a mentality that may be atypical for *even* the devils.

            God damn that's insightful. I would genuinely appreciate this being canon.

            I'm curious to see if / how well Joon's spirituality perks work to obfuscate his thoughts from people like Bethel and Valencia. Until the author specifies, I would argue that it's a up in the air as to who knows what in relation to Joon's mental state.

          I would not be surprised if Bethel thinks something along the lines of "If he *really* does not want to, *really* resist, I'll stop and not mutilate him/screw him by telling others."    
          But whether or not she would be lying to herself no matter more *so* much now for, in the end, Joon did not resist¹ (comprehensively, since the fear of bethel reacting badly/violently to the overt and forceful denial from Joon, in that situation, was not one without base).

  I'm calling it now, future Joon is the DM.

  Also that scene with Bethel seems like a clear case of rape intellectually, but on some level culturally and emotionally it partially feels to me like Juniper had consented, even though I know it shouldn't, which really disturbs me. In the gender reversed scenario it would probably be considered unambiguously rape by all the readers. And I mean, I'm not a woman, but if an attractive man forced me to have sex with him, a part of me feels like I would at least try to enjoy it to some extent even if I really didn't want it, just to make it a little less awful.

  It really really disturbs me that any part of me sees this as "not rape", simply because the victim is male and the perpetrator is female. It's as if american cultural mores have sunk their teeth into my mind on some disturbingly deep level. And when I think about the reason it has sunk into me on that deep level, its maybe because if I didn't let it that could hurt my own reputation. On some deep level, american culture does not consider male victims of female-perpetrated sexual violence to be possible. A part of me is terrified of being falsely accused of rape, or of unintentionally pressuring someone into having sex with me, and so I overcompensate for that with a combination of paranoia and only having sex with people I would trust with my life (or in other words no one yet) and publicly condemning male human beings who commit acts of sexual violence as monsters, but not female ones. To side with a monster causes others to see you as one. In american culture, female rapists have more power than male ones, becuase no one really believes that a woman would be a rapist. If a man gets raped by a woman, the rapist can just accuse him of raping her. The only surefire way to avoid this no matter what is to avoid sex with women, or to simply be lucky enough to not get raped. Because if a man does get raped by a woman, he has no defense, our culture nigh universally will see it as his fault at least in part and on some level.

  Professor Quirrel's quote from hpmor seems relevant here:

  "You should know this to be true, boy, for you have made freer to speak ill of Dumbledore than you ever dared speak ill of me. Even in your own thoughts, I wager, for instinct runs deep. You knew that it might be to your cost to mock the strong and vengeful Professor Quirrell, but that there was no cost in disrespecting the weak and harmless Dumbledore."

  I thought I was better than this. The fact that any part of my mind is assigning any blame whatsoever to a victim of sexual violence, when it wouldn't be doing that if the victim and perpetrator had different sexes/genders, even after everything I've read about the mens rights movement, even though the example here is fictional and even though my mind is only doing that out of self preservation, makes me feel horrible and dirty.

  Also I will note there are strong parallels to what Joon did to Maddie and what Arthur did to Bethel.

    I'm kind of in the same state I was the first time through HPMOR, >!that is, in a QQ-is-Voldemort sense, where I'm not sure whether the author is trying to make it obvious that Joon will become the DM in order to set up foreshadowing, or whether the author is trying to make it that obvious in order to misdirect me into thinking that Joon will become the DM when he won't, or whether the author is playing another level higher than that, and the misdirect is itself a misdirect, and future Joon is the DM all along.!<

  wow uh that third chapter

  Let's speculated on that DM convo instead. That sounds easier.

  It seems the DM really wants Juniper to realize that the game is, in fact, *worth the candle*. I'm not sure why he wanted to redo the conversation at the end, though.

  > even if you don’t think the game is, well,” he moved his hand as if to tap at the book again, then looked down. “Dammit.” He looked back up at me. “How would you feel about wiping this conversation from your mind and doing it over?”

  It sounds to me like his heavy-handed attempts at telling Juniper that "the game is worth the candle" are not going as he planned and he wanted to reset? But he ended up not resetting, and I don't know why that is, either.

  For reference, here was Juniper's original "prayer" way back when:

  > “I don’t want Fenn to change because her loyalty metric increased. I want her loyalty metric, if she’s going to have one, to just be a reflection of how loyal she is, not an invisible lever controlling her. I want her to be a real person, or at least as real as I am. And … I’m hesitant to want that for everyone else in Aerb, because sometimes existence is pain, but … if they’re not going to be real, or at least as real as I am, then I want them to be real enough that I can’t tell the difference. I want that for the whole of Aerb, alright? I want to poke at the seams and find out that you thought of everything. And at the end of it, I want Arthur back. That’s the only way that this game is ever going to be worth the candle.“

  This suggests that "the game is worth the candle" means that the people in Aerb are "real" in some sense.

  So I think the whole point of the conversation is that the DM is trying to get Juniper to realize that Aerb is "real". Why? I have no idea.
  Especially since I feel like Juniper usually acts like it is, anyway.

  So in conclusion, I don't really know why the DM is saying the things he's saying. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

    >He tapped the book again. “I was debating giving this to you, but I suppose it can wait until you’re done. Offer not valid if you die, obviously.” He tapped the book a final time, and it popped out of existence. “I should get going, things to do, places to see, you know the drill.”

    He made the book disappear to add a little flair, then tried to point at it after as if he’d forgotten that it wasn’t there anymore. Seems to just happen to make it seem like the DM is fallible.

    ```

  - u/JackStargazer:

    If he's referring to "Worth the candle", based on Juniper's quoted prayer there I think it's referring to getting Arthur back at the end.

  - u/pku31:

      Mr Satyr over there is going to be shitting his pants soon (if he isn't already) when he learns more about Joon and his organization. 

      Joon is completely absurd by the standards of the setting by any lay observation, much less by the resources available to Mr Satyr/OIDR

      First of all:

      -Joon has his own *mobile base* that he used to  deploy his own *private army* for the clean up of the town.   This is going  to be the most obvious to Mr Satyr as it is probably what his day job consists of. 

      -Joon is immune to the anti-meme bullshit of the left over rats and other pests yet to be exterminated in the area. 

      -Joon fights the bullshit anti-meme rats and other pests …

      *publicly*

      *as an obvious, master, multiage* 

      *while seeming invulnerable*

      *who very obviously had the opportunity to soul-fuck thousands while he had those thousands in his way-bigger-on-the-inside, strategic-level weapons platform*

      -and now he  is interested in "rebuilding" the local polity and *oh*, the one public suggestion he had was *inviting in the rivals* of the local mage population. 

      soon, Mr Satyr  questions weather Joon sleeps at all.

      Joon really is a heavy hitter by now.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Not needing to sleep isn't all that mysterious, the tattoos is just expensive. I agree with the rest though.

        One thing that Satyr doesn't have the information for yet, but which could become relevant, is that Joon is a human who became a master still mage within hours if not minutes of leaving the Temple. In regards to the other magics he has, they could come up with explanations like him being a master soul mage who stopped his soul from decaying and also masked his age, or something like that. But unless he's a Renacim or Rhannu, there's no existing way for him to become so good at still magic within so short a period. That's scarier than any existing power he has, because he can gain new powers in such a short period of time. If you do some spying and find out all the magic he has available to him, will that information be relevant in a week? Maybe he gets substantially better at blood magic in that time, or he picks up velocity magic, or he's suddenly a really good gold mage. Who knows?

        The obvious explanation is that he's the next Uther, but I don't think Uther ever escalated in skill so quickly. Add in that he can get a lot of entads from Uther's caches instead of needing to fight various groups for them to claim them in the first place, and his knights are extremely strong already...
        ```

        - u/RetardedWabbit:
          ```
          Another connecting theory they could have is that he's the best soul mage ever and has been running around stealing mages powers/skills.

          He's walked away from fighting mages with their powers a lot. Restrained by a tattoo mage? Gained his power and killed him. He literally broke the last known soul mage master out of prison to kill him for power/soul monopoly. Goes into the still mage school? Tons of them die and he becomes a master.

          The more I think of this the funnier it is, it's a great conspiracy theory for governments to have about Juniper especially since soul magic is such a boogieman to most people.
          ```

        - u/scruiser:
          ```
          I think the more conventional assumption would be that he had previously become a still mage under a different identity and had concealed this.  It's not like they can detect if someone is already a still mage, right?
          ```

          - u/sicutumbo:
            ```
            It would raise questions as to why he would bother to get time in the Temple if he's already a mage.
            ```

            - u/scruiser:
              ```
              He claimed to be an agent sent to investigate, so they might assume he wanted/needed to see the temple from the inside?
              ```

            - u/Luminous_Lead:
              ```
              It'd be handy if he wanted to establish a new identity as a still mage. He'd get certification and documentation that'd help immensely with his new cover.

    Congratulations! 

    For me specifically, the art is somewhat mixed feelings. It's interesting to see the character the way you imagined it, but I've felt amaryllis to be somewhat of a <fill your own fantasy> sort of character (visually at least). As opposed to a vague description, seeing what she might looks like prevents me as a reader from mapping my own "dreamgirl" image onto the character personality.

      I sometimes have that problem with TV shows, though a little less with novels, unless there's enough art out there that it can actually get a toehold in my mind. One of the things that I thought about doing was something like the Trapper's Daughter series of woodcut prints, which (almost) never show her face, instead having her constantly either covered with hair or looking away from the camera (examples [here](https://imgur.com/a/Up2L2Nw) and [here](https://imgur.com/a/na40g4n)). But part of the purpose of the art is to give people who have trouble filling in the blanks something to paint in their mind where words aren't doing it.

      - u/LeifCarrotson:
        ```
        The face, hair, and expression are surprisingly close to my mental model. 

        It's the immobility plate that's completely different. Or did she just don some old-fashioned armor for this picture? I had been imagining something more like  Samus' Power Suit, but with smaller shoulders. Lots of sleek, polished plates that mesh in implausibly flexible ways, no spikes or steampunk vibes.

            I can barely give a pass to the void rifle, but if that's supposed to be the immobility plate and the flickerblade it's definitely not following the textual description:
            > Three mannequins sat at the back, only one of them with armor on it, **a suit of elegant full plate with a heavily stylized anvil on the front.** There were two swords. **One had a thin basket of metal around the handle, and I would have called it a rapier if its edge didn’t look too sharp for it to be primarily a thrusting weapon.**

            Yeah, same. I was definitely envisioning the armor as fairly cliche "woman's armor". Not boob-plate, but definitely slimmer. Also, her face is subtly different from what I was envisioning, though that's probably partly just down to art style.

      Gods, I could, but it would take a hell of a lot of work to compile. I *think* the rate has been hovering steady at about one per thousand words once it's published, and *roughly* the same caught by earlybirds since that system has been in place. So first order approximation for the total would be something like 2,000 typos.

      Of course, what you'd really want to do is chart it in two different ways: chapter the typos were caught in, and when the typos were caught, which I guess you might as well do if you were going back through all the typos threads anyway. (Typo reports generally get split up between GDocs, Discord, typo threads on chapters, the occasional PM, and AO3, which is part of what would make it a nightmare to track down.)

    That picture feels more like it came from _Warhammer 40,000_ than from _Worth the Candle_. Amaryllis looks ridiculous. Where is her helmet? Why is she holding a rifle and a sword at the same time?

    I don't primarily think of Amaryllis as a warrior, anyway. She can fight, sure, but her biggest contributions to the team (apart from her entad collection) have always been her analytical and social abilities, combined with her relentless willpower and workaholic tendencies. It would be more true to her character to show her at the head of a meeting or representing the party in negotiations or something like that.

    Also, I think the art looks pretty sick, though maybe would agree that it’s a bit unfittingly combat-focused for the character. I’m curious about how much it cost, if you’re willing to share.

    It doesn’t match my head-canon much, either — I always pictured Amaryllis as Lightning from FFXIII (and the rest of the cast as the canonical character models for Divinity: Original Sin 2). This puts me more in mind of Aloy from Horizon: Zero Dawn.

          I do also think that modern visual art almost certainly goes way beyond what's aesthetically pleasing, but that seems to be an opinion that's discouraged, so I suppose I *was* hypocritically contributing to that? Regardless though, you could have made your initial comment less outright insulting and tempered it up front with the "I really believe people are going to be put off the story by this art".

    They've only been mentioned in passing a few times, but that's probably enough to get the gist of what their deal is.

    Ch 128:

    > There was an equivalent to the Ethereal Plane, but it was badly out of sync with Aerb, and you could only get there if you were a star mage.

    Ch 148:

    > Late during Uther’s time on Aerb, there started to be disappearances. Raven became one of the missing: she was having a daydream of a shining palace on top of a cliff, and ended up there, leaving the prime material plane behind. As it turned out, one of the other planes, Xoltle, had been brought into collision with the material plane. Anyone who daydreamed about the place on Xoltle that was co-located with the dreamer’s physical location on Aerb would wind up on Xoltle, where they would be picked up by the insane hierarch who had set his sights on conquest. Uther had defeated the hierarch (naturally), then untangled the planes with star magic beyond anything anyone had seen before or since.

    Ch 155:

    >“Sure,” I said. “Just thought it might be relevant.”

    >“It’s not,” said Oberlin. “The second time we encountered the symbol of the man on fire, he was part of a demonic cult. They were out of Five Spires, urban, with a cluster of star mages creating a planar depression that facilitated possessions. Nothing world ending, we don’t think, though they were making an honest effort there at the end. There was discussion of the man on fire in their notebooks, and a handful of drawings. That time there were survivors we were able to talk to. They talked about him showing up in their dreams.”

    Ch 160:

    > (Amaryllis suspected that he didn’t know what the hells he was talking about. A skilled star mage could make a room that was bigger on the inside than the outside, but it was hellishly expensive, and the failure modes weren’t pretty. Nothing in the schematics had indicated the kind of reinforcement that you would expect, if there really were extradimensional spaces in play.)

  Alright, had a few days for a reread and thoughts on Chapter 164 to simmer. The biggest point I don't see anyone mentioning here is this passage:
  > I wanted to say that I couldn’t, that I didn’t want to, that I cared about her but that it was still a bad idea for a fair number of reasons. And then I thought that we’d already gone so far, so fast, this would already need to be explained, or could be exploited by her if she really wanted to, and if I pushed her off and told her no, then if she really wanted to, she could overpower me, or kill me in a thousand gruesome ways, or just hurt me, even if I could heal back.

  > And I liked it. On so many levels, I liked it, not just the purely physical, but the sense of the forbidden, the bad idea that I knew I would regret, giving in to basal impulses, the roughness and intimacy of it, the power she held over me, the fear and adrenaline, being her first, showing her what it was like … the more it was happening, the less I was thinking, the list of pros and cons got washed away into a confusing river of emotion and sensation, all moving toward the same destination.

  If I'm in the GM's shoes and committed to manifesting inner demons as love interests, that dichotomy right there is the reason Bethel exists. It's not a coincidence that Bethel basically acted out Juniper's fantasy of Amaryllis coming on to him, and it's really important to remember that Juniper responded exactly as she might've hoped.

  It's just that Juniper *also* has the brand-new ability to reach unforeseen levels of doublethink, to simultaneously give strong indication of consent while quietly having a panic attack. I'm not quite willing to chalk the timing up as another diabolus ex machina, but I have a hard time faulting Bethel for not taking into account a completely novel magic being used to hide the damage she's inflicting.

  (There's also a perspective issue that we as readers have an inside view of Juniper's negative thoughts, but fade to black while the other half of the dichotomy is driving. For obvious reasons, sure, but it does bias the account of what happened.)

  Another poster has made a comment about black and white framing not being useful in a nuanced situation, and I agree. I'm deeply uncomfortable calling this rape for a variety of reasons, mostly boiling down to the fact that the label distorts more here than it explains. Bethel's interest is as academic as it is purile, she doesn't put much emotional weight on sexuality in general, she wants to do something nice for Juniper, and she's calling in a favor. Juniper has incredibly conflicted feelings over his psychological quirks being expanded into independent sentient beings, is struggling with a heavy weight of cultural baggage, and is trapped between the fate of billions and preserving his own sanity. Both bring plenty of damage to the table. This wasn't a crime, it was a disaster.

  And maybe it's time to earn the fact that I'm posting this on an alt account. The line "I hadn’t actually decided that this was something that I wanted to do, and I felt a knot of fear forming" might use a literary trope, but it rings so damn true as someone who's been in that kind of situation before, multiple times. But I'm almost automatically dismissing the explicit justification as bullshit - the physical threat is never as paralyzing as the stuff in your head. When someone you care about, who cares about you, puts you in a situation like that it's easy to feel trapped but you always have plenty of options; and while it's going to hurt someone no matter what you do the only time I've *regretted* is when I ran.

  I doubt self-psychosurgery is a substitute for time and communication, but it's a damn sight better than fear.

  (And to swing the mood completely: how the fuck did the acting not get Juniper skill progress in Romance‽ Has AW just abandoned tracking that skill?)

    All the black and white framing and strong emotions running in the thread make me wonder what verdict a jury would pass on Bethel's actions. The popular consensus seems to be that it falls under the technical definition of rape since Joon expresses his lack of consent several times and fears the threat of violence. However, Joon's internal monologue also suggests it's partly consensual and Bethel never actually threatens Joon - nor does she seem to intend to rape Joon, as she's advancing based on her reading of his arousal. It's just a complicated mess of "said no but nonverbal was projecting maybe and was partly thinking yes but meant to give a clear no if given more time to think clearly but gave up because everything was too fast and [passage]." Guilty verdict with mitigating factors? Hung jury? 

    Also, how do laws and social mores apply across species (Bethel being on the extreme sentient-entad end)?

      I blame a lot of polarizing discourse around sexual assault for this, but things like "it being a complicated mess" and "joon partly wanting it" are extremely common features of most rapes, I would even posit the majority of them. We have real difficulty with the idea of saying that some rapes are not as bad, or more messy, and so on than others, and in fact not all rapes and rapists are created equally. You can, in fact, become a rapist without meaning to, and with no malice. The real world is complicated.

      &#x200B;

      However, none of that creates any ambiguity around the fact that ignoring someones repeated no's and climbing on top of them to pin them down is 0-ambiguity rape. The whole point of the entire consent framework is that, because of how messy sex and power and peer pressure can be, when a relationship is starting people need to communicate fairly explicitly to avoid a rabbit-holes of negative experiences. So i think a jury could well debate the punishment, just like the punishment between one thrown punch and a baseball bat to the face will receive different sentences, but the conviction is the same.

        I don't think it's possible for the same word to both refer to a [uniquely](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeIsASpecialKindOfEvil) horrible act and something that can be committed without any mens rea. Barring an inconceivable rehabilitation of the word, it's realistically not something that should be used if there's any degree of nuance.

        > However, none of that creates any ambiguity around the fact that ignoring someones repeated no's and climbing on top of them to pin them down is 0-ambiguity rape.

        For some people, that's foreplay.

        I'm not being glib - there is a sizable fraction of the population that genuinely enjoys playing games with consent. Bright lines are highly desirable from a legal standpoint (and a moral one, to a slightly lesser degree), but it's not tenable to proscribe sexual relations that specifically. The obvious patch is to say that such exceptions can be limited to established relationships... but now we're back to some level of qualitative ambiguity.

        And as far as the text has told us, Juniper can definitely get off on that kind of play. And Bethel has an unparalleled level of insight into crude biomechanics, which she uses in lieu of more detailed interpersonal skills. It's entirely likely that she thinks she's acting out his fantasies - *and she's right*. But sometimes, that's not enough. Loyalty 18 is pretty damn high, and I find it *really* hard to believe she would have acted as she did if she got an accurate read on how Juniper was reacting.

        (And while she's undoubtably being unacceptably reckless with another person's volition, I've also known a happily s&M couple that legit did not know to have a safeword after being together for 3 years. Responsibility around this stuff does *not* come naturally.)

          It clearly does, whether we want it to or not. Most laws make it pretty clear that "person A a bit less drunk than person B sleeping with them" and "dragged someone out into a back alley and tied them up" are the same exact crime. I dont even think this is abnormal, its true for most crimes - we just have ~*discourse*~ telling us otherwise, but of course that obfuscates.

          And you, uh, dont need to explain to a poly switch what kind of foreplay that could be ;). Which is why I feel confident stating how capital-R rape it is - those kind of power dynamics are things you play with in *established relationships*. It doesnt matter how Joon felt, because people's feelings are a hot mess. He clearly articulated his No, multiple times, which is the bedrock of the consent framework - because we have complicated feels, we have to put power in our will to determine the start of these kinds of things. I would be confident betting that 95% of people in the bdsm scene would label this as rape for precisely that reason.

          Bethel's insights are a great example of it actually - she has far higher levels of "reading someone's intent" than most humans ever could obtain, and completely botches it, due to motivated reasoning, personal biases, and with some active deception on top. It puts paid the idea that you "knew they wanted it".

            Ok, shared context then! ;)

            I think the core of my thesis can be summarized by the prediction that 95% is a significant overestimate even among the community that cares the most about this issue, and puts the most work into getting it right. Not out of disagreement, in so much as they would approve if the question/scenario was put to them, but in that the praxis that would have been needed for a happier ending isn't in routine use.

            I think this is something a large fraction of the population gets wrong with alarming regularity. Alternative lifestyle folks *need* stricter standards (simply because they're the ones actively experimenting with boundaries) and the mutual consent framework is definitely close to an optimal solution for real-world humans, but I'm hesitant to hold people to it universally without allowing for context. If only because it's such a potent weapon, and one that will inevitably be used on the vulnerable.

            > Most laws make it pretty clear that "person A a bit less drunk than person B sleeping with them" and "dragged someone out into a back alley and tied them up" are the same exact crime.

            Mostly a tangent, but I don't believe that's true - it's my understanding that the level of intoxication that inhibits consent* is the level where the victim is incapacitated to the point that they physically can't make their wishes known. I blame the misconception on a mix of wishful thinking and exactly the polarizing obfuscatory language in contention.

            *Legally! Morally is obviously a stricter standard! Can't stress that enough!

It puts paid the idea that you "knew they wanted it".

            I think a lot of the problem is that she's a house. Or rather, that she's likely never had a romantic experience in her life (and even the **thought** is a novel thing!), and that these are the clumsy first steps of an adolescent, despite (exacerbated by) all her age and power. I'm absolutely prepared to revise my assessment depending on how the next chapters go, but my model of Bethel is one where "you raped Juniper, and he didn't resist because you made him fear for his life" is a crippling nightmare scenario.

            ---

            Speaking of shared context, what are your thoughts on Juniper vis-à-vis the companion harem? I broadly subscribe to the idea that the Council of Arches really *was* designed to reflect off of his psychological quirks/issues, and that the DM doing such for a committed monogamist is a cruel move that forces a tradeoff between emotional and romantic development. Separately, I think monogamy is ultimately untenable for someone who seriously intends to achieve immortality, and that jealousy is a *disastrous* trait in a deity. Juniper as he currently is is \*not ready\* for omnipotence, not in the current context at least.

        Yet despite strong gut reactions to it, rape - particularly male rape - is ironically and sadly underreported. Victim blaming cultures, socially learned discomfort with discussing rape,  patriarchal societies and masculinity demanding hush hush all contribute to the mess. You can say the same of murder, yet murder law tends to have quite a bit more variation. However there is a bigger burden of proof in intent for rape and you have two sides - like in Bethel's case.

        I wouldn't say it's zero ambiguity, except in the technical sense and maybe that's what's causing the dissent. If someone says no and the alleged rapist advances anyways and the victim seems to consensually engage without expressing continued resistance, is that still rape? Is it the after-the-fact feelings of violation that determine the nature of the act? If there was an element of fearful coercion but the perpetrator was unaware of that being a factor at the time of the act, are they legally or ethically responsible for that? Lots of relevant jurisprudence in similar situations like rape in marraige or implied consent in relationships with skewed power dynamics.

          I think the text is pretty clear that there's no line to draw - by Aerb law, Bethel is property, end of story. If there's any wrongdoing at all, my guess would be something like tortious negligence by Amaryllis.

          > All the black and white framing and strong emotions running in the thread make me wonder what verdict a jury would pass on Bethel's actions.

          By Earth standards, there is very little chance of Bethel being convicted of anything as things currently stand. But if Juniper and Bethel were both determined to testify, you're looking at he-said-she-said with no physical evidence. My money's still on little chance of conviction.

          > Yet despite strong gut reactions to it, rape - particularly male rape - is ironically and sadly underreported.

          Generally agreed. It's a legally inconvenient fact that rape is a crime that can occur entirely within the head of the victim. Without defensive wounds or the like there can often be zero physical evidence establishing a lack of consent, and there are strong reasons why those might not happen on both sides of the gender divide.

          > If someone says no and the alleged rapist advances anyways and the victim seems to consensually engage without expressing continued resistance, is that still rape?

          As per my above comment - some couples consider that a fun Friday night. By the bare facts, not enough to establish any level of wrongdoing.

          > Is it the after-the-fact feelings of violation that determine the nature of the act? If there was an element of fearful coercion but the perpetrator was unaware of that being a factor at the time of the act, are they legally or ethically responsible for that?

          These are really interesting to consider together - if a crime could be committed by one's partner withdrawing consent during the act despite saying nothing, isn't *everyone* bringing a legal weapon to *every* sexual encounter?

          A separate thread, but if we're talking about personal violation then it strikes me that a large fraction of Bethel's personal trauma comes from the fact that she was forced to become a tool of coercion against her will. Not directly relevant to the dynamics of Chapter 163, but a slanted parallel.

        Bones have to be "whole" bones. I don't think that this is explicitly in the text, but it makes no sense for bone mages to not just carry smallest-possible splinters around instead of whole bones, if that were possible. Of the two(?) bone mages in the text, both are dealing with entire bones, rather than bones that have been shaved down to a more ergonomic size. Similarly, Juniper remarks at some point that many of the remaining unicorn bones are too big and unwieldy for practical use, which wouldn't be an issue if you could just take a sliver of them.
        ```

    - u/acinonys:

      Yes, that makes sense. Although even massive creatures might contain small bones, quick googling suggests that for example in dinosaurs the columella, a small bone in the auditory system corresponding to the stapes in mammals, is quite small.

    I assume they are useless from Juniper tapping them to fuel debuffing Mome Rath using his blood/bone attack. But you're right, surely not all the bones got drained and they're presumably super strong to be able to support it's massive weight.

- u/PastafarianGames:

  This means that the Narrative theory is true. [We already know this, from a Doylist perspective, but now Juniper/Mary should know too]. There is a journey plan and it has an end goal. The exclusion itself is not a spontaneous decision. The guy (entity, really) knows how to postpone the archery contest *exactly* so that Fenn gets to participate, and then he *doesn't* know that

    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Wholly depends on the Kenner's wording. If it has an explicit duration, then it, too, can be stilled. 

      But it doesn't matter. Even if it's not, getting once Prince per month is not an insurmountable task, so with a time chamber to pay Kenner off once a month and a new Prince once a month, it's basically unlimited, *mostly* uninterrupted invincibility in the common timeline.

        Sleeping would trigger the loss of the temporary levels in Still Magic obtained by sacrificing levels with Essentialism, so this is not a repeatable, once a month thing.

        Juniper has a strict timeline to eliminate sleep permanently, or faces losing all the sinergy between Essentialism and Still Magic. Also consider that after each level sacrifice it becomes harder and harder to level skills again.
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          Right, the sacrifice.

          So Joon has 14+1 MEN, which means he needs 55 skill points for the sacrifice. Hmmm, not *that* bad. He needs to level essentialism to 40 (if he hasn't already) to see if it allows to shift more points like he speculated.

    - u/UlyssesB:
      ```
      I don't think so. The "sleep debt" you build up isn't a property of Kenner's Eye, it's a property of your body. If the effect of Kenner's Eye is suspended by exiting the exclusion zone when you have such a debt, you fall unconscious. This couldn't be backlash from the tattoo, because it isn't magical when it's outside the zone.

      If you could still this "tiredness" buildup when you have Kenner's Eye, you could probably still it when you don't, so you wouldn't even need the tattoo.

Kenner's Eye had been pointed out as the easiest way to break open the Still Magic virtue, and of Skin & Still Magic, Still is the one that just became part of Juniper's toolkit.

The group has terrible odds in a fight (and between burrowing and the Egress, she can disengage trivially), and they can't boot her because she'd probably be unhappy enough to raze Anglecynn.

  I guess either they have to let the newly-threatening Draconic Federation fight her or Juniper can try to "soulfuck" her into some amount of sanity. Not only would the latter (doylist narrative thinking) be a reversal of her attack, it's been (watsonian) built up to with Ellio and Hyacinth, and Juniper visiting her soul during the Infinite Library sidequest.

  (As long as I'm writing, I really liked the Reimer chapter. It was fun to see the world from his perspective.)

    Replying to myself because I was poking around Bethel foreshadowing and ran into an unrelated thing:

    > “Juniper,” I said, extending a hand to her.
    > 
    > She looked me up and down. “Like the flower?”
    > 
    > “It’s a tree,” I said.
    > 
    > “A tree with flowers,” she replied as she took my hand and shook it. “Lisi,” she said. Her hand was limp and a bit cold. “Are you?” she asked.
    > 
    > “Am I what?” I asked, bewildered.
    > 
    > “Anglecynn royalty?” she asked. Again, she seemed annoyed that I was confused.
    > 
    > “No,” I replied. “You?” 

    She's asking because it's a theme for ~~the brits~~ [Anglecynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=anglecynn&go=Go&ns0=1):

     * [Amaryllis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaryllis)/[Cypress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress)
     * Aunt [Rosemallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_mallow)
     * [Lisianthus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eustoma) (Lisi)
     * [Hyacinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinth)
     * [Larkspur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larkspur)

    Wonder how old the tradition of giving flower names to royal kids is. Maybe Uther started it:

    > Uther was his character, the Best King Ever. I have a quest to find the Lost King. And he ... he planted a juniper tree beside astatue of a smith, and that was where he went when he wanted to think about me.

  I am happy that everyone here is treating the rape seriously. As a victim of rape I was scared that it might be swept under the rug as it was for me for a decade.

  When it comes to characters... To me this puts Bethel past the moral event horizon. It would take an awful lot to redeem her in my eyes.

  I certainly had an extreme emotional reaction to this part. Perhaps it is not rational for me to find rape more evil than murder. That said it happened to a protagonist, making this event somewhat comparable to if Bethel had murdered a party member for fun. The excuse of 'she didn't do it to us' doesn't fly is what I'm saying.

  Finally, is it right for me to judge her when her values don't line up with a regular human's? Personally I feel ignorance is no excuse, she is dangerous. Dogs don't understand they have rabies but we put them down anyway.

  I wish the author the best of luck in writing about this extremely contentious topic.

  Well, I guess I'm a lot less morally complex than Joon. If that Bethel part happened to me and I actually didn't want it, I'd just be angry at myself for not being more forceful in my 'no' but I definitely wouldn't think it was rape if it happened to me.
  ```

  - u/Memes_Of_Production:

    This doesnt deserve downvotes - Bethel totally raped Joon but however a person experiences such things is valid. I have known rape victims who considered their rapes no big deal and didnt care, its rare (and obv doesnt change the nature of the crime) but they exist and shaming them for how they feel can often be traumatizing in its own right. No Perfect Victim and all that.
    ```

    - u/CaptainMcSmash:
      ```
      Eh, it's fine. It was probably only like 1 person and you get those types that try and tell others the proper way to feel everywhere. I'm reminded of the Cyberpunk 2077 thing going on.
      ```

      - u/Memes_Of_Production:
        ```
        Oh sure, its not like downvotes will hurt you or anything. I just thought it was good to note for the discussion, for some people out there who think one must respond to things one way (Joon probably wont conform to our expectations)
        ```

        - u/CaptainMcSmash:
          ```
          Oh it is, but yeah its a shame it even needs to be pointed out though.  Having such a strong belief in your own moral outlook is kinda a problem in and of itself.

        Throw shade, please. That's just something you imagined because you strongly disliked what I said and that biased you towards coloring my comment as unfavorably as you could.

      - u/Memes_Of_Production:

        I think that is an extreme stretch that he was throwing shade. People can discuss anticipated emotional reactions to things, and you would need a much higher bar to claim that. It never even occured to me that that line was shade.

        (also you dont know the posters life story, even if you can bet the odds)

      Nah that's Juniper's thinking, he gives voice to possibilities and background thoughts far more than I do. Plus, even he doesn't think it's very likely, just a possibility. I'm less fearful of Bethel than Joon is because of what I've heard her say and seen how she acts so I would think it was even less likely.
      ```

      - u/eltegid:
        ```
        The scene is confusing as it would naturally be, but if you take into account his feelings afterwards and *his explanations of how he was feeling at the moment* he really was scared.
        ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    Bear in mind, Joon doesn't consciously think if it as "rape" either. He's just uncomfortable and afraid enough that it's obvious to the reader.

    People do vary in their response to things like this, but there is an element of not knowing how you'll react until you actually go through something, too. I think a lot of people (maybe especially guys?) don't really expect the "freeze" response to danger or the intensity of fear and trauma afterward, and are surprised and upset/ashamed by their own reaction to danger.

  I always thought the concept and specific name "exclusion zone" were a Alexander Wales Invention and found them super duper neat. Cue my considerable disappointment when I recently (youtube feed for the series) found out thats just the word you englishman/women use for Chernobyl exclusion zone.

      Quote Joon: 
      >“Um, it’s like Chernobyl, which is a place on Earth where there was a horrible accident,”

      Which is ambigous. If he had said "its terminology we use on earth for...". Not that it matters.

  So... If Juniper has enough points for Still Magic 100 and Spirit 100, he should have enough points for Still Magic 100 and Any Other (Unlocked?) Skill 100, meaning he should be able to find out the virtues for the other 31 skills (40 minus Soul, Spirit, Still, Tree, Fire, Water, Revision, Velocity, and Languages) - unless he's worried about another exclusion, of course (like Still Magic 100 + Soul Magic 80, since even if the current synergy between Soul and Still Magic is fine according to the DM, I don't know if he would let him get Soul Scaphism with Still Magic 100...)

  &#x200B;

  Also, could he ask Oberlin about Uther? If Uther was embroiled in the civil war between the Endlings, maybe Oberlin was already alive back then... Although I'm wondering  if he subsists on books, too, and what that looks like\^\^
  ```

  - u/Fredlage:

    *Endling* doesn't refer to one specific species, but is rather a term for the last surviving member of a species.

  I was not prepared for that rape scene. I hope it gets addressed soon, because I *really* wasn't comfortable with the chapter of awkwardly ignoring it. 

  Also, now might be a good time to update the story's trigger warnings.
  ```

- u/GrecklePrime:
  ```
  I very *very* much would have appreciated a content warning or something for the third chapter. 

  I actually haven't been able to finish it, it makes me that much uncomfortable. Is it fine to skip to the next chapter? How much info would I lose? Will I be lost?
  ```

  - u/arenavanera:
    ```
    It should be safe to skip.  The chapter ends after the event you're trying to skip, and the only thing you'll be missing is some info on Joon's mental state at the end, which mostly gets repeated in the next chapter.
    ```

  - u/Putnam3145:

    I think you can skip it without confusion.

  Thinking about the latest chapters, and I had two realizations.

  1) They can probably fix the Locus through an orgy.

  2) Amaryllis isn't worried about the sterilization pledge because she's already had a daughter.  One who can live more or less eternally under the right set of circumstances.  And doesn't care particularly about property or wealth.
  ```

  - u/MythSteak:
    ```
    Wait what?  

    Can you explain more of both of your points and site some in-text evidence?  I have not picked up on anything like that in the story at all
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      When Juniper looks at the Locus' soul it's this giant sprawling picture.  In the middle is a giant orgy which is creating soldiers to go fight (probably the second empire).  Others go off in the wilderness.  It's not implausible to think that the locus, as a being that seems connected to the abstract concept of life, is empowered through reproduction or sexual energy.

      Also, Solace is now Amaryllis' daughter.
      ```
