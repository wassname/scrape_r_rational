## GEB Discussion #13 - Chapter #12: Minds and Thoughts

### Post:

**Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid**

This is a discussion of the themes and questions concerning the **Chapter 12: Minds and Thoughts** and its dialogue, **Aria with Diverse Variations**.

**Translations**

This chapter is simply repeating one idea over and over with different examples to illustrate the fundamental problem. How can an idea be translated from one domain onto another domain? We face an enormous problem in translating meaning from one language to another. This is one of the biggest problems in Artificial Intelligence as people work on improving machine translation. Furthermore, what about the more unique aspects of one culture which has no obvious analogous counterpart in another culture?

Does anyone remember the Universal Translators we always see in science-fiction? To be capable of translating from an alien culture into the human culture when we already face difficulty between our same-species culture is bordering on magic (sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology* ). In fact in *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*, the [Babel Fish](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Babel_Fish), which acts as the universal translator was proven to prove the existence of God which contradicts his/her statement of him/her refusal to confirm his/her existence. Translation is a maddening task to understand the high-level meaning of a statement, map it onto a similar high-level meaning into another language, and figuring out the lowest-level words in that language.

How would you try to translate **GEB** into another language while maintaining all of the word trickery that Hofstadter is so fond of?

*The mangling of this phrase is deliberate.

**Isomorphisms Between Brains**

Interestingly Hofstadter mentions a puzzling problem in the field of Cognitive Science: how do we contain in our brains, our model of how other people behave? We are able to function in society by understanding how others would act and connect with each other. This is called the [Theory of Mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind) which is a significant stage in child development when a child is aware for the first time of the fact that other humans can have a mind and emotions like the child themself. However, how do people who are sociopath and psychopaths are able to understand how others act when they have flawed understanding of emotion behavior?

......

**Dialogue**

Warning: I spoil the answers for most of the questions in the wikia link about this dialogue. If you want to try answering them, then go to the link at the bottom before you read the rest of the post.

The Goldberg Variations refer to [Goldbach’s conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture).  The dialogue is also repeating statements made earlier by one of the characters in slightly different ways. I’m not sure, since I can’t tell if I counted all of them, but I think it occurs 30 times. In addition, Goldbach’s Conjecture has many variations on it with numerous mathematicians attempting to solve each one. This is remarkably similar to the music with multiple variations on a single melody.

I’ll just briefly mention that the problem of running a program which can be guaranteed to stop if there is an answer, but will run forever if there is no answer for the algorithm is a significant one in the field of Computer Science with some roots in the [Halting Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) and [Recursively Enumerable Languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursively_enumerable_language).

Wondrous Numbers are part of the [Collatz Conjecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).

The bolded letters are **Dboups** and by subtracting one (letter) from the word gives Cantor, or the mathematician who invented the [Diagonalization Argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument).

Note that the phrase the “very gold Asian box” is changed into the “Very Asian Gold Box” by Achilles. Why does this happen?

  You mean next on April 23rd? :)

  I can't think of a reason other than it belongs to the post-ending ending and therefore contains typos (Golbach Conjecture, p.404), double spaces (your__outstanding generosity, p.404) and maybe this swap?  Or is there more to it?  I have to admit I didn't really notice it while reading (Good catch :) ).

  ##### Chapter 12
  1. Can someone think of an answer to DRH's question [p. 373]?

    > Why did the Tumtum tree get changed into an "arbre Té-té" in French?

  ##### Dialogue
  The dialogue was very entertaining (again):

  1. At the beginning the Count calls for a composer to entertain him because he is not able to sleep <=> Achilles does the same with the Tortoise
  2. The count gives 100 Louis d'or to Goldberg, the Tortoise also gets 100 Louis d'or
  3. "wondrous numbers" actually refer to the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
  4. There are some puns involving copper silver and gold:
      - Kupfergödel, Silberescher, Goldbach
      - Copper, Silver, Gold: An Indestructible Metallic Alloy <=> Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid
      - The *cop*s (copper) named silva (silver) and gould (gold)
  5. I am not sure what the deal is with the giraffe/elephants/baboons title suggestions on p. 402 other than the first letter matches gödel/escher/bach, maybe someone else can think of something?
