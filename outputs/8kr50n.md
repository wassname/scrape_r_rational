  It might not have been the most *exciting* chapter, as you put it, but it sure was awesome. Peaceful negotiation between DBZ characters is something special to behold.

    Well, to be fair, the original meeting between Goku and the Ox King was resolved in quite a similar way. A bit of a scuffle that ended when Ox King recognised Goku as Gohan's pupil (it was because of the Kintoun there). Original Dragon Ball was more about adventure and less about straight up fighting, especially early on, before the King Piccolo arc.

  Obligatory ["Called it!"](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8ap9dt/rt_ff_wip_the_optimised_wish_project_chapter_4/dx0gfr0/?context=3).

    Kudos where they're due :D.

      Ooh, do I also get kudos for [calling the fake dragonball signature](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8ap9dt/rt_ff_wip_the_optimised_wish_project_chapter_4/dx2f96p/)? :)

        You do!

  I'm now suspicious of Bulma's motives - she has now had a significant amount of time to consider her wish with the knowledge that magic is real and that it will almost certainly come true. I'd give it 1:2 odds of her picking a new wish either at the moment of truth, or having done so already.
  ```

    ```
    "Have the man that I'll be the happiest, safest, and most prosperous with meet me in a natural manner at some point within the next few months."

    *Vegeta arrives on Earth about 12 years early*

    "Okay, Kakarot, time to come home or I'mma blow this planet up."
    ```

  ```
  Enough of a build up of chapters came out that I finally started reading :) Enjoying it a lot so far! Looking forward to seeing Shenron.
  ```

- u/SimoneNonvelodico:
  ```
  Not much to say on this one. A bit of transitional stuff, mostly, and an explanation of all that happened in the previous chapters, to lead into the grand finale of the arc. I hope I can get the first chapter of that down next week!
  ```

- u/Sonderjye:
  ```
  I am enjoying the story progression a lot. I wonder why whether Bulma will ditch her wish and instead wish that Goku can control himself during full moons.
  ```

- u/Silver_Swift:
  ```
  Great chapter!

  So Bulma and Goku did not go back to the castle, Mai attacked them instead. That makes Goku going along with the hostage thing a lot more plausible. 

  I am wondering what Pilaf and co are hoping to accomplish with the camera, given that if Bulma is planning some kind of double cross at this point they are too far away to stop it.
