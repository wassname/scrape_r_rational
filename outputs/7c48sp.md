    Thank you 8-).  I never really went away, although I did take a longer break than planned.  My effective average writing speed has slowed down by about half for the last year or so. Many pro writers have the same problem, so I'm counting myself as lucky that I'm not looking at deadlines on stuff that pays the rent.  I also have a *lot* of empathy for all the prose and graphic creators of near future SF that are in the middle of series or serials.  The interesting-but-plausible near-future zone has been moving around a lot, and I'm not the only one who has had to scrap stuff because of it.

    That said, I have the the big bits of cool stuff at the climax and end of Maker's Ark worked out and they're in sight.  I just have to figure out how to fit in something that really should have happened about ten chapters ago without killing the pacing 8-)
