  EE has been using lyrics very effectively in recent chapters. It's a marvel to read! I can't help but wonder, though, if this is the hand of the Wandering Bard. The fall of Keter would be incredible story fodder for both Above and Below. Catherine's nascent Name looks appropriately powerful - and may end up being a trap for her.

  Seems interesting. Is there a downloadable .epub ?

    Unfortunately no there isn’t, the author doesn’t approve of making and sharing epubs since he’s hoping to publish after the story is done.  But check out [bloxp.com](https://www.bloxp.com), it might be useful ; )

      This is exactly the sort of thing the author doesn't want people to do.
