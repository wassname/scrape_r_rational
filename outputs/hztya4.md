  This story seems to depend on the reader having a familiarity with the source material, in that it doesn't take any time to establish the characters or the world.

  Not having played any of these games, then, I'm going to give it a pass.

    Indeed! I don't think any paragraph I could write would capture the way Spiral Mountain exists in a reader's mind. All fanfiction runs into not wanting to waste space delivering exposition the reader is assuredly familiar with and video games invite their audience to inhabit their worlds more concretely than any other medium. I'll leave it to be judged if I leaned too far with this - but thank you for not assuming it was unintentional. I appreciate the feedback.

      Does anyone think it would help if I assembled an atlas of the geographical references, fill in at least the environmental detail or would that not affect the fundamental issue?

      Accessibility of rational fic to people outside their direct fandoms is an interesting issue in looking at this stuff as a genre to be compared against each other. I'd have missed out on so much from this community had I not happened to be into Animorphs and Willy Wonka

  Interesting. I don't feel like Banjo or Bottles are quite capturing the "Rareware character" feel in their dialogue, but that might be because we don't have Kazooie in the story yet - it seems like an odd choice to have her not present at the start, but I assume you've got A Plan for the bear and bird meeting that necessitates moving their meeting after Tooty gets abducted. 

  I assume from your comments and Banjo's mentions of Wizpig that you're building a "Rareverse"-style setting in the vein of /u/gazemaize and their Dahlverse. Presumably that includes Diddy Kong Racing and Conker's Bad Fur Day. Possibly it also includes DK64 and the various Donkey Kong Country games? Time will tell, I suppose. (Depending on the level of "chuck it all in", it could also end up with characters from James Bond and Joanna Dark to the Battletoads, so I will wait and see to what level you're taking this.)

  I find it surprising that neither Bottles nor Mumbo have brought up the existence of Jinjos yet during the discussions of magic - I thought that Bottles explained their existence to you when you first find one, but I could be mistaken.

  I'm also looking forward to how Brentilda and Cheato affect the story - against a smarter Gruntilda, the information they provide is likely to be key.

  I think it's good that you're writing and exploring spaces that are interesting to you.

  I'm sorry, but while I can typically mentally edit around minor typographical errors without too much loss of immersion, there are twenty-one instances in the three published chapters where quotations end with the closing full stop outside the closing quotation marks, and I find it all but impossible not to stop and stare at them when I see them, losing all context and finding myself quickly lost. Bottles' name is spelled 'Bottled' in one place in the first chapter. 

  If I was a diehard Banjo-Kazooie fan, I might be inclined to read on to see what you've done with the universe, but as it stands, the typographical errors and lack of context prevent me from entering an enjoyable reading flow.

    I like the full stop outside the quotations... but I should rather stick to the consensus style to not jar the reader. Kind of strange I could come to think of this kind of stuff as unimportant and writing as kind of this frivolous thing... perhaps I'll trade beta readings with a friend somewhere because I'm totally noseblind to these things. Thank you for giving such a thoughtful feedback! I'm touched, it wasn't even phrased negatively
    ```

      I went back and fixed those specific typos, and a bunch of endquotes that didn't have a period at all - a habit from internet posting that's tough to break. Hopefully having this interaction will keep me primed from not noticing this stuff in the future; if anyone has further typos feel free to PM me

    [This is a perfectly legitimate style.](https://www.capstoneediting.com.au/blog/how-to-use-quotation-marks-correctlyquotation-marks-with-other-punctuation) In Australia, it depends on whether the punctuation is part of the quotation or not. It's also common among programmers because it's consistent with how punctuation works in programming languages.
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      Since you mentioned programming, I'll just say that the *most* important thing stylistically is consistency: use tabs if you wish, use spaces if it makes you happy, but *please* don't mix them. Or in this case, ending quotation styles.

      (Also, as a programmer, I still much prefer keeping the punctuation inside the quote. It's part of the string, not an outside operator being called on it! ;p </opinions>)
