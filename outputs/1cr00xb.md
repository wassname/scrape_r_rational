Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Americana](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44511764-americana) - Graphic novel about the author's journey up the pacific crest trail. An easy, enjoyable read with pleasant art and a fast pace.

  [Whistles From the Graveyard](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62919353-whistles-from-the-graveyard) - Memoir of an embedded cameraman's war on terror. Jarring, atonal, and overall a very gripping read.

  [A Fire Upon the Deep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711.A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep) / [Rainbows End](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102439.Rainbows_End) - Vernor vinge writes exactly my kind of sci fi. Speculative, action-packed, and unafraid to be a little weird. I'll probably end up recommending his other work as I get to reading it. A Fire Upon the Deep in particular was a 5-star novel for me.

  This week I read [*Axiom of Infinity: Souleater*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/75831/axiom-of-infinity-souleater) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 


  It's a "Virtual reality game turns out to be real (and there's no logout)" portal fantasy story which executes very well. Specifically, Book 1 is complete (on Patreon and on RR in like 2 weeks) and moreso than like every other Royalroad story, the author manages to deliver from a narrative perspective and writes a damn good conclusion which still ends on a nice cliffhanger for book 2. 


  The author also manages to write the emotional/psychological aspect quite well especially considering one of the core elements is essentially nonconsensual body hijacking by the protagonist who is, like any sane human, not okay with this fact.


  Only negative dings would probably be that the protagonist is a bit of a special Mary Sue and I feel the "System" gets a bit too "in-the-weeds" with the infoboxes but these don't really detract from the story much.

    > Only negative dings would probably be that the protagonist is a bit of a special Mary Sue 

    That's why I bounced off it, up until I stopped reading it felt like the MC was getting a non-stop pipeline of unearned rewards.
    ```

  - u/aaannnnnnooo:
    ```
    Personally, I'm quite fond of how "in-the-weeds" the story gets about the magic system, since I love that level of detail, and it's a refreshing change compared to the majority of litRPGs, where the "system" rarely feels systematic.

    I agree that the protagonist can come across as disproportionately powerful and versatile, but part of that is intrinsic to Travellers as a whole, rather than the protagonist. They have access to more achievements that are consequently easier to get than the general population; as the story progresses, and we're introduced to more Travellers, I imagine it'd become obvious how unfairly advantaged they as a group are.

    Binged this after this recommendation - _thoroughly_  enjoyed it. 

    The only issue is, as mentioned, power creep/Mary Sue issues. 
    Part of this is compensated for by the limited nature of the resources he has at his disposal to pursue the skills and items he’s practically gifted with - but everything from his class to his nature as an isekaid fella makes that…less of an obstacle. 

    Still really engrossing, the mechanics of the system are detailed and interesting, and there’s a lot of implied secrets and background shenanigans in the world building that may make some of the power issues more intentional and central to the idea of the plot. 
    Maybe. 
    We’ll see.

  Alexander Wales' new project made me realize that TUTBAD has completed quite a while ago already. What do people think about it? I read the first few chapters when it came out, >!until shortly after the first dungeon adventure; I remember them moving into a house and they had to sell stuff they had found.!< It was a pleasant enough read but it didn't really *hook* me.

  I think what would make me interested is if the story was clever in some way. I always really liked the flashbacks to the DnD sessions in WtC where they analyze common tropes and so on. Is there anything like that in TUTBAD?
  ```

  - u/ReproachfulWombat:
    ```
    It's not bad by any means, but Awales' stories all have the same pattern and and I consider it his weakest work, so if you're like me and you get bored once you start to be able to notice and predict an author's twists and turns then I'd suggest skipping it so you can enjoy the rest of his writing more.

    To explain: TUTBAD, Thresholder and Worth the Candle all sort of read like worldbuilding exercises, with protagonists travelling between dozens of different 'settings' (cultures, worlds, exclusion zones, dungeons, DnD campaigns) where they spend a little while hanging out acting as writer's way of exploring his worldbuilding. They move on to the next location when they're done, leaving the previous one behind, never to be visited again. 

    Thresholder is by far the worst example of this, so you have to be really in the mood for a *lot* of worldbuilding to enjoy it. (The fact that each new thresholder that the protagonist meets gets multiple chapters of zero-interaction exposition and infodumping where they describe every single world they've visited in exhausting detail drives me crazy).

    I'm pretty sure Awales has worldbuilding disease and has managed to turn it into a writing career :v

    I give TUTBAD a solid 3.5/5 on its own merits. Good, but not exceptional. I drop it to a 3 if you're reading all of his stories in a short period of time though. 

    (I think WTC is a solid 5 all the way until the last quarter, where it drops off a bit, for comparison).

      Thanks, this was very helpful.
      ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    It's purposefully laid back. If you haven't read Thresholder, maybe that would be more for you. I do think TUTBAD is worth sticking with, but only if you enjoy the cozyness.
    ```

  - u/viewlesspath:
    ```
    I think it's pretty good. I enjoyed the worldbuilding a lot, as usual with AW, but only liked half the POV characters, and the slice of life thing felt lacking, it didn't really do it for me. Overall I enjoyed it, probably in the 90th percentile of the stuff I've read, but it's my least favorite of AW's recent stories.
    ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Do you like the characters? I'm a fan of all of them, and their little problems, strenghts, weaknesses, jokes and interactions. For that reason I'd recommend you read until Isras character becomes more clear. If that doesn't hook you, it might not be for you.

  I have been watching a lot of Hitchcock lately. I highly recommend The Birds. If you don't know anything about it, it's worth going in blind.

  >!In all of the examples of disaster or apocalypse media I can think of, the interpersonal issues of the main characters are weaved together or thematically tied to the event they are trying to survive (exempting films like Threads where the characters are never actually developed because the work is focused on portraying the horror of disaster and its larger impact on society instead). The Birds doesn't do that. It spends a lot of time developing its characters and then yanks those plotlines away once shit hits the fan, which doesn't happen until more than halfway through the movie. All the talk of budding romances and domineering mothers and bizarre pranks disappears because it doesn't matter anymore, the BIRDS are here. The BIRDS don't care about you and your silly problems, they are going to kill you. All you can do is shut up and grab your children and loved ones and do your best to block the doors because if you don't the BIRDS are going to get you. You had personal struggles before but now you have but one and that is the BIRDS. This movie has no resolution. Will you ever again be allowed to worry about what once seemed so important? Maybe, but that's for the BIRDS to decide.!<

    > The Birds. If you don't know anything about it, it's worth going in blind.

    I've never seen it, but I'm assuming it's an Australian romcom? Sounds fun, I'm downloading it now.

        I'm pretty sure the comment you're replying to was a joke, but I unfortunately also don't entirely get it. Something about "bird" being a term for women in Australia?
        ```

        - u/Noumero:
          ```
          Oh, I see. Yeah, I did wonder whether that was a joke I'm not getting (especially since cursory googling didn't turn up any Australian romcoms named "the Birds" or anything similar), but nothing came to mind. Apparently I'm missing the context for it entirely.

          u/viewlesspath, we implore you to explain the joke.

  Got into [Systema Delenda Est](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/83315/systema-delenda-est) from a previous rec thread.

  It's a fun read. Always enjoyed the genre where heavy sci-fi meets heavy fantasy.

  Any other works similar to that? Talking very heavy sci-fi so not things like Gate (modern warfare in fantasy).

        If you have a solid story with harem, you are better marketing it as harem first and as solid story second


        Otherwise the "solid story audience" will review bomb it because of the harem



        And even then, i have seen people trashing stories with harem in the title, due to them being harem

    Yes, I ripped through it a couple weeks ago, and it is entertaining.

    I have some questions about how Cato's automation is set up on his moon base. And if he has any actual AGIs working for him now, and how his culture worked out the ethics of that.

    The real question now is how Cato will break out of his beachhead on Sydea, seeing how quickly that system god intervened.

      > The real question now is how Cato will break out of his beachhead on Sydea, seeing how quickly that system god intervened.

      That was a portal into the one world where the God wasn't a dipshit. He could just a) try other portals until he finds one where the Gods are as evil and incompetent as in Sydea and b) at some point, I have a feeling that the bug God will eventually switch sides.
      ```

      - u/ansible:
        ```
        I was somehow under the impression that Sydea is a relative backwater (or frontier), and not well connected to the rest of the portal network. Meaning that the other world was the only next hop.
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          Yeah I'm pretty sure the only portal connections Sydea has are to bug-god-land and (previously) to Earth. The fringes of the system portal network are just a linked list, apparently.

  [Certain Dark Things](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16940712) - HP Fanfic - 880K Words - Ongoing Y5/7?

  I've been reading through Harry Potter Fanfiction and this one gets my vote as 'thoroughly decent'. It's an AU with a female Harr(iette) + Hermione and Alara (OC) as good-guy Slytherins.

  * 4/5 Stars for decent grammar, well developed characters, engaging plot, and creativity.
  * -0.5 Stars for cannon rails - while a lot of new and interesting stuff happens, most events rhyme with cannon, even if they differ quite a lot in details.

  This is a long shot

  I read a web novel years ago that I’m trying to recall the name of. 

  As I remember it the story contains magic, a female protagonist in a dystopia. She’s considered “underclass” and lives in the lower levels of the city getting caught up in some crime. Tries to enter the magic university that’s in the top of the city that is connected with a sort of lift. Manages to get in as a servant and later on manages to become a full fledged member, albeit looked down upon by other members. I think she had some sort of fire magic. 

  At some point in the story there is an attack on the university where she proves herself. There’s some scene where she ends up in the most secure part of the university where the dean loves with a big library of high end magic. 

  Does it ring a bell for anyone? It’s likely 5-7 years ago I read it.
  ```

  - u/VilhalmFeidhlim:
    ```
    Reminds me a little of Pith, although no fire magic - and that story was taken off the internet, I'm afraid.
    ```

    - u/Kazis:
      ```
      Oh I’m fairly certain it is Pith! Hadn’t heard it was taken down. Can’t seem to find any information as to why that is though - do you know?
      ```

      - u/VilhalmFeidhlim:
        ```
        Yes, actually! The author has taken it to an agent and gotten a book deal - I believe the new version, "Queen of Faces", will be in bookshops come December next year. 

        (Although you can still access the original via the Internet Archive, as it turns our!)
        ```

        - u/Kazis:
          ```
          Good for them! Wasn’t able to find it on internet archive, but I’ll have a proper look when I’m home and not on my phone! Otherwise I’ll just have to wait till it publishes
          ```

          - u/ReproachfulWombat:
            ```
            I'd suggest reading the IA version. The published version is apparently *wildly* different to the original. Like, completely unrecognisable.

            According to author interviews, It's been genre-switched to Young Adult for 'saleability', had "80% of the content removed in editing", and is now apparently a 'joyful and hopeful' novel about the trans experience. 

            A complete 180 on the dark, horrifying, dystopian original, in other words.

            The author is amazing so it's probably still going to be worth reading, but it's not Pith. It's Queen of Faces, an entirely new property that shares a few minor concepts with the original work.
            ```

            - u/thunder_crane:
              ```
              That’s really unfortunate. I don’t blame the author for doing all this given the deal she received but I have to wonder why publishers wanted the rights if they were going to change the majority of it

              - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
                ```
                Never forget that an editor from a publishing house wanted Wildbow to change Worm [into an YA novel that started with the words "'Take that, you worm!', Emma said"](https://old.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/7ps03s/hollywood_buys_the_rights_to_worm_and_starts/dsjmdws/?context=3)

              - u/suddenly_lurkers:
                ```
                Web serials don't adapt well to traditional publishing. Publishers typically don't like millions of words that are hard to break up into easily saleable segments.

                So after looking at how extensive the editing would be, I guess they figured they might as well rewrite the whole thing to fit the optimal YA slop formula. So they were really bidding on the basis of the author's writing ability, their concept, and their identity (weirdly important in YA world to avoid getting cancelled).
                ```

            - u/Kazis:
              ```
              Yeah that’s not really how I remember the sorry. Thanks for the advice!
