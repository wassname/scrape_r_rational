## Read-through of r!Animorphs: Ch1-5

### Post:

Preamble: u/Not_Baxtor and I are doing a read-through of r!Animorphs: The Reckoning, and posting our comments as we go. In order to not pollute the subreddit, we will post the above chapters in megathreads - the below parent comments have spoilers up to and including that marked chapter, along with an off-topic thread.

Feel free to join us in our read-through! One of us has read it and the original Animorphs before, one of us hasn't. And thanks to u/TK17Studios for the story!

Link to the next megathread: Coming soon

  Cool idea! But this is all pretty tame so far; if you're going to do the Cinnamon Bunzuh, you should probably be a *lot* more detailed than that, or else it'll be over pretty fast. Go crazy! Analyze every single little sentence!

  This is awesome! I've had the idea for a while to do ratfic "book clubs" either as a series of megathreads here or in its own subreddit. The goal being to let folks catch up on long fics while still getting the experience of theorizing/speculating about them with a group of other first-time readers.

    So I'm super happy that they went through and got every single animal that they could and acquired them. It really bothered me in the original how they just were getting the odd animal here and there, and only as required. Then they'd end up in situations where they needed something, but didn't have it ready.

      Yep, I'm assuming at this stage that you can maintain as large a library of morphs as you like, and there's no cost to doing so?
      ```

      - u/Not_Sophie:
        ```
        Without answering the question (nor saying if I even can answer), I've been thinking about the best way to address this - surely from their perspective they don't know those sorts of costs... like, I'd go out to the max, and acquire everything and every person I could. But then I don't know if I'd ever run into limits or break the machinery. 

        Is there a good way to think about this? It's like the problem of if you ever woke up with a superpower, how would you go about using it without knowing it's limits or if it would ever break.

        In this case though, they really should just find another Andalite to talk to.

    What the flip! Did Rachel just let the Yeerks know that they're being hunted? I understand she's angry and all, but there is *no* way that can be seen as a sensible move.
    ```

    - u/Not_Sophie:
      ```
      Yeah... bad move

      Although it does say that she only targets the humans, not the yeerks:

      >I focused on Melissa and her parents, mentally excluding the Yeerks they were carrying. The alien slugs would hear it anyway—they’d have to. But if my guess was right, they’d be unable to tell it apart from any other thought. It would sound just like Melissa, just like Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, my message translated into their own internal voices, just as Elfangor’s voice had been translated into mine.

      But I feel that being confident about that is probably not something that she can be, with so little experience.  


      It makes me think - I was impressed with the others raising the possibility of not doing anything in their earlier meeting. Having it as an explicit option. I feel that Rachel misses that completely, and that is her weakness:

      >About halfway through the conversation, I’d started to feel that pressure again, the itch of inactivity that made me want to get up and pace, made my fingers twitch and cut my patience in half. It had grown worse and worse as the others bickered and dithered, until finally I’d had to step outside to get some fresh air.

        Hmm, still can't excuse this. The result is to put the yeerks on their guard and totally throw away any advantage of surprise. Even if the yeerks are misdirected to suspecting Andalites rather than humans, the cost of this action is insanely high.
        ```

        - u/Not_Sophie:
          ```
          Oh, totally agreed. So that was her reasoning, and even if we think she can be confident enough that she is right about how it works (she can't be), it's just a completely rash move. Kind of like what we were talking about the other day about Death Note and letting L know that Kira even exists is the most costly mistake of his.
          ```

            TK17 wrote about this in another thread. Basically, the only way he could be true to Rachel's reckless personality from cannon and not get everybody killed in a rational world, was to have her make a big mistake and learn a hard lesson early.

            Remember, these kids are 13.

    >“Which raises an interesting question, actually,” Marco said. “Is there a mouse inside you right now?”

    I'm guessing this will come up again, but I'm super interested in this... I wonder if there is a whole bunch of other munchkining abilities you could do with the ability to just destroy things (if that's the case) - elimination of nuclear waste, anyone?

    >should bring spray paint and marijuana as cover

    It really would be hilarious if they got caught and stuck in prison on their first mission. Hilarious, without considering the fate of the species, that is.

    They should definitely cue up a really small morph like a fly as a top priority, if they haven't already.
