## Assistance Needed! [D]

### Post:

Alright guys. I need help here. I'm an atheist (was raised Christian) My family is still devoutly Christian. Me and my parents got into a big debate about whether there's a supreme creator or not. I said that, if there IS, I don't think the Christian God as we believe him to be is one. And even then, I only agreed because I agreed that a universe created by a supreme being that let it run itself looks no different than a universe that was created by no supreme being. 

Anyway: The discussion boiled down. She tried to tell me that Darwin's theories were mostly false and all disproven. And that he was psychotic. I tried to explain that if a "psycho" tells you 2+2=4, that doesn't make it wrong, that means you should justify it with a mass of other people. Basically, what I need is a short and sweet summary on why evolution is real. I get that Darwin was the 1800's and things have changed, so maybe some "parts" of  his theory have been unproven, but as far as I understand, much of what he discovered is the basis for the theory of evolution we almost universally accept today.

Any evidence for why we can be fairly certain God (at least the Christian God, as opposed to some ambivalent being)  isn't real would also be helpful. 

And also, PLEASE make sure whatever you say is sourced. If it's not sourced, I can't use it :( 


Thanks in advance reddit!!

  You should avoid arguing with your family. If your mother wants sources, however, then give her [this link](http://talkorigins.org/) and direct her to [this FAQ specifically.](http://talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-evolution.html) She has certainly been misinformed.

  This subreddit is not the place for requests like this, so I am downvoting. I wish you luck with your familial relations.

  I think it will be very difficult to change her opinion. It's not just a matter if presenting her with proof, it will be a difficult and gradual process.

  It also depends a lot on how open she is to changing her mind. But Creationism isn't (usually) one of those things people believe just because they haven't seen the evidence like what color of car is the best or whatever. When it's tied to deeply held identity (religion in this case) there's a whole edifice of myths and misinformation. Most likely everyone around her tells her the same thing and whenever she sees something pro-science, she just turns to Answers in Genesis or whatever, finds a "rebuttal" and dismisses it.

  So good luck.

    >Well, I can't offer up any proof for the non-existence of god, since there seems to be as much concrete evidence disproving Him as there is for proving Him- that is to say, zero.

    Oh boy.  You don't know what can of worms you just opened.

    Firstly, complexity priors are a thing.  Now the rest of it.

    Claiming that there's no evidence against the existence of God, no falsified predictions, is a *massive load of bullshit*, and actually an insult to the religions of our ancestors, the ones they *really* believed instead of [believing it made life more meaningful to believe](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Belief_in_belief).  Have you ever *read* an actual liturgy?  As in, actual prayers?

    [Here's a particularly pointed example](http://www.ourtemple.org/dnn/YouthEducation/HebrewSchoolPrayers/MaarivAravim/tabid/170/Default.aspx)  (taken from my own birth religion, so as to avoid offending others more than I already intend).  A reminder: this prayer is actually supposed to be said once each day.

    > Blessed are You, Lord our God, Ruler of the universe, Whose word brings on the evening. Whose wisdom opens heaven’s gates, and Whose understanding changes the times and seasons, and orders the stars in their heavenly constellations according to the Divine will. God creates day and night, rolling away light in the face of darkness, and darkness in the face of light, causing the day to pass and bringing on the night, separating day and night. God’s name is the Host of Heaven. The living and eternal God, rule over us for all time! Blessed are You, Lord, Who brings on the evening. 

    Now, I can buy that Maimonides, for instance, being a proto-scientist and a philosopher in his own day, had some massively "allegorical" interpretation of this prayer, along the lines of "Something something Cosmic Clockmaker something something God made the laws of nature blah blah."  But that's not what the prayer *actually says*, and if you read the *more* ancient commentaries, the Mishnah and Gemarah themselves, and particularly the Midrash, you don't find that our *actually religious ancestors* believed in philosophical cosmic clockmakers for their God.

    [No, they believed in the *scientifically beyond-ridiculous* but *otherwise totally obvious and natural* reading of the prayer, in which God literally moves bits of the world around to show the passage of time and set the natural order.](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/mlp-gameloft/images/f/fc/Princess_Luna_vector.png)  They also believed in guardian angels that walk you home from your religious services on Friday evenings, and in demons who brought bad luck but could be warded off by spitting.

    They also believed that a prophet, having been *literally* immortalized (that is: given immortality) by God, would visit every single household of their coreligionists during the same evening of an annual holiday, *Santa Claus-style*, and that we should accordingly *leave him a cup of wine to refresh himself.*  Hell, when I was younger, I actually saw someone walk off our lawn, get in a white sedan (small), and drive away, and figured, ha, *that must be the Prophet Eliyahu!*  Lo and behold, the cup of wine we'd left out had been drunk!

    (I wasn't *that* young, and my brain *did* nag about alternative explanations, but hey, I had an informed prior weighting my thinking in the wrong direction.)

    [During the same holiday](http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/jms/jms13.htm), we spill drops of wine, which is a curious example of how religion has been perverted these days.  See, my ancient ancestors would have admitted the simple truth: they spilled wine because they were talking about plagues, and spilling liquid onto the ground (as by spitting or spilling) *wards off the demons and evil spirits drawn by the open mention of disaster*.  Nowadays our so-called "sages" say it's because we have ever so much compassion for the enemy nation who God gladly slaughtered for our sake in the story of the holiday!

    Look at that!  Look at how a careful, humane, philosophical explanation was invented for a religious practice, *to cover up how it was originally an outright superstition* based in *such* a *flagrantly* non-naturalistic world-view that nowadays we might laugh you out of the room for proposing to write a *work of fantasy* in which the world actually did happen that way!

    [This was because the old, ancient religion *actually made claims about the world*, in everyday terms that any common person today would be able to check on Wiki-fucking-pedia.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4/belief_in_belief/)

    So no.  There are *loads and loads and fucking heaps* of falsified predictions made by *honest* religion.  [There are just *also* loads and loads of goddamned apologists who are always ready to *water their own religion down* in a desperate effort to keep believing in it instead of saying, "Well, it was kinda nice in a funny way, but that's just not how the world works."](http://lesswrong.com/lw/jy/avoiding_your_beliefs_real_weak_points/)

  Organisms have changed over time. The fossil record basically makes denying that impossible unless you believe in magic.

  Your mother believes in magic. Don't bother.

  > why evolution is real

  Evolution, like gravity and relativity, "is real because it is". You should instead ask why we _consider_ it real, at which point you can refer to what is possibly the most diverse body of evidence ever amassed for a single theory, the fact that we have literally observed bacteria evolve new capabilities, the way it arises from the basic function of DNA (it would be hard to see how mutation plus reproduction could _not_ lead to incremental changes over time...) and the total absence of counterexamples that don't fit the narrative.

  Keep in mind, all of life on this planet came about by incremental changes from a single-celled ancestor billions of years ago. _That's insane_. It would be entirely credible to disbelieve, if not for the _enormous weight_ of the evidence.

  PS: go visit a natural science museum with your parents! One with dinosaur bones!
