  I've really been looking forward to being able to post this chapter. 

  **Synopsis**

  Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

  Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

  _Save the cheerleader, save the world._

  This isn't an AU Worm fanfic, is it?

  [edit] The way that visions work makes no sense though. Either there's information flowing back in time, or there isn't. If there isn't, the visions are genuinely meaningless. If there is, then knowledge about how to do this should be the main payload of the message. (It isn't, so it's likely the former.) For a good treatment of "stable-timeloop" visions, consult Greg Egan's Arrows of Time, which is a "globally causal" world - the configuration of spacetime is determined instantaneously and globally, such that the only universe that can exist is one in which the use of time travel causes no contradictions. This leads to visions being both boring and self-fulfilling - knowing that a certain future is coming, people become fatalistic, allowing it to come to pass. (Which is, indeed, the most probable way in which a time loop can be stable.)

  Also: dude. Go find a deterministic set of children, touch them in a deterministic order, receive larger messages from (up to 150 years in (assuming you do it again when you're old)) the future. I wonder how many messages you need to pass through the compressed version of a seed AI?

  Unless you're very careful in setting it up, foresight is either broken or useless.

    I think you're remembering "Heroes".

    You're imposing HPMOR-style time travel onto another story.  It's fiction-- the time travel does not have to create "stable timeloops", per se.  For it to be rational, however, the rules do have to be self-consistent, however.  What if, for example, sending a message back in time destroyed the future for the intervening time between the delivery of the message and the transmission of the message.  Time then continues forward as usual.  This can be done self-consistently, and was executed in the highly-recommended Terminator fanfiction "Branches on the Tree of Time" [1].

    If you follow the model of time-travel I just described, then sending messages back systematically like that is *extremely risky*.  Each time that a ~10 second message is sent (I'm guessing that's how long the message was), Simon must survive in the new future long enough to send the next message.  What happens if, while waiting, he gets hit by a bus?  Heart attack?  Now the loops are terminated and he's dead.  10 seconds is not a lot of information, for having waited several years.
