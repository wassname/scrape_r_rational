  I have seen this reccomended a few times - what are the reasons that I should be reading it? Awesome action scenes, heavy emotion, good characterization ... ? 150K words (and incomplete) is enough that I'd like someone's analysis of *why* I should read it rather than just being told I should read it.

  Edit: Not to mention that the first chapter was apparently published in 2007, which means that it's probably never going to be completed.

    Good characterisation.  Good worldbuilding.  Near-canon competence porn.  Best treatment of wandless magic I've ever read.  Excellent treatment of magic generally, including obscure stuff like Occlumency and the cultural reasons not to require an unbreakable vow from every student never to harm another person.  

    The main points of divergence are subtle enough that it feels realistic, and the author feels no need to visit the stations of the canon - some *similar* things happen, but there's usually good reason.  

    It's a very strong rational fic, without being rationalist.

    The story had a two year hiatus at one point but has updated twice this year, so it doesn't seem too unlikely that it'll be finished to me.

  Seems irrational for Harry to pay for information that Dumbledore will soon be giving him for free. There's no real cost to Harry just assuming that he can't get out of the tournament, so even the slight delay doesn't provide much of a justification. Dumbledore would of course be much more thorough than any student in finding relevant information, as well.

  Additionally, Harry maybe should have bargained harder. He paid much more money than he should have. It would have been easy for him to, for example, point out that if she forced him to pay the bounties individually, he would then refuse to use her as a source in the future. The good will or slight trust of the Boy Who Lived is worth a lot more than the galleons she gained, he should have pointed that out and used it while negotiating.

  Wow, that test is really smart and sneaky, awesome.

  As always, I'm very glad to see this update.

  Man, I either need synopsis on these kinds of things or to stop reading so many works in progress at once. My memory on this story is foggy enough that I'm forgetting things, but I remember it enough that rereading it would be annoying considering it isn't even finished yet.
