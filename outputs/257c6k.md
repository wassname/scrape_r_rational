  ```
  On [Charlie's site](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html) you can read it for free (though it wouldn't kill you to buy a copy to give to a friend).

  There's also the [Accelerando Technical Companion](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Accelerando_Technical_Companion) which is woefully incomplete, but still helpful.

  And of course if you still have questions, you can ask guys like me who can probably explain anything confusing.
