## [BST][Q] Re-entry physics question

### Post:

For the purposes of hard sci-fi, I need to know the velocities, pressures, forces, temperatures, and electromagnetic dynamics something in the shape of a human body would experience while falling to Earth from 200 km on a geosynchronous (suborbital at that altitude) trajectory.

Is there any summary of physics formulas and atmospheric data, or a calculator or simulator that would help me determine the results of such a specifically unusual event?

[](#s "Our protagonist has two nanoassemblers, one the volume of half a lung, the other the volume of a full lung, and the mass of two human bodies, one cyborg, one android, to manufacture with. The android's brain runs on a nanotech quantum computer in the other lung, but the cyborg is a human brain augmented with nanotech *in neuro* and an auxiliary android-style neural simulator in their other half-lung. The cyborg has respirocytes in their blood stream, capable of both transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide separately. In this setting quantum computers are contained through laser cooling and thermoelectrics, all enhanced by nanotech.")

[](#s "The cyborg can be rebuilt after the incident. They have the technology. If necessary they can be reclaimed from neural backup and bodily reconstruction, but this is the absolute worst case, as they contain evidence necessary for their continued survival. The cyborg's brain and auxiliary computer has to remain intact and alive. In second-worst case they can backup the cyborg's mind, but the organic medium of the evidence is a significant chunk of their probability of continued survival. Similarly, the android's computer has to remain intact as forensic evidence. They can jettison spare mass i.e. limbs, however, if they survive the fall they will be in the ocean waiting to be rescued for at most a week.")

Is there anything the protagonists can do to increase their chances of survival?

[](#s "If they can't survive re-entry the ending will be significantly more literary than otherwise. This is after the main climax of the story, so I think perhaps this could be considered "falling action." Heheh.")

  I think xkcd What If covered similar problem, about cooking steak via free fall. The article is [here](https://what-if.xkcd.com/28/). If I understand it correctly, your protagonist can survive slowing in atmosphere without any additional measures. But covering himself in metal capsula can help. He should also (obviously) disable any sensory machinery on his skin. He should also try to manufacture parachute or something to help with landing.

  I believe the thing happening with temperature is a result of the ideal gas law -- you compress air in front of you, which increases the pressure, which means either more material or higher temperature. Obviously, to protect yourself from that, you need to keep the hot air away from you, which means having a good insulator around or just a large amount of ablative shielding. I don't have formulas or numbers on that.

  Forces -- you've got gravity and air resistance as the main things. (Unless you encounter orbital debris, in which case the normal force is going to make you sad.) We approximate Earth's gravity as causing acceleration of 9.8m/s^2 , and you'll start out with about 6% less than that -- not enough to make a big difference.

  At 100km, you'll start encountering atmosphere. You'll be going about 1400m/s at that point. You will decelerate to 50-60m/s by the time you reach the ground. http://hypertextbook.com/facts/JianHuang.shtml has some measured velocities for humans in free fall at terminal velocity at particular altitudes; you can do linear interpolation to guess at the acceleration and forces between the measured points.

  You'll get turbulence from wind. It gets pretty strong in places. Turbulence is an injury magnet because of the jerk and jounce more than the acceleration.

  Depends on the capability of the nanoassemblers.

  If they can control the angle of re-entry and have enough time to build an aerogel-density ablative heat shield out of surplus body mass, it should be survivable.
