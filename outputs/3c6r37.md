    I would really love a short description or reminder about each one.

     Obviously I remember four boys and 3 or 4 girls...

    Well, maybe I'll reread later sometime...

      These are my notes on them. I should probably finish updating the wiki sometime.

      Benisek. Chubby gossip obsessed, loud. Not concerned with magic, well placed family business. Friend of Zorian.

      Veyers Boranova. Expelled for violence, noble.

      Taiven. Skilled combat mage with a large mana reserve (up to level 3), crush of Zorian's, class assistant to Nirthak. Athletic and attractive. Aggressive and rude personality, her aid requires helping her with a mission a few days in to the month to retrieve a watch from the dungeon from giant spiders. Knows trick mana surge, where you saturate an area with your mana allowing you to sense mana constructs.  Can cast the incredibly destructive fire vortex spell. Knows a host of other combat and environmental spells of great utility, e.g. spider climb, feather fall, other survival spells.

      Akoja Stroze. Classroom assistant.

      Neolu. Perfect scores in warding, avid reader of speculative fiction. Was at dance with Jade, Maya, Kiana and Elsie who were all giggly.

      Briam. Firedraker owner, drake can cast fireball at will, familiar with a strong bond.

      Zach Noveda. Immensely powerful time looper, bloodline trait allows him to have a massively enhanced mana reserve and reasonable control. Extremely skilled, but originally pretty crap. Knows many combat spells. Last heir to house Noveda, socially powerful, though his family was weakened by its strong military tradition, connection to the royal family and deaths in the splinter wars due to them volunteering to militarily support the royals. The weeping plague damaged them further. Raven haired, kind.

      Raynie. Red haired goddess as described by Zorian. Attractive, good at classes, polite and reserved about her history. Only Kiana knows her history- she is the daughter of the leader of a wolf/human shifter tribe.

      Kael Tverinov. Feminine voiced morlock with soul magic with bone white hair and intense blue eyes. Alchemy expert. Medicine expert. Soul magic expert with soul sight. Has a daughter, Kana, and a dead wife who is the daughter of a witch, Fria.

      Tinami Aope. Member of Aope witch house who allied with Ikosia during witch wars for a house, rose to high prestige via use of Necromancy, Demon summoning and Mindmagic. Firstborn. Is shy, expert in spider lore, skilled at combat and has powerful pain causing purple beams.

      Estin Grier. Immigrant from from Ulquaan Ibasa, the island populated by necromancers.

      Kopriva Reid. Green haired member of green haired criminal organization house Reid (nothing was proven), swears like a sailor.

      Aneka and Armie - the (in)famous Ashirai twins. Soul bonded twins, as is usual for the Ashirai family. Giggly twits.

      Naim. First generation mage of some soldier.

      Edwin. Son of golem makers.

      Jade. Daughter of a high ranking member of house Witelsin.

      Ibery Abercomb. Student with a green turtleneck at the library. Crush on Fortov.

              Oh, and if you want admin powers for the wiki, feel free to say. As the author of this awesome piece of work, you obviously know all the stuff much better than I would. I think you need admin powers to do stuff like name changes.

              Although of course, your personal free time and choices and work are important, and this isn't to say I feel you have any obligation to do such things, just if you want it.

    I'm presently running a tabletop rpg campaign in this setting with only minor differences - mainly attempts to make the gamesystem's magic compatible with the way magic works in the story.

    It's going really well, and after just two ~5 hour sessions I've taught the players they *can* be hurt despite being in a timeloop. I had to hijack some cranium rats though. :/

  ```
  This chapter has a very satisfying feel to it, of returning home. I especially like how the girl with the bicycle shows up. When I think of an iconic moment in Groundhog Day, I think about Bill Murray checking his watch frantically and then sprinting down the street to catch a kid who is about to fall out of a tree. Nochka fills this same role as the girl he will habitually save (I hope!)

  I also like how Kael's experiments play out. While its glossed over compared to the significance of everything else happening in this cycle, the iterative cycled experiment idea is one that I think about on a daily basis.

  Zorian has dismissed healing as a serious discipline so far. Modern medicine owes a lot to the concept of the randomized, controlled, double blind experiment. If he were in charge of the hospital and could arrange for treatment A to be given to a cohort of participants and record what happens over the course of the month and then on the next cycle, he gives them treatment B instead... He eliminates the need for randomization -- eventually he can optimize the best individual outcomes for everyone who visits Cyoria's hospital!

  TLDR: I wish I could time-loop so I could treat my patients with only the best medicine or procedure that they need.

- u/Kodix:
  ```
  Ah, good ol' Xvim. He's just adorable.

  Also, I'm calling it now - Zorian will try and learn to use his telepathy in order to create memory packets for himself, or maybe just organize his memories better.
  ```

  - u/daydev:
    ```
    > Ah, good ol' Xvim. He's just adorable

    I envision an ending when Zorian has defeated the Grey Hunter, and Red Robe, and has woken the gods and defeated them too, and has mastered all the magic there is to master, and more, and Xvim is still unimpressed.
    ```

    - u/notmy2ndopinion:
      ```
      And it turns out Xvim is just a well-crafted illusion built to stymie the most-dedicated Mage by saying, "Not fast enough. Again."
      ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
    ```
    I think Xvim may be another time traveller. Or at least have some other “condition” that requires him to put such a filter between himself and his students that will allow only the most expertly trained ones to consistently waste more of his time and attention than is strictly required by the curriculum.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      But then why isn't he reacting to the obvious changes in Zorian?

      Either way, time-traveler or not, his actions are very *weird*. No matter how fanatical you are about the basics, he should be reacting in some way to Zorian's obvious skills with the exercises he's giving Zorian. His lack of surprise makes me think he's a [Chekhov's Gunman](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChekhovsGunman) in some way relating to the time travel....or the invasion.
      ```

      - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
        ```
        Maybe for somebody to be a looper is not a unique enough property to him to get interested in that person. He doesn’t even have to be a time traveller himself, come to think of it, — merely to know *of* time travel and TT loopers.

        In terms of [tES](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/General:Elder_Scrolls) logic, he may be the highest level [trainer](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Trainers) for exceptional people of such an extent that they’re not only benefiting from a time loop, not only willing to train incessantly while being inside (instead of pursuing hedonistic purposes, socializing, etc), but are also successful in reaching such a mastery that puts them in “top 1 percentile” even when compared to all other time travellers of their area or era.

        > ... [Missing] …[can only ever be one winner in this game](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091203/quotes?item=qt0337068). I am truly… [Missing] …

        Maybe Xvim was the one who activated the Sovereign Gate and anchored it to Zach, or at least has some connection or knowledge of the procedure. It’s also possible that even if Zach was given the better odds by the virtue of being the last member of a dying — and powerful — house, his victorious emergence from the time loop is still not guaranteed, and others can take the crown from him while the loop is still unbroken.

        >"... Do you know how many magic missiles I can cast before I run out of mana?"

        > ... average mages can fire somewhere between 8 to 12 magic missiles before running out of mana, while very gifted ones could manage as much as 20 or 30. Furthermore, while mana reserves increased with age and practice, they were not unlimited in potential – most people's maximum was roughly 4 times the amount of mana reserves they started with, and usually less.  ...

        >"50?" he tried.

        >"232," said Zach smugly.

          There's only really three possibilities:

          1. Damien comes to Cyoria (as Red Robe or otherwise).
          2. Zorian goes to Damien in Koth.
          3. It's just a bit of character building of no real significance.
          ```

      - u/Jon_Freebird:
        ```
        That makes a certain amount of sense, thank you for the explanation.
        ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    About RR's supposed absence and the possibilities you list, I think your condition for #3 is unlikely, but the odds that RR has given up is high (because we don't know whether RR thinks he's caught Zorian in the mass soulkill genocide of mercs). 

    Thinking about the reasons why RR would (apparently) no longer share his knowledge with the invaders, the main factor is probably that Red Robe realizing his rampage inadvertently changed the course of the invasion. However, we don't have any info whether this has been happening consistently in the recent loops.

    From what we've seen, he isn't part of the original invasion and might have only helped them to achieve his own ends. Perhaps he had a major argument with the lich (or even soulkilled him) after things went downhill post-aranea. 

    Because it's very likely he's using the invaders for something, he's probably still invested in their end-goal of summoning a primordial and razing Cyoria. It's also possible he's come across the same information as the matriarch that the time loop is destabilizing, so he can no longer afford to figure out how to make the invasion succeed like before. So he could be focusing on another solution in the background.

    Until we see how things go at the end of this loop, everything is still wide open.
    ```

    - u/Zephyr1011:
      ```
      RR knows Zorian still lives. The human mercenaries were killed during the aranea massacre, they were hired by the aranea, and Zorian met red robe the restart after that
      ```

  - u/notmy2ndopinion:
    ```
    Red Robe and Zorian may be seeing the effects of the butterfly effect of Aranea elimination in which subtle events are now greatly changing the course of each reset.

    Example: what if one of the Aranea originally used a military officer for intelligence? Normally at the beginning of the month, he sleeps in while getting psychically interrogated, misses a meeting at work and gets suspended. However, with the Aranea gone, he makes it to the meeting and deploys the troops to choke points in the dungeon (something the spiders wouldn't have wanted) and then goes gambling with his friends. Each die roll he makes, and the gambling habits of his friends are all altered... the winnings from the casino shift to different hands... And due to the randomness of the magic dice to prevent cheating, the outcomes are different for every single loop.

  ```
  Why doesn't Zorian try to pull Kael into the loop? 

  Zorian has identified the soul marker and Kael has soul sight. It shouldn't be that much work for him to help Kael to figure out how to replicate it. Once Kael figures it out, they can pull whoever they want into the loop. 

  Currently Zorian's biggest limitation is that he is operating alone with no one else to double check his assumptions and logic.  As far as Zorian knows there is only Zach and RR as loopers. While Zach is nominally on Zorian's side, his lack of discretion limits how much Zorian can share with him to collaborate. Kael is good at being discrete and has a skill set that complements Zorian's well. There are likely others that would be a good fit for a looping conspiracy that could also be added.

      Wow. I was looking at that name trying to understand what is the significance of it, and I totally missed it. But now that you mention it, the significance of Zorian's name has suddenly 'clicked'. "Zarya" is "dawn", so "Zorian" is more or less "Dawnian". And the time loop always starts in the morning. So *this* is a (anti-)Twilight story! But I suppose everyone, but me, connected that already.

        Whoa.
        ```

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  Just caught up with everything, and I'd like to wager that the aranea are potentially recoverable. RR obviously doesn't have the same marker as Zorian or Zach, and souls are not destroyable. So, simply enough, RR's marker is different somehow, and is being affected by the same spell anyway, or he is being affected by a different time loop spell entirely. To kill the aranea permanently, he would work some soul magic with his own marker to make the death condition in their souls loop back. He turned them into loopers after killing them, in other words. To fix this, if it is fixable, one would have to remove the markers from the dead araneas' souls.
  ```

- u/ancientcampus:
  ```
  I keep seeing more and more up-votes. I suppose I'll have to pick up the story one of these days.
  ```

- u/Cheese_Ninja:
  ```
  I think Red Robe may have decided that remaining in the loop wasn't worth the risk anymore and left it entirely.  RR thought that the Aranea and an unknown number of others had been included into the loop, and probably figured that he might not be able to find them all before they could ambush him.  This also would sidestep the issue that Zorian is currently facing of memories degrading over time.  RR would still be pretty fresh on what happened before he threw some wrenches in the works with the "dead" Aranea and mercenaries, assuming they'll pop back up when normal time resumes.

  As to why I think RR is capable of that, the Matriarch's message states: "[Missing] …can leave at any time. Thus, stopping him was… [Missing]"

  Unless she just meant RR leaving Cyoria at any time, which is a distinct possibility and works better in regards to him not needing a personal escape route from the loop.

  We also finally have a name for bicycle girl, "Nochka".  Still don't know for sure if she drowned in an attempt to go in after it in the other loops, but she does seem like she would have gone into the water now that we know a little bit about her.  Since her family only moved her a couple of months ago I wonder if they're part of the invasion forces?  If not, her mother has a surprising degree of awareness concerning the cranium rats.

  It would be funny if Zorian spends decades in here and Xvim never changes.  Although in this chapter, Xvim does seem to have run out of new exercises and is just grabbing whatever he has lying around.  I'm wondering if Xvim is just really good at hiding his surprise at this point.  I suppose next training session Xvim could set up an anti-shaping field in his office and have Zorian repeat everything.
  ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
    ```
    I have two ideas regarding Nochka, the bridge accident, and her mother.

    The first one is that her mother is a cat-shifter.

    >The .. girl wasn't there this time .. but .. There was a small-ish cat, probably a very young one, looking forlornly at the raging waters of the stream. .. **when the cat turned to look at him and their eyes met, he was assaulted by an intense feeling of sadness and loss**.

    -

    >Nochka's mother .. was honestly a little scary to Zorian. She didn't look frightening .. but it took only five minutes for Zorian to decide there was more to her. **Her movements were all fluid and precise, she never stuttered or wavered when she spoke, her gaze was frighteningly intense, and she gave off an air of absolute confidence and composure.** Frankly, if he had been alone he would have left the place in a hurry, but Kirielle didn't seem nearly as intimidated by the woman and insisted on telling her new friend stories. Such as the one of how they stumbled upon her in the first place.
    > 
    > "Ah yes, the strange brain rats," Rea said when Kirielle told them about their encounter with the cranium rats. "I've seen a few hanging around the house, but never in such numbers. Disgusting things."
    > 
    > Zorian frowned. Why were the cranium rats hanging around their house?
    > 
    > "You should be careful," he told her. "They're called cranium rats and they can read your mind, possibly even memories if left unmolested long enough."
    > 
    > "Hmm… **good thing I kill them when I find them**, then," Rhea said.

    So in this case what’d’ve happened is 1. Nochka would’ve tried getting the bike herself and drowned, 2. her mother would’ve eventually become worried, 3. shifted into her cat-form for better speed and olfaction, 4. went by her daughter’s trail and 5. ended up at the bridge. This is when she’d realised what happened to her daughter and when Zorian met her during one of his iterations.

    The second idea is just that the bridge has some bad property attached to it — a curse, maybe, or a monster lurking in the waters, etc. The point is that it makes creatures who try to pass over it lose things that they dearly care for. So, for Nochka it would be her freshly-gifted bike, and for the cat (which, in this case, is unrelated to Nochka’s mother’s mystery) — maybe one of her first kittens or something similar.
    ```

  - u/DerSaidin:
    ```
    My guess for RR is he decided the invasion is optimized enough here, and he is busy with other stuff. Because he doesn't care what happens in Cyoria this loop, this time the invaders there only had orders like "invade on summer festival" instead of "execute <detailed plan>".

    I don't think remaining in the loop would is in any way a disadvantage for RR, I doubt he would choose to leave. And he is probably too bad-ass to have been killed.
    ```

  - u/FTL_wishes:
    ```
    The issue here then is that he would have no idea of how skilled Zorian is when the loop ends. Yes, he could be ambushed in the loop, but that goes both ways, and he could have kept tabs on his enemies. His "fresh" memories will also be irrelevant, especially with actors in the loops still changing things.
    ```
