## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So, based on a post [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5vqlm9/rules_for_the_effective_hero/de49zx1/) I was thinking about how one might rationally justify plot armor as an actual superpower.

  Stories are human constructs, fit together after the fact and kept purposefully incomplete. Sense of purpose- imputed cause and effect -are what makes them memorable, but such things are creations of human minds rather than inherent to human events. *Good* stories, the ones worth telling, carry an implicit promise: [I am telling you this for a reason.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pFI9UuC_fc)

  That promise is the plot armor. In order for heroes to be protected somebody has to know in advance that their stories are worth telling. So it isn't heros as individuals who have the superpower, it is their contribution to a satisfying story which keeps them secure.

  In order for this to be the case within a rational fiction, some intelligence with the ability to manipulate reality has to:

  * care about stories
  * have a satisfying ending in mind
  * align events to meet that ending

  The obvious example of such an intelligence is an author. Characters becoming aware they live in fictional universes is already a trope.

  What I haven't seen much of is minor characters gaming their actions to take on prominence in such stories, using the author's preferences to tailor their actions and personalities such that they're more attractive to the author's needs.

  Worse, such stories aren't even self-aware since poking fun at our own story preferences is cloyingly meta. So interventionalist gods or simulationist AIs might be better targets.

  So: You know you're living in a world of stories. You've met main characters from time to time, you may even have felt the favored fortune of assisting them in their needs, but recently a close friend of yours died in order to provide the motivation a hero needed to leave their rut and cross the threshold of adventure.

  How do you become the last hero? How do you use its own story preferences to turn the tables on the intelligence in charge and tear the whole thing down?

    Speaking of that, there's something kind of similar with one of the two main antagonists of [Harmony Theory](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/48739/harmony-theory), an MLP fanfic. [Spoilers](#s 'I'm not too clear on the details as the author is still expositioning this, but it seems that a character is gaming the fact that, in this story, the elements of harmony behave as sort of enforcers of narrative casuality, to be a hypercompetent villain.')

    I have an idea for how this might work. It would take place in some world where godlike entities are attempting to construct a mythology rather than allow humans to develop their own. It could be a fantasy world where gods/spirits actively interfere or a sci-fi future with superintelligences manipulating memes and ideologies by creating inspirational anecdotes.

    However, because Deus Ex Machinas are boring, the "authors" need to make their actions seem like luck on the part of the characters. They usually can't take direct action so they just make sure people are in the right place and time to make the decisions the authors' want them to. Some authors could have different methods of accomplishing their goals and there may even be some sort of "audience" judging their success.

    If the story is going to be about fighting against this narrative causality, then you need to include some fatal flaw in the system that can be exploited. Maybe stories are "published" before reaching a conclusion so they frequently go off the rails, or the story has to end before being published so no one knows for sure how they'll be received. 

    As for how this story would actually work, I'm not sure. There'd either have to be some way for the protagonist to "peek behind the curtain" or everyone would know about this and not really care. I find neither an especially attractive option since they're very difficult to get right without hurting the story's actual narrative, so I'm hoping there's another option I haven't thought of.

    u/alexanderwales did something *a little* like this with Shadows of the Limelight, but the problem I had with that story was that all the characters came across as reality tv stars. I don't find it interesting to entertaining to see characters create the story they're telling to a in-universe audience when I want to have a story told *to me*. The magic system forced them all to be narcissists putting on a show, but I want characters to have depth.

    Nearest I can think of is to write this story as if it were about actors putting on a show. They're performers who do their job either because they want to or have to, but the story is about the people behind the masks rather than the masks they put on. I don't know how to reconcile that with the fact that the plot is about the show they're putting on, but it's the best I've got. Thanks for letting me explore this interesting idea.

    I tried to write a story about this once, but it was godawful and I deleted it.

    The premise was that we're all in a simulation that simulates free will by calculating as many possible futures as it can, and somehow chooses between them semirandomly. This was a major issue with my story since I have no idea how that would work.

    Processing resources per individual increase quadratically by how influential that person is - the more people they could affect, and the more possible ways these people could be affected, the higher the required resources are.

    It turns out that there's a relatively small number of resource hoggers, who end up affecting far more people in more ways than anyone else. This small group of people take up the majority of processing power.

    To save some processing power, the simulation limits possible futures these people could take. Since the creators of the simulation were big on free will, the simulation is limited in the ways it can pick futures.

    A lot of the time, these resource hogs are be nipped in the bud - the simulation can see that they might grow up to be resource hogs, so it tries to subtly change their environments to discourage resource hogging without impugning too much on free will.

    Sometimes, however, it blocks futures in interesting ways that happen to end up as cool stories. I did have a character planned that had a sort of plot armor, because many futures that ended in his death or incapacitation would have led to more processor use. I also had someone who was an absolute genius, but things would always go wrong at the last minute.

    There's probably lots of issues with my premise but I had fun thinking through the possibilities a situation like this could have.

  If a villainous agent who found themselves in the early 1970's with the ability to give out powers ala Cauldron from *Worm* had genocidal motivations (minus mutations and space whales), what would be the most effective way to destabilize human society and cause humanities extinction? 

  Constraints on the agents abilities:
  They cannot gain powers, and are in most ways baseline human.

  They don't know all that much about earth and humanity, nor that much about the technical details of the powers. As far as they know the powers are magic. Safe to use, but they are effectively black boxes. The powers come in the form of small colorful potions. They have effectively infinite potions, but must administer them personally.

  The powers are exceptionally varied, but spider man's powerset (Web, Climbing, Increased Strength/Durability, Minor Precognition) would not be considered especially strong nor week in this setting.

  Possibilities could include: 

  1) Cold War Stuff. (Igniting the cold war by giving powers solely suited for combat to both sides, ect)

  2) Brainwashing children into believing that humanity must be eradicated, then making them super soldiers.

  3) Arming existing radicals with powers.

  Unfortunately, 1 and 3 both require human political knowledge, and 2 requires human psychological knowledge. So I imagine their first steps would be to learn all they can about humanity and to remain out of the spotlight until he has a plan of action.

  I'm trying to think of methods that the villain in a story I am writing may consider, and the way the world would react to their actions.

    Give powers exclusively to the members of a single religious group. (I'd say "minority" religious group, but that wouldn't stay true for long.) Watch the world implode (preferably from a safe distance.)
    ```

      Preferably a group that seems especially loathsome to most non-members. A Westboro Baptist Church like group, or some organisation already bent on violence.
      ```

    Power choice seems the key here, so that's probably where education ought to start. It made a world of difference for Cauldron.

    If the powers don't work on other ill-tempered large animals (domestic bulls seem a pretty good choice, and we keep them in massive feed lots for ease of access) then I recommend the least mentally capable humans the villain can find. Scared and confused is almost as good as malicious, if they're powerful enough and unable to communicate effectively.

    Watching humanity react to these wandering disasters will provide both the psychological education your villain requires and a state of panic required to simplify human government interactions and hone in on other more devious plans.

    Seriously though, the world's domestic cattle gaining superpowers is one of the most terrifying things I've ever imagined.

      Unfortunately, humans are the only species (on earth, at least) that can receive powers in this setting.

      I do like the scared/confused idea, though. Feral children would be awfully difficult to deal with if they could breathe fire.
      ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    Can they give out the powers in secret, so that people don't know who from or even how they received powers?  Can they pick who gets stronger powers?  If so, reward superpowers to the most destructive and criminal people, such that people will realize the pattern.  A murder or two might get a minor power, a corrupt businessman or politician who get lead into the water or an outright terrorist may get a potent power.  People seeking powers will do worse and worse actions before they even get powers:
