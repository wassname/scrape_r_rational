  I was so paranoid during this chapter. Puar could be anything and anyone, and he's in control of the computer in a fully computer-controlled complex. First I thought he was impersonating Bulmas father or mother, but probably not - he's still having trouble with details, and Bills would notice inconsistencies in their behaviour. I did call him being the fake Bulma-voice and messing with the clock, but I would probably have called fake on anything. 

  And now we have a rampaging giant ape Goku in the middle of a populated city. Except for characters we don't know are present suddenly swooping in and saving the day, the only way to stop him is cutting off the tail. Problem is, how would they know to do that? Maybe spooky squad figures it out somehow, but Puar will of course still be working against everyone. Difficult situation.

    "Spooky squad", I like that XD.

    Maybe Yamcha can convince Puar to save them from Goku.

    Here's hoping that Spooky Squad's single day of rage training actually got some effect on Goku Kong.

      > some effect on Goku Kong

      Spoiling the next chapter's title... official name here is King Wukong :D.

      It's gotta be fear if Goku's transformation works that way.

        Itâ€™s triggered by the powerful emotion of blutz waves :v

  Oh, God that was an amazing chapter.  I love the fusion of horror with Dragonball's world. I knew Yandere Puar was going to lead to something great but never expected it to go this amazingly. Props to you OP, I can't wait for the next chapter.

  New chapter is up! Besides, I also created a new [piece of cover art](https://www.deviantart.com/ganhope326/art/The-Optimised-Wish-Project-772158503) that I think looks a bit better than what I used before.

  Damn, amazing chapter! I was really hyped after the previous one and this one didn't fail to live up to the hype!

  I've been waiting for this chapter and it turns out to be fairly good. The only thing I find strange is Puar character, is he really supposed to be so bad?

  Nice trick with Puar leading Goku out, I had to read that part two times to understand what really happened.

    Not in the original story, of course. But I've retconned a few characters already, I'm not being super literal. For example, Mai isn't a double agent for the Red Ribbon, and the Instruments aren't even a thing in the original DB. Spike & the others are real supernatural creatures, not men with fucked up histories and a serious case of chuunibyou. I'm following a bit the example of EY in HPMoR here - keeping a lot of details similar or close enough, but occasionally changing something around in order to make things more interesting and fresh.
