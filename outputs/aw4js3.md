  Well damn. Red's not doing too hot by the sounds of it. Glad Leaf is semi ok, I was quite worried. I feel for Red, having the psychic sadness mixed with the pressure would have been intense.

    Yeah, I’m honestly amazed he managed to stay on his feet this long.
    ```

    - u/PDNeznor:
      ```
      The way this is going, he might be close to his second trigger. Wait, wrong series.
      ```

      - u/The_Magus_199:
        ```
        Nah, second trigger would have to be something that mirrored the death of his father on a much larger intensity.

        Like, I dunno, a kid who retreated into depression after losing his parents in a car crash being pulled out of his shell by new friends and growing to rely on them only for his class to get into a bus crash where they all died, leaving him alone again.
        ```

        - u/PDNeznor:
          ```
          Just replace 'car' and 'bus' with 'pokemon' and 'more pokemon' and its basically a one-to-one scenario!
          ```

          - u/The_Magus_199:

            Damn, you got me. XD

- u/Silver_Swift:
  ```
  Wow, Red's really losing it isn't he?
  ```

  - u/Trips-Over-Tail:
    ```
    Unsurprising. He's dealing with the aftereffects of the Pressure, his own grief from overexerting himself psychically, finding dead children, witnessing people and his Pokemon being killed or wounded, and watched his friend and crush get terribly injured by a fuckhuge monster and had to carry her perhaps a mile or so through a ruined, practically war-torn city, still full of monsters and corpses, and sit alone in a hospital for hours while his friend his patched up without any support.

    By himself, without other friends, without his family, without his Pikachu, and without an adult.
    ```

  Ooooh boy, if this was a more stereotypical story then I would say that Aiko just set off the mother of all death flags. Especially with the kiss on the cheek she just gave Red before running into the burning building. However, I don't know DaystarEld well enough to be able to predict how likely Aiko and/or Jake will make it out.
  ```

  - u/1337_w0n:
    ```
    I want to know whether or not he's going to roll dice for it.

    Either way, good chance Aiko's not going to make it.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I do enjoy rolling dice, but not for this story.
      ```

      - u/1337_w0n:
        ```
        Well that answers that question.

        While I'm here, thanks for canonizing my OTP. 😊👍

    What strikes me is Aiko leaving her Abra behind and mentioning the deadline to visit her father several times, plus her reasoning for not staying with Green.
    ```

    - u/martiniguy:
      ```
      I missed her leaving the Abra behind, where'd that happen?
      ```

    - u/nipplelightpride:
      ```
      I don't think she left her Abra behind, it's just in her bag instead of her belt.

      And her name is Leaf!

    She's at that age, I guess...

- u/Memes_Of_Production:
  ```
  I feel like Red is getting some flak here, but in all liklihood he is correct - the risks here seem very high for a very uncertain payoff. The Second is being motivated not by a logical cost-benefit, but by a debt he owes - which is 100% a good thing to die for, human values matter, but Red and Aiko dont have to commit to that. I dont think Aiko is wrong to want to have her moment where she sacrifices and overcomes fear, but that can be used to justify anything. Red may be totally drained, but I see no reason to think he isnt the one thinking most clearly. (Of course both sides can be correct - sometimes you have to just defy the odds for yourself)

  &#x200B;

  Still, now that Aiko is charging in, I feel like Red should shift is mind after some thought - his loyalty to Aiko is much stronger than to random people, again human relationships matter. So I hope he does try to help later on in the next chapter.
  ```

- u/Trips-Over-Tail:
  ```
  If Aiko dies I'm starting a rival story where she doesn't.

  Maybe.

  Actually that sounds like a lot of work, I'll just headcanon it.
  ```

- u/elysian_field_day:
  ```
  Love how this story took a hard left turn from YA Journey into what amounts to a catastrophe movie kinda thing. I found the recent Zapdos chapters incredibly well-written, and as always want more at the end of this months chapter. Thanks!
  ```

- u/eroticas:
  ```
  I'm surprised a direct hit from a Pokémon didn't just kill Aiko there! It didn't really seem to hurt her at all... Maybe it's the difference between a baby drowsee hit and an actually strong Pokémon
  ```

  - u/Wolydarg:
    ```
    To be fair a drowsee probably doesn't need to hit that hard when hypnosis makes their prey totally defenseless. I can totally see their telekinetic power being underdeveloped in favor of a more powerful hypnosis/dream eater.

    Also that people can become crazy/vegetables after a dream eater attack is terrifying.
    ```

  - u/lazaret99:
    ```
    She had to rest and wait for the potion to heal her, so she was completely incapacitated and super vulnerable. I wouldn't say that she was barely hurt
    ```

    - u/eroticas:
      ```
      Right, but it does say something about the scale of the forces involved that it was more or less like a human punch.
      ```

      - u/lazaret99:
        ```
        Could be just the expression, paging /u/daystareld
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          Yeah, just an expression :)
          ```

        - u/eroticas:
          ```
          To elaborate on what I'm trying to say, even a single very strong punch by a strong human man (let alone any other ape) could kill the average person. So the fact that she basically got up again suggests it was, in fact, force on a human scale of things. Even if the force was more than what the *average* human could procure, it was not above the range of what a trained human fighter might be able to deliver, and far below what for instance a gorilla would deliver.

          This surprised me because throughout this story I've sort of been assuming that pokemon power is orders of magnitude above what you'd expect bullets and shields to be effective on, let alone an ape. if pokemon force operates on those scales, you would expect a human with a weapon to be somewhat more effective against them. Therefore you'd expect trainers to be armed with something more than just pokeballs (for the odd occasion when they ran across a pokemon low level enough to take on themselves). I thought the reason Trainers did not bother with conventional weapons, and the reason Pokemon themselves were not trained to use weapons, was that Pokemon were just so tough and so strong that an ordinary weapon would not realistically add anything to the situation. 

          (I was similarly surprised that e.g. Machamp could not carry two human beings and not be slowed down to less than a human's running speed - due to the absence of weapons I've been imagining bigger power differentials between humans and pokemon than perhaps were intended.)

          That is to say, if that's the best Drowsee has to offer in terms of brute force, (Dark type) Blue holding a spear would have a pretty good chance of slaughtering it. Add a gun and it's no contest. Which means the rangers would be carrying guns, just in case they encounter a situation like this.

          (Anyway, this is now more nitpicking about a relatively tiny detail than is necessary haha)
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Keep in mind that the weakest attacks in pokemon are things like "Tackle." A rattata's tackle would not expect to be THAT much stronger than a strong human punch, right? A Drowzee's Confusion is roughly as powerful as that, in game terms.
            ```

          - u/tokol:
            ```
            Jack has a machoke, not a machamp (but I definitely agree if it was a machamp). Since the machoke is cradling the boy rather than carrying him like a sack of potatoes, I think it makes sense as written.
            ```

    ```
    >storm ravaged streets

    This should be storm-ravaged.

    >Now that we're a smaller group, need for information of each person's capabilities are magnified

    Subject-verb agreement; I would change this to "**the** need for information of each person's capabilities **is** magnified"

    >crabby

    krabby

    >"Tracking and pokemon care." Aiko says.

    Period after care should be a comma.

    >It takes Aiko's eyes adjust with the remaining light outside

    "adjust" should be "time to adjust"

    >Where the distinction is drawn in her own mental landscape?

    I don't understand this sentence fragment fully -- I think it should be more clearly integrated with what comes right before it.

    >rush at the lipald

    liepard

    >encompases 

    encompasses

    >likely toward a the pokemon

    remove "a"

    >Aiko and Elaine are resting on against one of the barricades, shoulders leaning against each other as their backs lean against their bags. Eevee and Psyduck are resting with them, eating the same nutrient bars they're munching on.

    Two things: I don't understand why this narration is in present progressive tense instead of present simple, and the first sentence has "resting on against one", where either on or against should be deleted.

    >she the dread reaches her heart

    remove "she"

    >Some trainers just arrived that went in

    I think "that" should be in front of "just"

  Akio may still be being affected by the lingering aftermath of the pressure when making her decision to follow Jack into the building

  > The thought of just staying out here while the people and pokemon burn inside… she wouldn’t be able to live with herself, would never be able to look Blue or Leaf in the eyes again…  The memory of how she froze up when Zapdos appeared shames her all over again. *This is my chance.* 

  Wonder if she'll reflect on that when she has more distance from the event, assuming she makes it out alive.
  ```

  - u/nipplelightpride:
    ```
    Maybe, but I also think this is just Aiko's personality. Lots of people wouldn't be able to live with themselves if they could have saved a life and didn't try.
    ```

- u/Gummysaur:
  ```
  I see people calling this the “Stormbringer arc” or the “Zapdos arc” but I vote we name it the “Daystar tests how bad he can make us feel for Red in as few chapters as possible arc”. I mean Jesus Christ, someone give this kid a break.

  Awesome chapter as always. Fingers crossed that Aiko makes it out alive.
  ```

  - u/Electric999999:
    ```
    He'll feel even worse if Aiko dies in there, which seems quite likely.
    ```

- u/personalensing:
  ```
  I really hope Aiko makes it out alive. Besides how sad her death would make us feel, it would also have a huge impact on the rest of the group. I don't think they need something like this to end this horrible day (hard to believe all those chapters happen in about half a day).

  Also, poor Red. How is he still going after everything? I don't even want to think what effect these events will have on his mental health.
  ```

- u/TheGreatTactician:
  ```
  So does this mean Aiko has a thing for Red? Are we going to get a love triangle situation? Also, someone please save these children, they are only 11 or something. God, please, get them to safety.
  ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    > So does this mean Aiko has a thing for Red? 

    I don't think so at all. It's a single isolated action without any further elaboration; it sounds to me more like she's stepping out of her comfort zone on multiple fronts, especially after her musings on Elaine's action from before.
    ```

- u/XtremeHacker:
  ```
  Honestly, I'd just like to say that I can't wait for the next chapter, and man, I really can't predict if someone is going to be ok, or not, you've been proving my expectations wrong in a great way, it's nice to not be able to trust what I think is going to happen.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Great chapter as always!

  Will we see what happened to Seto and the woman who was driving Laura?
  ```
