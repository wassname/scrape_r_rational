## Searching for Yudkowsky's pseudonymous fiction

### Post:

[Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.reddit.com/user/eliezeryudkowsky) has at least one pseudonymous fiction.

It started with this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9esous/the_asteroid_strike_unconceivable_threats_in/e5ssj4x?context=3).

The latest [hint](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/lfu18v/a_recommendation_for_elahrairah_by_anderein/gmrq9po/?context=3):
> I'll add "El-Ahrairah" to the list with "The Waves Arisen", "The Erogamer", and "Fargo", but still not that one thing I actually wrote, that's been recced on /r/rational a few times, which nobody ever suggests I wrote.

So which writing has been recommended a few times on /r/rational that might be from Yudkowsky. Prime candidates would be [RST] fictions by authors who just published once.

Any more hints?

To Eliezer Yudkowsky: if you consider your fiction instructive why not reveal it for the benefit of the underprivileged who can't read a lot?

  I mean, think about what this thread is going to turn into (and likely how previous ones on the topic have ended up, I haven't been deep in here for long), it becomes a pseudo-recomendation and analysis thread of other rational works where people actively engage with the connection between the work and the author. Also, puzzles are fun, and any amount of hype and mystery isn't going to hurt EY's own work.

  Also maybe it's much less deeply rational and EY wants to be able to write something that's less serious. Or maybe he wants to be able to write something with out dragging his reputation into the discussion, or triggering people's biases/putting them on guard. Or maybe the hint not being revealed after so long was just because he likes trolling people sometimes (if he steps in here to "reveal" and instead links a rickroll then I'm on point with this. Except now we all know to look for it so he won't do it. Unless he wants to move up another level and does it anyway. Ad infinitum).

      I would call it "earnest" in that it makes an honest attempt to reflect and instill rationalist and transhumanist philosophy.

    BTW this is the reason some people assume yud let the AI out of the box in his AI box experiment but decided not to tell anyone the reason - because the reason was that doing so promotes AI research more than not doing so.
    ```

    - u/holyninjaemail:
      ```
      Yud was playing the AI.  It was his opponents who let the AI out of the box and I don't think multiple people would choose to have a marginal benefit on AI research rather than have the satisfaction of proving Yud wrong.
      ```

      - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
        ```
        I mean, was there anything stopping Yudkowsky from just paying the people off after the test? I'm pretty sure most people have a fairly reasonable price for throwing a game they know to have no true consequences.
        ```

        - u/holyninjaemail:
          ```
          The stated rules of the AI Box experiment are here: https://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity/aibox

          Notably, the first rule is "The AI party may not offer any real-world considerations to persuade the Gatekeeper party".  While I cannot prove that what you describe didn't happen, I wouldn't expect Yudkowsky to lie about if he followed the rules laid out for his experiment or not.
          ```

            Why? Frauds have existed before.

            - u/holyninjaemail:
              ```
              I'm not really interested in arguing this.  It is entirely possible that everything he has presented about himself is false and I have no way of proving otherwise.  I just don't think it likely enough to waste my time on.
              ```

              - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
                ```
                Your source says outright that there were no rules for Yukdowsky's tests. It's actually surprising to me how many people don't realize this, despite it being written explicitly and clearly. I have this conversation every few months here, it seems.
                ```

                - u/holyninjaemail:
                  ```
                  So I do not, in general, like snarking at people on the internet.  It makes me feel bad and leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  That being said:

                  > In case you were wondering, I (Yudkowsky) obeyed this protocol voluntarily in both earlier tests.

                  This is the fourth bullet point of the list that I quoted the first bullet point of a few comments up.  It's actually surprising to me how you can accuse me of not realizing what is written explicitly and clearly while not doing the same yourself.
                  ```

        This whole experiment is pseudo-mystic mumbo-jumbo. It may or may not have happened (My guess it is did happen, but like any stage magician Yudkowsky was simply careful in selecting the right volunteers), but it's obviously designed to build a cult of personality around Yudkowsky personally, and not for any scientific rigor.

        The whole "I have a cunning argument that would convince anyone, but I'm keeping it secret" stick to just so transparent. I don't understand why people fall for it.

  a better question is perhaps "why reveal the existence of pseudonymous fiction in the first place?" I'd've thought there was a general collective incentive *not* to go thinking too hard about pseudonyms, but stuff like this places more scrutiny on works by seemingly-throwaway accounts, which makes it harder for people to write pseudonymously (regardless of their reasons)
  ```

- u/CronoDAS:
  ```
  I suspect it doesn't exist and he's trolling us.
  ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  Huh, I was sure it was Erogamer.
  ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    "The Erogamer" does not count against the hunt for "that one thing nobody ever suggests I wrote" because, in those three cases plus now El-Ahrairah, people have suggested I wrote it.  As for whether I did write any or all of those four, I do not confirm or deny &c.
    ```

  - u/thomas_m_k:
    ```
    The Erogamer is too long, I think. I suspect it's a much shorter story, because he is mostly concentrating on work at the moment and doesn't have the time to write a monster like the Erogamer.

  Could it be "Hope and Silence in the Hive" [https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hope-and-silence-in-the-hive-warhammer-40k-complete.583942/](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hope-and-silence-in-the-hive-warhammer-40k-complete.583942/)

  Things that speak against it being EY: Just about everything.

  Things that speak for it being EY: There is one chapter (8.ii) that is basically a 40k/Gurren Lagann mashup (with orkz) which he has as a blank entry in one of the omake chapters of hpmor, and said chapter also has an (unattributed) EY quote in the author's notes.

      Well yes. And a patreon with a real looking name on it that isn't EY.

  ```
  If you really wanted to do this like a puzzle hunt, you could scrape all pre-2018 recommendation threads and posts, make a big list of fictions, corellate by author, find one-off-pieces, then reread.

  Alternative is maybe finding out how high /u/EliezerYudkowsky values not being attached to those pieces of fiction and paying him off :P

  A common theory is that he was Wertifloke who wrote Waves Arisen, but it's not confirmed one way or another.

  - u/thomas_m_k:

    Huh, doesn't the quoted comment by him pretty much confirm that he didn't write it? Unless he wrote *two* stories.

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:

      The quoted comment was not meant to so confirm.

      That is true, but doesn't stop people from suggesting it along with every well-written rational fanfiction posted here when the author isn't involved on the subreddit.

    It all started with [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9esous/the_asteroid_strike_unconceivable_threats_in/e5ssj4x?context=3) where Eliezer Yudkowsky said he wrote a story under a different name, in which he very much tried to alter his writing style.
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      in which case the problem might not be solvable. there's a lot of stories and if the style is distinct there's not great way to distinguish it from the crowd.
      ```

      - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
        ```
        It has occurred at least once that a work I wrote under a pseudonymous name while making no effort at *all* to disguise my style, was posted directly to /r/rational without anybody suggesting it was me.  Honestly I was a bit surprised by that!  I guess that case, plus my experience writing "team tyler's van" with Alicorn, suggests that - even on those occasions where I've made zero effort to disguise my style, and am naming characters "Haroun Pevers, curious boy" - it takes either a lot of cumulative writing, or an extended exposure over time, before people start to perceive such a thing.  (The readers got it eventually for "team tyler's van" but it took a while.)
        ```

        - u/wren42:
          ```
          readers are often less perceptive of the things the author finds obvious, and find all sorts of hidden bits the author didn't expect, or for that matter intend ;)

          I feel like Chili and the chocolate factory could be yours if you made an effort to make everything simultaneously make as little sense as possible while still being coherent and running on puns. So that's my vote
          ```

          - u/thecommexokid:
            ```
            No, Chili has way too much of the SneerClub nature to be Eliezer, based on how repeatedly he has demonstrated he cannot model that mindset. (Specifically the joy Wonka takes in tearing others down is something I don’t think EY could author convincingly.)
            ```

  This is a bit late for the post but I feel like thinking out loud somewhere about this and might as well do it here. 
  So like the thing that feels more like stuff that eliezer writes that I've seen is seeking power.
  But but the author is obiously not eliezer due to other stuff(like them having a patreon) 

  I once wondered if eliezer had written forty millenniums of cultivation because he did say he thought of trying to pass of "a girl corrupted by the internet is the summoned hero" as a translated Japanese light novel. (also this means that he might actually have done that for the thing where he changed writing stile) , but forty milleniums of cultivation is actually in Chinese and has stuff that make it very unlike the kind of thing eliezer would write, even if does seem like the author thinks along similar lines sometimes so definitely no. 

  Anyway extra thoughts, the pseudonym also can't have posted too much other stuff(unless it's an account eliezer uses often for stuff he doesn't want under his name) , probably only wrote a single fic and is most likely newer than eliezers account (though that doesn't narrow it down much)
  They also almost certainly aren't a regular in the discord. 
  It's possible eliezer is on the discord under that name and has maybe even said something at some point there  but definitely not regularly. 
  It's most likely something short, doubt eliezer expends that much time writing. 

  It's also possible I haven't actually read whatever eliezer has written.

  It's also been recommended more than once. 
  And that might discard stuff the authors posted on r/r. 
  It's maybe in hfy. 

  Could be a glowfic like he might just have more than one glowfic account. 
  Glowfics that have been recommended is probably a smaller category.

  I guess he could have written friendship is optimal, even if it's really not his style.
  Don't know enough about the author to discard it.

    > forty milleniums of cultivation is actually in Chinese

    Eliezer studied Chinese in secret just to troll us
    ```

    - u/crivtox:
      ```
      Obiously xd.Or hired someone to translate it and managed to fool whoever did the manga.All in service of  of making us doubt reality.

      Btw for the record I was absolutely right(and should have put more probability mass in the option than a maybe) about eliezer having written something in hfy, with a new account that hadn't been used for other stuff.

      Can't remember the name exactly rn but he admitted having written a short story about aliens and evopsych and humans being the only altruistic species and only one that managed to coordinate enough with non-kin to reach the starts.I don't think its the thing he said it has been recommended multiple times though so he has written multiple stuff.
      ```
