    This is where Canon contradicts itself. Yes, it is stated that newborns are pretty mindless, but we can tell Bree Tanner wasn't or the other vampire she hung out with. According to the Second Short life, a lot of the vampires were fighting but how much of that was because their maker basically said sit here and do nothing all day. Victoria and Riley managed to organize an army of twenty in less than a year and kept a very hands off approach. This was while they were based in a city with all sorts of distraction.

  Can't believe I'm overthinking *Twilight* stuff... but Luminosity and Radiance were pretty good so I don't feel too bad.

  Issues I see:

  1. Volturi have vamps with powers. Can't recall if they have as many in the original series as they do in Alicorn's stories, but at the very least they have a mind-reader, a shield-generator, an illusionist who can cause blinding pain, another that can cause sensory deprivation, and probably others. They might not have pre-cognition, but Alice does - and there's no telling if the Cullens would approve of your plan. Almost certainly not, since you're literally building up an army of new vampires to overthrow the old order.

  2. Newborns are feral as hell, and much much stronger than older vamps. Hell, Jasper is like 160 years old and still has trouble controlling himself. It's quite possible that they would accidentally tear you apart as soon as they were turned (though the more preparations you make and the more successes you have, the lower the risk of this). There's also no guarantee they'd agree to your plan after turning - it can drive them insane. And the smell of humans may turn them frenzied for decades after - the smell of blood can do so even after a century (again, Jasper). 

  3. There's no guarantee that years from now the Volturi won't have made up some counter, or that the plan is still feasible. The problem with playing the long game is that technology is increasing so rapidly that parts of this may be obsolete by the time you're ready to start. You could try and use newborns and move up the time frame, but that risks them going crazy with bloodlust in a city. And the Volturi have dealt with newborn armies before.

  I almost feel like the best way to wipe out the Volturi would be to study nuclear physics, learn to create a bomb, and wipe out the entire city with it. Hell, or find a way to steal or buy an old Soviet bomb. Horrific, inhumane, will throw the entire world into shock... but less risky than using an army of new vampires with flaming shotguns and combat training. Plus then there's no question of what to do with your army of vamps after overthrowing the vampire world order.

    In all seriousness, nuclear materials are heavily controlled by non-Vampire governments for exactly this reason.

      Because of Vaarsuvius' principle, or because they want people not to blow up Volturi?
      ```

      - u/MugaSofer:
        ```
        Because whenever people want to destroy a city/wipe out their enemies, their first thought is "hey, I should build a nuke".

  *Luminosity* and the far superior *Radiance* are still the only exposure I've had to the Twilight universe. And I couldn't be happier.

    I wish that had been the case with me. I was in high school during the Twilight craze and I slogged through all four of those monstrosities. I have never regretted reading a series more.

      I read them all too. The plots were so stupid and the romance was creepy, but I just couldn't overcome my brain boner for the cyborg-like vampires. I would have loved to have their physiology. Luminosity/Radiance was total wish fulfillment for me because I spent the entire canon series like "aaarrrghhh just TURN HER turn EVERYONE oh my GOD"
      ```

      That's dedication.  I finished half of the first book (and the first two movies).

  Uhh how do you deal with the witches? Forget defeating the Volturi (who iirc have a shielder vamp in their retinue), how do you stay God Emperor if you are willing to turn people you consider to be desirable? There's no reason they can't end up with really OP ant-you powers. Also why do you expect that some of the soldiers wouldn't have anti-brain washing powers as well? Even if witches are relatively rare (in Luminosity they are, but in canon Twilight most vampires we see have some power), you still are talking about >200 total vampires (assuming that you consider >60 scientists etc. as desirables).
  ```

    I forgot about the witches. If someone is found with powers and surrenders then I would offer them extra money, or power. I'm also hoping that they would stay loyal to their maker, aka me. 

    I'm going to do some basic math and see how often witches actually do pop up. 
    Although I'd only be sampling from the list of known vampires in Twilight it should give me some sort of statistical basis on how many witches I can expert per vampire. 

    I'll be omitting Victoria's army from my calculations.

    - u/ulyssessword:
      ```
      I think you will *severely* overestimate how many witches there are.  You see powerful people in the books, and witches tend to become more powerful, therefore you will see a disproportionate number of witches.

      Why? Are you staying loyal to _your_ maker?

  There's a movie about this. It's call daybreakers.

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    The premise is cool but the plot is pretty awful.
    ```

  - u/jldew:
    ```
    I'm definitely looking that up. Is it on Netflix?
    ```

    - u/thedarkone47:
      ```
      unfortunately no.
