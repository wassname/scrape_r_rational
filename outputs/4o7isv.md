  Interesting chapter. The end result was surprising. I wonder if it was lethal. The consequences of murder within the Iris family would be an interesting thing to witness.

  Maybe I'm imagining things, but the writing seemed a little off this update.  Still, I've been waiting for this fight for a *long* time now, so I can't complain too much.  Very satsifying to read.
