## The Great Filter

### Post:

For those of you who don't know what [it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) is. Assume for the sake of this conversation there is some sort of great filter. What kind of events, if any, do you think they're likely to be? The discovery of nuclear war, rampant pollution, hostile AI, or something else entirely?

  This unnamed story by Scott Siskind proposes a possibility: http://www.raikoth.net/Stuff/story1.html

  I recall reading somewhere that properly-constructed Dyson Spheres could be detected only by the gravitational effects. In fact, with only the instruments currently at our disposal there would be no way for us to distinguish a galaxy with a lot of Dyson Spheres from a galaxy with a lot of dark matter. 

  (In which case there's really not so much of a Filter as we think)

  I can't remember where I read this, though, and don't know enough to say whether it's total BS (I would be happy to hear one way or another). 

  I'm also not yet sure if, once you get to the point of crossing interstellar distances, it isn't easier to just *create* your own habitats rather than terraform big hunks of rock. In which case there may be any number of civilizations out there but they're leaving the star systems clear for potential future life. 

  (I can't remember where, but there's a scifi story where the alien civilizations have developed a sort of Prime Directive that doesn't allow any kind of interference in a system that has the potential to bear life on its own).

  Snarky answer: Anti-Spiral invasions.

  Real answer: I think that if one does exist and we're not just missing something huge, we probably passed it already.  There are too many coincidences in our evolutionary history that created just the right kind of creatures to form a cooperating, advancing civilization.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  I think it's probably behind us: The evolution of "intelligent" life.

  The kind of sapience you need to start poking at the laws of physics is something that you either have or you don't. Evolution is all about incremental improvements. So there's really not much reason for intelligence to evolve. It was a series of coincidences that our ancestors got into circumstances where their brains could grow unimpeded.

  I mean, take insects. They've been around for hundreds of millions of years, and they currently outmass mammals by an order of magnitude. Yet individually they're dumber than a sack of hammers. Even actions that seem clever in-context are driven by instinct have no real thought behind them - insects can't adapt to new situations.

  I think if we ever discover life in other star systems, we'll see a lot of things as dumb as insects.

  If AGI is possible within a few centuries of technological revolution, this together with fairly conservative estimates via the Drake equation would suggest there should have been a plethora of civilizations out there (at least billions) who would have done it by now. Which we don't see.

  So either AGI is extremely unlikely, we are in some sort of nature preserve, there are harder limits on intelligence than we currently believe, civilizations always go extinct before then, (intelligent) life is far rarer than we thought in the first place, or my favorite: we're just seeing a very strong anthropic selection effect; we're the only ones here because you just don't expect to find yourself in a universe with most flavors of recursively self-improving superintelligence. Not that I actually give this strong credence, but it's pretty interesting at least.

  Evolution isn't a goal-oriented process that leads to intelligent life and it usually gets stuck on some local maximum (or, a slowly oscillating Red Queen's Race near a local maximum).  It's pure luck that the Earth isn't still covered in trilobites.

  If the great filter is in front of us, my guess is that we're simply too far apart in time and space to effectively leak evidence of each others existence to each other.

  Robin Hanson over on overcomingbias.com has an interesting argument: 

  Basically simulating different colonisation waves of expansionist civs, refracting and reflecting on themselves. And it turns out that you get sometimes giant wastes of pristine stellar estate- we might just life in on of those.
