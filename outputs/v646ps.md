## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Can I get something similar to The Flower that bloomed nowhere and Unsong? I enjoyed both and they apparently both fall into rational fiction.
  ```

  - u/thomas_m_k:
    ```
    Maybe [Chili and the Chocolate Factory](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation). I got similar absurdist vibes from it as Unsong.
    ```

  - u/Cosmogyre:
    ```
    I've only read Unsong, but I they're two pretty large works, any way you can specify what parts you liked? At a guess, I'd say Chili and the Chocolate Factory: Fudge Revelation and Pokemon: The Origin of Species are similar, but those are also big works that I'm using to hedge my bets.

  I have been reading [Memories of the Fall](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36051/memories-of-the-fall), a xianxia novel. I am only a few chapters in so far but the author seems to do politics and corruption really well. There are so many characters and scheming clans working at cross purposes that I have some difficulty keeping track of all their names. In hindsight I almost wish I took notes. The Author recently finished rewriting the first section and posted the new chapters at the end. 

  Does anyone have other recommendations with lots of political scheming?

    I just caught up with [Fox's Tongue and Kirin's Bone](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42226/foxs-tongue-and-kirins-bone), recommended last week, and it seems like something that would be up your alley. There's all kinds of politicking, scheming, the whole works. The first "book" just finished, so there's a full, self-contained story out there, unlike many webnovels.

    If xianxia is something you'd like more of, I'd also recommend Ze Tian Ji / Way of Choices. It's an excellent politics-heavy story that stays on the smaller end of the power scale, and focuses much more on schemes and plans than 'number go up.'

    I'm almost positive you've run across it before, but *A Practical Guide to Evil* is another story that really ramps up the politics as it goes on. Cat definitely starts out more on the 'hit it until it goes away' side, but plenty of background and side characters pick up the slack until she comes into her own. Including perhaps one of my favorite villains ever, Kairos Theodosian.

    [A Young Woman’s Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/) is an AU fanfiction of *Youjo Senki*, which in turn is an AU fic of World War 1. This particular spinoff deals with the main character amassing political and military power in the wake of a crushing defeat of her nation. I quite enjoyed its incorporation of personal loyalties and information asymmetry into the politics. Also, it’s hilarious.

    I’m sure I have some good political *Harry Potter* fics in my listings, but it’s been too long since I’ve read, say, *Hogwarts Battle School* for me to give a confident recommendation.

    [Trailblazer](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/trailblazer-worm-gundam-au.680881/) is an excellent and nearly complete crossover between *Worm* and *Gundam*. Like many *Worm* tinker fics, it deals with Taylor’s ascension in power and notoriety. Unlike most of them, it has at least 6 factions running their own plots simultaneously, and anyone can be acting as a puppet or as a puppet master. Sometimes both. Combine that with a rare willingness to go beyond *Worm* canon and you have a top-tier story.

  What are good stories that feature the protagonist infiltrating *The Masquerade* without being a proper part of it? Think settings like **Animorphs** or **The SCP Foundation** - Any fun stories featuring normal individuals stumbling onto the grand global conspiracy to hide or keep secret the paranormal? Lies and trickery and seizing whatever little advantage or trinkets or information they can gather and *somehow* finagling a foothold into that world? 

  Some Other Examples:   
  - A baseline human in a world of supers faking their powers through fancy gadgets.  
  - A non-practitioner mingling with actual wizards using sleight of hand.
  ```

  - u/lo4952:
    ```
    [Non-Playable](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20351053/chapters/48256216) is pretty much exactly what you're looking for. An SI wakes up in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and very quickly realizes just how fucked they are. This is less a story about fighting as an equal and more about doing whatever you can to survive, but otherwise spot-on.

    [Paranoid Mage](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49879/paranoid-mage) is by no means a good story, but the first 15-20 chapters are *very* engaging and scratch a similar itch. The MC *is* a magic practitioner, but he has no idea what he's doing and there's no one to help him. There's definitely a strong element of bluffing your way to victory in a world you have zero idea about while abusing every little advantage. With that said, starting with volume two, it becomes irrational and at times dumb, while volume one, IIRC, end on a cliffhanger—so beware.
    ```

  - u/eludur:
    ```
    For a baseline human in a world of super’s, I would recommend the completed story https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/44658/superworld. The main character pretends to be a clairvoyant in a world where everyone else has powers.

    * Julia's plot arc in the second book of [*the Magicians*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magicians_\(Grossman_novel\)#Major_characters) trilogy fits this, but she's not a muggle. Discretion warning: >!sex-related!< trigger warnings.

    * [NPCs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22088245-npcs) (also published lit) is a partial match — "four NPCs .. find themselves faced with an impossible choice: pretend to be adventurers undertaking a task of near-certain death or see their town and loved ones destroyed. Armed only with salvaged equipment, second-hand knowledge, and a secret that could get them killed, it will take all manner of miracles if they hope to pull off their charade."

    * [*Security*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10377231/1/Security) is a Worm fanfic in which the SI is a muggle. Interesting premise, but too much wishful thinking and generally somewhat underwhemling.

     * other muggle-protag Worm fanfics include [*Rank*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rank-worm-oc-canon-compliant.631417/reader/) and [*Deputy*](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/deputy-internship-worm-au-au.483163/).

    * in Resonense (more prceisely, [*Revolution\)*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2569561/41/Revolution) there was a character matching what you're describing perfectly, but they were mostly an off-screen antagonist for one of the plot arcs.

    * *[Lord of the Mysteries](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/lord-of-the-mysteries/)* may have a premise that's close enough to be a match, though prot's here also not a muggle. Wishful thinking and weirdness filter to advance the plot are likely present in this story too.

    Pact is probably adjacent to this - the main character is a practitioner but starts off so far on the backfoot that there's that same struggle to gain a foothold.
    ```

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      He also doesn't start off as a Practitioner, so it fits their request even better. Though it's not a global conspiracy he's dealing with, but rather the established power structures in small-town, Canada. Imagine how wild the Practice must be in New York or Beijing.
      ```

      - u/Coriell1:
        ```
        I mean the practice as a whole and innocence vs awakened is a global conspiracy.
        ```

  - u/Sure-Manufacturer-47:
    ```
    As another comment said, Pact and Pale both start with uninitiated protagonists who are figuring out systems and rules established way before their time, but also have several flavors of non practitioner side characters exactly as you describe, 
    Witch Hunters / Blackguards who have no magic but have forced their way into the magic world, and the Aware who can see or have experienced parts but not the whole. 

    Control (the game) is literally an uninitiated protagonist stumbling into the SCP Foundation, but she pretty quickly (pre tutorial) becomes the Chosen One and there’s not much figuring out or mundane excellence there. 

    Hawkshaw Inheritance has an unpowered Batman type as a mentor figure, but the main character protege is a (fairly mild) meta. 

    The Artemis Fowl series is this exactly, at least the first book before the series went into mostly supernatural heist stories.
    ```

    - u/TouchMike:
      ```
      > mostly supernatural heist stories

      They were so much fun though. I should read them again some time, I wonder how they hold up now?

    The Rook by Daniel O'Malley does this pretty well. Basically a woman wakes up with her mind wiped, with information from her past self and a bureaucratic job at the Checquy(the British Supernatural Service.)

    EDIT: I just realized you also asked for "A non-practitioner mingling with actual wizards using sleight of hand", for which Sebastien De Castell's Spellslinger Series greatly applies. Read it, it's very good.

    Arcane Dropout is about a guy trying to infiltrate the masquerade of a secret society/culture based around an flashy casting-spells style of Magic, by using his own, totally unrelated and separate system of paranormal-beings and ghost-communion style of mystic Magic (that the spellcasters are totally unaware exist) to pretend he's one of the spellcasters. 

    So it's basically a modern setting that has two totally separate magic masquerades covering up completely different kinds of magic that each aren't aware of the other, and a guy from one finds out about the other and uses the powers from one to try and infiltrate the other.

  This is what I've been reading this week:

  [Time to orbit: Unknown](https://derinstories.com/2022/06/04/001-the-problem-with-the-javelin-program/) \- a sci fi story where the main character wakes up from cryogenic freezing in transit on a colony ship. Updated Wednesdays. So far 5 chapters are up, but will likely update pretty regularly (it's by the same author of [Curse Words](https://havenstory975986403.wordpress.com/archive/), first book [The Cursed Heart](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39959/the-cursed-heart)).

  Something I really loved about Paranoid Mage was the protagonist being proactive in staying anonymous: by buying burner phones, browsing the internet on public wifi, always using fake names, etc. Any other stories that have a large amount of that? Bonus points for being urban fantasy or fantasy with a pretty good amount of technology and/or surveillance magics.

    *Azarinth Healer* is a pretty decent popcorn fic. OPMC walks around, punches big monsters, is very hard to kill. Nothing fancy, but if that's what you're looking for...


    *Defiance of the Fall* is a bit better than Azarinth; a kind of LitRPG / Cultivation crossover where the MC's bad luck puts him right into hell from the very start, forcing him to git gud or die. Spoilers, he... doesn't die. I dropped off it at some point, but got several hundred thousand words of fun out of the story.

    - u/npanov:

    [Brockton's Celestial Forge](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23949661/navigate) is a Worm/Jumpchain crossover semi-SI (MC is a very minor canon character) that currently clocks in at ~1.37M words and updates weekly. MC is very OP and gets moreso almost every chapter (excepting interludes) but his adversaries are similarly scaled to provide a challenge, for instance: >!Leet, Uber, and Bakuda are all serious threats that are still at large as of the latest chapter (101).!<
    ```

    - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
      ```
      It's a polarizing fic. Detractors point out that the MC spends most of the 1.4M word count thinking about his powers and hardly doing anything of consequence due to what he describes as a "major mental disorder". On the other hand, even some detractors praise certain non-MC's POV chapters. YMMV.

      Edit: spelling.
      ```

      - u/WeepyDevil:
        ```
        Detractor here, can confirm. The author has a pretty good grasp of characters who I would expect someone writing what is otherwise an absurd stompfic to just roll with the common fanon flanderizations of, and their technical writing skill is pretty good. A bit of fanon does seep into the fic here and there, but as Worm fanfic goes it's a comparatively tiny leak. The protagonist is kind of bland white bread but his family and mental health issues are quite well depicted, as someone who has personal familiarity with them. That said, I find the vast majority of the fic, outside of those interlude chapters, completely unbearable.   


        The MC being a very minor canon character is very generous. For all intents and purposes, they are an original character. There isn't anything wrong with that, mind, the stigma of OCs in fanfiction is overblown, but there's a vast difference between fleshing out a minor character who didn't get much development in canon (say, Greedo or Admiral Ackbar), and creating a new character who pretty much only theoretically existed in canon (one of Lukes non-Biggs friends, who, ignoring the old novel and Marvel comic, which were based on an older draft of the script where they made a minor appearance, can only be intuited to exist by the fact that Luke refers to his friends in the plural).  


        The stupid overpowered jumpchain nonsense powers, in addition to, well, being stupid overpowered jumpchain nonsense, constantly intrude on the story like an app/executable that really wants you to update. Almost every single fucking chapter, a new one shows up and the pace of the story has to grind to a halt to decide whether or not the next version of Windows is worth it or not.

In the MC's defense he's spent a lot of that time >!inside the computer system of his pocket reality where he can think at an accelerated rate.!< I'm too lazy to check right now but >!hasn't less than 2 weeks passed in the story so far?!<

    Mystery Flesh Pit National Park has some superb world building and the sight has plenty of stuff like papers, maps, reports, etc. describing the mystery flesh pit. Basically in the 1940s some oil inspectors in Texas discovered a unbelievably gigantic living organism under the ground and promptly turned into a tourist attraction and tried to take advantage of its weird properties for profit. Horrifying things about it are hidden in the lore and reports and the park closed down after shitty maintenance on a single pump nearly woke the thing up and risked potentially ending the world. Darkly amusing and horrifying at the same time and I have to admit that I probably would be tempted to visit if it was real and open.

    [The Northern Caves](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522) is, in-universe, a report by a member of a niche early internet fan-forum for Leonard Salby's classic children's series *Chesscourt*, to the larger community of that forum. It concerns how a small number of users of that forum got their hands on the unreleased manuscript of *The Northern Caves*, the final, longest and strangest entry in that series, and the bizarre and, as you can probably deduce from the fact that this even needs a report, concerning results of when they all got together to finally read it.

    It includes more narrative driven "notes" sections set up as the author's recounting of events in this report, and "materials" sections, related excerpts from the forum, newspapers, bits of books, etc. that the author of that report felt was relevant.

    More out of universe, it's a slow, suspenseful, both character and mystery driven buildup to things going seriously off the rails, in a >!sort of pseudo-magical-realism!< explosive climax that the report is trying to work into something intelligible and meaningful for a wider audience. 

    Thematically, it's about small internet communities, the way art and fan communities around art affect people in terms of their relationships, values, and the way they think. It's also, and this is more a personal interpretation based on the epilogue, about the how early internet communities were tangibly different to modern ones. 

    All the material you're reading when you read the story is set up so that it also exists diegetically within the story, no interludes or set-apart narrations, so I think it fits very nicely into what you're describing, though obviously not in a professional or academic affect. The notes sections are all perfectly in character, and the materials are convincing and fantastic at fleshing out the other characters, the world the author lived in, and even the author himself, as your only access to him that isn't his own writing. 

    It's a really beautifully written story, totally original, with stellar chararacters and prose, drawing you deep in and getting you invested even though you're here "after the fact", it's not an 'ongoing', present-tense narrative. I really highly recommend it, I really enjoyed it and it touched me pretty deeply when I first read it, couldn't stop thinking about it for like a week. One of those things you end up excitedly talking about to people who maybe aren't *actually* that interested, finding excuses to bring it up.

    Oh, also, like, a lot of Borges' corpus lol. You know how a huge chunk of SCP is "What if there was a book/idea/map/etc. that did something spooky? Here's what I think a scientist who found it would write"? Well, Borges is the OG "man finds spooky book and is now writing to YOU about it" guy. Lots of fantastic short stories, the king of magical realism. Hell, [SCP-1986](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1986) (and likely The Wanderer's Library as well) is directly inspired by his story ['The Library of Babel'](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-The-Library-of-Babel.pdf)

    ["Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"](https://sites.evergreen.edu/politicalshakespeares/wp-content/uploads/sites/226/2015/12/Borges-Tl%C3%B6n-Uqbar-Orbius-Tertius.pdf), mentioned elsewhere in the replies, is right up your alley, and can quasi-accurately be described as *Gate - Thus the Semioticians Deployed!*

      The Northern Caves! I read this last year I think, what an incredible story! I remember devouring it in a single sitting, never have I wanted more for a fictional book series to be real and have a chance to get my hands on it. Thanks for reminding me about it! As for Borges, with have been suggesting him I should finally bite the bullet and get some of his collections.

    Asimov's "The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline" is a classic for obvious reasons. There's three other stories, [as described on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiotimoline).

    There's a couple extended Pokedex projects out there.

    Other than that, I'd repeat the Tabletop RPG book idea. Shadowrun, for example, has a great setting and a lot of its books are dedicated to fleshing out parts of it for Gamemasters, and thus take a more in-universe, science/culture communication tone.

    Currently not freely available, but the author of The Way Ahead has finished the novel on Patreon and moved on to a new project, The Encyclopedia Arcane. Here's the pitch from when it was introduced:

    > **The Encyclopedia Arcane.** 

    >The basic gist is that it's a fantasy worldbuilding dictionary. Fantasy nonfiction, if you will. It's part of the same grander cosmology that The Way Ahead and my future projects are set in, but it has its own little corner and setting. It's perfect for all of you who like me just really love worldbuilding and half the time see all the 'plot' and 'characters' as a distraction for the real meat of raw fantasy mechanics.

    > The first entry (about the biology of elves and the distinction between various elven races) is being released concurrently with this post, but expect all sorts of stuff in the future, from the history of various magic systems to the various leading scientific analysis of planar structure (including comparisons of the World Tree vs Great Wheel models of planar relationships), to the history of Evershake, the city built atop a not-a-Tarrasque.  

    It's currently [Patreon only](https://www.patreon.com/NorskDaedalus) with two entries out, but it's probably exactly what you're looking for.

    *Psi Effect* is a ME / XCOM crossover that has a first contact arc between humanity and the wider ME universe. It's pretty self-contained, so you could just read those chapters if you wanted (though the entire story is quite fun, and I'd recommend checking it out).

    The chapters are kind of haphazardly thrown together on fanfiction.net, but if you go on Spacebattles each arc is labeled.

    Since you've got a few MLP on there, there's [the Maretian](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/396744/the-maretian) which was fun and low-conflict.

      I dropped this early on for people actively making decisions that don't make sense. Glancing at the comments, this does not improve throughout the story. Disreccomend for /r/rational.
