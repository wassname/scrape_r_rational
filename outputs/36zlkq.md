## Phylacteries are necromantic? WTF!?

### Post:

Has it ever occurred to anyone here to wonder why the heck making a phylactery, a spell designed to PRESERVE a person's life in some form, is a spell only ever used by necromancers. I've never seen a story in which someone other than a necromancer, a mage that specializes in death, used a phylactery. Why is that? Shouldn't phylacteries be a cleric spell?

  In pretty much any setting that allows for a lich, there is also an afterlife. The lich is *not* preserving life, he's forestalling death, and not even doing it that well given that his body is still dead. If there were literally heaven and hell, what would you think about the man who went to great lengths and severe disfigurement in order to avoid the afterlife altogether? You certainly wouldn't think he expected to go to heaven, would you?

    Well, it's not known that there's an afterlife in HPMoR.

    And there's lots of afterlives that are less attractive than "heaven" or even becoming a zombie. Eternal sleep or eternal clinical depression seem popular.

      HPMoR also doesn't have liches, phylacteries, necromancers, or clerics. So I don't think it's really applicable. It does have horcruxes, but those aren't really the same as phylacteries, and if there was necromancy, they would definitely be necromantic because they're fueled by a death.

      But yeah, there are a ton of settings where the rules are different, even if I can't think of one off the top of my head that has liches and clerical magics but doesn't have a heaven. It probably exists though.

        Terminology. Horcruxes are basically phylacteries, and Voldemort is basically a lich. Abracadabra is kind of necromancy as well.

        And by now pretty much all the settings with liches and clerical magics are derived from D&D, which is a really low grade source of mythology. Not that Harry Potter is much better, but at least it's not Yet Another D&D Campaign Writeup.

  Originally, in D&D, all life-related magic was necromantic. That included healing spells as well, meaning that phylacteries being necromantic didn't have a negative connotation. Not just because of the spell school name, that is.

  Also, in D&D (or at least 3.5 and below D&D), clerics made the best necromancers, with wizards being relatively crappy ones in comparison.

    Eh, it depends what you wanted to do with your necromancy. If you wanted the 'necromancy' style of setting all your feats on fire to be the master of save-or-dies, Wizards could be quite effective.

    My favorite primer for necromancy in 3.5 is the [revised necromancer's handbook](http://community.wizards.com/forum/previous-editions-character-optimization/threads/1049211) (strong, amusing writing).

  I don't see anything in RAW that says that you have to be an arcane caster, and in fact there's no actual SPELL involved in becoming a lich. You just need to be an 11th-level caster and have Craft Wondrous Item. A *bard* could become a lich if he wanted to.

  So almost all phylactery creation in fiction that I have seen involves doing unspeakable evil - killing people, shearing away parts of your own soul, etc in order to make your soul into a nice small tidy package that can be preserved.  It is more of a making a deal with the God of Death by sacrificing others to him and becoming someone or proving yourself to be someone that is in line with that God's will.

  For example the Pathfinder method of becoming a lich involves:
  >Once the phylactery is completed, it must be placed on an altar to a death god which you must construct from black onyx (500 gp) in a process that takes 8 days. With all the etchings and enchantments done, requiring you to expend 6 hours and two whole levels of spell slots each day, you are ready to transfer your soul to the phylactery. With an evil outsider watching over (it is impossible for them to interfere, via the power of the ritual), you must sacrifice one of your race who is twice as young as you and another who is twice as old (to a max age of the maximum age for your race), as per the ritual. Their souls are consumed by the black onyx altar where you will slay yourself using your most potent necromancy spell. Your soul will travel through the black onyx into the phylactery where it will be activated, coming your passage into lichdom. The evil outsider is automatically dismissed to wherever they came from and the black onyx altar dissipates from the site. The altar becomes a tribute to the death god you dedicated it to, your name being engraved throughout it as your soul was channeled through it.

  Pretty obviously necromantic.

    I think they generally just imply that it's unspeakably evil. When they actually list requirements, munchkins find non-evil ways to do it. If you just need to destroy someone's soul, use the soul of someone that's evil. Save them from a fate far worse.

    I've heard of other methods that are even easier, like the heart of a baby (anesthetize and cast regenerate after).

    And even if you find something that's necessarily evil, no matter how evil it is, it's still worth it if it lets you prevent two necromancers.

      Considering there is a kind of ur-undead which is literally a demigod fetus... I dunno if that is such a good idea.

    Is that official? The source I find for that quote is from a forum post and I do remember various Paizo products mentioning that the writers did not want to lock down GM's to one method of Lich-creation.

      [Here's the official Pathfinder source for the template:](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/lich)

      > The quest to become a lich is a lengthy one. While construction of the magical phylactery to contain the spellcaster's soul is a critical component, a prospective lich must also learn the secrets of transferring his soul into the receptacle and of preparing his body for the transformation into undeath, neither of which are simple tasks. Further complicating the ritual is the fact that no two bodies or souls are exactly alikeâ€”a ritual that works for one spellcaster might simply kill another or drive him insane. **The exact methods for each spellcaster's transformation are left to the GM's discretion**, but should involve expenditures of hundreds of thousands of gold pieces, numerous deadly adventures, and a large number of difficult skill checks over the course of months, years, or decades.

      Plus some additional rules on creating the phylacteries, but that only takes some gold and "Craft Wonderous Item".

  Phylacteries keep you animated and thinking. They don't keep your heart beating or your lungs breathing. They let you ignore clinical death; they don't prevent it or heal you afterwards.

  If the world you're thinking of has a different type of phylactery, then maybe it would be appropriate for a cleric to use them.

  I recall reading about 'good' liches.

  I can't remember if it was faerun or one of the other settings but it boiled down to a procedure performed by elves where by their elders could volunteer to be a kind of gaurdian ancestor for the family lineage.

  There is also in the libris mortis a few less then evil ways of becoming sentient undead that are no where near as evil.

  Cities where its considered a civil right of passage after you've reached an age past child bearing to just 'become a sentient zombie' and several other things.

  Hell even in Pathfinder the psudo egypt like undead necro-civilization with the 'evil wizard' is actually a pretty chill place and not exactly all that bad. Everyone who does not become an intelligent undead is considered a conscript on death to the government (either for unskilled labor or a soldier) so really the biggest problem in that setting is that class defines whether you live forever and in what form (vampires, wraiths, ghouls, shadows and lots of the 'spawning' undead are fun).

  Also there is a fun prestige class in savage species based on the premise of "emancipated spawn" who are people that can be restored after being turned into things like shadows via str damage.

    I read a pretty cool book, I forget the name(If anyone cares enough, I'll find it in my library of books on my PC at home), where the main character is a Lich, and a good guy.

    He was a wizard of a battle-mage circle from a lost ancient civilization where any student that reached mastery status(approximately half of whom were expected to, in general) was taught the spell to create a phylactery and become a lich to keep their knowledge around for the younger generations (and coincidentally live forever, as this version had the whole body-stealing from anyone who got too close to their phylactery if their old body was obliterated - The ancient civilization had laws where people who were to be sentenced to death could have their body granted to a lich instead - The soul of the person whose body was possessed explicitly passed on to the afterlife, etc.).

    It was a very mechanically interesting setting, and pretty rational about how it handled magic. No spell was explicitly evil, even if it could be viewed as evil.

    Book 1 - Mage

    Book 2 - Ravin of Yorindar

    Book 3 - Arc of Time

    Book 4 - The Wench of Woe

    Book 5 - The Mountain, The Raven and the Sea

    Book 6 - The Game of the Gods

    I found books 1-3 the most entertaining. Books 4-6 felt kind of... tacked on.

    Something like that is present in Eberron, but the D&D Good Lich template was somewhere else; I think in Libris Mortis.

  ```
  While the end results are cleric-like, the actual process - moving around your soul - is very much necromantic.

  ```
  Necromancers manipulate the boundary between life and death. The necromancy part is retaining control over your own (soul-less, undead) body.

  Control Water is still a water spell even if you use it to lower the water level.
