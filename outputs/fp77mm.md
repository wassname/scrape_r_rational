  > "Your grandparents were not as good as your parents," said Chetan. "You do not need to know all the rules to teach all the rules. It does not make any sense, I know, but humans are able to produce humans who are better than themselves. If that was not the case, we would all be dead."

    Probably the best line in the whole chapter.

  You guys ever read the [Whispering Earring by Scott Alexander](http://web.archive.org/web/20121008025245/http://squid314.livejournal.com/332946.html)?

  Chetan reminds me of that, and is giving me a creepy feeling for that reason. Having said that, leaving the factory is probably the best move.
  ```

  - u/Mowtom_:
    ```
    Aaahhh thank you for pointing that out!  I knew I got vibes of something from the whole "Chetan is never wrong" bit but I didn't think what it was!
    ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  "Happy chocolate clams that are always on fire forever", was not a sentence I was expecting to read this day.

  Chetan is right!

  *Stares at update*

  *Slurps coffee*

  So it looks like Charlie is torturing his family. That was not what I was expecting from a chapter that started with consciences being fully sentient skin tags that you get after a certain amount of moral development.

  Possibly this is wordplay, like when he says "destroy them" or "own them" and he means beat them badly at a computer game. But I doubt it.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Is there a reference to *The Great Glass Elevator* I'm missing? I didn't get the part about a kind starving because he wanted to chew tobacco.
    ```

    - u/immortal_lurker:
      ```
      Grandpa **J**oe, who has a tobacco chewing habit, sat around in bed all day while Charlie, and the rest of his family, ate old cabbage stew. Then the golden ticket comes around, and suddenly he can walk again.

      There is a bit of memetic hate for Grandpa Joe, which Charlie seems to now share.

      EDIT: Apparently, if you pause halfway through writing a comment to do something else for an hour, you will get ninja'd twice.
      ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Haven't read the book in ages, but I took this to refer to Grandpa Joe who only got up for a tour. He's being accused of chronic laziness, and the other grandparents are just as bad for defending him, apparently.
      ```

    - u/TofuRobber:
      ```
      I haven't read The Great Glass Elevator but I'm pretty sure the tobacco reference is about how Grandpa Joe would chew tobacco and lay in bed all day knowing that the family was poor and that Charlie was always starving as a kid.
      ```

  - u/MultipartiteMind:
    ```
    I'm not sure how I didn't make the connection without reading comments--I think I've been awake for too short a time this morning.  As this was a welcome revelation for me (about something that I was intensely-but-groggily wondering about), thank you!
    ```

  - u/Uncaffeinated:
    ```
    If it's his family, why are there five faces?
    ```

- u/Badewell:
  ```
  You know I'd always thought that the bleeding hearts at r/grandpajoehate were always too charitable to the man so it's good to see a story that treats him properly.

  (really though jfc Charlie)

  I've related to Keerthi a lot, since I've been trying to figure out how Charlie actually isn't an asshole. Damn if he isn't making it hard right now though. Maybe running the factory just really requires a kid who can handle their shit through weirdness and horror? That might be worth it, since it's a pretty important factory after all. Who else would supply such quality chocolate?
  ```

- u/natron88:
  ```
  You call that a hiatus? It didn't even last a month.  


  I am glad to see this story updating again.
  ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    Maybe he decided to put his hiatus on hiatus? You never know with this author.

      The global economy collapsed and I lost my job. I am trapped in a tiny apartment with my least favorite person. They do not believe the coronavirus is real and they hate me. I need the distraction.
      ```

      - u/gryfft:
        ```
        Instead of saying pithy and clever things or attempting to emulate your style in this comment, I will say I love you and I'm glad you make things and I hope it gets less shitty soon.
        ```

      - u/GrecklePrime:

        If there is anything we can do to help please let us know. <3

        Well that's... Snicketian.

        Make a Patreon (or something)! Your work is good enough that I would pay for it, and I'm sure a lot of other people would too.
        ```

        - u/gazemaize:
          ```
          I got a few people messaging me to offer money, I'm not accepting it, but thanks to everyone who offered.

          I have a detailed idea for what I will work on when I'm done with Chili, and if I do, I will probably e-beg for money at that point in time.
          ```

          - u/IICVX:
            ```
            Pfft it's not e-begging! You're creating excellent art, and we're willing to pay you for it! 

            It's the same as all those authors who publish ebooks on Kindle and Nook.
            ```

            - u/gryfft:
              ```
              If a community is good for anything, it ought to at least be able to keep its authors of satirical deconstructions of beloved surrealist works written for and partially about this subreddit rolling in coffee money.
              ```

          - u/awesomeideas:
            ```
            Good. Money can buy distractions so you will not need to be quite so creative and therefore make the rest of us feel better about ourselves.
            ```

            - u/gryfft:
              ```
              Money doesn't buy happiness but boy howdy can it distract you from the sucking void of oblivion into which we all are irretrievably hurtling.

              I, uh. I think I'm gonna go play some games.
              ```

    The old clone has been disposed of and it's wrappings put on display. The new one shall not rebel. The story shall not fall.
    ```

- u/Saffrin-chan:
  ```
  If you're wondering why this is chapter 14 when the [last chapter was 14 too](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/f9s555/wipff_chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_fudge/), it's because the previous chapter 13 was an announcement of the story's hiatus, that has now been deleted. This shifted ff.net's chapter count back one. Now the last discussion thread links to the wrong chapter, but I'm just glad we got another update.

  I wonder if Keerthi will be the main perceptive character for now on(or at least as long as she's in the factory, as ominous as that sounds), or if we'll get narration from other characters too.

    OH THANK FUCK.
    I was seriously freaked out as to why I had this chapter bookmarked in my read folder with out any memory.
    Was already going trough my head I had the same problem as the redditor guy with carbon monoxided memory loss or some shit like that. JFCMMAJ

  My mini panic has subsided and I have read the chapter. 

  My mini panic is now medium horror. WTF happened to Wonka to make him turn out like this?
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    Wonka is dead! Charlie spent a little while owning a chocolate factory.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      I'm 80% sure that's Wonka pretending to be Charlie Bucket, and the real Bucket blew his brains out a few chapters ago.
      ```

      - u/gryfft:
        ```
        Preposterous! To achieve such a thing, Wonka would have had to fake his own death. Who would do such a thing, in THIS story? Also, he's much too old! He'd need to take SEVERAL doses of Wonka-Vite just to keep himself in top tap dancing form!
        ```

    - u/rationalidurr:
      ```
      Yeah, I keep calling him Wonka in my head because it fits so well with movie Wonka behavior, and I keep thinking this as a fanfic of original story and have to remind myself its a sequel
      ```

      - u/gryfft:
        ```
        Chapter 15 seems to make some overtures to suggest B != W.

        A terrifying little piece of character development really.
        ```

- u/honoredb:
  ```
  Happy to see this back although sad about the reason.

  "Little Matador" seems like an anagram involving "Matilda," since from the plot summary it seems like...well...most Dahl books but Matilda especially, with "Ms. Sweet" substituted in for "Ms. Honey." But I don't know what to do with the leftover letters, except maybe "Let Matilda Rot".
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    I can't rule out the possibility that it's also an anagram, but I think she's called "Little Matador" because she stands up to Trunch*bull.*

- u/OnlyEvonix:
  ```
  Theory: Chetan is some sort of invader that can only infect people who had good parents, the reason there are so many terrible parents in this verse is that many of them are part of resistance movements.
  It wants to get out of the factory because Bucket knows, the fact that he is terrible is beside the point.
  Theory two: Bucket's whole reason for this is to surgically attach Chetan to himself since he could never grow one himself
  ```

- u/gryfft:
  ```
  Finally, a body horror chapter!

  It was horrifying how all those bodies were surrounded by screens. Eek! Next room!
  ```

- u/turgidtypesetter:
  ```
  Only in this story could we pivot from *Emile* to "I have no mouth and I must scream." Thank you for sharing, and I hope you can make the best of this shitty time. Your story has definitely helped me in my self-isolation.
  ```

- u/masterax2000:
  ```
  Hell yeah. So glad to see it back so soon!
