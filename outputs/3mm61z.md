  Dang Zorian, why don't you want to do this with Xvim during other restarts? In fact, why don't you get mentored by him 24/7. You'd be doing everything perfectly after about 100000 restarts.
  ```

  - u/world_is_wide:
    ```
    Their personalities are too different. Xvim has the heart of a grinder while Zorian is more of a explorer/quester

    Finally Zorian has discarded Xvim's incompatible *grind shaping* perspective and started seeing shaping exercises as *his relaxing toy*.

    Imagine the shaping exercises are soon going to hit the next level for magic construction
    ```

    - u/elevul:
      ```
      Plus he doesn't actually need to train WITH Xvim to do the shaping exercises, as he can just do them in his free time while travelling the continent or mindraping people for his other quests, and then come back once every 10-15 restarts to see if Xvim has other shaping exercises for him to do.
      ```

- u/AmeteurOpinions:
  ```
  Xvim cements himself as one of my favorite characters. Something about his relentless cranky-old-wizard attitude and Zorian's continuing reaction to it is enormously entertaining.

    Enhancement rituals and shifter magic is likely a low priority for Zorian, based on this.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Thing is, that only crosses out enhancement rituals.

      I was thinking of something that would directly affect his soul. Obviously he would have to do this once he had his soul sight, but becoming a shifter should give him a physical boost that would carry over restarts (as he is affecting his soul directly).
      ```

      - u/elevul:
        ```
        He can't touch his soul, because even a small change could kick him out of the loop, which is a risk he's not willing to take.
        ```

        - u/Nepene:
          ```
          I hadn't thought of that, good observation.

          Another reason why transfiguration spells would be good. Soul clothes have been proven safe and give most of the same benefits.
          ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        Directly modifiying his soul would probably be dangerous and may have mana costs. It would probably be cheaper for him to learn some transfiguration spells and some physical boost spells.

        Although if he gets to the point where he is physically fighting enemies something has gone very wrong.

  Hm.  The fact that Zorian was able to pierce Xvim's shields temporarily does decrease my probability that Xvim is some type of super thingy.  Zorian, you really need to try slipping something into Xvim's drink and reading the heck out of his mind some loop.

    ```
    Or did Xvim just want Zorian to think that?! :P

    I'd be really uncomfortable if Zorian started mindraping even people who haven't clearly joined the conspiracy. I'm surprised you'd suggest that.
    ```

    - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
      ```
      Zorian is trying to prevent someone from summoning an Endbringer, and heaven knows what other risk of temporal damage.  Not to mention the ethical issues associated with the time loop itself.  I think he has a morality license on stuff he does *inside a time loop*.
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        I dunno, given that Xvim's mindstate is presumably very similar across time loops (and memories pre-timeloop are exactly the same), compromising his mental privacy doesn't 'stay' within the loop. Privacy of the post-loop Xvim is just as compromised (unless Z manages to purge his memories before the last loop ends / early on in post-loop).

        So, I can imagine extreme circumstances where this could be warranted (Xvim refuses to cooperate, Z playing each loop as if it was the last one, Xvim's knowledge likely relevant to the event)... But just doing it because Xvim is mysterios I detest.
        ```

      - u/valeskas:
        ```
        Zorian considers himself defined by his actions. Attacking neutral people would change him, introduce bad habits that may cost him outside of the time loop.
        ```

        - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
          ```
          I guess it could be the right act for the genre.  In Worm that level of niceness would get you killed or worse.
          ```

        - u/SoundLogic2236:
          ```
          More importantly, bad habits are mind effecting, meaning they are one of the few things that could cost him INSIDE the time loop.
          ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        He's noted this issue with himself too.

        >Kael seemed amused that Zorian cared more about his safety than his own, considering that Kael would be restored to normal once the loop restarted and Zorian might not be, but Zorian's moral sense had yet to adapt to the implications of the time loop and he was horribly bothered by the idea of leading Kael to his death in the tunnels and leaving his daughter all alone in the world… even if it was only for a week or so.

        >but he had to admit he knew of no other way to deal with the third time traveler. The only other way involved destroying his soul, and that was arguably even more morally reprehensible. Plus he didn't actually know how to destroy someone's soul. And hopefully never would.

        >And that was without even considering the moral dimension of the whole thing. Picking on innocent people for the sake of personal training was not the road he wanted to go on, and dismissing their plight as irrelevant due to the time loop striked him as an unhealthy attitude to have. He might have justified the whole thing to himself if it was just a matter of tapping into their senses, since that was mostly harmless, but the Luminous Advocates made it clear this wasn't the only skill he would have to practice on his fellow humans to get right.

        He doesn't want to have a morality license. He's worried about going down bad roads and becoming an immoral person.

        >In other words, he needed to develop his mind magic, ethics be damned. He didn't think he could do this on his own, so he would have to seek out other aranea webs for this.

        He is however willing to do a great deal of immoral things for the right cause. 

        Capturing Xvim and interrogating him, while interesting, isn't an action of key importance. Xvim's knowledge doesn't seem to be anything that unique, just exceptionally well practised and skilled. Besides which, eventually Xvim will surely have to admit Zorian's skill eventually, Zorian can just keep improving his shaping skills forever.

        Xvim is also a dangerous target to attack due to his skill. It could go very wrong. As he has no reason yet to suspect Xvim as Xvim hasn't yet done anything too radical why would he? We as readers can suspect him, but as far as Zorian knows he's just a very skilled and powerful mage that seriously annoys him. There are no shortage of strong mages around. If Xvim was some sort of super thing, if he'd mastered empathy as well as Zorian with pure shaping skills it's not like Zorian could contradict him. Xvim surely knows more about how shaping works than he does.
        ```

    - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
      ```
      Why exactly? It's a few minutes of pain (or less, given unconsciousness) in a loop that won't have happened measured against some huge pile of deaths that the summoning will cause.
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        I mean, mind rape is horrible even if it's painless and the victim never notices? Mental privacy is important. You can't treat someone who can know your inner workings as an equal, it completely changes the calculus of how likely is it that the other person is playing/exploiting you...

        I don't really see why Zorian can't just come clean with Xvim in one loop, ask him for some kind of self-signal that he could give him in the next loop to prove it, and then gain his cooperation and presumably answers to any specific questions he might have. Having maintained consensual partnership will mean he doesn't have to hide his knowledge post-time loop, doesn't get desentivised by his actions within the time loop to a degree that it would impact his post-timeloop life, etc.

        It's just fucking wrong and he's nowhere near the situation where he would have to do it.

  Typo thread.

  > Zorian horridly strengthened his mind shield

  Pretty sure that was meant to be "hurriedly".

  Was the double negative intentional?

  Also, while it's not strictly a typo:

    Yeah. And he's definitely not one of the villains. I think it took me way too long to be certain of that. He's clearly very significant though. I wonder HOW he managed to find out about the time loop.

    Wait, I wonder...does the time loop really encompass everyone in the area? What if it's just Zach's, Zorian's and Redrobe's souls going back in time, and no one else's?

    And then they interfere with the timeline, so that every time there's a reset the next loop ends up a little different. Also, we haven't heard anything about zach for months and months. Has he been captured? Is he dead? Is he being mind controlled? Is he redrobe? I vaguely remember that last one being disproven, but don't remember how.

    And considering that so many people have said that time magic is impossible, I wonder if maybe they're not really time travelling. In the Yugioh Millenium world manga, it at first seems like yugi and his friends have travelled back in time to ancient egypt, when in fact they're all still in the Domino City museum, and they're inside a tabletop mmorpg that simulates ancient egypt, and and since it's a magical shadow game, the events in that game are somehow able to influence the past, overwriting it with the events of the game.

    Maybe the Arranea's real bodies were killed, removing them from the simulation.

    So, to recap, all of the expert magical researchers think that time travel is absolutely impossible. And only Zorian, Zach and maybe Redrobe or perhaps someone else retain their memories through each reset/loop. Zorian only became part of the time loop because of some sort of accidental soul connection with Zach.

    Hmm, this still seems clunky. I suppose maybe everyone could be in the magical dream/simulation, and only a few people retain their memories, although then that leaves the question of why does anyone retain their memories, and why those people specifically?

    Any other ways to fake time travel for 2 or 3 people that you guys can come up with?

      A plot point I've seen come up in other loop fics is the badass non-looper who is so good he figures it out anyway each time he sees the upgraded protagonist. I'm betting Xvim fits this archetype.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      My theory is that the cultists were being used. Someone helped them summon a primordial, but let them take the brunt of the costs and then step in to hook the primordial to create the time loop. I'm gonna assume that the universe isn't very large (Ptolemaic model+heavenly spheres), so what the primordial is doing is reversing entropy over the span of existence. It can only rewind for upto a month, and  will eventually run out of energy (that's why the loop is deteriorating). 

      The loopers in this case are exempt from this because their souls are the only thing that isn't being looped.
      ```

    - u/Sparkwitch:
      ```
      >Maybe the Arranea's real bodies were killed, removing them from the simulation.

      I don't think the simulation hypothesis works. Zorian's first run of the time loop includes super-mage Zach and Redrobe-influenced cultists. Zorian *could* just be a self-aware part of the simulation, but that seems an unlikely thing for nobody to do to his protagonist.

  Some observations from someone who just finished reading up to this point mostly in one go (over two days, a week ago). I have advantages and disadvantages in analyzing where this is going. I've just read it so it's fresher in my mind, but I've also not had nearly enough time to think about it and I'm sure some of you have read most of the early chapters multiple times. No mater, here's some of my thoughts:

  * Damien probably maters, but not necessarily. Especially given it seems doubtful he's in the loop.
  * Most likely originator for the loop seems like it would be some sort of ancient machinery. A loot of noise was made out of some kind of magical doors which seems like they might be a possible trigger. In a related note a portal from the same people who apparently made or used these doors exists under the city. Zorain has been given a map of something under the city. This is probably not coincidence. Also why in the world do you have the exit node for your teleportation system deep under ground in a dangerous area.
  * Why did all the spiders dye?
   * Probably they didn't. If I was faced by this I certainly would not put all my eggs in one basket. Why not spread out a bit. Red Robes is no good at mind magic and divination can be perfectly defeated so there's almost no chance he actually tracked down and killed all of them. Why she did not tell Zorain this (unless this is what the message was supposed to be about, but I doubt that) I'm not sure, probably she was worried that he'd draw any potential fire back to them.
  * Xvim What's his game?
   * Zorain is a pretty competent mage at this point certainly for his supposed age and yet Xvim is always discouraging almost to a cartoonist extent.
   * Xvim may just be a bad teacher, but he's shown himself to be talented and probably on the whole write about the things he is trying to teach.
   * At the same time it's clear that he's an abject failure at his goals. He doesn't explain how to make progress on any of his exercises and it seems that he would be happy to use the entire year on silliness. Is this some sort of trick or is he in some way probing for a reaction.
  * Why rebellion.
   * Don't get me wrong but the motivation hasn't really ever been explained. Is it just a power thing? Is the island becoming overcrowded? Why not sooner. What's changed?
  * How many loopers are there?
   * At least two
   * Signs seem to point to 3 at one time
   * Red Robes wasn't physical
    * Why? He had no reason to think he was going to be attacked.
    * It can't be easy projecting yourself like that. It seems like it would require some complicated bit of soul magic.
   * Zorain is tagging along because the targeting mechanism for the spell got messed up but why is Red Robes?
   * Two possibilities. He has his own valid soul identifier, but he seemed unreasonably reluctant to hurt Zach also the loop always restarts for Zorain when Zach dies.
   * Could Redrobes be hitching onto Zach in a similar (probably soul magic based) way as the spiders were with Zorain. AKA he isn't actually looping physically, but his soul is being pulled along.
  * Why/how did Zach start the loop.
   * He's rich, but doesn't actually seem powerful. He has guardians that control him. If anything their interests run counter to him, they have no reason to turn him into a super mage.
   * Resolutions:
       * He didn't: He too got sucked into somebody else's loop.
       * It was an accident. He was going where he shouldn't have gone and he got sucked in
       * Possibly the soul marker is inherited? Last of his line so he's the only one left with the marker.
            * might also explain Red Robes Did any of his family turn them selves into some kind of an immortal with soul magic? Not why red robe's afraid though

  * gods:
   * I have to think gods and their disappearance are relevant somehow. How much power would this who looping exercise take? On the order of the total entropy that was expounded planet wide during that semester. How does it keep it up for literary 100 years. Where is a 100 years of the planets output of magic coming from? The gods maybe in some strange way? Channeled and controlled by some machine?
  * What is Red Robes doing?
   * Red Robes is apparently no longer helping the evaders.
   * Reasons:
      * Red Robes is no more. Something has done him in.
      * Direct confrontation with Zach has finally made him realize there is another looper and he is trying to deal with the problem in some way.
      * Red Robes is devising a counter to the Zorain development/ possibly the spiders.

  What I would do if I was Zorain

  * Put as much of what I've put above to the test as possible.
  * Track down Zach. You're a competent mind mage, he probably isn't at least talk to him and confirm the marker you've been tracking isn't red robes. Do it through a proxy if necessary to assure red robes doesn't gain this knowledge
  * Travel. Confirm the loop extends across the planet. This is potentially dangerous as behavior when exiting the looping zone would probably be bad, but probably OK.
  * Figure out more about the motivations of the rebellion. 
  * Start keeping an eye out for being out of the loop. Ask the priests during the start of each loop if they are in contact with angels. If so you can be pretty sure your out of the loop.
  * Try to figure out if anyone in the invaders forces are disappearing every time at the start of the loop. Red Robes can't control where he is at the start so that's how you catch him
  * Consider knocking Zach out of the loop if possible even if it means killing him.
   * Red Robes probably has not had enough time to come up with a perfect battle plan against the spider less city.   
   * The more time you give him looping the more time he has to do so, at least as soon as he starts helping again.
   * With some practice you probably can beat invasion - super human knowledge.

      I think Xvim is just a horrible teacher. Sure, he knows his stuff, but he doesn't intuitively understand that what's obvious to him is not obvious to people he's mentoring. And he doesn't think about that.

      Thus 'now close your eyes and dodge the pebble', rather than 'now extend your mana around your head and watch disruptions to detect the pebble' because the way to do that is *obvious* to Xvim.
      ```

      - u/space_fountain:
        ```
        Quite possibly and if this was the real world I'd agree with you completely. We are dealing with fiction though even if it's meant to be rational fiction, which means he has to be important given the amount of time that has been devoted to him.
        ```

      - u/nicholaslaux:
        ```
        My understanding is that his "teaching style" places much more focus on "learn through experimentation how to do something you've not done before". If he tells you how to dodge the pebble, you've learned the shaping exercise, but you haven't learned how to find novel solutions to new problems.

        Maybe another student's solution would be to try to reach the bucket of pebbles and "tag" each one to see with detect magic, rather than the mana bubble head. He might be okay with either solution, but is more interested in teaching "how to solve the problem" (in excessively hardass manner, but still) than "how to perform basic shaping exercise".

            That's a perfectly valid point, but to me it mostly is a criticism of the "hardass" aspect of him, not the "lack of teaching them how to do shaping" aspect.

            Generally I would agree with your assessment of him as "teaches reluctantly", but I would assume that when he does teach, he thinks his method is the "right" one in terms of having the best outcome if they can survive it. For those who can't, however, he has provided no value at all, so it's still definitely an inferior outcome unless you think (as I'd assume Xvim does) that anything less than a "completely optimal" mage is worse than no magic at all.
            ```

            - u/None:
              ```
              Either that, or he just doesn't give more than a shit-and-a-half about teaching, and the shaping exercises are his own mildly pathetic way of proving his own superiority by thrusting impossible tasks at students and sneering when they fail. Like a slightly more subtle Snape. He's kept around because he's a shaping master and a senior faculty member - and you don't fire senior faculty.
              ```

            - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
              ```
              Even then, if you want to teach someone problem solving, you don't do what he does. First you explain how problem solving works, then you give them problems to do, and then if they can't solve them you give guidance. 

              I think he learned by this method, so he teaches by it regardless. It 'worked' for him and he presumably ended up feeling superior to most other mages so therefore it must be a good method as far as he's concerned. When kids fail out they're just showing that mages today are too soft and not that his teaching methods are sub-optimal, which reinforces his bias.

  I would hardly call half an hour to eat a meal "wolfing" it down, especially considering they apparently sat in complete silence for over that length, the reason meals take so long to eat is because you talk during them...

    Around four years according to this google drive document detailing the loops. There is an estimated days elapsed which is ~1460 days as of a couple loops back: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZVanJNuiZFmywxl4Vv57vBigADLIjhgXLYF85S8deJ4/edit?usp=sharing

  Just putting this theory here in the unprobable case it turns true so that I can boast in future. I think Zach is a shifter, and was the first supposed sacrifice  for the primordial. The time loop spell was created by the primordial itself, possibly to avoid the sacrifice in the first place. The primordial just wanted to take a small multimillenial nap and now it has to wake up and bring destruction to the mortal plane. It's annoyed as hell.
