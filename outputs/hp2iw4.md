  Why.

  Why have you done this?

  Why would someone create this?

    You have to admit it explains a lot.

      A couple nitpicks, the force isn't always hereditary but it is passed down in the cases of the Skywalkers(and so do a host of mental issues and neuroticism ), and also midichlorians are a symptom of the force but not the cause canonically in new canon. It was a fun little read though
      ```

  ```
  If anything else, I laughed! 

  There are way too many holes in Star Wars to make it a rational fic in my opinion but that's kind of a fun experiment here.

    Especially after the clusterfuck of revisionism in episode 9 act 1

  This is the most reluctant upvote I've ever given

  I dont know why I am laughing.

    I made it to the part about Yoda before I started cracking up.

  THE M WORD IS HERESY.
  ```

  - u/mannieCx:
    ```
    People dont seem to know how midichlorians work. They're heroin.

    No but seriously, they're confirmed to be a symptom of the force and not the cause of it in canon.

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      There are only 3 movies and the M word isnâ€™t in any of them.
      ```

      - u/mannieCx:
        ```
        Not considering the clone Wars canon is fucking heresy. That is a gift from God himself
        ```

        - u/ArgentStonecutter:
          ```
          There. Are. Three. Movies.

    I'm a little disturbed by that site. I've never signed up for Quora, and yet it showed me a popup with my name.

    Seems to be using my google account.  Weird and disturbing.

    edit: maybe I signed up and just have no memory of it.  But I never use "sign up with google" or such.  I'm paranoid about linking accounts.
    ```

    - u/Waebi:
      ```
      I think it's an embedded google site, i.e. your PC asking google "hey, which accounts am I signed in with and could use to link with this site?" I've seen this a few times.
      ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  Surely they can use genetic engineering to build a superjedi without risk of inbreeding.
  ```

  - u/RedSheepCole:
    ```
    Yes.  They can also use technology to fight beyond the WWII paradigm.  They just choose not to.  Like, literally, somebody discovered that trick Holdo uses in TLJ four centuries ago, and somebody objected, "but that isn't fun, and it seems kind of unbalanced," so they ignored it.  That moment where she rams everything to death is meant to be an ironic counterpoint--showing her bucking centuries of fleet traditions, the same way her would-be nemesis Poe defies her--but people who didn't read five different novels and play two different video games from the new expanded universe didn't get it.

    Anyway, doing the Force-assisted nasty with your sister is its own reward, is what I'm getting at here.

      Not sure why you're trying so hard to convince me that the whole star wars universe is bullshit.
      ```

      - u/RedSheepCole:
        ```
        I'm not trying to convince you as such, just doing an overextended and possibly unfunny joke with that as the subtext.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  If anyone needs me, I'll be in a coma, restoring myself from my last morph backup.

  (Great story.)
