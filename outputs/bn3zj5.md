  *Donjon* (Worm OC, Seattle) has updated with Collapse 1-6d! Sepulcher scouts out a warehouse chock full of power-enhanced mobsters and mysterious mercs. 

  I hope you enjoy the thrilling conclusion to Donjon's first multi-part chapter, as well as the primary portion of Arc 1, Collapse! Tune in next Friday for Donjon's first interlude, a look into the head of everyone's favorite mischievous magician.
