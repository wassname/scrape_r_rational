## Rational Fic about ending the conflict between the Jedi and Sith in Star Wars or at least finding a way to maintain the balance between light and dark.

### Post:

So I have just recently posted a discussion post on finding a way to end the war between the Jedi and the Sith in Star wars. I have gotten mixed opinion on it, but that got me thinking does anyone know of any good fanfics where the heroes find a way to end the conflict for good or at least come up with a solution to maintain the balance between the light and the dark and are more proactive in stopping the bad guys from gaining power?

### Comments:

  Remind me why we want to maintain a balance between light and dark?

    That's basically what I would expect characters in such a fic to ask.

    I think Lucas is on record as saying that the dark side isn't actually a part of the balance of the Star Wars universe, but the manifestation of imbalance. So if you were sticking to that interpretation, you wouldn't. I find it kind of interesting that so many go in for this 'light and dark together' idea of balance when the original intention is quite different.  


    And Qui-Gon (as written by Claudia Gray) had a take on it as well:  
     “...It would mean the darkness would be just as strong as the light. So it doesn’t matter what we do, because in the end, hey, it’s a tie! It doesn’t matter which side we choose.”  
    “It matters,” Qui-Gon said quietly. “It matters which side we choose. Even if there will never be more light than darkness. Even if there can be no more joy in the galaxy than there is pain. For every action we undertake, for every word we speak, for every life we touch—it matters. I don’t turn toward the light because it means someday I’ll ‘win’ some sort of cosmic game. I turn toward it because it is the light.”
    ```

    - u/CronoDAS:
      ```
      Yes, Lucas is definitely on record as saying that. The Disney trilogy contradicts it somewhat, though; Luke Skywalker tells Rey that the darkness and light rise to balance each other.
      ```

      - u/Pirellan:
        ```
        to be fair, Lucas did not put that in the movies.  He had three whole movies (prequels) that were essentially world building for the movies he already made and he didnt do it.
        ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    The Sithon is the antiparticle of the Jedion, both mediator bosons of the Force, so Light charge conservation requires it.
    ```

  - u/jacky986:
    ```
    Because apparently according to some star wars fans it is impossible to destroy the dark side because it always comes back so maintaining a balance between the two seems like the least bad option.
    ```

    - u/burnerpower:
      ```
      It coming back implies that there can be a time for it to come back from. That implies it can be eradicated for atleast some time. I see no reason why a balance that permanently incorporates the dark side would necessarily be superior to cycles of conflict where the dark side is annihilated every time it crops up.
      ```

      - u/Freevoulous:
        ```
        maintain a dark side that is present, but relatively placated? Like maybe a cadre of lesser Sith who do nothing but sit on their asses being hedonistic and lazy, but always kill ambitious new upstarts.   


        Its like in the real world: the presence of the italian Mafia (the most lazy, and laid back of criminal organisations) prevents the rise of the local gangs, because the Mafia just guns them down, and then goes back to their low-key prostitution and pizza tax evasion.
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          I get the comparison, but be aware that the Italian Mafia has been quite a bit more violent than that at times. It has now been forced to keep a low profile because had it kept up the insane levels of violence it demonstrated in the '90s, even the relative tolerance of the state and the local population towards its existence would have eventually run dry.
          ```

    - u/lucraft:
      ```
      Oh, actually _A Practical Guide to Evil_ deals with these themes, in a world where fate is bound up in Stories, which have actual power. The Black Knight character here - he doesn’t try to maintain the balance, but he is aware that good and evil seesaw and goes to great lengths to suppress the emergence of heroic characters so that evil can dominate for a little while longer than it is “supposed” to.
      ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        There's a backlash to this as well as theorized by Black.

        He theorizes that the movement of the Great Evil of the continent is due to the older Grey Pilgrim and Saint of Swords being too successful at keeping down villains on their half of the continent.

        The balance must be maintained and if you push your side too far there is a backlash.
        ```

    - u/Valdrax:
      ```
      Considering the Dark Side is the emotional side of the force, I would expect a rationalfic about the Star Wars universe to be heavily Light Side biased.

      And weirdly obsessed with becoming a Force ghost and thus immortal or setting up clones, but I digress.
      ```

      - u/Dragonheart91:
        ```
        Star Wars clones don’t get memories from the original, so that is kind of pointless.

          ```
          The Emperor cloned himself both in the Disney canon and the Legends/EU cannon.  Apparently, he has a way of passing himself on.
          ```

          - u/Taervon:
            ```
            That's because he's using a dark side force technique to basically hijack a body. Sort of like Force Ghosts, except he can possess people.

        Interesting side point — Yudkowski posted his thoughts on the Pixar movie Inside Out which is about (spoilers: the value of negative feelings.)

        He analyzed the rational components closely, but I see correlates here.

        Perhaps a ratfic of light/dark balance is one which notes the need to have multiple Sith lords somehow, each representing different dark feelings, in order to maintain a better balance and then each dark faction is pitted against each other by the Light who in turn vies for influence over teenage protagonist.

        Then just like Star Wars and Inside Out, the main lesson becomes — as a teenager— do you give in to rage, anger, depression, disgust, lust, etc. hormonal impulses or do you follow the peaceful and rational way of the Force?

        Edit: hm, I realized that my “lesson” actually undoes the storyline. Do you as a teenage recognize the importance of of rage, depression, disgust, lust, etc., as NECESSARY portions of your journey to achieving enlightenment and following a more peaceful path and the rational way of the Force?
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          The Force seems to be an entity that, for those who manifest it, will end up amplifying their negative emotions (really, emotions at all: Anakin is undone also by love, after all) to unhealthy degree. So basically if you're born a Force sensitive you're shit out of luck and a therapist's nightmare; you either have to go full suppression, the Jedi's way, or become a psycho murderous Sith. I think this is also one of the main issues with the new sequels, by the way. Instead of exploring more in depth this interesting mechanic, which takes "rationality vs. emotion" to the extreme, it just went for the Force being an awesome inspiring motivational empowering something that Everyone Can Have And That's Okay. Utterly toothless and uninteresting, whereas the old approach to it at least gave a glimpse of a far more difficult reality to deal with.
          ```

          - u/notmy2ndopinion:
            ```
            I guess what I’m trying to say is that each Jedi in training NEEDS to meet and train with each Sith Lord to understand and overcome those feelings in order to emerge from the other side of the experience for the better.

            The movies don’t do this concept full justice — they explore it initially in the first part of the trilogies — but don’t follow through with it.

            So what I’d like to see in an Inside Out/Star Wars Rationalist fiction is a Jedi like HPMOR’s Dumbledore who recognizes through prophecy that the Sith are necessary — and splinters them into numerous parts to expand the journey of the Jedi to further the emotional/rational exploration.

              I'm now imagining Siths wired en masse into their own Matrix, where they get to live out their violent fantasies, and occasionally clash with Jedi trainees dropped in there as a teaching moment.

              - u/Iconochasm:
                ```
                Each Sith faction gets their own planet built like a theme park for going all-in on one emotional extreme, but in a rational and healthy way.  The Temple of Malice is a BDSM club, the Temple of Futility creates art to be shipped to the Temple of Fury as target practice.  The Temple of Hate is serene and austere, with plentiful medical equipment so initiates can see how deranged they've driven themselves by simple contemplation.  A Jedi must pass through each Temple, earnestly partake of their emotional vice, and find the inner strength to rise above it and move on.  The Temples are populated by the failed initiates who couldn't master themselves.

    There were some who lived in balance, and it was kind of like the final goal for Force users.

    >The Ones initially lived in peace and harmony in the home they made for themselves near the site of the geyser. The Father warned his children to never drink from the Font of Power, or bathe in the Pool of Knowledge; however, they eventually disobeyed his orders, with the Son drinking from the Font, giving him the power of the dark side, while the Daughter bathed in the Pool, bestowing on her the power of the light side. The siblings then claimed areas of the jungle for themselves and started to fight each other, while the Father tried to keep the peace between them.[4]

    >In canon, a young woman somehow came to their world. She initially became the Servant, serving and catering to the Ones' needs; however, she eventually became the Mother, doting on the Father and succeeding in mending the relationship between the Daughter and Son. She also managed to persuade the Son to use his destructive nature for a constructive purpose by using his Force lightning to carve new rooms in the walls of the gorge where they lived. However, she was still mortal and as a result she grew old, and was no longer able to keep the peace between the siblings. The ageless children started to resume their fighting, and neither the Mother nor the Father were able to prevent it.[4]

    Reformulate what light and dark mean, those are just words.  If its a yin yang within a fundamental force of the universe it might be quite important, even if the emotional effects of one element on humans is at times adverse. 

    Figure out what the fundamental attributes are setting our moralizing aside and you'd have your rational reason for darks existing

    dark isn't necessarily evil.  It's just emotional, right?  Anger isn't always used for evil.

    Besides, the force is all about balance.  If you have too much on one side, you create potential for the force to create a super-powerful champion for the other side.
    ```

    - u/Reactionaryhistorian:
      ```
      I mean in the Star Wars Universe it is pretty clear that dark is evil. The darkside users are literally going around torturing people while laughing manicly and blowing up planets. That's pretty evil.

      That doesn't necessarilly mean the light side is good. Honestly one could make a good case in universe that both sides are bad but the dark side is clearly worse. And if the force really is all about balance (which I suppose is a nice way of saying it demands a certain amount of planets blown up and people tortured to death) then the obvious conclusion of a stereotypical rational protagonist would be that the force is itself the enemy that needs to be defeated or at least modified.
      ```

    - u/GlimmervoidG:
      ```
      Star Wars canon doesn't have an answer to that question, mostly because the different authors can't make up their mind.

      Much of the EU jumps straight into Manichaeism head first - that is, opposed forces of light and dark, always in conflict, requiring each other. That seems to the the understanding most people instinctively jump to. In a Manichaeism view 'bring balance to the force' means bring jedi and sith into equilibrium, since you need both. 

      It's out of Manichaeism that you get debates like is it good verses evil, light verses dark, calm verses emotion and so on.

      But the actual movies (at least the original and prequel trilogy, spear headed by Lucas) don't really subscribe to this. For example, did you ever notice the term "light side" is never used? Not once.

      This is because in the Lucasian view, the force *isn't* clashing light and dark. The force is defined as balance and the jedi are guardians of that balance. The sith bring imbalance and corrupt the force towards selfish ends. That imbalance is the dark side.

      Or, as Yoda put it:

      >YODA: That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
      >
      >LUKE: What's in there?
      >
      >YODA: Only what you take with you.

      The dark side isn't properly part of the force. It is a corruption of it, created by people who misuse it.

      In this view 'bring balance to the force' means something very different. It means wipe out the sith. You don't bring balance to a system by introducing equal parts balance and imbalance. That's absurd.

    Unhappy Anchovy wrote some good posts on this topic:

    >There are three different and mutually exclusive views of the Force in Star Wars canon. (If you quibble the word 'canon' with me, or start bring up Legends or Disney or whatever, I will be angry. By 'Star Wars canon', I mean officially licensed and published Star Wars products.) I'm going to call these Jedi Orthodoxy, Manichaeism, and Deconstruction.
    >
    >Orthodoxy: The Force is unitary, and it is somehow connected with life. It binds the universe together, it flows strongly in some people or places, and it is inherently benevolent. Particularly wise or spiritual people can sense its currents and draw upon its power. However, there are also some evil people who can twist or pervert the Force, wielding it to their ends and against its own will. This creates the Dark Side. There is no such thing as 'the Light Side': there is only the Force, which is good. Orthodoxy is the viewpoint you get in all the films: this is why 'bring balance to the Force' means 'destroy the Dark Side', and it's why the phrase 'Light Side' is never mentioned in the films.
    >
    >Manichaeism: The Force is still connected with life and with holding the universe together, but the Force as a whole is in some sense amoral. The Force is divided into a Light Side and Dark Side, which constantly push and pull each other. People can tap into or serve either one of these sides, but never both. The Force is characterised by a constant struggle between good and evil, but neither Light or Dark can ever be eradicated. They are like yin and yang, rather, constantly moderating each other in this eternal dance. This viewpoint is very common in EU works. Manichaeism is operative in comic titles like Jedi vs. Sith, for instance, or in KotOR's alignment system. There is Light, there is Dark, they constantly fight each other, neither can ever win, pick one.
    >
    >Deconstruction: This is the rarest view, and is a conscious response to and criticism of the above two. Deconstruction often denies that there is any Force/Dark or Light/Dark distinction to make at all, and tends to question all conventional dogma. It might question whether the Force is needed for life, or if using - or following the will of - the Force is at all meritorious. It might liken the Force to a hostile parasite on life. Alternatively, it might still embrace the Force, but suggest that the Force is somehow beyond all of our categories or understandings. The main feature of Deconstruction is the suggestion that everything you thought you knew was wrong. It mostly appears in works like KotOR II or Traitor.
    >
    >When I have to interpret the Force in Star Wars, I find it can be useful to start by trying to work out which of these perspectives is in play. George Lucas is mostly Orthodox. (Though you still get weird things, like The Ones, which are clearly Manichaean.) The Manichaean view seems to be the most intuitive for a lot of people: it's surprising how many people reacted to the 'bring balance to the Force' prophecy with 'well duh it means killing all the Jedi'. Figuring out the underlying assumptions of a particular piece of Star Wars media is important so that we can understand what the Force is doing in it.

    I tend towards the Orthodoxy position myself. There is no light side. There is only the force (which is defined as balance and who the Jedi serve) and the dark side (which is defined as creating an imbalance through selfish acts and deeds). 

    Or, as Yoda put it:

    >YODA: That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain of evil it is. In you must go.
    >
    >LUKE: What's in there?
    >
    >YODA: Only what you take with you.

    At the same time, I think there's room for this to be an in-universe debate. We can have a jedi orthodoxy, while at the same time Manichaeic heretics. I can see how Manichaeism could be a very effective tool to corrupt jedi.

  I've seen an interesting point about the skewed balance in favor of the Dark Side as a direct consequence of the Jedi doctrine:

  The Jedi are asked to get rid of most if not all of their emotions. Where does all go, all this fear, anger, love, passion? In the Force.

  The Force, from which the Sith extract their power through fear, anger, love, passion.

  Through the Force, the Jedi *fed the Sith.* A galaxy-spanning Order of Jedi funneled power to a handful of hidden Sith for centuries. 

  Until the Jedi were wiped out, and then the Sith starved and lost their power in twenty years. Because honestly, the way Darths Vader and Sidious died did *not* scream "overpowered sorcerers".

      That's the Potentium interpretation, not Jedi orthodoxy.

      Basically, the Jedi say the Force has a Light and a Dark side, and through suppressing your emotions you avoid the Dark Side.

      The Potentium says the Force is the Force, it has no sides, and the Force is inherently good. The Dark Side exists *within the individual*, and is still to be avoided, but not at the cost of total self-annihilation.

      Take, for instance, Anakin Skywalker. The Jedi would say the he fell to the Dark Side only partially by choice; once it had its hooks in him, the Dark Side corrupted him, made him a worse person. The Potentium would say Anakin Skywalker fell to the Dark Side because he was a bitter, spiteful prick with anger issues and no self-control. The Force didn't do that to him, he did that to himself and misused the Force horribly along the way.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

        Then again, considering how quick Anakin's transition from "I'm not recognized for my skills" to "I am unreasonably okay with slaughtering children" was, the Jedi may have a point.

  There's a NSFW SI fanfic over on QQ [Touch the Lekku](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/touch-the-lekku-star-wars-si.7919/) which has an interesting take on the light / dark sides.

  The dark side is more about strong emotions.  If you let yourself be swallowed by emotions amplified by The Force (especially anger / hate) then you can turn into evil.  If you can draw from the light and the dark without giving yourself over to them, then you can be pretty strong and not evil.  I'm probably not doing the story justice in explaining it...
  ```

  - u/EroticRubMuffin:
    ```
    Interesting, the SI mentions the [Je'daii Order](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Je%27daii_Order), which apparently is an ancient version of Jedi that emphasized balance. Looks like a Canon version of what /u/jacky986 is looking for. Not rational, but yeah.

    >The Je'daii Order was an ancient organization unified by its belief and observance of the Force on the planet Tython, in the galaxy's Deep Core. Focusing on maintaining a balance in the Force, a state at which Tython was itself hospitable, the Je'daii saw the Force as three aspects of a whole; the Ashla (Light), the Bogan (Dark), and the Bendu (balance). They saw this duality in the Force represented in the night sky of Tython in the form of two natural satellites; one bathed in light, the Ashla, another shrouded in darkness, the Bogan. In keeping with their view of balance, Je'daii who fell too far to either the light or dark were exiled to the opposite moon to meditate until they returned to balance.

  I'm not sure if this entirely fits the brief, but I think it exists in something a bit like the same headspace. In it, the Jedi are treated a bit more like a monastic religion with crossover in other areas like politics, and take more notice and thoughtful action as a group:

  The whole “He will restore balance to the Force” line was clearly ominous foreshadowing that between Episodes III and IV, thanks to Anakin Skywalker, there existed exactly two Jedi and two Sith. Expanded Universe fans will argue, but I would bet $100 that this is what was in Lucas’s head when he wrote that line for Ep I.

  Also, Eliezer wrote a short alternate fic of the Darth Plagueis conversation where Palpatine makes a convincing case >!that there is no such thing as the light side of the Force. The Force is a combination of telekinetic powers and an evil emotional alignment. “Light Side” Force users access the former while purging emotions to avoid the latter. But induce emotion and a temptation for more power and a dude who woke up a flawed but noble Jedi will slaughter a temple full of Kindergarteners before he goes to bed.!<

    The Death Star had a crew size of 265,675. Alderaan had a population of 2 billion.

    So yeah, blowing up the Death Star was good.

      Also the Death Star was seconds away from blowing up Yavin IV too, which hosted thousands of Rebels. So it was self-defence as well. Had the Empire been defeated in another way they could have simply made everyone get off it and then dismantled it, but there really was no room for that.

    This, and also it's never entirely clear why the Republic is inherently better than the Galactic Empire. Obviously the Galactic Empire rules through fear and military suppression, but the simple fact is that the poverty-stricken worlds we see depicted didn't suddenly \*become\* poverty stricken when the Galactic Empire took over; they were presumably like that under the Republic, too. It's very clear that the Star Wars galaxy is rather brutally divided between the haves and have-nots, with smaller time evil like the Hutts being the only clear winners regardless of regime.

    I think a truly rationalist fiction would need to have its hero notice that the so-called "Light" Jedi are just as prone to genocide as the "Dark" Sith they are purportedly opposing, and try to identify a path forward that doesn't rely on supporting corrupt regimes or overthrowing existing regimes and then eschewing all responsibility and retreating to some mountain to meditate or whatever.

      The Republic had its problems, but it was never as bad as the Empire. The Empire 

      * destroyed an inhabited planet to teach others not to step out of line, and had no qualms about doing it again,
      * enslaved entire races to build its war machines,
      * inundated its citizens with propaganda that non-human aliens were inferior, that species like the wookies and mon calamari were "non-sentient" and to be used as slave labour, 
      * carried out genocides against alien races,
      * had its government and military controlled by xenophobes,
      * brutally crushed any and all form of dissent.

      That the Empire evil is is a central theme in Star Wars. It's not even a secret that Lucas based the Empire on Nazis. They're the bad guys.

      >I think a truly rationalist fiction would need to have its hero notice that the so-called "Light" Jedi are just as prone to genocide as the "Dark" Sith they are purportedly opposing, 

      Except then they wouldn't be Light-side. The light side was aligned with calmness, peace, and passiveness, and was used only for knowledge and defense.

      >and try to identify a path forward that doesn't rely on supporting corrupt regimes or overthrowing existing regimes and then eschewing all responsibility

      The Republic was corrupted by a Sith. Before that it was actually a pretty good form of government. I'm not sure where you get the whole "they carried out coup d'etats and then disappeared" idea, but I'm fairly sure that never happened the way you described.

      Again, the Jedi weren't without flaws. But one of their central tenets was that they didn't have the right to rule others simply because they were Jedi, that they were servants of the Force, something greater than themselves. The Sith were users of the Force, in service to themselves, and that always turned out badly (for others especially). It's arguably this difference in mentality that separates the light side and the dark.

        While I agree in general with all of this and saying there's no clear reason why the Republic should be better than the Empire seems absurd - even going by canon movies alone (admittedly all the xenophobia and slavery stuff is only covered in other stuff) - I don't think it's correct to say that the Light-side Jedi could not *possibly* conceive genocide. They can think, calmly, rationally, and peacefully, that for the greater good, painful as it is, some might have to die. They don't have much problem fighting, killing and waging war. But it would take the right setting for them to do that. Though for example, it's not genocide, but we see them go along pretty easily with the whole clone army thing, which is monstrous by our standards (but then again, that's probably more of an oversight in the writing).

          Maybe, except as far as I know that never happened. Causing misery is just anathema to the Jedi way, even if its for "the greater good." The closest I can think of is the [Jedi Covenant](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Covenant), who turned their back on the Jedi code, and even they were being manipulated by the Sith, which calls into question whether they were still Jedi at that point.

          Traditionally the Jedi have avoided getting involved in wars. Only when there was a great enough threat, like something that could topple the Republic, did they do so. But even then, the Jedi were careful - they knew that the horrors of war could (and would) turn some of them to the Dark side.

          Take the Mandalorian Wars, the Jedi Order didn't want to get involved, but a group of [younger Jedi](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Revanchist) did so anyway. Which led to the rise of [Darth Revan](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Revan/Legends) and a new Sith order.

        >Before that it was actually a pretty good form of government.

        Perhaps, but this is never shown in the later movies (although I haven't watched Episodes 1-3 in a while, so maybe there?). The point I was trying to make is that the lawlessness and poverty that's depicted throughout the Outer Rim in the movies didn't happen overnight. Maybe it was a good form of government for the wealthy folks on Coruscant, though, I don't know.

        >I'm not  sure where you get the whole "they carried out coup d'etats and then  disappeared" idea, but I'm fairly sure that never happened the way you  described.

        Episode 6 they take down the Galactic Empire. Episode 7, Luke is a hermit and the New Republic is apparently completely unable to police its own systems to the point that the First Order is basically in charge; what were they even doing all those years?

        Which brings me to the fact that I think it's the most recent trilogy that has made me super ambivalent about the so-called "goodness" of the Light side. We're shown that Storm Troopers in the First Order are unwilling, brainwashed conscripts, but then the Resistance goes in guns blazing and destroys an entire planet's worth of ships carrying those troops. Not as obviously morally repugnant as Alderaan's destruction, sure, but the practitioners of the Light side as depicted in the movies are virtually incapable of comprehending the complexity or moral ambiguity of their own actions. It's cool to kill a bunch of unwilling conscripts because they're on the "bad side", yet Darth Vader and Kylo Ren are both back in the Light because despite murdering and torturing their way across the galaxy, hey! Turned out they were capable of human feeling toward a single person each.

    I'd have to anti-rec this one. I got through Rumors/Gossip but the characterization of everyone here is just horrid. Sure it's the New Trilogy so you don't have a lot to start with, but things like Flinn being a slave-soldier since birth and the trauma of his training he forgives Kylo in two chapters. 

    Not to mention the force abilities being OP as hell constantly teleporting across the Galaxy and never being utilized properly. 

    Again I realize this is Star Wars, but the politics of running a Galactic Empire is never, difficult. Sure it takes effort but everything just seems to work and everyone is happy. 

    Finally the nail in the coffin at least for me, is the fact that Kylo immediately settles into the 'Grey' Force position without much effort, and Ray never deals with being tempted to it. No discussion is had on the moralities of either side except superficially, they are both just in the middle and sit their right from the start. 

    Also, the sex scenes. Fine I guess, but not the most romantic I've ready nor the most steamy. Which sums all this up, its a bowl of bland oatmeal.

    - u/Dragfie:

      Probably wouldn't disagree with this, but all the criticism here didn't really put me off and I skipped the sex scenes so note this may be taste specific. 

      The biggest appeal of this to me was the "reasonableness". I really enjoy it when characters faults don't make them do stupid things which just aggravate a situation which could be solved nicely, which this story served that taste perfectly. To others this could be the definition of "bland" though lol.

  You know what I never understood? How is the entire galaxy so technologically behind? Has no one reached an AI singularity? Why has no one built an actual dyson sphere? Clearly they could build a planet to absorb a star’s power and shoot it out. But no one built a Dyson sphere? Why even build a Death Star? Just launch asteroids at planets like a normal space faring civilization. Technically we could do it by just adjusting the degree of an asteroid slightly.

  Finally, why is anyone using blasters? They might have infinite charge or whatever but they are slow as hell. People can literally see them coming and dodge. They’re like spells from a wizard’s wand and they’re so slow Jedi can catch and hold them meanwhile a gun could reach a target before they realize they’re dead.

  If I recall correctly the Lore behind the Dark/Light balance is that they both were "supposed" to be eradicated when the Vador killed Palpatine (Bringing balance to the force). The force users who came after would have been neither Jedi nor Sith but an average of both that wouldn't drag the universe into needless wars to maintain the constant swinging seesaw that is the force balancing itself out.   
  This is the biggest reason to find balance. The star wars universe is defined by destiny/fate, (it actually defined by telekinesis and cool laser swords but ignore this) people who use the force and those who are around them are guided by it to fulfill a destiny pre-ordained by the force. the extent to which this limits their free will is debatable but that is another argument for getting rid of the dark/light dichotomy that drives force users to kill each other in a never-ending turf war over the fate of the galaxy.

  This video goes over it pretty well and has a few follow-up videos that go over this pretty well. It's very long but if you just want to skip to the parts relevant to this argument then skip to about an hour and a half in.

  TLDR: Constant war and undermining of free will.

  So.

  &#x200B;

  As some have pointed out, Lucas never saw the balance as having a balance between light and dark. Rather, The light side being the balance and the dark being the chaos and disruption of it. My issue with it, of course, is the themes his movies explore, especially the prequels, as well as the simple question: balance what?  
  if you wish to create a balance, common sense and the definition of the word dictate that you equal two different things, or more. usually they are opposites. So if the light is just another word for balance, and the dark side is merely a chaotic, outside force to disrupt it, then what is being balanced?  
  later on, in the prequels, we saw more of the Jedi mantra and codes, and we saw that they act in ways of heavily suppressing the emotions of their members to give them control.  This is then countered by the Sith, who revel in emotional turmoil and chaos.   
  This gave rise to the fan consensus, which was a heavy point of focus in the old legends, that the light side of the force is the calm side, and the dark side the emotional one.   
  In which case, the Jedi takes the light side to it's absolute extreme, banning confusing emotional maturity and level headedness with stoic apathy, suppressing their emotions and indoctrinating their younglings that as the dark side thrives in emotions, they must be wary of their emotions, and seal them away. Or as Yoda puts it: "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering." Of course this quote can be used differently, but it does show how rather then teach how to confront your faults and your emotions, the Jedi instead makes them the enemy.  
  On the other hand, the Sith takes the dark side of the force, who's source is in emotions, to it's absolute extreme. They believe that one must act from the most inner places of emotions and revel in every single act. Most of the time, however, the only emotions that matter are fear and hatred. Because the Sith has a severe issue, and it's their lust for power. Due to acting out of their basic emotions and desires, each Sith is a lone wolf, one that try and grab as much power as they can and wish for, which resulted in far too many civil wars and purges amongst the Sith. Which led to a weird, and convoluted system in which masters inspire specifically fear in their apprentices to control them, using their wild emotions to restrict them, which should, in theory, stand in stark contrast to the code of the Sith, in which your emotions should liberate you. Palpatine and Anakin are a perfect example for that. Palpatine has been scheming and acting all calm and collected, being busy with politics and running an empire, that he very much so became like the Jedi, a Stoic, overly powerful Bureaucrat. And Anakin, on his side, once turning into his emotions was betrayed, destroyed, lost everything he had, and entered into a long period in which he was manipulated and emotionally devastated, being almost a machine. Tolkien once claimed that evil plant it's own seeds of destruction, and the Sith ideology of freedom of emotions while at the same time being a selfish ideology that supports the limiting of other's freedom of emotions ruined it from the beginning.

  Frankly there isn't. The Jedi/Sith is alot more complicated than it initially seems

  The Light side of the Force represents the natural order of the universe. That is, life existing as it should in relationship to other life. Because the Force is a metaphysical field of existence which exists in all life. Life exists with the living force, and when it dies it returns to the Cosmic force in a feedback loop

  If the Force is a living organism made up of every organism, than the Dark side is a cancer.

  Its why the 'Jedi are the same as the Sith' argument is such bullshit. The Jedi as a system exist to defuse the latent danger present in the existence of force sensitives. Which is that force sensitives possess an absurd amount of power. Not just the visible telekinesis but an ability to see the web of relationships and causality that allows them to effect the world to their desire.

  There a reactive force, not a proactive force. The Jedi are the white blood cells who uphold peace using violence for the sake of de-escalation not for the sake of personal gain

  Furthermore the force isn't an ability you can fine tune to manipulate its mechanics. The abilities of the Jedi and Sith are tied more to intent, desire and understanding. Its spiritual not utilitarian.

  This is why force lightning and force choke belong to the Dark side even if they seem arbitrary. Not because electricity is evil because they are both techniques born solely with the intention of inflicting abuse on another sentient and emerge from the desire to do so. Its about the application, not the actual mechanism itself. Its also why a Jedi can't use Sith magic because to use Sith abilities requires Sith intentions to do so.

  Its also why the Sith always have to be stopped. Because the Darkside is a cancer born when sapient life wields the force to try and impose its will on reality. But as stated earlier it works by a feedback loop. The Sith starts out wanting to change the world and in doing so becomes more and more addicted to his own power inevitably devouring others and wreaking havoc in order to fuel it. The bigger the tumor grow the more it consumes.

  The Sith desire dominion over nature. The Force is all about the intrinsic relationship between living things and their constraints. So as a result the Sith desperately want to escape from those bonds and put themselves somehow above nature. Which leads to all their works and endeavors always culminating in destruction. The Lightside is the understanding that all things have to exist in harmony and that no one is an island untethered from anything else.

  Ultimately there isn't a solution to the problem. The Force is a setting specific thing which is intrinsic to life in Star Wars, it can't be removed without killing everyone. Meaning there will always be force sensitives, the only solution is the Jedi which exist to defuse the threat they pose.

    Okay but, when it comes to maintaining balance in the force the Jedi are very bad at their job. The fact of the matter is that the Jedi's reactive stance has allowed the Sith to grow and plot right under their noses and by the time the Jedi the Sith will have killed hundreds if not thousands of people and/or they are two powerful for the Jedi to handle which results in a purge of Jedi and the Sith takin over the galaxy. I suppose it is logical to assume that trying to destroy the force is a bad idea, but fact of the matter is is that the Jedi's withdrawn nature and reactive stance has led to the death and suffering of thousands of people across of the galaxy. Now if ending the conflict between the Sith and Jedi is impossible then at least the Jedi should fight smarter and take a more proactive stance against the Sith.

      TBF the Jedi were operating after a millennia of peace in which there was no war or Sith to speak of.

      They fucked up badly with Palpatine but considering that the Sith always fall Id say they have a pretty good track record.

      The sheer size of the galaxy makes it impossible to police everything. Expecting the Jedi to be able to defuse the Sith 100% is generally unrealistic given how vast the galaxy. Not to mention that being proactive risks infecting the Jedi with agendas and biases. In order to be effective the Jedi have to be closed off.

      Which is why they put so much effort in collecting force sensitives as a preventative measure.

      The Jedi are passive and reactive. But it’s counterbalanced by the fact that the Sith are unrestrained and self destructive.

Granted it would risk infecting them with agendas and the PT is evidence that doing so is a bad idea, but if they got out more they would be able to improve public relations with the galactic citizens who are mostly apathetic towards the whole Jedi-Sith wars until it's too late.
