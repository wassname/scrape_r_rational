  I'd say humanity both does and doesn't deserve the judgment that we're a bunch of liars. The aliens are essentially right that we're violent and warlike; the peace between Earth and Mars was always uneasy and based on the threat of mutually assured destruction. Which, incidentally, is what it took to make the fleets disengage here, the realisation that many had begun to die on both sides.

  On the other hand, the allegation that everything that humans had said was a lie - that was based on the aliens' inability to accept that someone else could have discovered an FTL principle that they had not.

    Really?

    Humanity abysmally fails its first interstellar contact with stupidly shortsighted infighting, and you would fix this by attacking the aliens that are *still planning to evacuate us from the star-consuming galactic menace*, because they're just that much nicer than us, and you want to persuade them to instead leave us in the lurch?

        Er...do *you* want to be fed into an interstellar mining plant and smelted for raw materials? Because that's on the cards - for all of Earth. And Mars too.

  Why is no one talking about the acedental phisical collision between warships? 

  Am I missing something that makes that happening reasonable?
