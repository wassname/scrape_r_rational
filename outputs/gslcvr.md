  Thanks for sharing the poem, I quite enjoyed it. [This](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44644/a-psalm-of-life) poem by Longfellow makes for a nice pallet cleanser afterwards, if you'd rather not dwell on that small unfocused blur before the dawn.

  ```
  " And so it stays just on the edge of vision,     
  A small unfocused blur, a standing chill     
  That slows each impulse down to indecision.     
  Most things may never happen: this one will,   "

  Great quote, thanks for the link.
