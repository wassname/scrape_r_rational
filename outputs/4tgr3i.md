  Scorch squads, oh fuck. Makes sense in a horrifying way though, interesting way of spinning the 'why doesn't magic impact economy' question.

    Thank you.

    Given the jutsu that we see used in canon, it would be trivial for ninja to turn the world into paradise.  There needed to be a reason for that.

      I failed to communicate it but I love it, and the presentation was perfect. 

      [Quote](#s "Kagome paused to give Noburi a puzzled look. "Scorch squads," he said, as though that explained anything. "You know, the teams that go around culling the civilian population. What do you call them in Mist?")

      I had to put my laptop aside and kinda just process while the consequences of this cascaded. I'm still awed. Great job. I was losing interest in the story (I don't follow the discussions, just the story only quest) a bit between chapters 45-55, but sign me up for *this* ride!

        I strongly suggest getting involved in the discussions; they're great fun, even if you don't actively vote, just reading and talking is fantastic.
