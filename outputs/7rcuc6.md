  Great chapter!  I especially liked how the "Good" hero is able to arrive at compromises that involve superior outcomes.  Someone forced by magic to be "zero tolerance good" wouldn't be able to ignore, say, an unlawful soul mage in his territory.

  Now I'm hoping they encounter the "Evil" hero.  Exactly why does he have enough supporters and thus gems to even stay relevant?  Who's voting for him and why?
  ```

  - u/ProperAttorney:
    ```
    It may be that the "Evil" hero may be able to hypothetically kill baby Hitler, whereas the "Good" hero would not.
    ```

    - u/SoylentRox:
      ```
      But then if the "Evil" hero gets better outcomes, as measured by a set of terminal values that both the Good and Evil heroes share, doesn't that make the Evil hero more "Good" than the good hero?

      That is, ultimately what *matters* is the expected outcome of a given set of actions.  Measured against what you care about - whatever that is - the *best* choice to make in our reality is that one that results in the best *expected* outcome.  (it may be wrong but you update your model with each actual outcome and always choose the best from what you know about)

      "Good" means "I'm not willing to do certain actions, whether or not they result in a better outcome".  Which is evil.

      If I increase the probability of 1 million people dying from old age because I'm not willing to kill 100 people as test subjects for a treatment for old age, I'm evil.
      ```

      - u/Keshire:
        ```
        I think in this case it's a balance of Objective versus Subjective. You can be subjectively evil, but objectively good. Or subjectively good, and objectively evil. (ie Killing an 'evil' baby)

        In this case, the evil hero has carte blanche to torture and kill in order to keep his position as demi god. It's not about the city per se. It's about the power associated with helping the city. In the eyes of the townsfolk he's going to be a person that gets things done. As opposed to the good hero to who wasted time and resources to achieve essentially nothing.

        I'm kinda interested in what the evil affliction entails. I'd guess it makes corruption, bribes and snitching more likely. Sell your grandmother out style stuff.
        ```

      - u/Ace_Kuper:
        ```
        Hm or you are evil if you immediately jumped to killing people, without searching for an alternative.

        Hell, you don't even need an alternative if you have a 100 people willing to do it, cause they want to save someone or we have 100 people waiting for an execution, cause they done some very heinous acts. In Aerb depending on the soul destruction\hell after death, your experiment might be a mercy to criminals.
        ```

        > as measured by a set of terminal values that both the Good and Evil heroes share

        If we start from the presumption that discrete acts are the point of evaluation, there's no reason to expect Good and Evil are based on terminal values. 

        Your line of argument presumes consequentialism, but there might be other ethical systems that comprise a better fit.
        ```

        - u/SoylentRox:
          ```
          Specifically, I'm implying that consequentialism is actually the only correct system of morals because to do anything else is not a rational decision.

          Really and truly, only outcomes matter, as predicted to the best accuracy possible.  Just like real experimental data trumps philosophy and thought experiments.

          This is "new", I guess, I understand philosophy and ethics goes back a long way, I'm just saying that all of the other forms of ethics are irrational bullshit.  Same as other ways of doing things pre formulation of the scientific method.

          And the laws of the universe back me up.
          ```

          - u/vaegrim:
            ```
            > And the laws of the universe back me up.

            Wait what? What the 'laws of the universe' are is precisely the question. Given the observation "killing baby Hitler registers as an evil act", you must assume that either your conclusion of the ethical math is missing some variables or that the system evaluating the virtue of the act isn't consequentialist. 

            **In this specific conversation** 'rational' isn't about evaluating the system the universe 'ought' to use, it's deducing the system the universe is using, given the observations we have.
            ```

            - u/SoylentRox:
              ```
              That's just it.  The reason the laws of the universe back me up is that consequentialism means using the best cognitive method you have available to determine the probable outcome that the laws of the universe will generate.  

              You may be wrong, but any prediction can be wrong, you've gone out and systematically tried to make your prediction the best one, and will update it with each outcome.

              Other forms of morality, you arbitrarily decide that something is "wrong". Like killing babies.  Making that decision without modeling what the _universe_ will probably do as a consequence for your action is by definition acting irrationally, as you're ignoring the actual consequences in favor of feeling good that you haven't killed a baby.  (admittedly that's also a consequence, but if you're talking about killing baby Hitler...)

              The root cause of this type of morality is the belief that an invisible deity is judging your actions and is going to do something in response to you after your death.
              ```

              - u/vaegrim:
                ```
                An invisible deity IS judging Joons actions! Are you actually talking about the story at all?
                ```

          - u/WalterTFD:
            ```
            "And the laws of the universe back me up."

            I feel like you are kind of eliding between consequentialist ethics and the scientific method here.

            Like, saying that disagreeing with you is 'not a rational decision', or that 'only outcomes matter' in a discussion about what is rational, and what matters, is using a point to prove itself.
            ```

      - u/infomaton:
        ```
        I consider it highly unlikely the DM is a strict consequentialist, although they may have consequentialist influences. They'll presumably prefer narrative oriented ethics, which virtue ethics seems best suited for, but with a deconstructivist bent.
        ```

        - u/WalterTFD:
          ```
          The 'cowardly' affliction from earlier strongly weighs against the notion of the DM as a strict consequentialist.
          ```

      - u/WalterTFD:
        ```
        "ultimately what matters is the expected outcome of a given set of actions."  You smuggled in consequentialism there.  No reason to assume that the world works that way.
        ```

        >But then if the "Evil" hero gets better outcomes, as measured by a set of terminal values that both the Good and Evil heroes share, doesn't that make the Evil hero more "Good" than the good hero?

        Obvious answer: Evil delivers better outcomes *for specific groups*. The people who vote for 'Evil' vote because it gives *them* better outcomes, even if in a *universal* sense, it gives worse outcomes.

        And of course, lies would cover why the victims were justified or whatever, to rationalise screwing outsiders and other demographics. That happens all the time in the real world.
        ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    The Median Voter Theorem guarantees that voters will be evenly divided between the Good Party and the Evil Party.  You think I'm joking?
    ```

    - u/LeifCarrotson:
      ```
      Why does Hotelling's Law of spatial distribuition not cause both parties to move towards the center?  

      (That is the effect that observes how you can drive for miles and not see a gas station, then come across four at one intersection. That happens because if they were further apart, one could relocate closer to the center, therefore they all end up together).

      By extension, if a Good candidate changed to be only mostly good, they would still capture all the good voters (who wouldn't dare vote for the Evil candidate) and might pick up a few evil voters that were nearly centrist. So the Evil candidate would change to be merely mischievous and recapture those votes and maybe a few slightly good votes as well. Eventually, they should both be Neutrals, right?

  Great chapter, but... the dude yanked twenty skill points and didn't get to put them somewhere else?  Didn't even seem to try?  That seems strange.

  Especially since nothing we've seen about this system would make "reduce a skill to zero" ever a beneficial change (outside of this specific sort of situation).  We haven't seen any global skill caps or diminishing returns for one skill based on rank in another, etc.

    Joon conducted an experiment with the number assigned to "Level Up" in his list of values, which began to tick upward after he shifted it down.

    He concluded:

    > it confirmed something that Fallatehr had said. Changes would revert, given time.

    So it may simply be a matter of time until his Essentialism returns to 20 on its own.
    ```

- u/munkeegutz:
  ```
  I think that:

  -Fallatehr obviously was the cause of all of this.  Fortunately, this is mostly because he lacks the understanding of how Joons genius works.  Clearly, Joon can simply re-learn essentialism now.

  -There have been many cases where Joon has gotten a skill above 20 by simply practicing on his own -- I'm thinking of rifles, bone magic and skin magic at the least.  I think that Joon should talk to Fallatehr to learn what's possible, and then go off to train on his own.  It is simply amateur training as opposed to actually using the skill in novel contexts which get blocked at 20.  If he went off on his own and tried new things / experimented, he could learn without help.  Evidence supporting this theory includes the lack of a "(Skill can no longer be increased by amateur training.)" after the essentialism level-up.

  The alternative (which would be amateur training) would be, for instance, if Fenn told Joon to move her value assigned to, say, the color green, up and down repeatedly to grind the skill.

    I believe all three of the skills you mentioned were leveled past twenty in live combat against the unicorn.

    - u/Laborbuch:
      ```
      > Evidence supporting this theory includes the lack of a "(Skill can no longer be increased by amateur training.)" after the essentialism level-up.

      He had just reached lvl 20, as evidenced by him witnessing the number change. He had not yet have the experience to hit lvl 21, which would have elicited the amateur training cap system message. Though I may admittedly be wrong in inferring this being the condition for the message.
      ```

  - u/NoYouTryAnother:
    ```
    I really suspect that, whatever Fallatehr's plan is, it involves a de-powered Joon. The obvious thing is to subvert one or more of his allies without Joon being able to check. In this situation, although Fallatehr's knowledge of Joon's learning rates may not be perfect, it is a known unknown. If Joon has an ace up the hole, it is probably his tame demon.

  This just makes me more interested in seeing the Lawful Evil approach to problem solving and mass appeal. Not only does the other fellow have to be a sort of paragon of Evil, capital E, he also has to somehow win the hearts and minds of the town's population in doing so. He has to be both Evil and somehow working for the town's greater Good, too. Or does he? 

  Just really interested in seeing the other side of the mirror to the Abswifth, who was great. I've always liked to read about the Paladin figure who isn't constrained by their code. Or even who has a code that empowers them, morally, in pursuit of maximal Good, instead of being "Lawful Stupid." The threshold deontologist Paladin.

- u/SeekingImmortality:
  ```
  Lawful Evil: What can I do, while keeping to the bounds of some defined system of honor or law, which will have not the greatest utility for everyone collectively but instead the greatest utility for ME?  

  Well, if the greatest utility for ME is to be continually voted into being superman so that I have great personal and political power, then performing acts which result in the populace deciding to continually vote for me would be best.  So...y'know...being a great and effective ruler, almost exactly as if you were 'Good'....just Not out of any sort of idealism.

  Though like the earlier chapter examined, there'd probably also be sideline investigations into the whole 'bussing in people whom you convince to vote for you and then murder' as a way of ensuring permanency of being superman.

  Thanks to **nohat** saying something in the previous chapter discussion thread, i was able to form a more coherent thought on why the party gives me a strange murderhobos vibe.

  This comment of his especially

  >The cosmic horror of the game and the narrative are well done, though I'm not really a fan of the sorta intrinsic fourth wall break, and in universe forced narrative structure really puts me off

  All members are effectively [Conveniently an Orphan](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvenientlyAnOrphan). Plus I realized that every person the party interacts with ends up dead\betraying them, a "vendor NPC" or a party member. The only exception could be the helpful bone mage, but it falls under the vendor category.  Is there any named individual with more than a few sentences to their name that doesn't fall under this pattern? As far as i remember, anyone not dead is an enemy, vendor or at best a quest giver\objective.

  I guess this is due to the story and author having roots in being a D&D campaign and dungeon master. The same can be said about the world. Locations are for all intended purposes are separate, autonomous and the world is VAST. It gives room for putting stuff in, but now it feels disjointed and empty for the places that were not mentioned. It just occurred to me when Juniper mentioned the map in this chapter. Teleportation allows to visit different locations, but at the same time it's like jumping from set piece to set piece without knowing how\if they connect.

      As i said, it can come with the territory per say. 

      Pen & paper adventure offers freedom, but at the same time it seems a lot more limited than an average video game nowadays if you only make you characters murder\fight stuff. Plus, you can put only so much talk about morality and intricate plot if in reality it's enemy-kill-rest?-enemy-kill.

      Even if Junipers "real world" friends in the respective segments talk about tropes, decisions, freedom of choice and it certainly gives the worlds creative freedom, it limits the Aerb world to a narrow path of D&D adventure of a group that only solves problems one way.

      It's easier to feel for the characters and appreciate the world when it feels real and lived in.Otherwise at some point you either don't care about what happens to anyone or see the repeating pattern and stop being invested.

      Even the most delicious meal if served every day becomes stale.

        Which is presumably what happened to his friend Arthur. The rinse and repeat finally got to him.

          This can be true. But from a standpoint of reading\creating a good story it should never be "it was dull\repetitive\uninteresting on purpose". Especially if it's a long written one.

          I love this story, but those are things i just notice by reading it.
          ```

- u/Makin-:
  ```
  Theory: Fenn gave the tip to incriminate Fallatehr, given her intense hate for the man, her access to the info and the lack of negative consequences beyond making Joon undo some easily recoverable progress. 

  That said I have no idea how she would have done it, so maybe the theory makes no sense. I'm just not seeing how this would benefit Fallatehr at all.
  ```

  - u/rlxmx:
    ```
    That implies that Fenn both knew that Joon could dodge a soul magic test (and how he would do it), and that she was willing to give her own description to the cops. If her goal was to spike Fallatehr, why not just give descriptions of him and his group alone? 

    The cops were given 4 descriptions (2 were definitely Joon and Fenn), and each party has four members, for 8 people total. Even if it *was* Fenn, she would have given them at least 1 more description -- Fallatehr and his 2 remaining loyal minions + Joon and Fen make 5 descriptions, not 4.

    >“Last night we were anonymously informed that an unregistered soul mage was set to visit Parsmont,” said the Abswifth. “We were given descriptions of four individuals, two of which are a match for the two of you."

    My best guess is that the remaining 2 descriptions are for Mary and Grak — which would allow Fallatehr to avoid giving away that Grak is compromised (which would have been a big hint in that direction if the Abswifth had said 3 descriptions, not 4). After all, theoretically Fallatehr doesn't know that they already have a (now) reliable witness to events that first day.
    ```

    - u/Makin-:
      ```
      Oh, my point is that she just wants Joon to finally agree to killing Fallatehr, so the tip has to be something that would 
      seemingly only benefit him.
      ```

- u/Izeinwinter:
  ```
  Hmm. Okay, the inescapable conclusion from the perspective of the soul mage that just did that examination is that Joon was powered the heck up using the exclusion zone that excluded skill transfers. Presumably, since he is the bodyguard of a princess and not a moral monster (the soul mage can see his values directly!)  with the aid of volunteers found in hospices. 

  Assuming he is a loyal citizen of Parsmount, this will not blow up in their faces in the short term, but it absolutely is a plot hook that can show up at any arbitrary future point with the official soul-mages showing up and politely inquiring where that exclusion resides.
