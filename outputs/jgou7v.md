## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  My friends and I go to a corn maze every Halloween but can't this year for social distancing so I made a virtual one. We've done it already, so now I'm [sharing it](http://noisyowl.com/corn/) with everyone. Would recommend getting some friends together on some sort of voice/video chat and all trying at once.

    Add some jump scares and you have a horror game.

    Not bad. It's a little hard to distinguish distances but honestly that just makes everything tougher, which is great.

    If I had a million dollars and *had* to spend it on frivolous things that would bring me no material benefit, "pack of eight tyrannosaur skeletons in a life-size diorama" would be pretty high up on my list now.

        Dinosaurs are great. 

        It's amazing and awful and wonderful that they existed.

            Have you thought about 3D printing them?

                Yea, in that case, current FDM printers aren't going to cut it, and DLP is still too expensive for things the size you're looking for.

  So about that animorphs fanfic
