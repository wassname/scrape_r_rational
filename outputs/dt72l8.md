## Have you played MUDs? Imagine a LITRPG turned into a game.

### Post:

Multi User Dungeons are basically text based MMORPGs. A lot of them a very roleplay heavy too. Because it is all based on text that means that it is relatively cheaper for new content to be added. The reason that I felt like posting about it here is because LITRPGs can if handled properly be proper rational fiction. However in a lot of LITRPGs it seems that the stat screens are totally meaningless whereas in MUDs they are not. I think that LITRPG writers who want to write rational fiction could take some cues from MUDs.

Anyway I would be interested to know if there are any writers here who have been affected by MUDs. A lot of players in MUDs are pretty good at roleplaying so sometimes it really does feel like being the protagonist of a LITRPG sometimes.

    Oof. Clearly not the most rational of player bases...

  I've only really played BatMud, where people don't really roleplay. But it is an awesome game with shitton of races, classes, skills... It's damn old, but actively developed. I think they call rp muds MUSHes.

  What cues would you take from MUDs, and which MUDs? There seems to be very little overlap between the actual mudding experience and what makes for a good LITRPG story, as far as I can tell. Can you expand what you mean?

  I'm familiar with MUDs, but have never really played. Would you happen to have a specific example of one you think is good, a screen cap or a link or whatever, of the stat screen from an actual MUD? Or a representative sample from several MUDs for comparison purposes?

    [Slothmud.org](http://www.slothmud.org/) is the best one I've played.  It held my interest for almost 20 years.

    The world constantly grows, and there's a seemingly infinite amount of content to explore.  (I guess it's easier to make a huge open world when you don't have to draw it!)

  I haven't played, but [this](https://www.starmourn.com/) is supposed to be the most modern/awesome one from what I've heard.
  At the very top of the website there are links to more MUDs made by the same developers.

  I used to play WotMud, based on the Wheel of Time.  


  I do have to remark on the irony of "turning a litrpg into a game" though, considering that litrpg is basically "what if this game were instead a book about being in a game". The Wheel of Time turns, indeed...
