  The author’s note in chapter 1 doesn’t inspire confidence that I’ll be rewarded with a novel plot if I keep reading. Is there a meaningful deviation from canon?

    A LOT.

    It's very much an AU.

  Has anybody read this and can give a review of the content?

    ```
    It's really good. The best bleach fanfic I've ever read.
    ```

- u/Subrosian_Smithy:
  ```
  I found some minor spelling and grammar errors as I was reading - English isn't the author's first language - but they didn't detract from my reading experience with an enjoyable reimagining of the early arcs of Bleach.
