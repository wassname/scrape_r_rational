## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Can anyone recommend some good super-intelligence fics? I really enjoyed Understand by Ted Chiang and the Crystal Society Trilogy. There were one or two minor characters in Worm that also had this trait. If I recall, one character got smarter the harder the problem was he was trying to solve. The orange pill character in [how deep the rabbit hole goes](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/)
  Is also really good.

  Anything else that might scratch that itch?

    Flowers for Algernon, the book rather than the short story, is a great one. 

    Limitless? I haven’t read the book, but I enjoyed the movie.

    Edit: Just remembered that Larry Niven has some superintelligence in some of his Known Space books. Protector, Fleet of Worlds.

    I rather enjoyed Vernor Vinge's A Fire Upon the Deep. He posited the idea of [Zones of Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep#Setting) to solve the problem of intelligence beyond our own in fiction: to wit, it becomes the story in the way time travel in a tale does, and further it is rather a challenge to write about someone who is smarter than the author.
    ```

    - u/rshap1:
      ```
      I read [Ar'Kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) a lot and the way that they show intelligence is having very vast and complex thoughts in a short period of time. So you'll see the character analyze everything that's happening around him, make some deductions come to conclusions etc. And it will end off with "two seconds have past" something like that. It's kind of a hacky way of doing things, but it works pretty well and gives the feeling that the character is capable of advanced intelligence.

      Anyways, thanks for the rec I'll check it out
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        I think the other way the author shows intelligence works better. The protagonist will be talking with someone, and is instantly able to deduce the intent behind the other person's words. Instead of "she said timidly," it's "she said a small lie." It honestly works quite well imo, and even changes how the story is written after the protagonist obtains the intelligence stat.
        ```

        - u/rshap1:
          ```
          Yeah I agree. I also feel that the way the characters thoughts and opinions have shifted work well. I don't know if it was intentional but he started off being very emotional and nervous and now speaks and thinks in a more calculative and authoritative way.
          ```

  ```
  Has anyone read any good Otome isekai stories that they’d be willing to share?
  It’s my guilty pleasure, and I’ve found one relatively recent story that’s pretty good: [Tori Transmigrated](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47030/tori-transmigrated)
  Not sure if y’all would consider it rational, but it’s pretty good, and the main character isn’t ridiculously overpowered like some stories in this genre. The wilderness arc, especially the preparation was well thought out, and pretty accurate to real life.
  ```

  - u/TREB0R:
    ```
    Tori Transmigrated literally just pisses me off to read and for some reason I love it. All the Otome isekai stories just blend together into generic trash that I find fun to read, so I can't really remember any that stand out. I enjoyed the webtoon version of Beware of the Villainess! which was pretty funny with some great art, but I hated who was going to be the male lead so I dropped it a while ago.

    If you want something more humour-based with low stakes, Please Fix The Story [Please Fix the Story!](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23987140/chapters/57699619) is a fun one. The world-building won't be as complete, and it doesn't take itself too seriously, but the dialogue makes me laugh every time. Think more popcorn snack than serious dinner.

    This is a bit late, but [Agenda of the VIllainess](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34311/agenda-of-the-villainess) was setting up some interesting dynamics while taking place in a Victorian-like setting. Unfortunately, it's currently on hiatus.

- u/Tiraon:
  ```
  Does someone has a recommendation for a story that explores a significantly alien mindset and outlook?


  For example [Shade Touched](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched) - from a viewpoint of an intelligent zergling basically. Though that one is long-term inactive, unfortunately


  Or a Foreigner series by CJ Cherryh - a human fitting in among a very humanoid and very psychologically different species
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    [deleted]
    ```

    - u/smallcool:
      ```
      In my opinion though, this is **far, far, far** more of alien mindsets than Shade Touched (and most of the other recommendations).

      The alien mindsets are on the level of Three Worlds Collide by EY, but unlike Three Worlds Collide, many of the alien characters are POVs from the alien, not from the humans.

      I'd highly recommend this if you're into xenofiction (it was even [recommended last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/qfhdft/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/hied7di/)), but just be aware that the POVs can sometimes be pretty hard to decipher.

      It's also got some pretty cool artwork, which can help since it's hard to imagine just how different some of the aliens are from text alone.

      [Onward to Providence - Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34353/onward-to-providence) link, since SpaceBattles usually isn't the best place to read 400k words.

      SpaceBattle also splits up "Threadmarks" (the story) and "Informational" (info about planets/species). Normally, this is great, since most people can just read the main story, and look at the informational stuff if they're interested, but Onwards to Providence has such alien POVs that the codices are really useful. RoyalRoad interleaves the codices with normal story chapters, so generally you can just press "Next Chapter" and you'll see a codex explaining the aliens from a human perspective.

    ```
    Short story: [The Things](https://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/) by Peter Watts. It is from the perspective of the alien from _The Thing_ (1982). (Knowing the synopsis is good enough.)

    Super Minion is a good story with an inhuman protagonist. It's either dead or on hiatus but has a solid 50 some chapters. https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion/chapter/303435/ch1-taste-test
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      I do wonder if the story really is dead now or it’s just a REALLY long hiatus. I could totally see the author come back with “sorry for being late, here’s 5 chapters” and then disappear for another year.

      I hope it’s still going.
      ```

    ```
    Blindsight, by Peter Watts. It is a first contact story with some starfish aliens with a weird mindset.
    ```

  - u/plutonicHumanoid:
    ```
    [OCTO](https://zalbert.net/octo/) is really good.
    ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    Ted Chiang is a perennial rec on this sub, for this reason among others. Story of Your Life (the novella Arrival is based on) is particularly good.

    Also, Three Worlds Collide by EY.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Xenogenesis by Octavia E. Butler. Icky and a bit depressing stuff though.

    Maybe Greg Egan's works, changing the geometry of space results in very different lives.

    - u/Allanther:

    My favorites from RR with this trope are [Mud's Mission](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31919/muds-mission) (abandoned, unfortunately, but what is there is good) and [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion). 

    The Crystal trilogy fits the bill as well.

    [The humans do not have a hive-mind](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/giayss/the_humans_do_not_have_a_hivemind/) is an excellent series of short stories on r/HFY, later made into a book which is quite alright as well. It has two PoVs, one human and one really well-done inhuman. It's probably my favorite r/HFY story (sorry, Eliezer).

    Speaking of that, his story [Kindness to Kin](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/lom9cb/kindness_to_kin/) there, as well as Three World Collide, are also great at portraying inhuman aliens.
    ```

  - u/smallcool:
    ```
    It might be worth searching for "xenofiction" ([TV Tropes link](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Xenofiction)), since it's all about alien mindsets.

    Most of my recommendations have already been posted by other people here, so [here's a link to some previous recommendations from /u/alexanderwales](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/97oo2e/challenge_companion_xenofiction/).

    The Imperial Radch Trilogy by Ann Leckie is a bit controversial, (despite the first book, Ancillary Justice winning a crazy amount of awards), but I enjoyed it. The main character is warship called "The Justice of Toren", who used to control 1000s of ancillaries (like a hive mind), but after their main body gets destroyed, they're stuck controlling a single ancillary.

    In fantasy genre, most of the dungeon core stories are about humans that are controlling a dungeon, but there are some, like [A Lonely Dungeon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37231/a-lonely-dungeon) where the main character was never human.
    ```

  ```
  A while back in Savage Divinity, there was a stretch of chapters where Rain is like a pseudo general, or something, and has to allocate soldiers to different tasks based on reports. Things like, send soldiers to x village to check whether or not the reports on demons is correct, decide on whether or not to execute people based on signs of demon posession, etc. Should he trust this report of demons and send soldiers there? Could turn out to be false, in which case he wasted the time of a bunch of soldiers who are needed elsewhere. Or maybe it's true and he decides not to send soldiers, and the whole village gets massacred. It was him trying to solve very ill-defined problems with bad information, and basically trying to make the best of a really shit situation. What I especially liked about it was that his job was basically to stamp different papers, resulting in the life or death of people. 

  Any other stories that evoke similar feelings?
  ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    *Papers, Please* fits the bill. Do your job as border control faster and better, or lose your job. Glory to Arstozka.

    There’s also a genre of tactics games that are about this on the object level even if they don’t have quite the same theme. Games where sending untrained recruits to die can be the only way to keep the greater organization afloat. Old-school X-COM (and perhaps the Long War for new XCOM?) would be in this category. *Darkest Dungeon* lives for this.

    It’s also a popular genre in cooperative board games. *Pandemic* is obvious, but the presentation isn’t as grim as the underlying fiction. *Kingdom Death* would be one where your party accrues more crippling injuries and psychoses as you scrabble against monsters.
    ```

      I was actually gonna write about *Papers Please* as the second example, but didn't in the end. Great game!

    A Practical Guide to Evil has large stretches of similar military issues. The Malazan Book of the Fallen also has some of this, but it's split between the perspective of dozens of characters. There's some great sections of excellent military problem solving with explosives though. Fiddler is basically an honorary goblin.
    ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      Oh yeah, Malazan is basically defined by people making these decisions. (Maybe early Malazan? I’ve only read the first 3.)  The fallout of the Siege of Pale is a good one.

      Though we don’t tend to get as much of the perspective of anyone signing off on this stuff, at least not early on.

    The game 'Yes your Grace' maybe ? I didn't like it though, it felt like the game was punishing me for being rational and making rational choices just to imply that I should always be the good guy even if it directly causes the death and suffering of thousands of people.

    &#x200B;

    Oh my daughter will have a shitty marriage and an unhappy life. That sucks but you know what sucks more? Thousands of people dying, women and children getting raped by invaders, the enslavement of my people.. 

    &#x200B;

    It's arguably a good well reviewed game though, you might like it depending on your personality and tastes. To me it was just annoying, I could see the writer purposely punishing me and shoving moralistic nonsense down my throat constantly.

  Looking for slow-paced, long works with a smart/rational/introspective (at least one of the three, but the more, the merrier) protagonist who is either evil or takes up the villainous role.

  ...I've just realized that I essentially asked for *Only Villains Do That*. Well, consider that the gold standard.

  Unrelated to the first one—but a combination with it would be *very* welcome—I'm looking for LGBTQ romance with rational characters and/or monsterfucking with rational characters.

    Overlord is this, although there's a bunch of caveats with it that might hamper your enjoyment. The tldr is that the last member of a top guild in an MMO shutting down gets isekai'd, along with his entire guild base and resources, including all the npcs. While there's plenty of introspection and social finangling as the protagonist tries to navigate both himself and the entire guild he is now responsible for through the world, he is still as smart as a top tier MMO player, so his intelligence is mostly related to small scale PVP and social scenarios on the level of office politics, which is nowhere near appropriate for the level of power and scale of events that unfold. Even if he does actively work on improving his ability to lead and learn about the world, and try to guide his new underlings to grow as people, he's never as smart as the main characters of most of the stories that come through this subreddit. 

    There's other things that might turn you off too, most of the nearby enemies and powers don't really understand just how much stronger the protagonist and their allies are, because they're basically an Outside Context Problem, means they aren't acting "intelligently" in the sense that you know from the start (as the reader) that they are making decisions that will end badly, which could feel unsatisfying or pointless to watch happen. The author also writes near entire novels from perspectives of people other than the main character, which is rather weird. Book 3 is about the main character sending one of his underlings to conquer all the nearby lizardman tribes as a test of their forces and learning exercise, and 90% of the story is seen from one of the lizardmen being conquered effortlessly.

    It does have a lot of content (14 light novels so far, don't bother with the anime adaption only the first season was sort of decent and still cut out so much from the novels), and there is a broad enough scope to the world, reinforced by the switching perspectives, that does make it a pretty enjoyable experience overall if the possible pain points don't grate on you. (Although the very big worldbuilding questions of "why did the isekai happen?" and also  "how the fuck did a bunch of NPCs get effectively ensouled and mindfucked in such a way they don't realise they weren't always sentient?" getting ignored in favour of the world itself are things that would specifically bug the people of this subreddit more than most too)

    TBH it's pretty much a prime candidate for a ratfic version of the story getting made, so whether or not seeing a story with all pieces on hand but 'underutilised' by the author could be interesting or infuriating.

      Thank you for the reply! I read the manga when it had just started to get released—so, in 2014 or 2015. I followed it for a while, enjoyed it, but at some point my passion fizzled out. I might get to LNs just to see how much they differ and what did I miss.

  A few years ago, I read a short story that (I think) was recommended here, and I’m trying to find it again so I can reference it elsewhere.

  The story was about a villager whose tribe has no writing system; they rely on oral history to keep track of their past. This tribe and a neighboring tribe have an argument, each thinking that the other did something historically. The protagonist works with the westerners who have recently come into contact with the tribes and discovers that they have written evidence which proves that one tribe is factually correct and the other wrong. Then there’s more that happens that I won’t spoil in case someone else wants to read this.

  Does anyone here remember this short story? I’d love to be pointed to it again; all the searches I could think of turned up nothing. I suppose it’s possible that this wasn’t a ratfic recommendation, but I suspect that it was.

    You seem to be thinking of source material with a few very good fanfics, but relatedly I think that Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga is remarkable in that the *average* fanfic is actually surprisingly okay.

    *Fate*. I wouldn’t have expected a rules-light VN to yield so much excellent fic. 

    *Fate/hollow fake* is a sprawling quest-format story that plays with a lot of the stuff underlying canon. I couldn’t tell what was just a deep reference and what was original, and that’s a plus.

    *Man Off the Moon* is supposed to be quite good but I never got into it. 

    *Servant of Zero* crosses over with a separate horny magic combat franchise; it’s unfinished, but what exists was great.

    And then *Postnuptial disagreements* is one of my absolute favorite crossovers of all time. It intersects minor *Fate* characters with *another* horny magic bond battle royale series. I can not adequately describe how much this goes off the rails.

      Just going to throw out there that I really enjoyed this one. It's a FATE x Mass Effect story, where Heroic Spirit Emiya is sent by the Moon Cell to the Mass Effect universe and meets a young fem-Shep in cadet school. I read it right when Mass Effect Legendary Edition was being released and it hit a lot of sweet spots. That being said, Emiya is ridiculously OP and always seems able to pull out a new OP ability to suit his needs. It also goes a little too long on some arcs, and was still on-going when last I read. 

      So yeah, I recommend it if you like the two IPs and want an OP MC exploring an alternate Mass Effect story.

        For the easiest sell given your apparent predilections, in my opinion several spinoffs of Friendship is Optimal easily surpass it in quality, in particular the work of [Chatoyance](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/1291/Chatoyance/stories?order=top),  such as  [Caelum Est Conterrens](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/69770/friendship-is-optimal-caelum-est-conterrens) or [Implacable](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/406526/implacable), or if you'd prefer to see the AI bulldozing over and assimilating other AIs, rather than just humans, there is [There Can Be Only One!](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/264855/1/fio-there-can-be-only-one/1-omniscience) by Epsilon-Delta.

        There are also many classic shorts with more of a slice-of-life feeling, like [Pinkie Pie Watches Paint Dry](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/22329/1/pinkie-watches-paint-dry/pinkie-watches-paint-dry) or [Princess Celestia Hates Tea](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/29271/princess-celestia-hates-tea), though those might assume the audience to have a bit more of an existing attachment to the characters

        I also quite liked [Fallout Equestria](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/119190/fallout-equestria) (which is big enough to have its own [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_Equestria)^(spoilers)) and, branching out into other niches, too many others to list, but going deeper than that would definitely be too much colorfulhorses(tm) to load on you!

        I'll just finish with that fandom by saying that there are several themes, popular on this sub, that are well-represented within mlp fics: HFY-style first contact, time loops, building societies of immortals, etc.

        As for Twilight, Luminosity does indeed seem to be a rare gem (and I haven't read its spinoffs, so I shan't recommend them, merely point out that they exist).  There are over *two hundred thousand* (!!!) Twilight stories on fanfiction dot net alone, though, which is surpassed only by Harry Potter and Naruto, so there's probably something for everyone, if they care to sift deep enough to find it...

  I've recommended it before, but since it just completed its first book (with over 400k words), I'm pointing out [Mark of the Fool: A Progression Fantasy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41618/mark-of-the-fool-a-progression-fantasy) again as one of the gems over at RR. The characters act in creative ways, their power increases at reasonable levels (more or less; >!Claygon!< is sort of a giant power boost), and they manage to not hold the idiot ball so well that I mentally applauded the author's choices. There are also a lot of potential plot threads that have misdirected me, which is good as all too often I spot tropes a mile away and guess what will happen well in advance. Here, I've been pleasantly surprised several times when my expectations were subverted. Always in good ways; as said, no idiot-ball holding. It's refreshing, and the characters are likeable and the world is interesting. I like it.

  On the opposite side of things... if Mark of the Fool is a good hearty meal you recommend to your friends because it's nutritious and delicious, if not luxury dining, then [Azarinth Healer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16946/azarinth-healer) is the late-night box of popcorn chicken bites from the KFC down the road that has been closed several times for health code violations but you still guiltily crave while stoned. Full disclosure, I'm like... 250 chapters in, and there are over 700 chapters out, so I have no doubt things change over time. But it's just... not good a lot of the time. Frequent spelling mistakes. Vague but pretty obviously wrong references to distances, speeds, and times that don't make much sense. A protagonist who keeps getting stronger and more badass while impressing all she meets and smacking anyone who disrespects her. It's just... not great. But I just... keep... reading it. My monkey brain likes seeing numbers go up, and apparently that's enough to keep me turning the pages. I can't call it good, but like trashy reality TV shows or grinding in MMOs, somehow it manages to catch the attention far longer than it should.

    Early *Yu-Gi-Oh!* manga chapters. Before Yami became family-friendly, he was known for burning people alive in the Shadow Games (no cards).

  The [Dr. Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Stone) anime is streaming on HBO Max, and I just caught the second season.

  I have been writing Frameshift - Magic, Math, and Not Enough Context for a couple of months; it used to be called Yet Another Godsforsaken Isekai. It will contain, as of tomorrow, 110k published words.

  https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46378

  It's rough, especially at first; there's good reason my retention rate past chapter 3 is south of 20%, and it's not just because it's very in medias res. But some people really like it.

  Thematically it's about connections, trauma, agency, and a bunch of other stuff. It's also about the ethics of a lot of bog-standard tropes in media when you actually stop to think about them, and it's also about the feeling of being totally lost and having to just figure it out as you go along.

  - u/Adeen_Dragon:

    I can second this recommendation; though I’ll add that the protagonist is easily distractible, and the narration follows his distractions. 

    For example, while social negotiation is happening, the protagonist starts (mentally) theorizing about the artwork of birds in the room. While this is exactly the kind of thing I’d do, and I feel very seen, I’m not sure if I like so much happening ‘off screen’. 


    I read the updates as they come out; it’s a bit like a daily puzzle.

    I was kind of enjoying it (thanks for writing), but got turned off sometime after the second harem person got introduced. It already seemed like one person who was randomly really into the protagonist was a lot, the second made the dynamic feel kind of lopsided. The lack of context didn't really bug me too much, guess the MC is from a spacefaring civilization and he's now in an ultra-advanced / decadant magical civilization?
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Cador isn't really ultra-advanced, though it's definitely decadent. Bearing in mind that the Temple isn't the surface, the party where Adam met Zidanya is vaguely 15th century and modern Cador is only a little bit later in most areas; Cador is stagnant due to a few reasons that Book One won't be going into.

      Some of the currently-deleted chapters (I deleted all the NSFW stuff for Royal Road writeathon) make it clear that Zidanya is at least as much into Amber as she is into Adam. I dunno if that helps or not!

      Anyway, glad you liked it for however long you did like it.

      - u/Amonwilde:

        I could give it another whirl, as there were things I liked about it. It's more that it already felt like we had this one relationship that got started too fast and was too intense. I have no specific objection to a harem plot, just wanted the story to dwell a bit on the things that happen.

    *[Castle Kingside](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43462/castle-kingside-rewrite/chapter/689901/0-setting-the-board)* is good. A surgeon gets iseki'd into a medieval fantasy society, and he decides to bring modern medicine to it. Unfortunately for him, he gets iseki'd as a starving beggar, so it's a bit of an uphill climb.

    *[Dread Our Wrath](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/dread-our-wrath-asoiaf-si.870076/)* is an ASOIAF fic, and has the SI born into a newly minted noble family in the Stormlands, just after the Dance of Dragons (the war, not the book). The protagonist isn't particularly ambitious. He's mostly concerned with improving the lives of the people living on his family's land, and the innovations he chooses to introduce reflect that. Unfortunately, this is Westeros, and his neighbors don't always understand that they aren't necessarily playing a zero sum game...

    > protagonist is an antagonistic asshat that causes 90% of the problems he has to solve

    Yes.  He's a cat that should have been killed by his curiosity.  But it leaves room for growth. 

    > on top acting like an autistic immature teenager. 

    I found that relatable. His autism makes it harder for him to be the son his father expects. 

    > And the side characters in the story apparently don't act like they're in a post-apocalyptic world.

    To be fair, the apocalypse(s) happened many centuries in the past.  This is the life they grew up in. Even the upheaval that happened to lead to the founding of their clan happened generations in the past.

    This is true, but (mild spoilers) >!there comes a point where he realizes that he is not as smart or great as he thinks he is, and also where he comes to realize that his dad (whom he blamed for a lot of his problems) isn't as bad as he imagined.

    >And the side characters in the story apparently don't act like they're in a post-apocalyptic world, with most of their actions not being internally consistent.

    I'm not quite sure what your friend means by this. They live in a society that is defined by survival of the fittest, so there's a fair bit of opportunism and conflict, but by and large they abide by the rules.

    >  an antagonistic asshat that causes 90% of the problems he has to solve

    Ehhh, I feel like it's justified. He makes decisions that are the best/most rational with the information he has, but it *does* create problems he has to solve. Never felt the "asshat" part, though.

    > on top acting like an autistic immature teenager

    He is literally an autistic teenager, so no shit.

    > And the side characters in the story apparently don't act like they're in a post-apocalyptic world, with most of their actions not being internally consistent.

    Never felt that as of Book One.  To be fair, I'm only just beginning to read Book Two—but I doubt it's much different from the first, and it was quite good in the character department. *Especially* in developing the two main characters. The progression is believable and pleasant.

    > I'd give it a shot by reading it myself, but I only have so much time set aside for reading that I don't want to start something I would dislike.

    I'd say it's one of the better ongoing stories on RoyalRoad. Definitely rational-adjacent—even when characters are not acting smart, they are consistent. The worldbuilding is interesting.

    My main issue with the work is repeated grammar errors that persist even after being pointed out by readers. The writing itself is quite good.

  This is an unconventional recommendation, but I think that r/rational will appreciate the themes of Rufus Rex’s album Dead Beat. 

  Essentially, a man tries to cast off the shackles of death. 

  Available on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/IrHusF6MJyg) , and available for purchase on Bandcamp. 

  The genre is … alt metal? I guess? There’s a fast guitar, but no screaming.


  Oh, and if you end up really enjoying the music, check out Creature Feature; Rufus Rex is a side project of the lead guitarist. Creature Feature has a similar tone, but not the same themes.
