  So the first thing I thought of when I saw the prompt was the D&D mimic and how they end up in so many dungeons spread across the world. Somebody probably breeds them, right? Looking forward to seeing if I wrote it even close to the way it played out in my head.

  [The Things](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/watts_01_10/) by Peter Watts is perfect for the prompt.
