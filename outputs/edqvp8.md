## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  So I guess **Bill Gates** consistently participates in [reddit's secret santa gift exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/edjz1k/bill_gates_was_my_secret_santa/), which made me think of how matching with him might best satisfy my values, in either direction. I guess being his recipient would entail a small legion of assistants poring over your post history to find compatible presents -- hopefully they'd be pretty discerning, since I don't think I'd much want a 90 lb box with net cost ~$1k. Instead, I think I'd much prefer, say, a 10-minute phone conversation. So since you can't control gifts he (and his staff) purchases you, **I'm curious how all y'all would munchkin 10 minutes of his undivided, teleconferenced attention.**

  I think I'd personally focus on two topics, trying to start a short dialogue on something like:

  >!Cause Prioritization: I've noticed from your recent pivot to charity work that your primary focus is on developing world health. What are your thoughts on the moral patienthood of nonhuman animals? (or global catastrophic risk, or senescence research, or social change vs. direct work, etc. Probably the first one, though). Would probably come off as a crazy here.!<

  >!Personal Job Searching: Do you happen to know anything about navigating the tech job market in Seattle? (A-WINK). Then when interviewing I could shamelessly name drop -- "well, I was talking to Bill the other day, and he mentioned that... Bill who? Gates, lives near here, you've probably heard of him; as I was saying...". Would probably come off as a parasitic opportunist here!!<

    Bill Gates is already funding one thing I'm really passionate about.

    He's trying to help develop better nuclear power.

    He also is funding a fairly energy intensive carbon capture tech.

    Energy intensive but scalable. And nuclear power puts out a hell of a lot of energy without generating carbon.

    Apparently the last thing on Gates' bucket list is "don't die." So he's very much in favor of life extension tech.

  Power: personal hammerspace, roughly milk crate sized items (12"^3) living creatures can be stored in this way.

  •The power involves physically inserting the object into this separate dimension (think a coin disappearing into thin air) partial items can't be stored

  •No negative feedback for trying to store something that's too big, it just doesn't work

  • No limit on the number of items that can be stored

  • No accompanying index ability, you have to remember what you stored to retrieve it, but there's no first in/out, anything can be taken as-needed

  • Each object is stored in its own "pocket", separate in all concrete ways from other objects

  • Time progresses in hammerspace, but it is an otherwise ideal place to store things. It's a perfect insulator and "unbreakable" insofar as an explosive that detonates inside hammerspace will have its effects limited to its pocket. 

  • No location rule for retrieval, if I hide something behind my back I can retrieve it from thin air in front of me. It also doesn't need to be with my bare skin, I can take items if my hand is gloved with no caveat. 

  •W/R/T the above, my hand isn't physically subject to the conditions of the pocket, but I am not protected from burns or degradative effects of a molten or corrosive object

  • Objects stored aren't subject to gravity

  I think that's everything.

    Any hammerspace that ignores potential energy breaks thermodynamics.

    Simple example: Set up a counterweighted elevator tuned so that your platform will rise when only your weight is on it, but will fall when you + a milk crate of lead is on it. 

    Sit there producing your milk crate of lead at the top, and storing it at the bottom. Draw infinite power from the pulleys in the middle. 

    Fix: make retrieving an object either cost or generate a certain amount of some sort of energy, based on the difference between the current potential and previous potential energy of the thing.

      The power works by taking an object in your hand and pushing it into another dimension, this effectively slows it to a stop. It does activate instantly relative to the idea of as soon as you decide to vanish or retrieve a specific item, it begins happening.  

      It's strictly volume. Energy could be stored if the person could physically hold it, and it was smaller than roughly 12"^3

          >Can you "retrieve" an object on yourself and wear it? I'm thinking instant armor. If you can have an instant anti-rad suit, you can start playing with radioactive material directly on the battlefield.

          This is a great idea, I guess under my own rules it would depend on their size. You could vanish a motorcycle helmet and then hammerspace it back onto your own head, or vanish and materialize gloves, and so on. Since objects inserted retain their shapes, you could also do this for a jumpsuit. If you got into one, let it drop to your feet, and then pushed it into hammerspace, you would have it ready as-needed to put back around your legs and draw it back up. If the jumpsuit also includes boots/foot coverings, then your feet would need to be in the air. sitting down with feet raised would work – but a person *could also* "jump" into a hazmat suit, insofar as they'd jump, pull it out of hammerspace around their feet, and begin lifting it up over themselves.

    \-Can you open more that one portal/door/whatever into hammerspace at a time?

    \-Does the portal have to be facing you or could you turn it outwards to catch incoming projectiles?

    \-What happens when something too big tries to go into a portal? Like, let's say you tried to drive a car into one.

    \-How far away from yourself can you open portals to hammerspace? 

    \-Are the boundaries within hammerspace interactable? Could you create a shallow portal at around knee height, step on/in it, then create another and do the same to walk through the air?

    \-How fast can you open and close a portal? Maybe you could generate electricity by rapidly opening and closing a portal that holds a magnet near a conductive substance.

      Hammerspace is a dimension that runs alongside our own, so access to it is gained by moving "H"-dimensionally. Think a magician vanishing or producing an item, if you have a coin in your hand, you "push" it into hammerspace, or draw it back out. Because of this, when you extract something your hand is visible the entire time.  

      I'm not sure yet how I want to deal with the idea of someone who has this ability losing a hand, (most likely through a prosthetic, which would eventually work as well in accessing hammerspace as their own flesh,) but for now it's simply a matter of how fast they can physically take the item.
      ```

        >most likely through a prosthetic, which would eventually work as well in accessing hammerspace as their own flesh

        This could open up some interesting exploitations since it implies that the ability isn't actually tied to the physical location of your hand but where your mind believes it to be.
        ```

      - u/IICVX:

        Okay, here's two potential metaphysics for hammerspace:

        1\. It's a continuous dimension along which things can move. This would work like our spatial axes, but in a direction we can't percieve. 

        This means that things entering hammerspace (moving in the H+ direction) appear to shrink away to nothing, and things exiting hammerspace (moving in the H- direction) seem to grow into their full size. 

        If you wanna make this process "instant", you just need to throw a lot of H-ward acceleration at it (on both ends) - you'll need some sort of hyperspace catcher and launcher on either end, and there's neat failure modes for those devices. You'd still be able to see the object shrink away with a sufficiently high speed camera, maybe. 

        This is potentially vulnerable to stuff like "what happens if you put something into hammerspace, but only halfway" - does it stay "shrunk" (it's really just far away in a dimension we have a hard time conceptualizing, but whatever)? Do accelerations only affect the part in realspace? But it's kinda stuck in hammerspace, where it can't move? Also you can get to hammerspace from anywhere in normal space, so how does that work for something that's halfway in? 

        2\. Hammerspace is actually a *quantized* dimension. Now items can only ever be in one state or the other. This would work sort of like the energy levels of an electron, or standing waves on a piece of string - there's a fixed set of states it can be in. 

        In this case, instead of a launcher and a catcher, you'd have something more like a dimensional tuning fork on either end; jam the business end of fork into the object to store and pour energy into it, and it'll make the object vibrate at H+ instead of H0. In order to bring objects back, you'll want either an H-vibration damper or another tuning fork tuned to realspace on the other end. Again, you'd need to dump a lot of energy into it all at once, and you might get a weird flickering effect as the object bounces between modes, or maybe some flashes of light if your hyperspatial energy can be lost into photons, but you wouldn't get the shrinking imagery. 

        This one also has failure modes, like for instance if H-vibration wears off, eventually things will drop out of your hammerspace. Or if hammerspace has a lower vacuum energy than reality, you could eventually cause a false vacuum collapse as everything falls in to hammerspace (and that's why hammerspace *has* to be H+ (more energetic), because if it's H- and is less energetic we're all screwed probably)
        ```

    As with any appear-something-out-of-nowhere type of power, you have to think about how it interacts with the matter around it. I'd assume disappearing it would leave a vacuum (and a popping sound when the air collapses), but what about taking it out? It wouldn't grow out from a point since shunting something along a fourth spacial dimension would be instant. If it outright replaces the matter, then you'd have a perfect cutter and destroyer of anything. If it pushes the matter away, you'd be creating black holes that grow at the speed of light since the acceleration of the particles, and the energy they would have, would be infinite due to the instantaneity of the appearance. On a more macro scale, can you take it out in any gas? In water? Honey? Mercury? Glass? Sand? Aerogel? Etc.

    There's also the question of how you define an "object". If its "a solid block of matter", then you'd be ruling out sand, glasses of water, soil, and living beings (composed of all three basic states of matter) (Side note, would assume that your pocket dimension has air and atmospheric pressure, or else things would explode or stop working. In fact, a bunch of stuff reliant on the presence of gravity *would* stop working). There'd be the question of if you can store two pebbles at the same time, or if you'd have to tie them together with a rubber band first, or something. If it's "a volume the size of a milk crate", then you've again created a perfect cutter that can cut out milk-crate-sized chunks out of everything. When it comes down to it, the world is just a wash of atoms that happen to connect to each other in different ways, so what happens at that level? 

    In terms of applications, there's being a delivery person. No need for an entire truck when you can have just one person. Same for space travel - you'd be saving the companies millions by having infinite mass-free storage. And also for transporting hazardous materials. You'd be able to completely securely store valuable items as well, though that would make you the target for people who want the stuff stored in your storage. You'd also make any check-in security useless and be able to bring anything anywhere, obviously.

  Christmas present munckinry! 

  this christmas, gifts you give have the potential to be much more. give the kid a hot wheels toy car? he gets a real car when he opens the present. give a girl barbie, and she gets the matching wardrobe in her size. this will not create life, and will not put children in danger (real space shuttles are too big, unless there is a LOT of extra space nearby). this includes toys for tots, if you donate. 

  the only limit, is the recipient must want the gift you give them. whats your most creative list of gifts?
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    I mean gifts for kids who have incurable diseases immediately shoot to the top of the list - ideally you'd get stuff like medical research from a hundred years in the future, panacea cures for everything, and examples of (or schematics for) perfect prosthetic limbs.

      star trek medical devices? yeah, i could see it, but would they WANT medical toys? thats the trick question. some of them may, so some percentage should work.
      ```

      - u/BoxSparrow:
        ```
        I would imagine it'd be less "medical toys" and more like "I wish I could live normally like everyone else".
