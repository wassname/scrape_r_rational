## [BST] What story ideas could come out of this time dilation power?

### Post:

I've recently been inspired by [the following thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/31xbrg/terrible_superpower_time_edition/) (**HIGHLY** recommended reading if you'd like to help) about a 'terrible superpower'; in one second of real time, an hour passes in your frame of reference. This power is always on and uncontrollable. While this provides for an excellent thought experiment and a reasonable amount of "What would the character do" writing, I'm having trouble coming up with an actual storyline beyond the character reacting to his situation. This is undesirable, since the tension of the story will naturally be at it's highest in the beginning, and grow weaker as the character adapts to their new environment. I've written a couple of thousand words for brainstorming, and plan to write more, but this is more to get the rules straight in my head and come up with the seeds of a potential early arc to a story.

Here are the rules I've set for my brainstorm writing. Most of these rules are breakable for the right idea. They're presented in rough order of how I'd like to keep them.

- Imagine two frames of reference; real time, and the character's time. There's a magical field that extends to anything the character touches (but not anything touched by something the character is touching) that brings it into his frame of reference. This same field prevents him from dying immediately or causing unimaginable harm to the world around him. This allows the character to open doors, operate machinery such as hand cranks, and consume food. It does not allow him to operate computers or other electronic devices at normal speed.

* The character has a metabolism that is normal within his own reference frame. He must drink, eat, excrete, and sleep according to his time. This presents large logistical problems which, in my current iteration of the idea, makes up the first part of the story. This is all I have so far.

* The character lives in the modern world, with no supernatural or superheroic things in it, save for anything that caused this specific effect to happen to him.

* The character cannot bring living beings into his reference frame.

All I have so far in terms of an actual plot is that there has to be some sort of intelligent being who caused this situation. The magical protective field that stops him from fracturing his feet or anything he touches, creating sonic booms by walking, and suffocating to death is far too specific, complex, and intuitive to humans to be a natural phenomenon.

Do you guys have any idea for extending the story I might be able to use, or at least riff off of to create a fully-fledged idea?

[This is what I've written for brainstorming](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10PBwnSFcksLzL895rkc5rfva0tUqQyAbQ7UbiQxkHeQ/edit). (2400 words) Comments have been enabled. Naturally, it's rather rough, and everything from sentences to the laws of the world to the entire introduction being scrapped is up for grabs. It's probably not going to make it into a final draft in anything close to it's current form, but can be considered a sort of blueprint for some of the rules of the world I'm envisioning.

  Plot ideas:

  * Slowed-down guy discovers another slowed-down person; adversary or love interest, or both
  * SDG gets discovered by the military/government, and they try to kill/control him (or hire him)
  * SDG gets discovered by a major corporation, and they try to kill/control him (or hire him)
  * SDG has to respond to a major disaster that he sees happening in slow motion (recommend tsunami, or if the math is favorable, an explosion)
  * SDG grapples with all the limitations of his existence which can't be eliminated with logistics-fu (ennui, lack of human contact, lack of socialization)

  Then you can link these things together in some way; the first third of the plot is SDG getting his systems in place and exploring the limits of his power, and this is disrupted by his discovery of a sound system playing a message at 1:3600 speed, just for him. That leads him to the discovery of another SDG, who has been less cautious and is being tracked by the government, etc.

  I would generally shy away from an "aliens did this" plot, but that's just me.

    The first, fourth, and fifth ideas are ones I have thought of. The first seems cliche, so I disregarded it. The very first thing I came up with when imagining a story like this is a second SDG. I am no longer surprised when this happens in a superhero movie, and I am notoriously easy to surprise in a story. I almost never see things coming, even when narratively obvious. That said, I won't throw the idea out; turning cliches into interesting things is a pretty common thing for a rational story.

    I don't think the fifth idea can carry a story on it's own without some defined conclusion, though it would definitely make the cut for inclusion to some degree. The fourth idea was colored by my belief that there had to be a supernatural reason for the power to be there, and thus the disaster would be one that the protagonist had specifically been slowed in order to avert. But if this wasn't necessary, or I chose to include a more naturalistic explanation (Military/government/corporation was experimenting with Time, somehow our protagonist was the person who ended up being hit by it) I could definitely take the story in that direction without worrying too much about a Grand Purpose. This would also allow for a resolution to the conflict, too: the party dealing with Time has the ability to change SDG back, but has set up safeguards even SDG can't break. To get back to his normal life, he has to do what they want.

    Combining these ideas gives me an interesting outline.

    Part 1: Character learns how to survive in the new world, explores the limits of power.

    Part 2: Several months or even years have passed, and SDG has learnt (or is struggling to find) methods to maintain his sanity and well-being long-term in the frozen world. At least an hour (5 months) and up to half a day (5 years) have passed. At this point, he's contacted by the party that did this to him. They have probably waited this long because the experiment went wrong, and they took less than a day to find him because as soon as they saw something suspicious (SDG will eventually have to do something pretty conspicuous to feed himself) they knew the experiment had succeeded on him instead of the intended subject. They offer to turn him back if he does something. This something is probably why they planned to turn one of their own operatives.

    Part 3: Character does the thing, or perhaps grapples with the moral problems of doing said thing, or perhaps tries to turn himself back without doing the thing. Either way, this resolves the story in one way or another.

    I don't know why I didn't think of a plot like this before, as it makes a great deal of sense. But then, finding ideas that make sense but have slipped by my radar is precisely why I posted here.

    Thank you so much!

      The reason that this trope is cliche is that it does a lot of heavy lifting. The Evil Counterpart allows the author to make a commentary on their hero, offers an easy way to increase the threat level, speaks to the human desire to not be alone in the world, etc. It's a *huge* multitool. I don't think authors use it because they're lazy, I think that they use it because it's effective, regardless of whether the audience is really surprised by it or not. It became cliche on its merits, not because authors were necessarily copying each other.

      (I'm not saying that you should use it of course. What I mean is that cliche isn't really a sufficient reason to ditch an idea, because all of the "best" ideas are going to be cliche, and cutting yourself off from the best ideas that the collective intelligence of authors has come up with over hundreds of years is going to make things a lot harder. Write what you want to write, but don't shy away from something just because it's been done before.)

    I really like the tsunami/disaster idea. It'll enforce both the tension and the despair of the situation.

  ```
  Here's a problem: At 3600x acceleration, if you say his metabolism still operates at a normal human rate in his own reference frame, then he's going to live for less than 8 days 3 hours, from birth to death.
  ```

  - u/Salivanth:
    ```
    It's not actually from birth to death; the character wasn't born with this power. They woke up with it one morning. That said, I'm aware that if he can't change back, he only has less than a week in real time to live. The character is also quite aware of this, and it's one of his major motivations for changing back.

  I think the mistake is making the slowed-down guy the protagonist- instead, make him the maguffin. He is the ghost, the unknown, struggling to reconnect with a society he has lost- every written interaction comes excruciatingly slowly from his perspective, however, he is the ultimate spy. Have the protagonist be someone who discovers his existence, you get to slow reveal the time issues to the audience as the protagonist discovers them, then have them trade on finding a cure for the time dilation and solving problems for the protagonist in ways only a super speedster could. Also- how do relationships work when your communication is so different- by the time a day has gone by for the protagonist, years have passed for slowed-down guy. To that end- what if slowed down guy has many, many contacts, and is playing a very slow (to him) game of chess for some unknown nefarious (or not) purpose?

  This is basically a crocked and nerfed version of Flicker in *The Fall of Doc Future*.
  ```

  - u/Salivanth:

    Googled that and realised I had read part of the story already. The biggest difference is that SDG can't change back. He's stuck at this speed, and that makes for a very different story (imo) than a story where the character can speed up or slow down at will. As long as the implications turn out very different, I don't think this similarity matters overly much.

    Plus, it's not like Flicker is the first speedster ever invented, or the first person to ever be able to freeze / slow time for themselves. It's the involuntary, constant nature of SDG's power that makes him interesting, in my opinion. The story is just as much about him struggling against his power as it is using it.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      Sure, but it might be worthwhile reading the rest of the Flicker stories to get an idea of the mechanics.

  Well. that person just lost all ability to have social interactions in any normal way. And nearly at all. I mean, you could start correspondence  with a bunch of people, and people who respond very quickly will only be delayed from your pow for.. oh, a couple of weeks or months. 

  .. This is a recipe for insanity. Humans do not function well at all in total isolation. Most likely result is that the victim does something  they have wanted to do, and now have the power to carry out until they can't take it anymore, and then kill themselves. The "something" depends on the person in question. Read the local library. Go run through a couple of warzones at high speed disassembling all the weapons, track down every pimp in their home town and disembowel them... but the nigh sure and certain end game is "suicide".
