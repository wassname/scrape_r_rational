## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  It's 40 years into the future and while AI above human-level intelligence haven't been successfully created (that you know of /tinfoil hat/), human-level AIs in very realistic android bodies are viable and cost as much as an average car. Such AIs can be created to be the perfect companion and can adapt and change to match you perfectly as you change and grow. Their appearance can be nearly anything that follows the basic humanoid body plan and often falls into near the human ideal for beauty. Their only 'flaw' relationship-wise is that they cannot be used for reproductive purposes. No having a child with them.

  With the creation of androids whose appearance and personality are perfectly customizable to be the ideal romantic, platonic, or familial partner, what will happen to human society/population size?

    Well, technology usually advances in many fields at the time, so it could be possible that in 40 years into future humanity has developed also uterine replicators, cloning and related stuff. So technically the impact such androids would have on population size growth could be softened or even overturned by another technology that emerged in the meantime.

    I think you immediately see even more of a decline in the middle-upper class having kids and or seeking human spouses. The would allow anyone with the income to afford it to have an 'eternal child'. Many people may desire this instead of a real child because it is more disposable and less of an inconvenience I am sure it would be costly to let the child pass through phases of life, but some people may still prefer it to human children. 

    Laws would need to be written to keep A.I. from becoming property owners so that they do not become the inheritors of huge amounts of wealth. Assuming they have no life-expectancy, letting them become property owners would be problematic.

      >Laws would need to be written to keep A.I. from becoming property owners so that they do not become the inheritors of huge amounts of wealth. Assuming they have no life-expectancy, letting them become property owners would be problematic.

      Given millions of genius level human-like AI working on curing aging (likely mostly running faster than realtime) the inheritance issue doesn't seem likely to be terribly relevant for long.             

      Also given most people would want their AI companions to be better people than they are (or rather at least as altruistic of individuals as they _think_ they are), it doesn't seem like letting AI companions inherit wealth would be a bad thing.

      Though of course all of this is likely underscored by the fact that everything would already have to be fairly socialist anyway otherwise nearly all humans would have long since starved to death due to their labor being totally worthless.

      EDIT: If the AI are _average_ human level intelligences then some areas will still be dominated by humans because you need to be clever to be good at them. However people with a great deal of wealth will also be high status enough that they will want human partners who are both attractive and have high intelligence social or otherwise. And any inheritance passed on to AI won't be stable long term because average intelligence individuals just can't compete in the sorts of areas that grow wealth faster than the market.             
      But as I've said in my other comment, this period of average human level intelligence can't last very long so many of these issues won't be super relevant for long.

  A little late to the party, but I'm trying to figure out a new magic system for a novella I wanted to write about mathemagicians. 

  The idea is that a fourth spacial dimension exists called the Traverse, and magic is the physics, chemistry, and logic surrounding interacting with that dimension (this branch of science would be called traversal mechanics, I think). I wrote a bunch of frantic messages about it that I'm just going to copy over.

  Everything in the universe has fourth dimensional properties, we just aren't able to perceive them. Humans go on about the soul or spirit or aura of a person, when really they're just talking about the traversal component of that person. This is the immortal part of a human, the soul. It is beyond the fabric of space time and not bound by it, tied to it only by the fragile form manifested when a person is born. As a square is the shadow of a cube cast into 2D, a cube is the shadow of a tesseract cast into 3D. Think of the human as a cube. The human is the shadow of a fourth dimensional soul. 

  But everything, and I mean everything, interacts with traverse, right? It would have to, even if just to touch it, like a flat surface in a 2d world would still be within our 3d world.

  That's how enchanting and magic work. Figuring out those components through mathematical proofs, and once the interactions are known, manipulating them. They are somewhat arbitrary from the 3d POV, since a layman wouldn't understand why a magician combines gold, saltpeter, ritual prayer and the shedded blood of a goose to alter the weather, but the mechanics are there. (I only offer this as an example, this isn't actually how I want to do spell crafting in my world)

  perhaps a magician could create an area where time is dilated by a fourth dimensional object outside our 3d world with a specific chemical process that creates an incredibly dense object just "above" the region he's influencing in the fourth dimension. 

  I had some mechanics that two quantum entangled diamonds with a traversal current running through them were how they achieved long range teleportation.

  the language of traversal mechanics is logic and math. if you know all of the working parts of someone's psyche, you can logically work out their true name (which is not something that can be expressed through verbal communication but doesn't need to be, once you know it it can be expressed by the will in the fourth dimension, in a kind of as below so above deal)

  but it's really really really difficult to pin down all the moving parts of someone's identity. you'd have to know all their core memories, all their biggest hang ups and triumphs, everything. so unless you are like high level stalker or they totally trust you with every detail of their lives, you can't just pull someone's true name out of your ass. But this also means that with each new "core event" that changes a person's life, their true name also changes.

  so that means a person is a very long function of variables (those variables being their core events that make them who they are, everything from their myer-briggs profile to whether or not their mom or dad are still alive) that once you know those variables, you can make that function equal to whatever you want. 

  That's pretty much all I've come up with so far, but I really want to build a system that's got hard science rules. My favorite concept about this was the creating a Time Dilation through a heavy dense object along the fourth dimension above where our plane exists. I also love the idea of wizards being dedicated mathematicians, chemists, physicists, and logicians that are able to interact with an extra spacial dimension. If anyone wants to help me build it or break it, it would be much appreciated.

  Let's say you were part of a scientific program involving using a portal to travel to and explore other universes, with different rules to our own. Putting aside the issue of how the portal itself works, or how different universes are able to mingle without something catastrophic happening (because you have to, for the premise to work), what kind of scientific fields would you draw on to examine the worlds you discovered?

  I mean, would you bring a geologist? A botanist? A meteorologist? An astronomer? A chemist? What would your research team look like? What equipment would you use to scrutinise any samples you gathered?

  I had an idea for a story like this, but I was struggling with the technical details.

      You step through the shimmering circle of the portal, and find yourself  surrounded by thick jungle. You can feel the heat of the place, even inside your environment suit. You glance back through the portal, into a world of concrete and metal - the test site that you just left.

      "Alright Ben, standard procedure. Investigate the area, collect some samples, do your thing."

      There is a window way at the back of the portal chamber, looking into the Mission Control room. You can just about see the Head of Operations giving you a thumbs up.

      What do you do, Mr. Physicist?

        I'm not a physicist, but some ideas for him off the top of my head:

        * Drop some rocks and feathers (or other objects with different weights and air resistance) to see if gravity and air resistance work the same there.

        * Bring a prism to see if light refracts into the same visible spectrum.

        * Equipment to test for the other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

        * Some circuits and a battery, and magnets, to see if electromagnetism works the same.

        * Metal detector to see if it reacts with any native material.

        * A weak radioactive isotope to see if atomic decay continues as on Earth.

        Some of the above might be best done in a slightly different order.

        Personally, for a first visit, I would suggest a core science team of physicist, chemist, and Earth scientist, a biologist if you expect life as per the example you provided, and maybe a psychologist or anthropologist if any of the life appears intelligent. Have everyone in the initial away-party be able to function as a jack-of-all-trades (at least) in their field, and bring in more specialized experts as they become pertinent to the situation.

        Have someone trained in first-aid. Maybe have a few people to provide security against hostile life (sarcastic and wisecracking field commander with a dark and troubled past optional), but who won't be overly trigger-happy at first contact with a legitimately surprised or frightened intelligence.
