## [D] It's that time of year again. Discuss romance in rational fiction!

### Post:

[Last year's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/45j37j/bstd_romance_in_rational_fiction_discussion_for/), for posterity.

What stories/scenes/ideas have charmed or impressed you? What made you cancel the second date?

  I like HPMOR's insistence on "it doesn't have to be about that."

  While His Dark Materials is not a rational series at all, its take on the romance at the end was outstanding, especially the way it forced a sort of ... cascading reinterpretation? ... of the previous two books.

  I'm sort of still looking forward to a rational fiction that *actually* contains romance in a good and meaningful way?  I haven't read All The Things, but most of the romances seem either perfunctory or unrealistic or Sue-esque, probably because they're often not at all the important thing going on.

    * I'm not sure if it's rational, but OP brought up Unsong, which features a major romance and a love triangle. 
    * Twig *is* rational, practically rational*ist* at times, and also features romantic themes (I think they grow as the story develops, I'm only partway through.
    * Yudkowsky's [fic](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/post/151225261055/the-empress-and-the-rebel) he linked below I guess
    * You could stretch "rational" to include *El Goonish Shive*, *Pride and Prejudice*, or an assortment of fanfics others have linked in this thread. I'd add the Culture novels that feature romance (mainly *Consider Phlebas*, *Look to Windward* and *Excession* I guess) to the not-quite-rational-but-pretty-close list.

      Twig is a biopunk-themed romantic comedy by now :p

      (well not really but kinda really)

    Most of the time the romance becomes subsumed in the greater plot as nothing more than extra motivation, which is disappointing (looking at you, *Methods*).

        *Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*, to be exact.

          I think he was trying to say that there is literally 0 romance in HPMOR. Even if EY intended it to be romantic, it just isn't. There are two prepubescent kids, brought together by isolation. There is no love, no attraction, absolutely no chemistry whatsoever. 

          There are a few plot points where everyone else wants them to be in love, but that's not a romance subplot in my opinion.

            I'm pretty sure he's expressed his thoughts on the matter as "they're eleven."

            Spoilers All

            Well, as a point of fact, Hermione *does* develop a legit crush on Harry in the latter half of the story, hormones and everything. That initial first date was pretty much just her following a social script since a romance sounded cool and exciting to her, but it did develop to be real as she entered puberty. Harry isn't yet at the point where he is physically capable of returning those feelings, if he ever does, but I'd put it down as "very plausible". 

            But yeah, wouldn't call that a romance per se.
            ```

- u/AmeteurOpinions:
  ```
  I haven't been reading all that much fiction cycling through here, but *Twig* has had many excellent romantic plots and *Unsong* deserves a mention for the Comet King's backstory.

  Most valuable lessons on romance I have ever learned:

  * Jealousy is an emotion just like rage. Everyone can learn self-control and how to appropriately express feelings instead of blowing up and making horrible mistakes.

  * Talk. Don't assume your partner is psychic and can deduce your intentions from body language and signals alone.

  * Relationships are a two-way street. Both individuals should be taking the time to be proactive. Come up with ideas of what to do or how to have fun. Neither person should be passive or doing all of the work. The only exception is possibly the 'courting' phase when someone first asks another out on the first date. But even then it's better if the chase√© contributes in some way as well.

  * Relationships are a commitment. Take the time to show/express your love for your partner and regularly spend time to enjoy each others company.

  * Have a neutral party. If you have someone else not involved with the partner such as a friend or a family member, they can listen to your opinions on the partner and help you to understand/work out any issues you may be having. This way by having a neutral area, any frustrations can be worked out without having to hurt your partner's feelings. Venting and gossiping about your partner is surprising helpful in bringing subtle cues to the attention of the conscious mind.

  * Be novel. Relationships can stagnate if both individuals fall into a routine. Not to say routines are a bad thing, but the best way to shake things up is to do something new and different on a regular basis. Learn a new skill together, travel to a new place, or just pop a random surprise on your partner.

  What does all of this have to do with rational fiction? Everything that can be used to cultivate a mature and healthy relationship can be used to demonstrate the same thing in your characters!

  What I want is difficult, but it isn't complicated; I want romance stories that aren't driven by the characters being cognitively inadequate, emotionally immature, or failing to communicate, including the characters' failure to deduce information that the reader could reasonably deduce in their place.

  Come to think, I guess that's why *Komarr* and *Paladin of Souls* are the only romantic plots/subplots I can remember liking.

  Let's set aside 'rationalist stories that include romantic elements' - yes, they exist; but there's no new suggestions there.

  Does anyone know of stories *about* a romantic relationship between notably rational people?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Pride and Prejudice. It was surprising to me how such different people can have such biting sense of humor, and generally act so intelligent.

  Not strictly about romance, but [El Goonish Shive](http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1) is an anime-inspired teen dramedy that has had several really good romantic arcs. The webcomic is rational...after the first 180 pages when the author retcons all the stupid stuff into making sense, puts an increased focus on character development, and starts getting more creative with the plot.

  This is my favorite webcomic, by far, and is the standard by which I measure all teen dramas against. The characters are very intelligent and talk to each other about the problems they're having even when it's awkward. When they don't, things go wrong and they learn from their mistakes.

  Ha! I'm currently writing a rational supernatural romance story. I'm not sure if it's going to be considered Good, and I'm not an experienced author or anything so it probably won't be, but I think rational fiction is such a broad category that we should try and get all the genres in there. I've noticed a tendency for rational stories to tend to involve genres or settings that you can munchkin (superheroes, sci-fi, fantasy) rather than stuff that's more "mundane". 

  Like, could someone write a rational buddy cop story? No reason why not. I'd like to see it! 

  Moreover, I think the demographic that tends to be here right now is "CFAR MIRI Eliezer Yudkowsky Fanboy" type stereotype, and that stereotype demographic tends to like stuff like Animorphs and not like stuff like The Babysitter's Club. And I think it's kind of a feedback loop - people see the sort of stuff that's posted here and write more of the same. 

  Aaaand now I'm wondering how to make a rational Babysitter's Club fanfic.

    It's good you're writing something like that, the constant pandering, whether intentional or not, is a bit annoying. It's a somewhat isolated community that could benefit a lot from outside influences and more exposure imho.

      My story is not uploaded anywhere official, though I'm soliciting feedback from beta readers at the moment, if you would like to help me out with that I'd be really grateful!

      It's at about 30k words and the first "volume" is nearly finished (some MAJOR scenes are missing though!). I'm in that editing stage where everything needs to be kind of ripped apart and put back together so I'm not sure it's in the best place for "enjoyable reading material". I will post it on this sub one chapter at a time when the first volume is finished though!

  I *still* maintain that there's a very interesting story to be told, which this community would enjoy, in a Pygmalion/My Fair Lady adaptation about an AI researcher who winds up maybe destroying the planet because of his delusional self-obsession.  [I mean, doesn't this sound like an "oh shit it's FOOMing" song to you?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3mC4485Ue0)  (Supposing that the hard takeoff isn't "one second everything is fine and the next second everyone is dead".)

  Suggested reading: [*The Paladin Protocol*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5623923/1/The-Paladin-Protocol), which might have redeemed *Big Bang Theory* if it didn't contrast so sharply with the original.

  And [*A Cadmean Victory*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11446957/1/A-Cadmean-Victory) is a really good take on Harry Potter as a darkish romance with more mature and independent characters.  [ending](#s " Like *Worm*, the ending can be read two or three ways - chilling, bittersweet, or just plain sweet.")  Highly recommended.

  I really liked [Fractured Sunlight](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/234937/fractured-sunlight).  Fair warning, it's an MLP fic.

  Without major spoilers, there was one scene especially that convinced me to post it here.  The morning after officially starting a relationship, one character thinks she might not need her meds anymore because she's happy and in a relationship and that's how love is supposed to work.  Her second thought is that that's really stupid and she takes her meds, thus heading off a long and annoying potential arc of dealing with her off her meds.

  In general it's well written and conflict tends to be due to actual trauma or values conflicts rather than misunderstandings.

  This is a parent's love for his child, not a person's love for his romantic partner--but it occurs to me that [this chapter](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715/51) (through "And she never disappointed.") in *[In the Blood](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6207715)* (my second-favorite Naruto story, after *[Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644)*) *definitely* is among the most moving depictions of loving relationships that I've read. Have you (plural) seen any similar romances involving partners who so *thoroughly* appreciate each other's awesomeness?

  > "And our weaknesses?"

  > "None, if we train hard enough."

  Phew! It's as pulse-pounding as ["I am *Sakura's aspect of light*... and your eyes have no power over me."](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/22) in *Time Braid*.
