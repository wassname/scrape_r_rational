  >Fortunately, Zorian had gotten lots and lots of insight into the inner workings of the soulseizer chrysanthemum during the last six months of the time loop…

  Calling it right now, Zorian's workaround for Mind Blank works by attacking the mind through its link to the soul. Soulseizer had an trick that attacked mind, body, and soul at the same time, and Zorian realized that it wasn't three separate attacks combined: it was one attack that could hit all three somehow.
  ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    That's a pretty rad idea. Makes sense. Nice workaround to the whole mind blank thing.
    ```

    - u/domoincarn8:
      ```
      There is one major issue with plan: Namely, it will only work for people whose Soul defences Zorian could breach.
      And QI is an extremely accomplished soul mage. If they could have over come QI's soul defenses, then they don't need to bother with a sneaky Mind Attack.
      ```

      - u/Brokndremes:
        ```
        I think this would be something more targetted towards Zach as opposed to getting through to one of their opponents.
        ```

        - u/Nepene:
          ```
          It may be a general attack which hits a lot of people, but enemies harder. That gives him an excuse for doing soul attacks vs Zach and can take out a lot of weakly shielded cultists. 

          Then he secretly does his main hammerblow against Zach.
          ```

    I have forgotten so much of this minor minutia (I totally spell checked that word) that I am gonna have a blast going through these books again after it ends.

  - u/Green0Photon:
    ```
    Oh man, that makes me even more excited with regards to the illusion over everybody in the city attack theory.
    ```

  - u/NZPIEFACE:
    ```
    That's going to lead him down the path of some bullshit OP Mindmage who can will people to death, no matter what.
    ```

    - u/BlueMangoAde:
      ```
      Soul defense is a thing, so people would have to prepare for both. Difficult but not impossible.

    - u/steelong:
      ```
      Well, a lot of stuff here seems DnD/Pathfinder inspired.  It's about time somebody learned "Power Word Kill".
      ```

    - u/PhilanthropAtheist:
      ```
      I'm still hoping we see a sequel where Zach survives and Zorian becomes the villain.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        And zach teams up with a simalcrum that isn't evil
        ```

        - u/PhilanthropAtheist:
          ```
          A shattered mind/soul mage like Zorian sounds cool
          ```

  - u/Hakurei06:
    ```
    See, my theory is that Mind Blank is actually the psychic equivalent of a pocket dimension, and Zorian is both an accomplished mentalist and dimensionalist. Also that psychic amplifying array.
    ```

  - u/rtsynk:
    ```
    except he's had plenty of opportunities to use such an attack and hasn't
    ```

    - u/-Fender-:
      ```
      It's absolutely critical that Zorian doesn't display his ability to bypass mind blank in public. Zach must be completely convinced that he's impervious to mind mgic under that spell, else he won't be able to fully believe the illusion that everyone aware of the time loop, other than himself, died. If he has a single fragment  of hope that it isn't real, then he'll die.
      ```

      - u/PhilanthropAtheist:
        ```
        He did study with the Araneans to try and bypass mind blank. It'll happen.
        ```

        - u/-Fender-:
          ```
          I know. I'm not saying that he can't do it. I'm saying that he must not display his ability to do so in the presence of Zach, or to anyone who could then tell Zach about Zorian's ability. I'm saying that his ability to do so must remain an absolute secret to everybody (except maybe Spear of Resolve and any other aranea from her web who might help with the illusion), until the month is over and Zach succeeded at surviving because of his firm belief in his mind being impervious to mind magic under mind blank.
          ```

          - u/SevereCircle:
            ```
            Spear of Resolve has been notably absent from the fight so far.
            ```

            - u/VorpalAuroch:
              ```
              Not too notable; as mentioned in the rooftop meeting, she's a pretty terrible direct combatant.
              ```

    I am so, so, so glad it exists. There's nothing else quite like it.

      ```
      Agreed. I've been following the story for just about 20% of my entire existance now, it's become a permanent fixture of my life. Next chapter is likely the final one...I don't even know what I'll do with myself after that.

      - u/ethicalhamjimmies:

          There’s a minor sequel that the author has talked about, but I think he’s onto other projects after that.

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        I should hope there's more than one. Fight has only barely started, and after the fight we have zach's shit to deal with, and then there's various world prologue we need. No way that all fits in one standard sized chapter.
        ```

        - u/Johnsanders667:
          ```
          There's going to be more than one,

          True, but notice that he's taking until sometime in November to write the next chapter, longer than ever before. Also, if you look in his bio, he said that as of Chapter 91 there is only 8-10 chapters left in the story, which means we're overdue for the final one.
          ```

          - u/-Fender-:
            ```
            Technically, this update took 6 weeks, and the previous one took 8. Although it's true that "sometime in November" could easily mean more than 8.
            ```

      - u/KamikazeHamster:
        ```
        I think that there's going to be a cliffhanger again. The angels versus demons battle is probably going to be the whole chapter. Then we're going to have a chapter dealing with the aftermath. There's also the possibility that they take the fight down to the primordial and **almost** have it escape. I can't see it being *just one* more chapter.

    Honestly? It’s a fuckin’ elegant solution. I had a laugh when he just picked up Oganj’s fireball — clearly the dragon mage doesn’t bother with the same kind of penetration that QI does and simply goes for brute force. I doubt that QI’s little stars would be so easily shifted into a pocket dimension.

  At a certain point, you have to wonder if maybe the Angels are right about murdering all of the loopers. For the greater good and all that.

  I don't know how many of you are familiar with Worm, but Zorian is gradually revealing himself as a classic [S-class threat](https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/S-Class#cite_note-17). His combination of golem creation, warding ability, knowledge of the mind, and simulacrum expertise allows him to grow in power practically exponentially.

  His only limit is his own relatively modest mana reserves. Unfortunately for the world, the best mana battery in existence is right in front of him.

  In a lot of ways, he rivals the threat of the ancient necromancers that a war was fought over.
  ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    Most of his exponential growth came from dangerous encounters with monsters whose abilities he could steal (princess, the soul plant, the Aranea, other things) and from using the time loop to steal secrets and make entire nations work for him.

    His growth will be a lot slower now, and with more eyes on him it will be harder to mass produce golems. He's still a serious threat (there's a reason Eldemar has laws against making big golems) but he's not an exponential threat. 

    He's a major threat, but if you threw enough powerful mages at him you could crush him. 

    He intends to be more subtle anyway, not evil take over the worldy.
    ```

    - u/ClaireBear1123:
      ```
      > He's a major threat, but if you threw enough powerful mages at him you could crush him.

      Well yea, he's a [Tinker](https://worm.fandom.com/wiki/Tinker). The same is true for necromancers, but that didn't stop society from banishing them. 

      > He intends to be more subtle anyway, not evil take over the worldy.

      Even if Zorian acts completely above board, the real threat is his knowledge. And Zorian is going to share his knowledge with the world. He's an idealist that way. Imagine what a less than scrupulous Lich could do with these novel ideas...

      It sort of makes you wonder why QI and Sudomir are even fighting him in the first place. Zorian could usher in a new period of mage dominance and inequality.
      ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        Zorian has said he'll share some empathy stuff, but I doubt he'll share everything. He wants to avoid the royal family going after him, and has a lot of debts to people so will avoid wholesale disruption.
        ```

        - u/ClaireBear1123:
          ```
          > Zorian has said he'll share some empathy stuff, but I doubt he'll share everything.

          He totally will share his knowledge. He's bemoaned multiple times about the waste of knowledge when old mages die. He loves libraries. He wants to start a magic research facility. He funded Kael's alchemy research out of sheer altruism and hope for better world. 

          He's an idealist in this way. Lots of nerds are. He doesn't see the inherent danger of it.
          ```

          - u/Nepene:
            ```
            Yeah. So he'll probably share his knowledge with select people who he trusts, keep some for himself, and slowly unload his knowledge on apprentices. 

            Crazy stuff will happen, but it'll probably take a while.
            ```

            - u/ClaireBear1123:
              ```
              If I'm QI, I'm abandoning that battlefield and figuring out a way to disguise myself so I can be the star pupil at Zorian University. If I'm the angels, I'm murdering that mofo.
              ```

              - u/Nepene:
                ```
                The angels don't seem to care about human knowledge much, more about social disruption and primordial release. 

                QI as Zorian's student does sound fun for a sequel.
                ```

            - u/BlueMangoAde:
              ```
              Now I want Zorian to open a magic school/research facility.
              ```

              - u/Nepene:
                ```
                Sounds like a fun sequel. Professor Zorian has a nice ring to it.

                    His crafting is very expensive. He could do with a lot more resources, and his golems would let him handle strange magical creatures well.
                    ```

      - u/PhilanthropAtheist:
        ```
        A thinker 5 - tinker 5 - master 7 type S-Class threat.
        ```

        - u/Caliburn0:
          ```
          Nah, Thinker 6 or 7, or possibly 8 I would think. His mind reading with his range alone is 5. 6 with his mental calculator, clock and other upgrades. 7 or 8 depending on his abilities with divination. Considering he was able to search half a continent with a week of preparation, I would go with 8.

          Tinker 7, with the golems and artifice abilities he's shown? Yeah, 7. Wards probably go under that one too.

          Master 8, or 9. He is capable of complete rewrite of a mind, and is capable of controlling pretty much everything with a mind that isn't shielded. (Which on the PRT rating system is pretty much no one.) His Simulacrum also go under here, as well as being another boost to his Thinker rating.

          Blaster 8 or 9. Dimensional blades and artillery magic are good enough for that.

          Stranger 5 or 6, illusions and ectoplasmic shells capable of looking like anyone. Then he can use his mind control to prop up the category even more.

          Honestly, Zorian has ratings in all the categories. So the simplest would just be calling him a Trump 8 or 9 or something. Which in PRT rating systems just means 'run for your lives'.
          ```

          - u/meterion:
            ```
            His tinker stuff would definitely bump his master rating up to 9, now that he's revealed his ability to make more-or-less autonomous semi-intelligent golems. Minions galore.
            ```

            - u/Retbull:
              ```
              The only issue with that is he can't construct them at will like that creepy city killer body eating guy in worm. Zorian would take a while to get ahead of even just a local army fighting him. He's not quite exponential as his minions don't make minions.
              ```

  - u/Kachajal:
    ```
    >His only limit is his own relatively modest mana reserves. Unfortunately for the world, the best mana battery in existence is right in front of him.

    And the Angels pretty much provived him with a solution for his mana issues - shaping ambient mana directly with the help of a magic item designed for the purpose. Either Zorian can create such an item - something he can research or do already - or maybe even just learn the ability on his own. 

    Which is, as you say, a ludicrous level of power.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Eh, I doubt it. Angels can use divine magic, which is outside the usual rules. Zorian can't.
      ```

      - u/ClaireBear1123:
        ```
        The angels cannot use divine magic, but they can make use of divine artefacts. Only the gods can use divine magic.

        An angel made that item in front of Zorian. It is not divine.
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          Or the angel summoned the item from elsewhere. Or made it using a connection to a divine artifact which makes divine artifacts. Any number of ways it could be impossible to replicate.
          ```

          - u/ClaireBear1123:
            ```
            Definitely true. It could have all been subterfuge too, and they simply handed Zorian an already existing divine object. 

            It would be more accurate to say that we didn't see anything that made it obviously a divine object, nor did Zorian make reference to it's divinity (I think).
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              It is of course possible that the cube was merely drawing in ambient mana to power a built-in, pre-cast spell. That is standard for magic items; the first golem doll Zorian built for Kirielle relied on ambient mana. You just need an item tough enough to withstand the effects. It would only really be extraordinary if the summoning cube was casting a new spell.
              ```

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      He can't manipulate divine mana that effectively, can't produce it, and any divine item he destroys now stays destroyed.
      ```

  - u/TheAtomicOption:
    ```
    >a classic S-class threat

    Threat isn't action though. The key here is whether his moral sense has kept up with his power level such that he's unlikely to ever be an *active* threat.
    ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    He's good, but he's not S-class. If you look at that bracket, it has entities like the Endbringers, Slaughterhouse 9 and Nilbog. Endbringers are literally unkillable if you don't happen to be a vengeful quasi-deity, Slaughterhouse 9 has a long track record of indiscriminately destroying locations and killing anyone they feel like, and Nilbog can multiply exponentially if he's allowed past a certain point.

    S-class is reserved for those situations where you have to get all hands on deck to even contain the problem. In 1v1 fights he has pretty good odds in most matchups, especially if he can scheme and prep beforehand, but a lot of the big-name mages out there would hand his ass to him in a duel without a need for backup.
    ```

    - u/ClaireBear1123:
      ```
      Imagine Zorian with the crown and 25 simulacra that work in unison. He could get out of control rather quickly.

      Within a few weeks/months he would be a Nilbog level threat. If he started doing novel research that would allow him to increase his mana capacity, he could turn into a swarm. A swarm that can continuously manufacture support golems and mind control others.

      If he were allowed to dig in, you'd never actually find the real Zorian.
      ```

  - u/nosoupforyou:
    ```
    Having great power isn't a threat.  Might as well kill any wizard because they have more power than others.
    ```

    - u/ClaireBear1123:
      ```
      It's not about power, it's about potential. 

      Zorian can seemlessly control many additional simulacrum, and continuously produce support golems that require no oversight or mana expenditure.

      In the right circumstances, he can exponentiate. That makes him S-class, or at least potential S-class.
      ```

      - u/nosoupforyou:
        ```
        Anyone could be a potential threat then.  Suppose the school wizards learn new spells and become more dangerous.  They are a threat now.

        If I go to the grocery store, and someone is bigger and stronger than me, they are a threat and must be taken down.

        Kind of ridiculous.

        Would you classify your dad as a threat when you're 10 purely because he has the potential to kill you, even though he's never given any indication he would?

        Being more powerful doesn't make someone a threat.  Actual intent does.   Consider Doc Oct from Spiderman.  He didn't become a threat until he started hurting people.  Before then he wasn't a threat even though he still had the same potential.
        ```

        - u/PhilanthropAtheist:
          ```
          This is relative to a setting like Worm's though. Imagine Zorian with his current capabilities in modern world like ours with no other mages but a bunch of super powered parahumans. They wouldn't have any mental defenses.
          ```

          - u/nosoupforyou:
            ```
            Imagining him in our world is meaningless.

            In that world, he's not inherently especially more powerful than anyone else.  He's just had the benefit of gaining decades of experience without aging, and collecting large numbers of spells.

            Equivalent to our world, it would be someone who gained immense knowledge, at 15, of various fields of study while also knowing where to find rich deposits of lost treasure.

            The only way you could consider Zorian to be a threat is if you assume he's going to take advantage of people.

            And the fact that he's a mind reader is irrelevent too, as there are plenty of them in that world, and they aren't all automatically threats.

            Basically you're equating someone with great power with someone who has evil intent.  Such as someone who works out at the gym and likes to bully people.  Zorian has been pretty explicitly not a bully.

            Wormverse has anti master techniques, mental training to resist masters, and there's probably a number of trumps whose shards could figure out how to block magic. 

            He'd also be notably weaker in that he doesn't have access to alchemical ingredients and such for golem creation and spell item creation. 

            He'd be a scary motherfucker, but Contessa could kill him, any endbringer could kill him, and a good team of parahumans could kill him.

              You know what. Yes that's true. There is also one major thing we didn't account. The lack of ambient mana to power his robotics.

              - u/Nepene:

                That would make it hard. He would do well to pair with a Crystal summoning or tinker parahuman and see if they could produce ambient mana.

            ```
            I didn't call him an S-class threat.  But someone with the capacity to punch you is not a threat.  That mindset leads to needing to destroy anyone who has superior skills.

            Superior capacity is not superior threat.  Threat requires some kind of indication that the other person is actually willing and able to act on it.

            For example, Jason from the horror movie would be a threat.  Jason, the karate expert from next door is not.

    ```
    They are amazing. 

    Zorian is no doubt pretty drained, but their allies are here, and his main contribution is done. He's never been a great pure combat mage. His shaping skills and mind magic and golem creation have been his greatest skills. 

    He can regenerate pretty fast as well. 1/32 mana units- simulacrum per 30 seconds, plus he can draw on ambient mana in emergencies. 

    I'm more worried for the invaders. They forgot that prep wins battles, and expended a lot of HP, mana, and effort on battering down a probably divine artifact and a single mage and golem to no use.

      Plus, the cavalry just arrived. They might just be battlemages riding eagles, but they were able to give Zorian and Zach issues back when they had first started raiding for keys. They’re no joke.

      As for Zorian’s trepidation about which side they’ll help — one side just summoned demons, the other side summoned angels. Seems like a pretty obvious choice.
      ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          These angels are pretty much exactly in line with descriptions in religious texts. Lots of fire, lots of limbs and wings in odd configurations, generally incomprehensible things not meant to be seen by human eyes. The pretty, fluffy winged, human-looking angels are a later invention.

          That aside, in this world people can actually communicate with angels; they definitely have an awareness of what angels look like.
          ```

          - u/kaukamieli:

            This is not our world and so our religious texts are completely irrelevant.

            - u/None:
              ```
              Understanding the *deliberate reference* to religious texts in the story isn't relevant to the story? Specifically, it's not relevant that the "not angelic" descriptions of angels match up with the actual, original source for descriptions of angels?
              ```

              - u/kaukamieli:
                ```
                They do not have our religious texts. It was asked if people recognize them as angels. It is completely irrelevant what texts these people have never seen to what the folk in this setting knows about angels.

                They have their own religion and we can't assume everyone knows these are angels just because they relate to our mythologies.

                So yes, irrelevant.

                What would be relevant is is what their texts, priests and people who have seen or communicsted with them say.

                I'm not sure how much information we have about their angels before this and if we know how much an average dude there knows about angels.
                ```

                - u/None:
                  ```
                  I didn't bring up religious texts in response to "do they know what angels look like," it was in response to "that doesn't sound obviously angelic." Because if you're trying to determine whether something is angel-like, checking whether it matches descriptions of what angels are like is a good starting point.

                  Then I separately answered the first question when I said

                  >That aside, in this world people can actually communicate with angels; they definitely have an awareness of what angels look like. 

                  Then you decided to ignore that part of my reply and complain that the first part isn't answering the question I wasn't replying to.

                    Well, you didn't quote the part you were answering to...

                    And I'm pretty sure normal people don't communicate with the angels and they have priests and stuff for that. Like our religions have these holy dudes too pretty much for telling you what the higher-ups think.

                    So like I said, "I'm not sure how much information we have about their angels before this and if we know how much an average dude there knows about angels." That there are some priests who talk with angels doesn't mean average dude has any idea.

                    I did not ignore that part of your reply. I specifically said that what would be relevant is what the dudes who have communicated with them say about them.

- u/I-want-pulao:

  How exactly is Silverlake dangerous anymore? The way I see it, she was dangerous only for her knowledge of Zach and Zorian. And, the 5-6 months after her exit and this (real time) month have seen (at least) Zorian eclipse what Silverlake knew of him. And her performance in this battle (so far) is rather poor too.   


  Of course, in the past, she'd be a threat to Zach and Zorian but as it is... I don't understand why she's still classified as a danger. Her x-factor was dimensionalism, and she's not that far ahead of ZnZ now I'd say.
  ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    Thing is silverlake is not a battle mage, her spells are hence slow and easily disrupted in comparison to the others, but she is a highly skilled soul & dimensional mage that know ZnZ way better then the other 2, but if she's not kept busy she can do awful stuff even if she's relatively easy to keep busy.

    The reason I think she's a non threat so far is because the thing we've seen is not in fact silverlake but her raven in her form, just being there as a distraction since silverlake as said is not a combatant.
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      Raven SL is an interesting take, didn't think of that at all!   


      Hmm but I think she's a bit of a non-threat overall, outside of her providing the information that RR and QI needed.. Yes, she's incredibly skilled in alchemy, soul magic, and dimensionalism. However, doesn't make her a heavy hitter esp not in battle... Ofc, Alanic is highly wary of her, but I'd even say Alanic can kill her easier than she can kill Alanic, just my reading of their relative skill sets.
      ```

  - u/vallar57:
    ```
    She's an unmatched alchemy expert with lots of time to prepare and huge resources. That spells "dangerous".
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      hmm, I hadn't considered the alchemical aspect, which is definitely a big thing. However, she's not just the weakest amongst QI, RR and herself, but the weakest by far. While narratively it was lampshaded many times that she is treacherous etc., the meta-purpose of her betrayal was to give RR and QI the information they lacked about Zach and Zorian, to make the battle more even. I don't see her playing any other major role in the story henceforth, unlike QI and RR, for example.   


      Unless the current lampshading of her being less dangerous but still dangerous is meant to indicate she gets to do something in the last chapters.

  Hell ya. another great chapter that evokes such vivid battles with good contours. I love how in the middle of the battle Zorion still has side thoughts and tangents on things which really add to his character and showcases quite subtly his multitasking and changing mental state.

   No wonder Damien was a great adventurer when he can go up against some of the best mages in the world and survive longer than a moment. Though it has been shown previously that he was a badass. That time travel reveal to Damien is likely to bight Zorion in the ass later on. Simply revealing that information on a large scale would likely make any of Zorions plans severely crippled.

  The fact Zorion had to work for the angels definitely makes it less of a literal deus ex machina.

  Zach and Zorions class is likely to be decimated after all this to keep the stakes real.

      You dont often see author playing with local slang in his fiction, but in this chapter he has both oganj and mrva. I guess MC name could be derivative from Zoran.

          Ognjište is a fireplace, oganj could be used for fire but not really (vatra is fire).

          Dveri is also older name for castle, i have no idea what knazov is but sounds slavic. Zoran is quite common name.

          Most of those stuff is seldom used words in modern language but still aplicable. 

          Author english is fenomenal, and he rarely uses local words for fantazy names. He probably has an editor, but his english is still better then some american authors in web fiction.

            Huh, I should have realized just looking at it - ognjiste looks like a reasonably close cognate of ignis in Latin and Agni in the Sanskritic languages 

            Knyazov Dveri was the name I mispelled haha - it's the town where sudomir was mayor.

            Yeah, I'm always in awe of folks' on the Internet grasp of English , and the author is comfortably in the top X% of written language  (setting aside the nigh peerless plotting/ story telling aside for a moment) mechanics

            While I speak a different slavic language, my guess is knazov is formed from a noun "knaz" which could mean "prince" and a suffix "ov" that is equivalent to the "'s" in English. So it could literally be "Prince's Castle". I used to  think that "Dveri" part was meant for "Doors" but the castle makes more sense.

          ```
          Knazov("Knyaz" or "Князь") is a Slavic feodal title, something akin to a Lord or King, depending on historical period.

          Dveri might also be Slavic from "дверь"(dver) meaning "door".

          (This is in Russian, but many such old words have same meaning in most Slavic languages)
          ```

          - u/dobri111:
            ```
            You are correct. In Croatian Dveri (or dvor singular) means Castle or mansion  or a large door for castle of temple or some such thing.  Knez is a high noble.

            Also "mrva" is not really used. Diminutive mrvica is only used either in ironic sense like here, or for a cute nickname.

            The rocket launcher oganj is Serbian, not Croatian but i guess it fits. Name is used basicly for same thing.

              Could be. I would translate it as Lords Castle, or Lords Mansion. Closer to events depicted in the novel.  But you could be right in that author wanted  sovereign gate. Would have been more fun if the real gate was located there, but author doesn't like "on the nose" references :).

  one has to wonder how much of a damn mana drain the cube is on its power source, and/or how utterly perfect and efficient Zorian's spell formulas are

  how long can that thing last

  also, that thing is totally going to release that fireball back at Oganj or someone else sometime later. way too good to pass up

  EDIT: actually...the cube could potentially store a very large or very plentiful power source within a pocket dimension, too... which makes it possible that this cube can last a *very*, **very** long time

    It is explained in the chapter where they first did angel summoning. The (same) angel explained to Zach that Zorian (pre-loop) wouldn't have had even passed the emotional and the ethics tests.

    "The ethics committee would have rejected him outright!"

    Plus: Anyone to be the controller had to be in Cyoria on that night. (Also told specifically then). Zorian wasn't (he was in his home, far from Cyoria).

  The world itself was constructed out of a dragon, right? This chapter may be confirmation of the angels having looped through this battle in their own version of the restarts. Angel tree knowing when the right moment to fight is, appears to be a typical time looper thing. They undoubtedly have a plan for Zorian & Zach at the end too.

  - u/Nepene:

    They have prophetic skills, and great powers of divination. I doubt they can loop, they just know a lot.

      The Soverign Gate was a divine artifact; I doubt time loops are common place.

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        Yeah. In my story, the dragon below runs a loop of the loop, since the prime world is actually in a pocket dimension of hers. Time loops require deadish gods or primordials or whatever, so they'd be uncommon.

  I finally caught up to the story (was at chapter 30 or so a couple weeks ago). The ending isn't being very subtle about being inspired by Time Braid, is it?
  ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    While the story is obviously Naruto inspired and Time Braid inspired (in part since the author favorited Time Braid) the ending isn't time braidy. As I remember it, the villains summoned a bunch of clones of the main character, and the heroes used their extreme combat skills and mind magic stuff with clones to beat them up.

    Here, the Sakura analogue Zorian is using his item creation skills and the aid of his brother to defend him while he summons minions and the Naruto analogue Zach fights a dragon.
    ```

    - u/VorpalAuroch:
      ```
      It's not a blow for blow repeat (and couldn't be, since it's missing the mind control themes), but it's pretty similar. The heavy squares off against a dragon (in TB the dragon was a hero (Naruto), here it's a villain). The main nonlooping villain (IQ, Pein) focuses on sabotaging the efforts of the backing cast and stopping the protagonist from asking Heaven for help. There are several fights happening in parallel, neither side being entirely clear which is the 'true fight' and which are feints, until they merge as the bit players are taken out and only the main fighters on each side are left. Lots of prep time happens on each side with the end result of the heroes negating most of the villain's prep, at a substantial but lower cost than the villains needed to set it up.

      It's its own thing, but the ending has so far looked much more ripped from TB than the middle did.
      ```

      - u/DamenDome:
        ```
        I think you just described battle scenes in general. The only similarity I see that strikes as very specific is involving loopers and nonloopers
        ```
