  This story is breaking my categorization of good fiction in a way nothing has since Worm, or maybe even when I was eleven and read Foundation for the first time.

    > Author's note: I did what I could re: formatting, but yeesh. Fanfiction is great, you guys are great, but this one interlude in particular may be worth reading on aooo instead (work number is 5627803) or by downloading the pdf (woo!) available at goo gl yLCvgK

    Chapter is a reddit thread, AO3 has the correct indentation. Makes it much easier to read.

    Damn, what a great update, that last post especially hit a note I thought was missing in the brainstorm thread. The whole thing is so *real*.

  Random thoughts on this chapter, and other recent ones:

  * I wonder what Telor and its hosts think of Esplin's speech. I can totally imagine controllers going "Wait, these guys are sentient?" "Sure. You didn't notice?", and hosts thinking "Does that mean they're going to treat us with respect now? ... Ha. Ha. Ha. :(".

  * One of the possible goals of Esplin's speech that hasn't been suggested so far could be memetic vaccination. If he visibly betrays humanity after this speech, cooperation between any group of yeerks and any group of humans will be much more difficult and unlikely going forward. "Oh, you regret enslaving us? Yeah, look at what the last guy who said that did!"

  * This chapter seems to imply that there is a complete information blackout from at least the American and the Estonian government, probably many more. That's weird, I'd expect that governments would want to be as open as possible, and official should make speech after speech after public conference to reassure the public. Shutting the media out sounds like something that A would get the media very angry, B would get many, many people to riot out of fear that their government is working for the alien invasion, and C would be missing political opportunities to show your value as a leader by taking visible measures in difficult times.

  While I'm at it, the list of mangled pseudonyms:

  * GrimHarvest7876 = I thought he was a PHO Bagrat cameo, but after checking, nope; u/reaper7876

  * countingcards = u/keeper52

  * PumicePrimate  = u/ObsidianOrangutan

  * creatureoftheglade  = u/creatureofthewood

  * HeartScribe = u/MugaSofer (?)

  * entroprising = u/chaosmosis (clever)

  * cognoslutty = u/philophile (haha)

  * hagar = u/ketura (?)

  * WetnessIsTheEssenceOfBeauty = u/Anakiri (?)

  * SabreVerte = Moi-même (he forgot the accent on the second 'e', though)

  * GSVOrangeYouGladIDidntSayBanana = No equivalent, I think; also, I love the idea of the thread with 100+ responses about "by the way, what the fuck just happened to the laws of reality?"

  * AskMeAboutDwarfFortress = u/PeridexisErrant (?)

  * Cosmic_Crayon, dontcallmeishmael, ElliotPhoneHome, m073cu73, rampant170, ArcaneFerret = No equivalent (?)

  * mrfreeze54 = u/CoolGuy54 (n**ice**... I will go to hell for that)

  * CQCQ_037 = u/CCC_037

  * KillroyIsHere = u/royishere, and, finally

  * TroubledTrousers = u/KnickersInAKnit

  Also, this chapter made me re-read both Worm's PHO interlude and Pact's Execution 13.4. I guess I'm a sucker for alternative formats.

    Lots of other contributions were folded in (e.g. DaystarEld's persona's attitude strongly influenced a couple of posts).

      Omg, I didn't notice you used my name (ArcaneFerret/MagicWeasel) because it was attached to the looting list (that I didn't write). It's an honour!

  The real tragedy here is that the last post only has one upvote. Come one, fictional reddit, you can do better!

  Also, I think SabreVerte should be SabreVert (also, squeeeee :D).

  Anyway, everything about this update is awesome. I liked it a bit less than the PHO Worm update because I'd already seen most of the contents, but otherwise it hit all the marks that PHO did: the formatting, the abbreviations, the typos (beware the Andalight menace), people being assholes to random internet strangers, and so, much, sarcasm. The last message really hit a note too.

  I am really looking forward to seeing how the Animorphs deal with this. 

  Lets say that the world receives true confirmation of the aliens, and the resolution of the Fermi Paradox becomes fact. Then naturally the smart thing for the Animorphs to do is come forward with Ax, and tell their side of the story. 

  Only then they have to admit to having the morphing technology, which, in the hands of the Yeerks, would give them an unprecedented advantage. (Side note; wouldn't morphing tech allow Yeerks to stop taking hosts? Sure, it would limit how far an individual could go from the pool, but it would remove their dependence on awake, sentient minds. That is, if a yeerk collective can even acquire the ability in the first place. ).

  And this would also put them at the centre of the international media storm that would follow, which some of them might find objectionable, considering that quite a few would blame them for the meteor. 

  And perhaps, most importantly, the andalites. In canon, the andalites thought the animorphs were lying when they said their home world was being invaded; in this case they already know, and their go-to plan when it came to stopping an unaware humanity from serving the yeerks was to scorch the planet. 

  If they caught wind that humanity might start willingly cooperating with the yeerks? Earth literally might be forced into an alliance with the yeerks, just to survive that first wave of andalite aggression. Especially considering that the last individual who the andalites might listen to (Ax) was last seen letting a yeerk infest him. 

  In fact, that could actually be Visser- Ones plan, if my model of the andalites is correct.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Morphing tech for Yeerks has been discussed around here once in a while, but not explicitly mentioned in the story.  Unless someone convinces me otherwise, my current take is "it'd work on a single Yeerk, but then break when that Yeerk diffused back into the pool," meaning it'd work on Esplin for good (and his time limit would be RIDICULOUS, given his mass, but he probably wouldn't want to lose his Alloran brain).

    Without saying yes, no, or sideways, I like the way you think re: politics, especially regarding the Andalite homeworld.
    ```

    - u/KnickersInAKnit:
      ```
      If Esplin morphs Alloran he's technically not losing the Alloran brain, but then you kinda get an issue of not much changing at all, especially if Esplin keeps his Alloran morph conscious. Which leads to an interesting question...if a Yeerk were to morph, would they keep the morph unconscious the entire time, or would they get 'creeped out' by the silence?


      This is kind of a fascinating ethical question. If you give Yeerks morphing tech and they morph sentient species, are they still technically infesting them?
      ```

  I like this chapter. Yurk/Andalight spelling confusion is cool, obvious in retrospect but easy to overlook in advance. The last guy's lament, that Ventura's going to just get overlooked, is especially strong contrasted with everyone else talking about strategy and analysis and physics and the state of the economy.

  ```
  That last post was the perfect way to end the chapter. Can't wait to see where the story goes from here :)

  So... I would like this update a lot more if I didn't already know most of the individual pieces from heavily participating in the IC reaction thread.  Even so, the overall idea is very good, a very nice way of crowd sourcing.  If it was my first time seeing it, it would be very fun, like the best of the PHO updates from Worm.  Even knowing a lot of the content already, it was still a net positive reading it, and the expansion on the last comment was absolutely brilliant.  I feel like my in character response was insensitive for not offering any condolences or such, it was a really great way to give the audience a sense for what all the deaths meant (otherwise they would just be a statistic to the reader).

  Woohoo, made it in! Literary immortality via ratfic!

  Question: how did you possibly make the decision on which posts to keep and which to cut? You could have easily made the chapter three times as long, and I admire your restraint, but I am interested to know your methodology. Was it mostly by feel, or was there a more logical component? Did you try to limit yourself to one post per facet of the situation? Was any of the humor worked in in earlier drafts?

  One criticism as well -- perhaps it's due to the fact that I read through the source thread several times over, but I found the dissonance between the crowdsourced content and your writing somewhat jarring. Perhaps predictably, you didn't quite manage to capture the feeling of a hodgepodge collection of internet voices as well as the actual hodgepodge collection of internet voices did. I will try to be constructive and suggest that the more effective method would have been to fight the instincts that have invariably produced wonderful writing and try to, well, write worse.

    *Checks off another Horcrux*

    They do say that a man is not dead while his name is still spoken... I wonder if that works for psudeonyms?
    ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    It was mostly a feel thing.  I went through the 238-comment thread and selected one comment, first (This Must Go In), then went down again and selected the next most important, then the next most, then the next most, stopping as soon as I felt I could.  Basically, I tried to do the one-post-per-facet thing, and nodded to the remainder in "show more replies."

    Heh—I *did* try to write worse, while at the same time saying all the things that needed to be said.  Ah, well.

  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I kind of wanted to ask you about it when I read this part.

    How does it feel to have a writer (I mean, a fanfic writer, not a *real* writer, of course) cook up a long, passionate, tear-stained speech about sort-of-your horrible life in sort-of-your name?
    ```

    - u/KnickersInAKnit:
      ```
      Serious response - a sort of living vicariously feeling. I'm not much of a writer, honestly. I'm kinda your stereotypical STEM major who can nitpick on the ridiculousness of CSI managing to get forensic DNA results back in 2 hours (come the fuck on, PCR takes like 3 hours to run esp with a manual plate load) and other such nonsense, but writing? It doesn't come easy to me. 


      I know that you and I comment a lot on /u/TK17Studio 's updates here on /r/rational, and you consistently comment on 'where things are going'. I mostly comment on 'biology things the author got wrong' and 'how I can break the rules of the world next'. Don't get me wrong, I truly love this fanfic. I just can't read and immediately see all those literary devices that other fans of this story can. I can appreciate, but not articulate. 


      So seeing the author dedicate about 1/5th of an interlude to expanding on a comment of mine that came from a place of personal experience (bitter, bitter grief at the unfairness of the world) is frankly...well. I feel like I've 'made it' in a strange way. Achievement unlocked: KnickersInAKnit inspires someone else to write something.

  Typo: User countingcards refers to himself as countingcards52 in his own comment.

  Very interesting chapter. I'm glad to see myself represented in it (yay!) and I can see where my comment's been edited to make the central point more clearly (good job). You definitely hit the nail on the head when it comes to the point of having a lot of different voices in this chapter. And I can see where a lot of the points came from.

  I especially liked TroubledTrousers' long diatribe at the end, there.

  I notice that most people are treating it like it had little or no emotional impact on them personally - which is probably not entirely unreasonable, given how most people probably didn't have relatives or people that they know in Ventura - and Troubled's long post at the end goes a long way towards countering this.

  I liked it.

  >From what it said, it thought our technology was the result of group intelligence, like termites or ants.

  Ouch. 

  Yeah, I noticed on re-reading I missed him *explicitly saying* that brilliant suggestion of mine in his speech.

  >[–] TroubledTrousers 11 points 41 minutes ago

  >Fuck you. Fuck you so fucking hard right now.

  ... oh, damn. I should have paid more attention to usernames the first time around.

  This chapter really benefits from re-reading.

  >lol. I know this was nearly a whole day ago, so it might have slipped your mind by now, but remember how a meteor just killed a million people.

  Dammit does my cameo consist entirely of burns on my comments.

  >Guys I had an aunt and an uncle in Ventura, are you telling me they fucking died because of this alien's 'dead man's switch'??!

  It must be amazing to be /u/KnickersInAKnit right now. 

  Some people are complaining that having "read it all before" makes this chapter less interesting, but I actually find comparing the roleplayed vs. canon threads really interesting.

  FYI for anybody still watching this thread, a private message with specific suggestions caused me to add about 500 new words in four or five new comments, so the chapter now contains EASTER EGGS FOR YOU.
