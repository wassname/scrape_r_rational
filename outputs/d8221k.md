## The Salvation War- Can't Read?

### Post:

So, I found some TSW recommendations in the subreddit, which makes it seem like the best place to ask this:

&#x200B;

I've read the story before, but the forum is no longer accessible w/out logging in. I don't have an account, and the option to register doesn't seem to exist. What changed, and is this story gone from the accessible internet forever?

  The [wayback machine](http://web.archive.org/) is very much a thing that exists, it looks like it has archives of it.

  Personally I wouldn't recommend it as a rational read though. It's much more a HFY story than a rational one.

  Edit: You can also read the original posting on stardestroyer.net (Index thread [here](http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?t=118769))

    You should also be aware that the stardestroyer.net version is the original, unedited version, while the one on tboverse.us is the edited version. Apart from cleaned up language, there are some minor differences (for example, [in the original](http://bbs.stardestroyer.net/viewtopic.php?p=2886869#p2886869), the reserved spot in the deepest circle of hell is for Robert McNamara, who was still alive at the time of writing; [in the revised version](http://web.archive.org/web/20160617001333/http://www.tboverse.us/HPCAFORUM/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=8355&sid=13aa02b2c9938cd03a3001f9ffd0359f#p71944), the spot is reserved for the executives who cancelled _Firefly_ instead).

      Thank you, guys, for the originals. That- wait, what? The deepest circle of hell was once *not* reserved for the executives who cancelled *Firefly*? Blasphemy!
