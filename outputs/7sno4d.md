## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I finally have a worldbuilding document for my "the world is full of animals moving through the desert with worlds on their back" D&D campaign, [on Google Docs here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YylmoGp9T5q87qOadJvh801HEmPMgO-bx5TUn5i4Xlc/edit?usp=sharing).

  I would like people's opinion on the following world building questions. In this particular world magic does not play nice with electricity. Specifically if the magic field interacts with electricity then it will cease to be ethereal and begin to become capable of maintaining two way interactions with physical parts, ruining delicate electrical parts. The stronger the magical field the weaker the electrical field needs to be. While this has many effects, such as the phenomena known as magic poisoning as it tears up your nerves, one major side effect is causing electrical devices to become impractical. Even in low magic regions this is a problem as a temporary thick spot forms. Therefore, in order to avoid this the people make use of magical solutions to most problems, but the one this post is about is computers. These people have started using mechanical computers to perform calculations. In order to compensate for the slow speed they have begun to use temporal acceleration to help. So the question is, what would be the downside of using purely mechanical computers? Secondly, my current thoughts about question one is that it would restrict the amount of memory and complexity of programs you can run as well as reducing the speed of human interaction quite significantly. So what sort of things could and could not be done with simple programs with limited memory, but unlimited time to work?  I'm reasonably certain that many things that we have accomplished with modern computers are not merely the result of increased speed and are instead the result of increased complexity such as the modern improvements to AI. Would spaceflight be possible and if not what are the computationally expensive parts of spaceflight so I can consider magic solutions? Tldr What could be achieved with mechanical computers?
  P.S I have very little computing experience. About the limits on mine are having watched crash course computers

    In theory, any calculation you can perform on an electronic computer, you can also perform on a mechanical one. (This is the same 'in theory' that states that any calculation that can be performed by a computer can also be done with pencil and paper - it says nothing about how long it will take to calculate).

    In *practice*, the major advantage of electronics is that you can fit an awful lot of computer in a very small space. Mechanical computers are going to be *significantly* bigger, and at the same time require some incredibly tiny and delicate parts. There will be trouble if dust gets in, or if a part deep in the machine breaks, or if a part is made slightly unevenly. So, we're probably talking a room-sized computer or so here.

    > So what sort of things could and could not be done with simple programs with limited memory, but unlimited time to work?

    A lot more could be done than you might think. In general, there's a tradeoff between time and memory - by giving unlimited time, you're allowing most of the problems of limited memory to be avoided by sufficiently devious programmers. (Modern computers tend to optimise for time over memory, so the default solutions to certain problems will change).

  Urban fantasy!

  Around the year 1600, I have a big disaster with vampires going from a population of, say, 100,000 to 800. The main reasoning behind this is vampire mythology didn't appear until around the year 1700, so having something Big happen in the vampire world around 1700 is a good way to have an in-universe justification for vampires being thousands of years old but mythology being far more recent.

  For some reason I ended up settling on the Catastrophe likely being because some vampire almost managed to take over the world and kill all his rivals (i.e. War). Vague religious / purity / generic "save the world from evil vampire" justifications have been trotted out, but it's kind of hard to put a Bad Guy in history who basically almost succeeded in committing genocide and at the same time think of a "reasonable justification".

  But, why... why can't it just be a Plague that only affects vampires? I don't need to justify how William (my main vampire) survived it, since the anthropic principle means I'm not going to be writing romance stories about vampires who didn't. The problem with Plague vs War is that a Plague would probably mean that all William's friends from Before were dead, whereas a War, if William had good connections and ended up with, say, a spot in a bunker safe from danger, it would make sense that he'd have quite a few friends from Before. But I've only committed to giving him ONE friend from Before, and if I don't give him any more, he can just have been lucky enough to have kept one friend (and they might even have drifted apart until after the Plague).

  I imagine that after the Catastrophe, whatever it was, the 800 vampires would have met together, become friends, etc anyway. I mean they would have kind of had to to maintain their social order.

  The other thing that is worse about a plague than a War is that I wanted the Catastrophe to happen around 1700 in e.g. Romania. A War can happen in one place; a Plague is by definition universal. I suppose I can make the vampires have a meeting, post-Plague, and for whatever reason the meeting was in Romania (perhaps it had an unusually high concentration of survivors?). Or the Plague starting in Romania, so the first affected vampires didn't have a "cover-up" plan like was developed later; vampire symptoms of disease could be like what people report corpses "with vampirism" today have (bloody mouths/etc). I'm a bit uneasy about it having a cure that was dispensed to people as in that time sharing a cure would be very slow and you'd end up with a racial disparity, and I don't want to give my vampires any more reason to be super white. 

  Big problem with the Plague: this will never be covered in-story so maybe isn't relevant, but vampires "under the hood" work based on nanites. So I suppose the Plague could be some sort of virus that causes the nanites to shut down; or just a regular "human" disease that the nanites aren't able to identify and shut off. (I mean, since vampires don't get poisoned periodically, their nanites can presumably fix prion diseases!). Although the whole nanite thing I'm not even going to TRY to touch with a ten-foot pole, I like to make sure that in my head it all makes sense so the worldbuilding has a consistent basis to rest on.

  Anyway, thoughts on Plague vs War? Plague also has a lot of angst because it could happen again and they're not sure what caused it in the first place.

    Your vampires tend to be fairly isolationist, do they not? How would a plague spread through the vampire population, exactly, when they're spaced out around the world and any one can avoid it by shutting himself away with his thralls and not letting any other vampires in?
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      Ah, you're right, that's the problem! Plague needs a vector to spread. Whereas a war makes its own vector  (but then you ask: how could a suitably isolationist vampire not hide on a tiny pacific island until everything blew over? and then do I really want my 800 survivors to be disproportionately full of those hidden survivor types?) 

      Then again, it could just be airborne - but that puts a big tax on *AIR*borne if we're talking about it going across oceans. Human plagues don't do that. Have it airborne and spread by humans - but then you still have the same problem.

      To get around the problem you need it to, say, have an incubation period of 200 years or so. Have it be a small contagious defect in the way the nanites (or proteins in cells, or whatever: no need to get specific) replicate. Because vampires grow so slowly, it takes a long time for this defect to be widespread enough in the vampire population. The defect is airborne (though vampires don't need to breathe, they do need to use their lungs to talk, and they feed through their lungs, so crap definitely can get there. In feeding they deposit stuff into the human bloodstream, so they can also infect humans they feed from). By the time people start dying from it, everyone has it; the young vampires are made from seed blood from their Maker, so proportionally speaking they will be as infected by the disease as their Maker was. 

      This has different connotations depending on the action of the Plague - are certain individual vampires just immune (thanks to something about their human DNA), or is it something about the "line" of their nanites (i.e. they have good antivirus or whatever). If the former then that gives me what I want but maybe makes less sense; the latter could be interesting as all the living vampires would be from one "dynasty" or another, and you end up with vampires who know each other and are grouped into a few loose factions. It doesn't cause much of a racial disparity as Making a vampire doesn't follow racial lines in the same way, and the lines can be very spread out (i.e. maybe all vampires who survived the Plague were the descendants of one Very Healthy vampire who Made a bunch of vampires c. 10,000 BCE - they'd be spread all over the planet in a few centuries).

      I think I like the idea of the plague survivors being from "family lines", but they'd also have to be the "luckiest" people from them, probably? Hmm.

      The plague winnowing the vampire population over a century or two is no big deal, so that's fine. 

      The big problem is, does that change the culture? Do the vampires know how it was spread? Would they institute a variety of anti-plague measures as a matter of course even if they didn't know how it was spread? Did vampires accept germ theory c. 1700? (It was first proposed in the Western world c. 1550 and accepted c. 1850). This could be an issue as I have vampires sharing feeding vessels - though that's easy to fix. Then again - even though we know not to share cups, we still do. And vampires are at even less risk from sharing humans than we are sharing cups, given how this plague is the only one of its kind in undead memory. So maybe they'd add a few superstitions - killing any humans a dead vampire fed on, ritual cleaning of this or that - but continue life as normal.
      ```

        Your isolationist vampire on a tiny pacific island is well insulated against both war and plague. If the war is one of complete extermination, however, and the aggressors have some form of vampire-locating magic, then 'isolationist vampire' might just be another way of saying 'easy target'; and perhaps the only survivors are a group of vampires who got together for the purpose of mutual defence (in which case they'd all know each other, hving once fought together).

        --------------

        On the plague side, on the other hand, one possibility is the Y2K bug writ large - that the vampire nanites were never intended to last quite *that* long, and when their date counter rolled over, the nanites reset themselves; which worked out to 'shut down' except for one particular nanite line, which either (a) successfully rebooted or (b) due to an ancient bug, stopped incrementing the time counter a few thousand years before the time bug hit, thus never triggered it. This way, it doesn't matter *what* the vampire did, they were all equally vulnerable - and the survivors have probably never worked out what it was, either, and have no idea how to prevent it from happening again. (Worse, all the vampires who did die did so near-simultaneously and with no warning).

          Oh, I loove the Y2K bug writ large. Especially the thought of everyone just dying almost at once. They'd have to conclude it was magic. 

          And hey, if I do decide to turf the nanites handwavium for vampires, a magic spell that was cast to kill all vampires (which some happened to be immune to) is a feasible alternative.

              Well let's just let that marinate.... that does explain why Cassius is trying to breed super predictors: he wants to know if this is going to happen again and how he can stop it.

              They are also probably going to know that they're all related to each other, which might make them point fingers at one another: so War could break out too.

                The one with the greatest interest in them *all* going well is likely their Youngest Common Ancestor - that is, the vampire whose nanites first developed an immunity (however that was done). One has to wonder whether or not he survived the anger of his children.

                  I imagine this vampire living some 20,000 BCE, and being long-dead. The living vampires know they come from, say, half a dozen bloodlines because they can't trace everything back quite that far.

                  The problem is - when I use the average vampire growth rate I calculated for 800 vamps in 1700 to become 20,000 vamps in 1900, one vampire takes only 415 years to become 800 vampires. So there's no way that a single bloodline could leave only 800 vampires alive, unless the growth rate was much lower in antiquity (it probably was: doing some quick maffs, the vampire population/human population goes from 1.2e-6 in 1700 to 1.2e-5 in 1900 to 1.6e-5 in 2000 - this sort of growth in % is unsustainable). 

                  So... let me estimate the vampire population in 600, when William was turned (using 2e-5 as the ratio): about 4,000 vampires. 1 AD has 3,400 vampires. Same ratios give 1700 pre-Catastrophe numbers at 12,000; this means that, with 800 survivors, we're looking at about 95% of vampires being killed. It seems like a Big Scary Catastrophe, but with a high *enough* proportion of survivors that most vampires are going to have a couple of friends living (if 95% of your friends died, you'd probably have one or (if very lucky) two good friends left and maybe 2-3 people you liked well enough to become good friends with when all other options are dead). So that actually works out quite well.

                  Great, now I'm sanity checking my growth rate for vampires: the vampire growth rate is equivalent to the massive growth rate of the world population in the 1940s-present day, which basically makes the *average* vampire make two children a century. Plugging in the pre-industrial human growth rate makes there be only 4,000 vampires in the present day, so the 800 survivors would be a huge demographic chunk (by comparison the "baby boom" growth rate gives 20,000 vampires in 1900 and 100,000 in 2000, which makes the Old Ones a lot more special!). 

                  So ANYWAY, back to what I was trying to do originally: the 800 vampires are 5% of the vampires living in 1700. So that requires 20  vampires-that-left-descendents to be alive whenever Nanite Eve was alive, on average. The thought of Eve being one of 20 "successful progenitors" say 10,000 BCE is not a huge reach in terms of their prominence. I think norms around vampire reproduction probably changed after the Catastrophe too - I have one character with the title "Progenitor of the Wang line" because I imagine that some vampires would have created "lines" of children afterwards in an attempt to rally the troops, so to speak. 

                  So yeah... you probably don't need much of a war for all these numbers to work out, is what I'm concluding!

                    Or unless the mutation happened only 415 years before the Catastrophe. (It doesn't *have* to start with the official founder of the bloodline).

                    It's worth bearing in mind that, before the Catastrophe, the vampire population was probably in equilibrium - the amount of new vampires being equal to those who died. Now, since there's not much that kills a vampire, this equilibrium could well have been artificial - that is, the planet was divided (by the vampires) into a group of territories, one per vampire, and all vampires were expected to only turn a child vampire if there was an empty territory for that child vampire to claim. (If there were no empty territories, vampires were not above the idea of emptying a territory belonging to someone they didn't much like - which is why alliances were so important, especially to young vampires). And the territories were likely small enough that it was impractical for two vampires to survive in a single territory.

                    This way, the youngest (and thus weakest) vampires would have been at the greatest risk, and there would be quite a few Especially Ancient vampires hanging about the place, being generally pretty near invulnerable thanks to their great experience.

                    Of course, this whole 'limited territory' business would go out the window after the Catastrophe, but the entire careful-complicated-diplomacy aspect of it (in which vampires were especially careful not to annoy other vampires) might hang on.

                      ```
                      Yeah, that's my logic behind calculating the vampires as % of the human population; the vampire population would be in equilibrium with the human population, as new territories would be made when prey got too numerous. 

                      Careful diplomacy is exactly what the story does! Here's an interlude - I may have shown it to you before, but hey. It does have your namesake character in it! (Originally it had an irrelevant character but then I realised it's better if Cassius is introduced early as someone William is on friendly terms with. Allows me to set up stuff that happens later, too).

                      (Later on, William agrees to give one of Cassius' allies a territory in the future because a new town - Kalgoorlie if you're counting - has sprung up after a gold rush in the last thirty years or so.)

                      ---

                      William folded a towel.  *Do you know where I might get information about any nearby Americans?* Asked the angles of the creases.

                      Cassius sprinkled water onto it. *What sort of information are you after?* Replied the arrangement of the droplets.

                      *I have found a human I want to serve me.* William replied by adjusting his tie, his left hand in front as his right tightened the knot. It was the left hand that indicated service and the right hand’s action that spoke of personal service to him. Had he then gestured outward, the act would have suggested, instead, service to Cassius. 

                      He trusted Cassius to fill in the gaps with pre existing information: had this been about a fellow vampire, his approach would have been entirely different, so there was a mortal American whose services he wished to obtain. 

                      Cassius laughed. “You mean a human you wish to have served to you.” He couldn’t resist the pun. He knew William was one of many who did not keep human servants for longer than a year or two before getting bored of them. Or just particularly hungry.

                      William narrowed his eyes slightly. Cassius was his elder and had something he wanted, so he had to accept some poor decorum. But William’s manners were beyond reproach. He grabbed a rose from the table, and expertly pulled out its petals one at a time, deciding to be direct.* It is your hotel. You must know about that night porter. Is he one of yours?* He arranged the petals on the table into a kolam of sorts.

                      “Do you not think I can control myself, that you refuse to speak to me?”

                      “I think you are being rude, your majesty. I am asking you a simple question.”

                      “I do know who you are talking about. I found him interesting, too. That’s why he works at my hotel.”

                      “He is one of yours?”

                      “I considered it. But I have too many. Do you want him?”

                      “Yes.”

                      Cassius laughed. “It’s a pity. He’s not an ordinary human. I fear you’ll ruin him when you get hungry or bored.”

                      William frowned, and picked up the rose petals. *I won’t ruin him. I can control myself.*

                      Hee laughed again, and retrieved the towel. *I don’t believe you. You are aware of your reputation.* The way he picked it up spelled out the retort. Left hand, picked up from the centre. He elaborated with some careful folds. *You don’t remember. They are impossible.* 

                      “I will have him, with your blessing, your majesty.”

                      He grinned. “Now who is being rude?” But William knew that meant the American was his.

                      “Will you tell me where he came from?” 

                      “I expect this favour to be repaid.”

                      “Naturally, your majesty.”

                        Some comments seem appropriate, though.

                        > William narrowed his eyes slightly.

                        The two of them have just been communicating through the creases in a towel, and the twitches of William's fingers as he adjusts his tie. How is a facial motion like this *not* an entire sentence of its own? (Probably Vampire for *I will kill you in your sleep*, too).

                        > “I think you are being rude, your majesty. I am asking you a simple question.”

                        I've noticed this trend in your writing before - this is *not* an inferior talking to a superior. This is two near-social-equals having a chat, and about something which William expects to be truly inconsequential to Cassius at that.

                        Which means you're getting the 'friendly terms' thing down well, at least.


                        > Hee laughed again, and retrieved the towel. *I don’t believe you. You are aware of your reputation.* The way he picked it up spelled out the retort. Left hand, picked up from the centre. He elaborated with some careful folds. *You don’t remember. They are impossible.*

                        There's a really impressive amount of information being exchanged here, in a few simple actions. Not impossible - especially if things like Cassius' facial expression while he's moving, or his precise finger motions, play into the gesture in important ways - but it's probably important to bear in mind that it's going to be very hard for any gesture, no matter how elaborate, to transmit information faster than the spoken word.

                        Consider the towel retort, for example. Ten words. A bit of poking around on Google suggests that ordinary English has an entropy which can be rounded off to about ten bits a word; so, that phrase is maybe a hundred bits of information.

                        Left vs. right hand is *one* bit. Picking it up from the centre - let's assume the towel can be picked up from anywhere in a sixteen-by-sixteen grid. That's 256 locations - another eight bits. Let's say another ten bits per hand in finger positions, and... hmmm. Another ten bits each for facial expression and stance. (I'm trying to err on the side of generosity here) This comes up to about forty-nine bits... out of a hundred.

                        This can be enhanced, to some degree, by having towel-related actions already have their own implication (as opposed to, say, rose-related actions); adding more bits of meaning. But it's definitely starting to look as if Cassius is going to need to readjust his finger positions several times to get enough information for a phrase like that into his gesture.

                        I mean - a secondary language based entirely on minor gestures is a pretty cool thing to have, and I can see plenty of good reasons to include it. But what you have presented here comes across as implausibly high-bandwidth communication.

                          Thanks for the analysis! I think you're right about the towel thing, and I probably *should* think more about bits - gwern's analysis of death note anonymity really comes into the forefront of my mind here. I will simplify the implied dialogue, though I should say that context means a lot here: William is temporarily in town, Cassius owns a hotel William is staying at, Cassius had Red (the love interest) hired because of his random "communicates in vampire language" quirk, and Cassius probably knows that William would see a lot of Red due to the timing of Red's shifts. (Truthfully, Cassius probably hired Red and put him at work as the night porter because some vampire guest would be interested in him sometime and would then owe him a favour for poaching his territory: so this situation worked out well for him)

                          > I don't believe you

                          The word/concept 'disbelief' would work fine for these four (five?) words; even if we don't allow gestures, orientation, etc to have meaning, it's clear from context that Cassius would not communicate that William doesn't believe him, but rather that he doesn't believe William. I mean, an English speaker can roll their eyes, or sigh a particular way and communicate the same thing. 

                          Really, this is communicated by the "he laughed again" part, before he even picks up the towel. 

                          >  You are aware of your reputation. 

                          This is a complex thought compared with the above and is likely what is communicated by picking it up. Really, all that needs to be communicated for William to 'get it' is the concept of reputation and perhaps it being directed to him (especially in context - later in the novel, Cassius quips that the janissary William is feeding from "has at least a pint of blood left in her", so he needn't stop eating yet). Reputation is very important to vampires so it makes sense that they'd be able to communicate it with their system.

                          > You don't remember. They are impossible.

                          THIS is the most complex part, and to explain its communication I have just written "he elaborated with some careful folds". Honestly, I don't think it's necessary Cassius adds this at all; William decides having a human lover will be good for his reputation because vampires will start respecting the huge amount of non-useful work it takes to cultivate one. Peacock tail style; if he can maintain a huge territory and keep all the conflicts smoothed between the vampires who live there, he must be a particularly good diplomat.

                          Anyway, I've gone through and shortened the "dialogue" in that section. Really, the most egregious example is "folds in a towel" asking "Do you know where I might get information about nearby Americans" so I elaborated a bit and reduced the sentence length:

                          > William folded a striped towel.  Do you have information about nearby Americans? Asked the angles of the creases and the minor movements of his fingertips.

                          \* I know by distilling things down like this, we get something that is not "ordinary english" and so  has more entropy than 10 bits per word.

        Have the plague be something for which vampires aren’t actually intentionally infected, but as a side effect. Like a parasite (mustn’t be particularly relevant) that as part of its lifecycle goes through three different hosts: A, B, C. Let’s say C is the primary host in which the parasite reaches (sexual) maturity. B is a required intermediary host, and A is also a required host. Let’s say primates are an intermediary host. Relevant and important for the lifecycle of the parasite, but not *that* important from the parasite’s point of view. To add insult to injury, let’s say the primary and for reproduction relevant host are rats or something equally ubiquitous at the time. Ideally some organism that became widespread at the time, but was only local before (to account for the lack of ‘plague’ before that time).

        Since humans *are* primates and vampires are arguably human, they also get infected often enough. Now in regular primates the immune systems is tricked or some such so that the parasite can complete its stage and pass through the organism without too much damage (hopefully), but what if the vampire nanites dealt with the parasite swiftly, but due to unique markers and proteins in that parasite an apoptosis or delayed self-destruct program is triggered in them? The cascade may take some time to propagate through the body (i.e. sickness symptoms as nanites shut down throughout the body), but will eventually succeed and be fatal.

        That way you can have a ‘plague’ that was uniquely deadly to vampires, but only them. Regular humans would be carriers of the parasite and vampires might infect themselves by drinking an infected’s blood (up to you, as long as you stay consistent). An upside/downside to this is you establish proteins/markers as one way of communicating with the nanites. Maybe only to trigger present programs, but still.

    First question I would like to ask. Why does the war have to have a reasonable reason? Does it affect the story if they did? If the guy must have a reasonable reason, say the main character worked for them and you are trying prevent the negative associations of having worked for a murderous bastard, may I suggest considering how many vampires ate people and did how many people they hurt or killed. If the number is high enough you might be able to portray them positively. However, you should consider multiple perspectives seriously as if you attempt to suggest they were totally justified your reader might complain. In addition, I can say from a previous attempt at asking, that a vampire who must kill once a month and cannot avoid it which is much higher that your story would find sustainable, still has people saying that it is still not okay to kill them on principle so you might have some difficulty managing to persuade people he was a saint, but if you do it right you should be able to convince people he might have had a reason.

    Why not both? War, immediately followed by plague. Double-whammy, and suddenly, all the vampires are gone. Or perhaps a sequence of events even more complicated.
