  It would take infinite energy to lift the clown's infinite handkerchief chain though... Unless it's from some sorta pocket dimension. Then you'd be better off just using it for kindling. Construct a high-speed extraction mechanism, feed tons of cotton to a gasifier, make clean syngas, use it for Fischer-Tropsch fuel/chemical production.

    The clown ain't infinitely heavy, so apparently it is in a pocket d right?
    ```

    Perhaps, because it is specified that a clown must be up there, "infinite" is not a quality of the handkerchief chain itself, but a quality of any handkerchief which is pulled out of something by a clown. 

    Until the clown begins to pull out the handkerchief chain it is finite, and so it requires only a finite amount of energy to lift.

    His wife's reactions are always the best.
