## [MK][D] Star Trek Munchkinery

### Post:

If you were to wake up as an admiral during stardate 47941.7 (the penultimate episode of next gen), how and how badly would you break the trekverse?
In the interest of limiting future knowledge, I'm just going to call both voyager and DS9 not cannon.

  There are so many things that I would need the answers to:

  * Why can't transporters be used for creating perfect duplicates of people, given what happened to Riker?
  * Why can't replicators make living things?
  * Why isn't artificial intelligence in widespread use, given the demonstrated capabilities of the holodeck?
  * What's preventing whole brain uploading and/or simulation?
  * How does time travel actually work?

  It might be that these questions have sensible answers, but in the show, it's all sort of glossed over. The Trekverse seems like it has all the foundational technologies necessary to create a transhumanist society, yet that just hasn't happened. And not just in the Federation - in nearly every other civilization that they come in contact with. Why?

      Sure, but that means that it's pretty much impossible to know what you can and can't do in the universe. The way the writers wrote the show was literally to just insert the word "tech" into the script and have someone fill in the appropriate bullshit later. The whole thing makes no sense, and asking how to exploit it is never going to produce a worthwhile answer, because the answer is probably just, "We can't tech because the tech." I *like* Star Trek, but the technobabble makes no sense, and trying to make sense of it - let alone exploit it - seems like a fool's errand.

        I like to think of the Star Trek's tech more in the terms /u/DaystarEld used for his Pokmon: Origin of Species work.

        You *can't* explain how a pokeball works, but you can give it hard rules that fit within the established cannon that would allow one to extrapolate how such technology could theoretically be utilized for greatest munchikiny effect.

      I have an idea borrowed from a combination of Charles Stross's Eschaton novels and a Buffy the Vampire Slayer crossover with SG-1 that turned into a star trek fusion fic (can't remember name).

      * In original timeline, it follows real world history up to a future singularity.

      * Advanced AI/uploads retroactively spread humans backwards in time and across space (resulting in Klingons, Vulcans, and all the near human people that they run across exploring)

      * Advanced AI/uploads becomes/joins with/retroactively is the Q continumm.

      * History gets altered in the process, history now fits history given in show (including stuff like the Eugenics Wars)

      * The very top most elite of starfleet, and probably most of the smarter vulcans (because they are not straw vulcans in head canon universe) are aware of the true history of reality.  Because of reasons (probably because they consider the true knowledge dangerous) they spread alternate stories about convergent evolution and such.

      * This very top elite has also decided that AI, life-extension, genetic enhancement, self-replicating technology, and other such things are all too dangerous to experiment with and suppress the technological development. Because things are already close to a post-scarcity state and there is centralized control they can get away with this.

      > * What's preventing whole brain uploading and/or simulation?

      All of these things are possible but are suppressed or are known but considered taboo.  The top elite with vague knowledge of the disaster of the singularity are responsible for this.

    Okay

    Riker duplication happened because of interference from the planet's atmosphere, only known to happen on one planet in all of known space, and then only once every several years, and on top of that it was a fluke. Even if sentient duplication wasnt politically toxic and taboo, you try studying a poorly understood natural phenomenon you only get to see about once a decade.

    I don't have a canonical response, I'm sure its not a cultural restriction, but I imagine there are many more states in which a piece of matter is dead than in which its alive. This might reduce it to just limitations in the technology - we already know that the transporter buffer has to be disproportionately huge to hold all the information of a life form, and that isn't even digitised information.

    Holodeck programs aren't sentient? Unless you're talking about The Doctor, who spent months to years running constantly on the Federations most advanced computers. The lack of common sentient holograms is just because the shows are set prior/during their first appearance.

    Nothing prevents whole brain uploading, it happens, its not common, the closest I can see to a canonical reason is that for some reason the field of robotics isn't very advanced, and man-portable computers capable of running a sentient mind are still limited by the technology (exception: data, who was once the target of a mind upload) generally there's social resistance to the idea in pretty much every culture, except where there isn't, where it happens (eg the binars).

    Time travel... Weeeeeell... Its clear from having FTL at all that they don't live in our universe, and their universe has either no or modified relativity. Let's say it works via modified relativity :p

      The world of *Star Trek* is just really, really sloppily built, in part because it's the result of several decades and hundreds writers who were working against a deadline and much of the time, only really cared about putting out a standalone episode. I understand much of the canon "logic" for why we never see any technological progress, and *some* of why the obvious transhumanist stuff never happens, but I also think it's stupid.

      Take the replicators, for example. They seem to have no problem making a medium-rare steak or a cup of hot Earl Grey tea. Yet they can't make living things. This despite the fact that it's claimed that replicators use a variant of the transporter technology, which certainly *can* transport living things. The Doyalist explanation for this is that being able to make a copy of a person at will breaks the whole universe wide open. The Watsonian explanation ... well, it somehow has to account for the fact that replicators can make a steak, with all the animal cells that implies, or the molecules of bergamot oil in Earl Grey, or any number of things that they obviously can and do make on a routine basis, but *at the same time* can't make living things (except for the one or two times that they do).

      The problem is that the writers wanted the "cool factor" of being able to create food on demand, or create an impostor of Picard, but didn't want their universe to have to become truly alien to the viewer. After all, if it were possible to make a copy of a person (either through transporter hackery or using a replicator) there wouldn't really be a reason for every warship not to have the best possible crew. Vital personnel would be cloned a hundred times over so that their skills and knowledge would never be lost. You can talk about social taboos, but those same taboos have to apply to all the other local cultures (and everyone capable of engineering the proper technology) so that a species doesn't just fork bomb and dominate their opponents. And in fact, the threat of facing a civilization that has mastered the creation of duplicates should be so great that research into making duplicates of personnel should be a top research priority - but there's no indication that this is the case.

      And you can't tell me that the field of robotics isn't very advanced when they have frickin' Data walking around. That *just makes no sense*. I can *maybe* accept that robots are impractical for most things given the existence of replicators, force fields, transporters, etc., but there's no way that Data gets made without some advanced robotic underlying technology. That strains my credulity to the breaking point.

      **tl;dr** The problem of *Star Trek* is that they wanted a lot of cool things without the consequences of those cool things.

        I don't disagree that the writing was oftne unnecessarily sloppy and at times insane and inconsistent (warp ten lizards o_o). But I never had a problem with any of the technologies that came straight from TNG's premise.

        E.g. I'm quite happy to believe a machine could make something that I will think tastes like monkey brain, but lacks the technological sophistication to make an actual functional monkey brain, with an active mind running on it. I won't credit a replicator with godlike fabrication powers just because it feeds me.

        Aside: I always thought that Star Trek's worst crimes against plausibility were done by individual writers on a budget, which accrued over its long run, rather than because the show had a philosophy of "Who cares, [insert science]". I never faulted it for having things like TECH in the original script, because its obvious those poor TECH writers were really putting their heart into it, just compare the TNG technobabble to Abrams Trek technobabble - TNG had much higher quality babble.

  Take a combadge. Go back in time. Drop it on IBM. Go back to the future.

  Pick up a new and improved combadge. Go back in time. Drop it on IBM. Go back to the future.

  Pick up a new and improved combadge. This one is also a personal teleporter. Go back in time. Drop it on IBM. Go back to the future.

  Pick up a new and improved combadge. This one is also a chronoporter. Send it back in time to IBM from where you stand in the future. This completes a stable time loop.

  All science is now complete. Your combadge is omnipotent. You are now Q.

  It's worth noting that rational!Star Trek has been done, and it was called [Three Worlds Collide](http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/). Still, it'd be really cool to see a version closer to canon.

  Anyway, since you ask, I'd get people to research the Augments. Yes, they *are* unFriendly and mildly superintelligent, but it seems extremely likely that they can be fixed or at least pointed at the enemy in some fashion.

  Also, the Borg are idiots, so find them and steal their tech (while suppressing the hive-mind neural interface stuff so we don't end up turning into them.)

  Finally, standing order to all starships that whenever you encounter a godlike superbeing that can kill us all with a thought, see about persuading them to disable all our enemies' weapons or something. Worked well enough with the Klingons. It's such a waste to *just* survive these encounters, you know?

  EDIT: Oh, hey, depending on how canon the Abrahms verse is here; ask S31 why the heck they're suppressing super-Transporters (via hologram telepresence so they won't assassinate me for Knowing Too Much, I bet they'd do that.)

  Whenever a main character really needs to be able to detect cloaked ships, they manage it pretty quickly. I'd have a team of engineers go through the list of known methods and build a sensor array that does that by default. And preferably a torpedo-sized sensor array that does the same things. And put them everywhere.

  If you'd counted DS9, in one of the episodes that bothered me most, an away team discovered the survivors of a crashed ship who were trapped by a portable technology-neutralizing device. After that moment, the Borg were no longer a threat in the ST universe. They simply became a convenient source of technology to reverse engineer.

    Why stop there?  Do this with all the teching the tech solutions that have ever been used.

    I would assemble a database of all the jury-rigs (teching the tech) used in all the past episodes.  I would have the crew train to apply each of these jury rigs quickly and effectively.  When possible, I would have them permanently modify or add on modified sections to the ship to do all the tricky things that get them out of trouble.  Then instead of rushing to fix things in a dramatic manner, my crew would just pull out one of the known jury-rigs and have it ready to go.

      Of course; I just wasn't up to looking for examples. So I provided a few off the top of my head that gave the Federation the ability to dominate the Borg, Romulans, and Klingons. For an admiral, I'd think that would be enough to earn me a nice long vacation on Risa.
