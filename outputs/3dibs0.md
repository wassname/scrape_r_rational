## Huge logical miss I've never seen addressed in Luminosity/Radiance (spoilers everything)

### Post:

I've just finished reading Radiance, which I started right after Luminosity, and, leaving aside my HUGE critique to the lack of rationality of the fiction after Bella was transformed (but that's way too long and I need to gather my thoughts before making a full write up of that), there is one specific thing that bothered me greatly through the whole story:

Why did NOBODY bring up the superiority of the species argument? Specifically, Bella, is obsessed in protecting humans, yet despite multiple references to Vampires as species, NOBODY, not even those who consider humans as only food ever brought to her the extremely simple arguments that Vampires are an evolution (=upgrade) of humans, and since they are as superior to humans as humans are to apes, and since they are the predator that predates on humans, there is no point in worrying about killing humans, aside from the fact that humans could be dangerous to vampires if fully in the known.

The "you can't transform humans who are mates to you" was really disappointing as well, since it gave more priority to the inferior species rather than the species she's part of, in a matter that's absolutely critical to a vampire's well-being.

Did I miss something, or Luminance/Radiance really has no place being compared to HPMOR or other rational stories?

  In what morality is it OK to kill something solely because you are superior to it? You mention apes specifically and there is already a large debate about whether apes should be given the rights and protections of personhood (same thing with dolphins). Even with less intelligent animals, there are people who believe killing them is morally wrong (vegetarians).

  While I personally think it's ok to kill some of the less sapient animals as long as it's done humanely, any species that has sapience, regardless of how much, should not be killed unless the relative gains are enormous. Since vampires don't need to eat humans, and humans have sapience (regardless if whether or not vampires are "superior") it is obvious that the correct moral choice is to not eat them.

  It prioritizes choice over forcing upgrades upon people. This is a longstanding moral debate, one addressed in the story, but our society as a whole maintains that forcing invasive changes upon a person against their will is generally wrong, despite its perks. Doctors have lost their license over less.

  ...your argument is so far removed from anything I consider *relevant*, that I'm having trouble figuring out where to begin picking at it. It just touches on nothing that would motivate Bella (or any of the 'vegetarian' vampires, or me).

  >  since [vampires] are as superior to humans as humans are to apes

  What definition of "superior" are you using?  Vampires are stronger, faster, and tougher, but they don't seem to think better.  To the extent that we are superior to apes it's due to superior intelligence, not improved physical abilities.  

  On a separate subject -- it's been a long time since I read those stories, but the way I remember it is that vampires can't reproduce physically, they can only (a) convert a human or (b) have a kid with a human, and the latter is a very high-risk option that will almost certainly kill the mother and will get some of the most powerful vampires angry at you.  Am I remembering that right?  

  [1] A few vampire also have special psychic powers, but that's supposedly a very small percentage.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    >Re-read the sidebar, Characteristics of Rational Fiction, and show us where you think the story is missing something. That's a fun debate. This isn't. It's just annoying people.

    Oh, I can assure you, I have tons of qualms with those as well, especially the "Nothing happens solely because 'the plot requires it'. If characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason. " rule. 

    The sheer amount of scenes that happened because the plot required it (2nd time Bella was burned, Caius deciding all of a sudden to get rid of Abby, Cody's defection, etc) and Bella holding the idiot ball through situations that any rational character would have resolved or at least attempted to before they exploded (powers development [this is a HUGE one, both on Bella, who had two points at which she realized her powers could do a lot more, yet never actually worked on them except for Jasper's emotional power, and for Elspeth, who in the car just decided to STOP growing her power, completely], Irina's situation, James' hunting and many others I don't remember anymore) is ridiculous.

    As another user said:
    >I think the reason you had to use coincidences is because you made too few changes in the universe. You made Bella smarter and more rational, but everything else, as I see it, is the same. >There was no other way to make life more difficult for the heroes without some major bad luck. I think it would have been better if you altered the universe to be a harder challenge for Bella's wit; made the Volturi smarter, changed some of the laws, introduced new elements - whatever.

    https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2gq4r6/rst_rationalistgenredefining_classics_luminosity/

    The enemies kept holding the idiot ball, so it was necessary for Bella to do the same, otherwise the plot wouldn't have developed how it was supposed to...

    But anyway, that's another discussion for another day (probably never, as I'm starting to read more and more critical reviews and I guess from now on I'll just link those when someone recommends Luminosity/Radiance).

        You have misunderstood and you haven't. I wanted to have the discussion on why the "Vampire uber alles" argument was never brought to Bella's attention, not on whether the argument itself is right. It just felt like a huge glaring miss on a story that was supposed to be rational but had such a heavy undertone of "vegetarian good, meat-eater is bad and stupid".

          It might not have happened directly on-screen, but it definitely *happened*. "Human Rights" was one of the big controversies that her, I guess you could call it her political party, was centered around. From not eating humans, to respecting their lives, property, and free will. The story goes into detail on how most vampires don't consider humans to be "people", and the many ways that played out. Bella definitely had heard both sides of the argument - that's what the whole bloody revolution was *about*. She undoubtedly had hangers-on trying to convince her otherwise.
          ```

- u/eaglejarl:
  ```
  Just to step back...is this a fair statement of your position?

  "No one ever said to Bella 'we should be allowed to eat humans because we are superior to them.'  Because no one ever said this,  Luminosity and Radiance are not rational."
  ```

- u/None:

  > Why did NOBODY bring up the superiority of the species argument?

  Superiority on what terms? If you merely mean that vampires can kill humans easily, that's not an argument worth considering. It would work just as well for ebola! A century ago, it would apply to measles, and nobody's sad that we eradicated measles!

  The interpretation I could agree with is that people have reasonable cause to prefer to be vampires rather than humans -- you get a better memory, you maybe become smarter (at least, you can read and type much faster, which is smarter on one axis), you don't age, you're more durable, you're stronger, and your senses are better. Plus the whole mate thing is convenient, in a way. The thirst is a nontrivial downside, naturally, and since it's slaked primarily by killing sentient beings, you might hesitate or choose not to turn.

  > there is no point in worrying about killing humans

  The general thrust of your argument seems to be: people would often prefer to live as vampires than to live as humans, therefore we should let vampires kill as many humans as they want. That's a complete non sequitur. You may as well say that the uber wealthy should be able to hunt humans for sport because most humans would rather be wealthy than poor. This is the exact opposite of rationality. The two concepts are entirely unrelated.

  If instead your argument were that *you* personally didn't care about humans and you did care about vampire freedom and autonomy, therefore you are fine with vampires eating people...that is rational, but it's not compelling to any moral person.

  > Did I miss something, or Luminance/Radiance really has no place being compared to HPMOR or other rational stories?

  Luminosity. Get the title right.

  You missed any shred of human decency. The Golden Empire was founded on human decency (well, and killing a lot of Volturi, and being able to trap vampires in essentially a prison world).

  Before that, nobody has encountered a non-human diet outside the Denali and Cullen covens. Those two covens are non-judgmental and do not proselytize. We don't see extended interaction between non-humanivore and humanivore vampires for the most part, and when we do, it's focused on defeating the Volturi. There are literally only a dozen vampires in the world who care about humans and think they're people. The thought of eating animals rather than humans is too bizarre and not well publicized enough for people to come up with objections. It's all "you can try your outlandish diet, I expect you to die from it, and I'm just going to steer clear in case it turns you into a ravening beast."

  Normal people don't just hear a bizarre idea and immediately treat it seriously and try to come up with objections. And in this case, it only takes a few seconds to get to a basic value mismatch, which lets you dismiss the other person's attempts to persuade you (if they're even trying) without further debate.

  However, since the books end with an authority mandating strict non-humanivore behavior with the ability to enforce that mandate, if the books continued a bit longer, we would see people petitioning the Golden Throne with bullshit arguments like the one you put forward.

  I looked at your comment history. Are you sure your real objection isn't that the books were written by a woman? Considering you post in /r/theredpill, plus the stuff you wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/3cz8nb/comiccon_women_tired_of_groping_geeks_and/ct0ncpv), plus [apparently you think even 4chan is too feminist for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3bzlup/google_trends_reddit_alternative/csrvqvj) -- that doesn't mean for certain that you'd be dismissive of a work simply because a woman wrote it, but it's pretty damning.
