  The bribery issue.

  http://blogs.worldbank.org/futuredevelopment/six-strategies-fight-corruption

  There are dual issues here. We want elected officials to avoid being bribed by criminals and other billionaires, but we also want to control them to ensure our laws are carried out. 

  1. ~~We can pay them better, but this gives them resistance to our bribery too. How about a bonus scheme/ sideways promotion scheme decided by the leadership? A general rise in pay, but more controlled. If we can get relative control of those at the upper levels via political manoeuvring and legal bribes we could encourage them to have a bonus scheme that rewarded loyalty, thus insulating them from cheap bribes and allowing us better control over who they accepted bribes from. Encourage internal infighting for increased pay, not seeking bribes from the outside, and a clear threat of demotion if someone behaves inappropriately that we could legally push with our contacts. Something for internal affairs to attack.~~ in another post I noted what works. Bribery occurs heavily because people feel political careers are insecure and they need to grab what cash they can. Encourage long term stable political careers, where an honest person can rise in pay and a dishonest person will face a social stigma and a loss of their job if they're found to be corrupt. Encourage long term thinking.

  2. Better transparency. We need a well funded press that's protected from violence to ensure corrupt and evil schemes get exposed. It'd be good to seek out contacts in the press, research with them what could be done to strengthen them. Campaign donations and bribes for the rich should be easier to conceal than bribes to the poor so this shouldn't have too much exposure risk.

  3. Cutting red tape. We want certain rules and regulations. If slumlords are ignoring fire regulations that's bad. But if companies are blocking people from making new companies that could challenge them via legal challenges that's also bad. We need to use our media contacts and study the bureaucratic burden of various rules in terms of cost, time taken and openness of whatever criteria are used to say yes or no, whether the rules are in clear English. After this some sort of powerful task force should be established with in house inspections and the ability to fine people and close businesses to ensure whatever rules are carried out, again with careful use of charity.

  4. Reducing poorly used subsidies. We need our statisticians to analyze where government money is going. If it's going mostly to the rich then it's probably being misallocated, and we should seek to change that. For that we need to find out the budget.

  5. Public education of people about their legal rights. We need people to know what rights they have under the system so that people can't enforce crazy laws by just blustering their way through and there is public demand for changes in crazy laws. This again needs control over the media. Perhaps our radio program could aid that? If we could give people household radios or have public broadcasting areas we could educate them about appropriate matters and their rights simply by educating comedians and actors and encouraging them to talk about the issues. On this, we should also see to find the best radio spectrum for broadcasting such things, and seek legal control over it.

  6. Internal affairs. https://www.aclu-nj.org/theissues/policepractices/crisis-continues-inside-police-internal-affairs/ "“The average citizen encounters numerous obstacles to registering
  a complaint. Finding information about how to file a complaint is an
  immediate barrier. Then, contrary to the law, many police departments
  insist that complaints be submitted in person and that juveniles cannot
  file reports without a parent present. Most departments surveyed are not
  able to accommodate non-English speakers. Many said they would report
  complainants who were undocumented to U.S. Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (ICE). Police employees who fielded our calls too often
  took on a tone of hostility or defensiveness. These and other obstacles
  discourage community members from lodging complaints against
  police officers.”" We need to research their access to the public, whether people can anonymously report issues, whether they allow third party complaints, whether they allowed minors, whether they allowed immigrants or people of certain races to report. We need to address any of those issues. We then need to ensure they have strong powers to punish people and do so in a transparent manner. Do they have backing from the local government if they do try to fire a police officer? Is there any civilian oversight?

  The civil forfeiture issue.

  Popular among police, the basic idea is that if something is involved with a crime then the police can seize that because there's a crime involved. You can seize the drug plane of someone smuggling drugs even if the owner is in another country and thus can't be taken to trial.

  The problem with this is that if you make it not based on a vigilante smashing things up but based off the police doing it they may use it as an excuse to loot the poor who can't complain and get rich.

  Studies on asset forfeiture have often shown that this is what happens. Rather than confiscating the factory that's used to push drugs and illegal weapons into cities low and mid level dealers are targetted, along with many innocents who can't easily say no.

  If he does this wrong he'll make the police into another gang with the legal right to steal from the poor.

  As such, he should have several requirements.

  1. Proceeds of seizure don't go to police, they go to education, charity, positive causes, whatever.

  2. There is a reasonable standard of evidence that whatever property is being used for criminal purposes, and a minimum limit on the value of that property, ideally connected with a criminal conviction. You can't just take property based on a suspicion it's being used for crime.

  3. Open and transparant procedures to get property unseized and to detail why property was seized.

    Maybe make those charities / other causes be specifically related to fixing poverty, &c. 

    Also, the charities need to be audited.
    ```

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      Yeah, sounds good. Stuff like funding schools, making houses for the poor, making jobs for the poor, all with auditing. I'm not too fussy on exactly what they do, the other option was just smashing them up, so long as they have a vaguely positive impact.

      You could have the local community vote on what is done with them. That would give them an incentive to turn in crime bosses. Reveal their crimes, your neighborhood gets a new school/ church/ factory/ bar/ apartment.

  I fear that with the trend of this quest being focused on politics, economics, sociology, crime and morality on a large scale it doesn't really lend itself well for purely rational discourse and decision making. Too many topics with nothing akin to scientific consensus in sight. And all that with a main character who isn't really constrained by any rules that need rational workarounds. Not to mention that the consequences of our actions have to then be judged by one or two persons (the writer plus anyone who helps him on his side) who, probably not being an expert on all of these subjects at once, can't really be completely objective and will thus lead to rather large scale polarization whenever a plan goes wrong for reasons that people don't "believe" in. Not to mention that I have no idea where the data of our statisticians to be hired and such is supposed to come from.

  I'll continue following this but I hope that issues become more small scale and "Batman-y" instead of just "A filthy rich man with many skills in a corrupt city" + the occasional supernatural event.

  I did some research on legal systems.

  Historically, a lot of people have had rather crappy laws and then as such have adopted roman or british laws to improve their own systems. From a study called The causes of corruption: a cross-national study by Treisman, he noted that local laws tend to be written up at the behest of local governments, and as such, tend to have a low respect for property laws. The government is free to seize houses and such for its own corrupt goals. Some points of note.

  "First, I replicate in this dataset the findings of La Porta
  et al. (1999) that countries with Protestant traditions and those with more
  developed economies have higher quality governments."

  "hird, federal states
  were more ‘corrupt’ than unitary ones, presumably because the competition
  between autonomous levels of government to extract bribes leads to ‘overgrazing
  of the commons’."

  "Fourth, while the current degree of democracy was not
  significant, a long period of exposure to democracy was."

  "La Porta et al. have argued
  that common law systems (found mostly in Britain and its former colonies) differ
  on this dimension from civil law systems (found mostly in continental Europe and
  its former colonies). Whereas the common law tradition developed first in England
  to some extent as a defense of parliament and property owners against the attempts
  by the sovereign to regulate and expropriate them, civil law systems in their
  Napoleonic, Bismarckian, or other forms developed more as an instrument used by
  the sovereign for state building and controlling economic life (David and Brierly,
  1985; La Porta et al., 1999). Common law developed from precedents established
  by judges, usually allied with the property-owning aristocracy against the Crown,
  while civil law developed from codes drawn up by jurists at the sovereign’s
  bidding. They hypothesize that the greater protections of property against the state
  embodied in common law systems improve various aspects of government
  performance, including reducing corruption"

  "In Britain and some of its former colonies, scholars have noted an
  almost obsessive focus on the procedural aspects of law. In Eckstein’s words,
  ‘‘The British . . . behave like ideologists in regard to rules and like pragmatists in
  regard to policies. Procedures, to them, are not merely procedures, but sacred
  rituals’’ (Eckstein, 1966, p. 265). By contrast, in many other cultures social order
  is associated not so much with adherence to procedures as with respect for
  hierarchy and the authority of offices."

  "A willingness of judges to follow procedures even when
  the results threaten hierarchy — to side with Dreyfus against the Army — clearly
  increases the chance that official corruption will be exposed."

  "Where more ‘hierarchical religions’ — Catholicism,
  Eastern Orthodoxy, Islam — dominate, challenges to office-holders might be rarer
  than in cultures shaped by more egalitarian or individualistic religions, such as
  Protestantism. 4 Religions may also influence how individuals view their loyalties
  to family as opposed to other citizens — what Edward Banfield has called
  ‘familism’ — which, in turn, may affect the level of nepotism"

  "In religious traditions such as Protestantism, which arose in some
  versions as dissenting sects opposed to the state-sponsored religion, institutions of
  the church may play a role in monitoring and denouncing abuses by state officials.
  In other traditions — such as Islam — where church and state hierarchies are
  closely intertwined, such a role may be absent."

  "For a number of reasons, the risk of exposure may also be higher in more
  democratic, open political systems. 5 Freedom of association and of the press
  engender public interest groups and reporters with a mission and the right to
  expose abuses."

  "The cost this entails depends upon the
  benefits provided by that job — the level of salaries in public office — and the
  length of time for which an honest official could expect to enjoy them (Becker and
  Stigler, 1974; Ul Haque and Sahay, 1996; Van Rijckeghem and Weder, 1997;
  World Bank, 1997). A high degree of political stability will lengthen officials’
  time horizon, while a bureaucracy that offers long-term careers with chances of
  advancement will promise greater future benefit to a low-level bureaucrat than one
  in which jobs are more insecure and promotion less likely"

  So conclusions from this. 

  1. Seek to import the british legal system and replace some of the more insane laws, with a special focus on property rights.

  2. Meet up with protestants and catholic dissidents in gotham. If they can be strengthened then they can serve as a valuable way to encourage a good work ethic and challenge the corruption of organized government and religion. 

  3. Encourage freedom of the press to expose crimes.

  4. Encourage a legal culture where procedure is held to be sacred above hierarchy. If the law says someone is bad that should be more important than political pressure from above.

  5. Encourage a stable political system where a career in politics is long, advances with time spent in there, there's a strong social stigma against bribery, and that advancement within it is very possible, as opposed to an unstable one where people need to grab what cash they can.

    This seems to indicate that the common law system is somehow better than the civil law system in fending off corruption. Yet a look at the [Corruption Perception Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index) combined with [one](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Legal_System_Detailed_Map.pdf/page1-1280px-Legal_System_Detailed_Map.pdf.jpg) of the various [maps](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:LegalSystemsOfTheWorldMap.png) showing the [world](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Map_of_the_Legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png)'s [legal systems](http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/images/lib/Mod6_Chap3_Fig3A.jpg) doesn't seem to indicate any such trend.

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      I'm not sure I can read any such trend, one way or the other, from maps on the internet. The paper noted they'd done a study and found less corruption. British legal culture was found to be better than common laws.

      - u/Bowbreaker:

        To say it differently, according to [transparency.org 2014](http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/results) 11 out of the ~~17~~ 19* best scoring countries don't have a law system based on common law. In the top 10 only the second and tenth places do. This may be confirmation bias but coupled with my own limited knowledge and experience I see no reason to believe that civil law somehow leads to more corruption and I dispute any claim that that single paper should be enough evidence to convince anyone otherwise.

        If of course you have other evidence to support the superiority of common law when it comes to decreasing corruption or instead can dispute the legitimacy of Transparency International's methods in a convincing fashion then I'll rethink my stance. As I said my opinion may be partially based on a bias of mine that comes from comparing the US and British legal systems with the other few European legal systems I have any knowledge on (which is mostly but not exclusively Germany).

          And note, at no point did I say that common law tended to make for superior legal systems. 

          "What they appear to suggest is that countries with both common law and a period
          of British rule probably have lower perceived corruption; those with just British
          heritage but no common law may also have lower perceived corruption; but that424
          D . Treisman / Journal of Public Economics 76 (2000) 399 – 457
          countries with just common law but no period of British rule have higher

                Is this supposed to be some form of sarcasm?

                I know that common law was developed in and propagated by England but I don't know how those two points you highlighted in your quote ameliorate my issues. I saw them the first time too.

                But maybe you just didn't get what I was trying to say as I also only highlighted some text. I seem to have been mistaken in the assumption that my previous comments provided enough context. I'll try to remedy that.

                >**differ on this dimension**

                I interpreted this as the dimension in question being corruption in government. Now that I think about it this may be a false assumption as the quote may be partially out of context. If that is the case then what was meant by "this dimension"?

                If it actually is corruption that is being talked about then you must understand how it reads as if common law systems somehow differ in corruption level from civil law systems.

                >They hypothesize that the greater protections of property against the state embodied in common law systems improve various aspects of government performance, including reducing corruption"

                I assume that "They" are David and Brierly? What I understood from the sentence quoted above (in context with the rest of the same paragraph) is that common law (and its supposed greater protection of property rights) is better at reducing corruption than civil law. After all the whole paragraph goes on and on about the differences in development of those two particular systems and then concludes with a sentence on how one of the to systems has positive outcomes because of how a particular aspect is *'greater'*.

                I have to admit that I kind of missed the part where the particular paper you quote only *mentions* that *another* paper hypothesizes such a thing while making no judgment or hypothesis on its own. On the other hand why would you quote that particular paragraph if not in support of British common law?

                I hope all this sheds more light on my reservations.

                  Common law in places that are Britain and its former colonies. 

                  I'm not sure how many ways I can state this. I have, and always have been saying that the paper said that places that are or were british and had common law had lower perceived corruption on average, not that everywhere that exists anywhere and has common law has lower corruption. Until you understand that this is the view I have I see little point in continuing.
