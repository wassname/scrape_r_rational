  Very battle-y chapter. I wonder if Cat is falling into her trap, ie too many losses for her goals.

    Certainly feels that way. Summer on the field is killing more than being killed. They'll lose eventually, but at this rate Cat's forces will be significantly weakened by the time the Summer Queen shows up.

      The Fae have inferior numbers though, as well as superior troops, so to some extent losing more than they do is going to be both unavoidable and acceptable.
