  ```
  Reading this chapter brought home how cliche everything is.

  > Ratbiter was getting a little old as well, he thought. The days where the destrier dutifully trampled whoever was in his way would soon be over. Tossing away the rest of the bread and washing away the taste with water, Klaus affectionately slapped the animal’s neck.

  > “We’ve still got another few in us, don’t we old boy?” the greying general said.

  > The horse whinnied and the prince smiled grimly.

  It feels like you can find variants of this scene in almost every fantasy novel - old man talking to faithful animal companion just before a big battle. 

  But somehow the author makes it work.
