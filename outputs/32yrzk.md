## [BST][Q][D] How to balance a language of creation/words of power/speech of magic system?

### Post:

Hello, I've been having a thought jostle around in my head for a while now that there might be a really interesting story in magic systems that work off literal words of power, sentences etc.

I always love spells that work off of the statements of the words in the spell. "No Living Man May Hinder Me" is a favorite of mine.

But if there is a language of magic that got me thinking what's it like if your native speech is literally the words of power that can shape the firmament of reality?

And if that's one language how do other beings deal with that being part of the world?

It seems like this could rapidly spiral away and get out of hand so I was curious what various people's thoughts are on keeping the flavor of saying "That house is on fire" and so it happens because everything said in the speech is true.

And actually have a world where individuals can be rational and the power acceleration is not too insane.

  My first thought is that if you want to make an actual language like that, you're going to have to kneecap it a whole lot so that it's not broken right out the gate. I don't mean kneecapping the ability to impose words on reality, I mean making changes to the language itself so that you can limit how it expresses itself.

  Múra-Pirahã is an indigenous language from Brazil. If you believe all the claims about it:

  * There are no words for numbers, and only two words for quantity which correspond to "a few" and "many".
  * There are no words for color, only words for "light" and "dark".
  * There is no distinction between singular and plural.
  * It's impossible to be ambiguous about how you came by information. You can't say "Betty shots herself in the head", you have to say something like "I see Betty shots herself in the head" or "Someone tells me Betty shots herself in the head" or "I deduce that Betty shot herself in the head".
  * No recursive sentences.

  Anyway, this is a stripped down language - about as stripped down as anyone has ever found. You'd want to make your magic language into something like that, lacking a number of words that would break the magic wide open and accelerate it into being nonsensical. You can add in some other things like the Hopi language's (supposed) lack of a past or present tense.

  That's just a first stab at how you'd have to constrain it if you wanted a good story. You might try a different tack, like having an unknown language that gets discovered slowly by the protagonist and delivers creeping power in that way, but I don't think that you'll get much mileage out of simply having a language that absolutely enforces its truth on reality.

    Paring down does seem like it could help a lot, and would even give a good reason for why learning some other language is valuable. But at the same time quite possibly very confusing if your used to speaking in words of power.

    Another thing that I thought would be useful is the whole 'unintended interpretation' rule that seems to always plague prophetic statements of immortality. In other words the language is not necessarily solidly concrete as you would expect and so it has a lot open to interpretation and thus the precision is not really there to control results unless you construct a kind of epic poem that has to layer the more noisy possibilities up over one another until you can get something that consistently does what you want.
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      The language could be impossible to learn as a child, so that no one is ever actually fluent in it without great practice.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      There are parallels between what you're wanting and programming languages. If you could construct it so that the language is recognizable by a finite automaton, you'll have a "kneecapped" language akin to what AW is getting at. See here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language
      ```

      - u/Nighzmarquls:
        ```
        I think my programmer background was leaking through there. But Ideally I was hoping for something not quite as dry or limited as most languages I've used.

          Programming is still a great parallel: the elderich ill-logic that makes mages mad is well expressed (here.)[http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks]  Moreso the word for anything complicated might have to be something the mage forms, not something passed down but an template (object) he forms from primitives.
          ```

    >no recursive sentences

    What's an example of such a sentence in English?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      "Jane thinks dogs are dangerous."

      So in Muran, you can't actually say that. You can say "dogs are dangerous", but you can't have a sentence nested within another sentence like that. English can do this to arbitrary degrees - "Jane thought Fred said Mary had proven dogs are dangerous."

      Edit: I should note that this, like a number of features of Piraha, is incredibly contentious among linguists. There are only three hundred or so people who speak Piraha, and only a very small handful of academics who study it.
      ```

    > It's impossible to be ambiguous about how you came by information.

    I hadn't heard that alleged about Piraha.  My prior says "Buuuullshiiiit."

      Just to add to this discussion, my cognitive science teacher told his class that ambiguity is an inherent feature in all languages, because to be precise requires including so much information that a random sentence starts to look like a lawyer's contract. Therefore, languages evolved to take the advantage of background information two speakers with a common language have to minimize the amount of necessary information. Any language without ambiguity would be more like a programming language instead of a natural language.

      TL;DR - Ambiguity allows us to say only the needed information for quick communication (1 sentence vs. five paragraphs) and the listener resolves the ambiguity with common background knowledge. Any language without ambiguity is not a natural language.

        Hum, this actually presents an interesting distinction possibility to keep all statements from being 'magic' or at least from being 'physical magic' at least.

        The simpler more vague a statement is the less functionally powerful it is.

        There are still some linguistic mechanisms that will be needed to likely keep it from being to potent but it has a kind of elegance to it .

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    Hum, I love the ramifications answer, thanks for all the thoughts that's really wonderful and I hope it was fun writing it out.

    I really like the more inherent poetry that seems to be suggested by your paradox loopiness.

    I'm thinking maybe people have a kind of 'sense in their mouth' or 'in their mind' of when their approaching a statement that will be dangerous or kill them.
    Also the removal of negation is really a fun culling of language flexibility that I find interesting and it does resolve a lot of things potentially.

    The whimsy of the magic is quite nice and I think you catch onto a really useful thing which is having proper nouns be really sparse and you have to sort of assemble a description instead to target things.

              This reminds me of David Eddings' *Elenium*, where it turns out that magic is literally just requesting miracles from various gods (who get worship out of the deal).  Which leads to some hilarious moments when the Church Knights realize that they've spent years praying to pagan gods, because the "one God" is too stuck up to grant routine powers.

              And importantly, people the gods *really like* might not have to ask in a dead language with correct grammar to get a result - plain english works, if there's good reason.  And sometimes they get proactive interventions, wanted or not...

  >everything said in the speech is true.

  That could be interesting, if it was literally impossible to speak a lie and attempting it altered reality to match what you said.  

  Some restrictions I'd apply:

  - Altering anything takes energy of some sort, altering too much is dangerous.
  - People don't use past tense.  Altering history takes more energy than they can use, so mistakes are dangerous
  - future tense is discouraged.  You never know when the energy drain from the statement will trigger (eg: "the house will burn down" could trigger at any time before you die or the house is destroyed by other means)
  - declarative sentences only.  "Burn down the house" can't be said in the language, only something like "I want something to burn down the house" (and if you didn't want it before, you do now).
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    Hum, A thought I had after you mentioned tenses is that there is probably a 'range' to the effect of a statement. mainly only what is present and can audibly 'hear' the language can be effected.

    I'm curious if it's possible to make a language that can be used that does not actually contain past or future tense. Or that it can only give future tenses in terms of something like timers of discrete events from now.
    ```

    - u/Sagebrysh:
      ```
      Ah so its almost as if the invocator is commanding whatever material to do what they want. Maybe if you limited it to actual present tense commands. "round rock become a cube" etc
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        I was going for something similar, but not quite like that.  It would be "that rock is a cube" under what I said.

        - u/Chronophilia:
          ```
          The language can't make statements of fact, only issue orders. It seems more correct to translate everything into imperative sentences, but I don't think it makes a difference.
          ```

- u/Solonarv:
  ```
  Since no one's mentioned it yet, I'll throw the *Inheritance* cycle's magic system out there.

   - You do magic by essentially telling magic/the world "throw this rock over there", in the language of magic.
   - The magic does, in some sense, read your mind; you can *say* "throw rock", and the magic will read your mind to figure out which rock you meant and where you want it thrown.
   - If you don't know how to phrase something in the language of magic, you can't do it.
   - Doing something with magic takes as much energy as doing it via normal means. Overexerting yourself *can* kill you.
   - The energy cost also scales up as you go further away. I assume the author put this in mostly for balance reasons.
   - You don't do magic accidentally, so *just* saying "set the door on fire" won't set any doors on fire unless you actively 'tap' your magic. This is something you train.
   - The language of magic is a plain old (*actually* old) language, though it's quite complicated.
   - It is impossible to lie using the language of magic. If you try, you just won't be able to say it.

  There's more to it, but that's pretty major spoilers, so I'll put it in a [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/vCrznGeb).

  Anyone can learn magic, though most people have a very little energy available.

  There's also mental magic, which is rather similar to how Legilimency and Occlumency are described in HPMOR. Any person can learn defense (on a basic level, focusing very hard on a brick wall will do), and I don't quite remember for offense. Battles between mages often turn into quite literal mindgames, because just killing your opponent (by popping a vein or pinching a tiny nerve) is actually quite easy, and MAD is not hard to achieve that way.

  It's been a while since I read the books and I'm rather tired, so I may have missed something. Feel free to point out any mistakes.

    As a point of interest, _Eragon_'s magic system was lifted wholesale from _A Wizard of Earthsea_, although Chris Whatsisname explored some interesting edge cases that Ms Le Guin didn't.  Anyway, AWoE would be good source material to get inspiration from. (It's also a damn fine series.)

      I have read the beginning and end of Geb's career (quite by accident). The shadow thing  that chased him gave me nightmares as a kid.

      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Eragon's elves have something like this. They're living in a post-scarcity society, albeit one that's isolated and slowly stagnating.

  One way to constrain it would be to affect the culture - to prevent contradictions, there's an inborn power hierarchy - Jill's True statement has a rank of 4318, so if she contradicts Jack, whose rank is 4367, her words are implicitly more True by virtue of her birth, and so her statement persists. The *other* way to do would be to make contradictions incredibly dangerous - if Jill says, "That house will always be on fire", and Jack says "That house is not and never will be on fire", the house is both on fire and not on fire. The chain reaction consumes the lifeforce of both invocators and populates the house with Contradictory Flame, which both burns and does not burn down the house. The house is both burnt down and not burnt down, so now it's a Contradictory Zone and liable to drive you insane if you stare at it too long.
  ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    I quite liked how, if you tried this in Eragon, it would drain life from both invocators until one of them ran out (and presumably died). That struck me as being quite an elegant solution.

      It does solve that problem, but only works if you have an "available magic power" stat. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It just seems overused, and a bit contrary to the spirit of What Is Said Is True.

  Things to read:

  1. The *Young Wizards* series.
  2. Anything by David Eddings.

  In the Young Wizards books, anyone can learn the Speech.  Wizards are granted Enacture by various Powers.  The Speech is simply an utterly unambiguous language that was used to describe the universe into existence.  Anyone can use it, including to make untrue statements.  Enacture allows you to repeat the 'description becomes truth' trick *at a cost*.  There are aspects of True Names, more complete descriptions are better, a wizard lying every (in any language) is *very unwise*, etc.  Higher Powers are a core part of the setting, both the benevolent, the unsafe (all of them, really), and That One we don't refer to.  Every culture has a story about it, though.

  David Eddings has written the same story a few times now, and it's almost reverse-fanfic where it gets better each time.  *Eragon*'s magic system is a transparent ripoff of this, just as it uses Pern's dragons and LotR's setting.  Magic allows you to do things, but the cost is energy required to do it without magic.  Draw on too much, and you die.

  General principles:

  * Native speakers will have a reputation for being incredibly twisty.  They're not being sneaky - you just get very very good at omission and meaninglessly precise and qualified statements.
  * Things get a lot easier when you can avoid any statements that have an effect on the universe.
  * It's better to have it rely on the power and knowledge of the speaker than a cosmic listner/atlantean magic engine/etc.  Consider:  "Every human is happy".  Does it work correctly, work incorrectly, throw an error, or do nothing?  What about "This sentence has the best possible effect"?

  You also want to be very precise in definitions.  Does `that house is on fire`

  * Set the house on fire?  This would typically require an imperative phrase...
  * No-op, because it isn't?
  * Never get spoken, unless you believe it to be true?
  * Never get spoken, unless it *is* true?

  Get around the munchkins by having something ironic preempt false statements.  After the first few dozen scientists have premonitions of DOOM/*do not mess with Truth*/heart attacks/labs explode/etc trying to say variations on "$hypothesis is true"... 1.5 bits per human life could deliver some interesting info, but it's not trivial to use.

  One of the magic systems in my novel works like this, but it's very heavily restricted. Some of these points are spoilerish for [Forging Divinity](http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/), so if you're reading that, you may want to avoid reading too much of the stuff below.

  Most of these points have been covered to some extent, but as a game designer, I like to think in bullet points. Maybe some of the ones below will be useful to you. =D

  * Vocabulary. In a world where this is possible, it's possible specific words may not be taught to people because of the power they hold. Other words may be well-known, but illegal to use. 

  * Syntax. It's possible that the language only functions if words are used in a specific order, or that they have different functions based on how they are used within a statement. 

  * The burden of complexity. A system with a lot of hard rules for syntax and restricted word usage is going to be a lot more difficult to optimize. This makes it that much cooler when the protagonists figure out ways to do it anyway, imo. =D

  * Cultural restrictions. I covered this briefly when talking about laws or "secret words", but there are all sorts of reasons why people might not use specific types of magic for cultural reasons. Religion and other superstitions, for example, might make the culture believe there's a reason you shouldn't use specific words, sentences, etc. Even if there aren't explicit laws, there could be organizations that attempt to stop the use of specific types of magic. 

  * A power source. Where does the magic come from? For example, in [Forging Divinity](#s "this particular style of magic relies on finding ancient artifacts and learning how to subvert the power in them. This involves creating a bond with the object to gain access to it, then learning the vocabulary and syntax specific to the object necessary to access its power.")

  * Costs. This is simple enough - what's the cost of using magic? Do people have mana pools? Do different words have different costs? 

  * Limitations on combinations of factors. For example, even if a word for "time" exists, maybe it's impossible to combine it in any way that would allow for time travel. This may be because there's a source of magic that doesn't allow certain hard rules to be broken, other more powerful effects are in place that prevent specific types of magic from being used, etc.

  Edit: As an extra note, in case you weren't already aware, there's a /r/magicbuilding. You might want to check them out! =D

  I'm reminded of "True Name" based systems, where to command a thing you have to know its secret name, and learning those names is a long and arduous task (because, for example, you can't just command *The Ocean* with a single name, and must instead learn the individual True Names for every distinguishable body of water... your power thereby growing as a function of how many names you know).

  More generally, making it somehow difficult or time-consuming to learn the language of power, perhaps to the extent where a lifetime of study/practice will still leave you only knowing a small and specialised subset, would be one way to keep a lid on the power level (and create different 'flavours' of mage depending on what they focussed on learning)

  You might set it up so that the language only takes effect when you *fully* describe the phenomenon, and this is often hard to do. So you can't just say "That house is on fire", because the language slices reality in non-human patterns, and therefore has no concept of 'house'. Similarly, it can't condense the idea of the house burning into the simple phrase 'on fire'. Instead, you have to deliver a long-winded statement that precisely selects the chunk of reality that is burning, what exactly burning means for the various materials, maybe put some constraints on it about how the system evolves over time. And getting any of these things wrong causes the effect to fail.

  So basically it becomes really hard to speak the language precisely without being close to omniscient. As a result, the only 'spells' that work are long chants with very clearly defined effects. The caster has to memorize the whole thing, and learn various mental tricks for making systematic changes. For example, you learn a fireball spell, and then you need to learn various tricks for telling it to go in a specific direction, possibly involving pulling out a compass or a sextant or something, and then adjusting your speech accordingly. 

  ...I just realized that my whole post is simply reinventing Rick Cook's *Wizardry* series, where a programmer finds himself in such a world and writes an interpreter (based on Forth, of all languages) to help him do spells that no one imagined possible. Maybe you should check that out instead.

    What???

    Clearly it should have been Python3, because Python3 is best language.  [*import antigravity*](https://xkcd.com/353/) and fly home.

  That seems incredibly hard to balance. Suppose that a society within your story wants to rehabilitate a criminal. A wizard says, "This criminal is sorry for their crimes." Would that work?

  It seems like you need to place a bound on the complexity of what people ask for.
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    Hum I think that could be slightly modified by taking the true name concept noggin-scratcher mentioned. So you can't just say "this criminal" you would have to describe the criminal sufficiently. And then if you can say that such a thing works this probably is comparable to mind control for all intents and purposes and so any ethics regarding that is comparable to re-writing some one's brain.

      Sure, but if you have easy mind control lying around in the setting, someone's going to use it (or try to, at least.)

    Ideally, it would be flat-out impossible to make statements that are beyond your manifestation power. Either the magic language would just prevent the idea from being thought, as is often with fictional "no lying" languages, or it would produce some undesiresable effect (eg, total magical expenditure + death of the speaker).
    ```

    - u/Nighzmarquls:
      ```
      I'm inclined to the language making impossible statements as comparably hard to say as lifting a mountain with your bare hands. The effort of the speech is obvious as you try to speak it.
      ```

- u/Ozimandius:

  People have mentioned a lot of possible solutions, so I'll throw a different one that I think might be a fun twist: the evil djinn trope.  Basically the intentions of the caster do not play into it and whatever loopholes the magic caster leaves in his spoken spell have a very good chance of going against them in some way.

  So in your example, No living man may hinder him, but a female or an inanimate object will likely lead to a major problem in the near future - the writing would be fun in that the reader could look at the spell someone cast and try to predict what ways it might go wrong for the caster.  Saying "that house is on fire" may simply set a tiny fire that barely does anything and poses no danger to the house, or turn the entire foundation and yard into a sea of fire that the house floats on.  And so on.  So casting magic becomes an incredibly dangerous thing that is done in emergencies or under very, very careful consideration of possible outcomes.

  > But if there is a language of magic that got me thinking what's it like if your native speech is literally the words of power that can shape the firmament of reality?

  NO.

  You do NOT want a toddler learning this as their first language, reshaping reality in nonsensical ways, getting whatever they want just by saying it, and unmaking its parents the first time they tell it "no".

  The language of magic must not be the first language for any person. No one may learn the language of magic before reaching a certain level of maturity, and the ability to form phonemes is not a sufficient lower bound.

  What if some poet happens to write a poem in different language and his neologism coincides with "fireball"?

  I guess people of all languages are wary of neologisms in this world. And free speech is a ridiculus idea.
