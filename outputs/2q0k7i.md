  If the wise wizard was really ruthlessly clever like this, they wouldn't even come back to check on the person and the definitely wouldn't explain that they are a manipulator, even to a person that is about to die.

    I tacitly assumed she had something she needed to get from the prisoner (probably information). Though 'for the evulz' would also be legitimate motivation for that character.

      ```
      Yeah, I kind of assumed she was there to get something from her with the plan being "and then we'll make our daring escape," only reality is without the escape part.

  ```
  In a similar vein, you could also subvert the "The magic was inside you all along" trope by pointing out that believing in yourself is easy and doesn't do much. The real challenge is getting others to believe in you.

  Exploiting trust? Nothing new.

    ```
    Just like canon!Dumbledore.  ...zing
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Subverting the "believe in yourself, you're special" meme, actually.
    ```
