## [RT][HSF][HF][DC][TH] Semi Monthly Update Post for Oh My! Generic Monster Girls: Critique or absurd suggestions welcome

### Post:

So right off the bat this is not porn or fetish fantasy or wish fulfillment self insert work. Yes I know the initial impression can feel like that. I'm striving to deconstruct the entire genre here along side a bunch of other things.

If your new to the story start [here](http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My%21-Generic-Monster-Girls%21-Dance-Magic-Dance%21).

If you want the latest update go [here](http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?58468-Oh-My%21-Generic-Monster-Girls%21-Dance-Magic-Dance%21&p=7871651&viewfull=1#post7871651).

If you'd like to poke and prod at my world building and get some spoilery information or links I'm game for that too.

I want to make this project as good as I can reliably make it time budget allowing.

So please let me know what is or is not working.

  Is there a story only thread? It's a bit annoying scrolling though all the suggestions to get to each segment of story, and only having a couple segments per page.
  ```

    ```
    That's what the coins are for (navigation).
    ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    Would it help if the images had some text on them? such as saying NEXT and PREV or perhaps just arrows? or maybe a hover over state?

    I originally thought the coins were super obvious but have been hearing it's not actually something people realize does anything (personally I always check what hidden/image based clickables are on stories like this).
    ```

    - u/Running_Ostrich:
      ```
      Text or arrows would be helpful (I probably wouldn't know to hover). I'd tried this story a couple months ago, but quit because I had the same issue.

      I'd also be fine with a table of contents that links to the individual story posts.
      ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  Showing the readers the wiki spell list would be work and would lock down the set of start-spawn spells, huh?

  How extraordinary is Magic 22? What spells have such requirements?

  How are XP gained?
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    I'm debating whether I want to make an actual wiki to fill with spells, or just include that in an update. Suggestions are welcome.

    [Spoiler for how stats work](#s "The stats are logarithmic, Magic power and all the other stats are between eight and ten times better for every time the value doubles.")

    [Spoilers for how magic spells work](#s "In the case of magic every spell has a spell power requirement. That says how often you can cast it. If it is equal to your magic it will take 1 day before you can cast it or anything else If it is half of your magic it will take 1 hour before you can cast any spell  of that spell power. But you can cast spells which costs less then it. If it is one eighth of your magic it will take 1 minute before you can cast a spell of that spell power again, you can still cast spells that cost less then it in mean time. At 1/16th you can cast a spell once per second. There are spells that can require a magic stat in the upper hundreds to cast once per day and they are terrifying.")

    [Spoilers for how Experience Works](#s "XP is gained from novel experiences and actual sensation of accomplishment with some heavy weighting on life or death situation/physical stress or life defining new experiences. On average a person in the equivalent of a constantly dynamic warzone where they have high chances to die at all times gets about 25 XP per day. A monster girl who is alive and aware is more or less incapable of getting less then 1 XP per day. Getting new levels gets progressively more expensive in XP and maxes out at 16 for a hard cap. It will take aproximately six years to reach this if you could sustain a high XP  producing experience")
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      [To first](#s "What do you mean, logarithmic? You are describing a polynomial relationship between points and power. And I was asking more for demographic information on how common her current Magic power level is, like a distribution chart and perhaps something like "she's already top ten".")

      [To second](#s "If you cast a half power spell, you can cast a full power spell exactly one hour later?")

      By the way, someone totally needs to cast Discern Properties on a Discern Properties window. Then again, since that is not something only our gang can do, the results are already on the wiki, since if I am on that planet, my clone already thought of it and posted the results to the wiki :P
      ```

      - u/Nighzmarquls:
        ```
        [to first](#s "Oh sorry, she is on the magic front almost the highest ranking individual on the planet, there is ONE other with higher numbers at this time and that is by ten points. But the next highest is about two points lower and consists of about 12% of the population or 1 billion monster girls give or take a few million")

        [to second](#s "Yep but then you got no more spells for 24 hours")

        And now you are starting to get some of the many planned trope inversions my friend :) welcome to a story with a 'global' supporting cast.
        ```

        - u/Gurkenglas:
          ```
          Make a wiki! (Also make a formula to roll, for every experiment we suggest, whether someone already did it and you add it to the wiki as a response to the suggestion :D. Involving rarity and max power of the used spells, time since the beginning of the event, etc.)

          [Spoiler](#s "Oh you are totally going to allow us to post stuff to their forum once they go public aren't you.")
          ```

          - u/Nighzmarquls:
            ```
            Any suggestions for a good free wikispace?

            I'm not particularly picky, but ideally should let me do a really clean format/style template.

            [Spoiler](#s "It is on my list of things to do, along with a bunch of others, I actually have a pretty massive foundation of work to support the magic system, the world events on the time line at a given event, and a lot more, it's why I had numbers for all your questions so far")
            ```

  ```
  Also interesting thing I'm seeing, this has been upvoted and downvoted in precisely equal measure.

  Never seen that before. Would appreciate reading which things people are finding issue with or the inverse.

  >how to store sufficiently complicated vivifications and metrics instead of suspensions

  So he is reading these comments after all! Valiant backpedaling there.
  ```

- u/Running_Ostrich:
  ```
  Having read from start to end, it seems like maybe this is a bit slow for my tastes, both in terms of story progression in panels and production of said panels. Though maybe it's just the medium that I'm not used to...
  ```

  - u/Nighzmarquls:
    ```
    Difficult to up production speed on this side.

    Story progression wise though I think I might agree. It's a little slow.
    ```
