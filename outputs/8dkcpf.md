## Predictions for the next PGTE chapter: I'm guessing an interlude because that would be infuriating

### Post:

Seems appropriate based on the last book.

edit: Goddamnit.

  Insane headcanon/lunatic ship: Cait proposes to Cordelia sucessfully and everyone is shocked into the crusade becoming unfucked. PoV is just the Seer watching it in all tenses simultaneously and giggling like a loon and giving the Bard the bird.

  Not stupid prediction: interlude from one of the white knight's surviving team or Papenheim.
