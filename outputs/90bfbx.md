## [D] /r/rational community recommendations for your favorite irrational fiction

### Post:

Irrational fiction, A.K.A "all fiction other than rational fiction." You know, regular stories, by regular authors, that you just happen to like! Post 'em!

This is not quite off-topic enough to belong in the weekly off-topic thread, I hope. I have a feeling a lot of the top-level responses in this thread will be *almost* skirting the line of being rational fiction, just because that's where this community's tastes lie. (But they don't have to be! If there's this one idiot-ball story so well-written in other ways that you just can't help but love it, please share that, too!)

    Strongly Seconding Accelerando, and blind buying Neptune's children despite the reservation's it's summaries have given me, because of how strongly I am thirding anything by Sanderson (I have all of it except Rithmasti, evil librarians and the comic books and might re-visit the librarians the first was clever but its a bit young) 

    To re-iterate Accelerando is the exciting parts of Age of EM  tied together with the narrative of one family, and some lobsters.

    *Edit: Stross's Laundry files are amazingly fun despite being Mythos stories.

  Any Discworld novel. I'm blitzing through the Dresden Files at the moment, and enjoying those a lot. Sanderson, obviously. I think the Elenium and Tamuli series by David Eddings have some of the highest [Moments of Awesome](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/MomentOfAwesome)/page ratios I've encountered.

    ```
    Man, I have such mixed feelings about the Prince of Nothing series. 

    I've only read it once several years ago but I remember having real trouble getting through it. The constant namedropping of all the fantasy terms felt clunky and the characters - while somewhat realistically portrayed - weren't likable, at all. It got tiring reading about ruthless scheming all the time.

    At the same time, the sheer amount of philosophy in the text was staggering. It was intertwined with the story and the metaphysics so well that you couldn't help asking questions. It had the best magical system of any fiction I've read.

    I didn't know there was a followup. Does it have similar problems?

  right now i'm really obsessed with the ongoing webcomic *Gunnerkrigg Court*. The story is about a young girl, Annie, who goes to a school at Gunnerkrigg Court which is a massive science-industrial complex where they sometimes study the supernatural. Across the river from the Court is a giant forest full of mythical creatures. The forest and the Court have a strange, uneasy relationship that Annie gets involved in.

  Not rational fic, it mostly has themes about love and friendship and stuff, but it's whimsical and funny, and the plot is engaging and the characters are a lot of fun.

  I've been reading through the powder mage series, it's pretty decent throughout, and sometimes quite good.

   The setting is medieval fantasy DND, with wizards as the ruling class and backers of the monarchy, but the power imbalance is changing rapidly because of the invention of gunpowder and how it makes it possible for regular people to do stuff like assassinate their settings version of Gandalf , and set off a fantasy French Revolution on the wizards and nobility,

  Machine Man, by Max Berry. It's thriller-fiction about an engineer and his rapid unexpected deconstruction into cybernetics in the modern day, taken to a maximalist conclusion.

  The *Cradle* series by Will Wight is English-language-original xianxia. It's not rationalfic (though there's a fair amount of Level One intelligent characters), but it's nonetheless very enjoyable and for the most part well-written.
  ```

  - u/Green0Photon:
    ```
    It's far better than any other xianxia I've tried.

    That said, now I'm disappointed in all other fics, because I really want a Xianxia/Cultivation fic where the protagonist progresses because of relevations about how magic works, instead of just popping pills or deus ex machinas in the form of macguffins.

    Cradle is actually really good because in comparison to those other Xianxia fics, it deconstructs the genre, and is definitely more satisfying.

    However, Cradle does not go far enough for me in the whole revelations about magic thing. It is far better than any other xianxia fic I've found, though.

        ```
        I recognize Savage Divinity and I've read a few chapters, but I haven't gotten to any relevations. I can try reading more, I guess.

        What is OEL xianxia?
        ```

        - u/daxisheart:
          ```
          Original English language.

          The Savage Divinity start is probably the worst of the series. Not that it's terrible, but the more you read the better and better it gets. Characterization and world building is absolutely top notch.
          ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Just blasted through volume 1, that was fun, it's main difference from 90% of the Xianxia I've read is that it got to the goddamn point, in a regular web Xianxia that first volume would be 40 chapters long.
    ```

  - u/DraggonZ:
    ```
    Warning! I actively disliked the series and didn't care for any characters or the world. The world feels like hell. All people care about is how good you're at fighting.

    - u/kraryal:
      ```
      Unfortunately that's pretty standard for the Xianxia genre. Anybody know some Xianxia that actually thinks compassion is a thing?
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        One of my favourite Xianxia is "upgrade specialist in another world" I like it specifically because the MC is a decent human being who makes decent friends who aren't in it just for renown or gain. The world Isn't packed full with blood thirsty cultivators and tyrannical sects, the MC joins a sect and they *value his talent*, it's shockingly refreshing to see characters with common sense in these stories some times.
        ```

      - u/Omniada:
        ```
        If you don't mind quest-style works (works that are written with the main character acting as voted on by the readers - kind of a realtime choose-your-own-adventure/roleplay kind of thing), there's [Forge of Destiny](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/), on Sufficient Velocity. The pacing is kind of weird because of the format, and the main character's time in the sect is very drawn out. It makes it have kind of a "magical boarding school" feel to it, made even stronger by the fact that the main character is very focused on the friendships she makes with her peers and the ways internalizing techniques affects her personality.

        I don't have very much to compare it to since I haven't read other Xianxia, but according to people commenting on it in the thread, it stands up very well compared to other stories in the genre. From what I understand, the main character is in some ways very much like a traditional Xianxia protagonist (shes a highly talented commoner who attracts the attention of the powers that be and has very good luck as far as finding loot), but in others very much unlike a traditional protagonist (she makes friends fairly easily and is very dedicated to them; she's next to useless in a straight melee or fistfight; she focuses heavily on intrigue, politics, and often infiltration). So - to the degree I am familiar with either genre - I think the best way to describe it is Xianxia meets boarding school fantasy, both structurally and thematically.

  Some of my favorites are:

  Short Stories
  ___
  * *Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius* by JL Borges
  * *Division by Zero* by Ted Chiang
  * *Fragments of a Hologram Rose* by William Gibson

  Longer Things, in order of somewhat increasing seriousness

  [I went with my fairly irrational tastes]
  ___
  * *The Phantom Tollbooth* by Norton Juster
  * *Guards!, Guards!* by Terry Pratchett
  * *Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency* by Douglas Adams
  * The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson
  * *Cat's Cradle* by Kurt Vonnegut
  * *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem

  *Focault's Pendulum* by Eco which was brought up here as one of the monthly books a while back was also a lot of fun.

  Feel free to ask questions about any of these! Also does anyone here have any good horror recommendations? I've really enjoyed most things by Lovecraft (sans the racism and terrible dialog) and *House of Leaves*

        [Interpratory Major Spoiler] (#s " That's my interpretation of how the level of narrative that includes Johnny Truant as impacted by the level of narrative that includes Pelafina plays out, based on various passages.  That the Johnny thread ultimately works as both a representation of Johnny as in-narrative character and as meta-narrative conscious observer, where the meta-narrative observer escapes the flow of the narrative via Pelafina-who also works on both levels-'s intercession, killing in-narrative Johnny's character, 'rescuing' meta-narrative Johnny.")  Honestly though, [House] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gyug0q9eyqw) of Leaves is a 'Make of it what you choose to' work, deliberately inviting over-analysis.
        [Interpratory Minor Spoiler] (#s " It is similarly my interpretation that the House, as embodied in the book itself, is in some sense aware of when it is being read, which is why the word House is always represented in Blue--that this symbolizes the reading coming to the notice of that awareness.

    Without spoiling the ending, I found The Magicians to be quite frustrating. It keeps coming close to concepts I'd like it to explore, then randomly turns away at the last moment in an incredibly irrational (to me) manner and goes back to being a deconstruction of YA fantasy stories.
    ```

- u/signspace13:
  ```
  My favourite Irrational fiction likely goes to Mushoku Tensei, a Japanese web novel, it follow the main character, Rudeus Greyrat, as he is reincarnated from a NEET in his 30s to a babe in a fantasy world. 

  His death was less than peaceful and his life in our world a tad despicable, so he vows that he will live life to the full in this world, putting in the effort where he lazed away in ours.

  The story is part fantasy adventure and part slice of life, it has action in it but it is never the point of the story, the main theme of the series is basically that of coming of age as Rudeus grows and gains experience we (as he does) realise that he was never really and adult in our world, and that he still needs to grow in order to be one.

  It is a story that holds a special place for me as it got me through some very hard times in highschool, it has remained one of my favourites despite parts of it being machine translated, and it's questionable sexualization of minors.
  ```

  - u/Dragfie:
    ```
    As a recommendation to both you and anyone reading this, IMO there are much better reincarnation translated novels. some of them are:

    Kumo desuga, nanika? (Yeah im a spider, you got a problem?)

    Moon lead journey - tsuki ga michibiku

    Lazy Dungeon Master

    my death flags show no sign of ending

    Some similar quality as mushoku:

    kyuketski hime

    Death March

    And tones more but the rest I either forgot or don't recommend.
    ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      I don't doubt that some of these are of greater quality than Mushoku Tensei, but my love for the series doesn't real come from it's quality, it isn't rational, I love Mushoku for it's message, as long as you strive you can overcome any challenge, and for the time I found it in. I'll give those a shot though, some sound interesting.

- u/SimoneNonvelodico:
  ```
  I'm not sure how to qualify this, but José Saramago's "The Gospel according to Jesus Christ" is one of my favourite books ever. It's extremely well written and extremely deep, and a savage tearing down of Christianity's fundamental myth. In a way, however, it might not qualify, because you could as well describe it as a rational rewriting of the gospels. Just one with prose and craft so fucking good it won the author a Nobel Prize.

  Another favourite of mine is Umberto Eco's "Baudolino". Though that one too has some "rational" elements - like a certain murder mystery that is solved through applying limited Medieval knowledge - it mostly is a story told by an unreliable narrator containing fantastical elements, so I think it's irrational enough for the purposes of this thread!
