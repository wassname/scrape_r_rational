  It is okay... on my first read through a while ago I liked it okay, but the way Cauldron lets Taylor dictate terms just breaks my suspension of disbelief (I had the same problem with Security!).  In canon this was the organization that was really just two people in the know and everyone else was kept at some level of disinformation or secrecy... the way they share things with Taylor is just too much for me.

    I hear you. Every time Taylor speaks with that form of authority towards high-ranking characters I cringe; it just doesn't fit with how I'd expect the interaction to go. It's just I have practice ignoring this kind of response, because I feel it with a large number of social scenes in virtually every story I've read.

      I could actually see Taylor talking like that, she has an authority thing in canon.  Doctor Mother might let it slide to pump her for info, but Alexandria would go all out on pressuring and manipulating her, and Contessa would go for a Path that would get the information out of Taylor without giving away any information to her or letting her get any more than the most trivial concessions from Cauldron.

        Here's a bit of devil's advocacy:

        >Alexandria

        While not going 'all out' certainly isn't on friendly terms with Taylor

        >Contessa

        Is friends with Taylor. While she can be all of the ruthlessly efficient inhuman optimizer we see her as, there still is a human under the mechanism.

          She literally didn't feel sad when Doctor Mother, the closet thing she had to a mother for a long time, died.  From interlude 29

          >  Odd, that she couldn’t bring herself to feel badly about it.  Was it because she’d spent so long trying to achieve something and she’d failed, or was it because she’d lost respect for the Doctor like she’d lost respect for herself?

        My view on that us that Contessa *is* on a Path to get *as much help* out of Taylor *as possible*. The Path just happens to include befriending Taylor and giving her any information she asks for.
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Even beyond that, her decisions and interactions seem to have too much of a convenient flavor. There's little reason to include Assault and Battery in things way beyond their pay grade beyond wanting to "fix" the bad stuff Cauldron did as opposed to the ineffective stuff.
    ```

  - u/Iconochasm:

    Maybe my SoD can handle too much, but I think the point of the fic is that this Taylor is the closest thing to the game changer Cauldron has ever found.  She's too damn useful *not* to have in the full inner circle.  "Thinker 9 with the exact specialty we need" wipes away virtually any concerns over age and experience.

    And frankly, I suspect that was the result of the Path to Getting Full Use From the Power Thinker that was run immediately after she pinged on Contessa's radar.  Giving her authority was the path of least resistance to getting Taylor fully on board with Cauldron's goals.
    ```

      So, as usual, the answer is "Contessa's power is bullshit." 

      :)

  The fic is quite good, I followed it for a few months already. Thanks for your work.

  However, one detail I don't understand. In one of the first chapters, Taylor makes a reference to a little-known aspect of power of Glaistig Uaine, whose existence is also fairly little-known to general public. She was never anywhere near the Birdcage, so how did she know that?
