  This is a bit redundant, no? Every single story Chiang has ever written, except Automatic Nanny is either [here](http://www.ibooksonline.com/88/Text/tower.html) or [here](http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang), and audio is [here](http://www.sffaudio.com/?p=30099) and those links are already provided in that other post that's currently on the front page.
