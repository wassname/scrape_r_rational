  This is a story I have been writing to help keep myself sane during physical distancing. Blurb:

  > An abandoned steampunk arms factory, in the middle of a conflict torn former state of the Empire it served, gains a soul. This transforms it into a Lord, capable of turning land into power. Beset by enemies on all sides it must figure out how to win the war its creators lost a century ago.
  >
  > This is a progressive Dungeon Core novel (which is to say the core will progress and expand in scale, eventually) across multiple dimensions with different characteristics (e.g. steampunk, magic, mythological). It has rationalist leanings (paragraphs of reasoning) and litrpg leanings (there are stat blocks). The core game mechanical idea is something like "what if different flavors of magic power actually did come from controlling land" and then the story is: "what if there was a flavorless ~~artifact deck~~ dungeon core".

  I'll expand more here because my attempts at writing are mainly inspired by this community, and if there is a group I am most excited to tell about my story its the people who will find this comment organically.

  This was inspired by Dungeon Core litrpgs and this is definitely a litrpg. Even if I do try to make the mechanics and reasoning a more rational take on Dungeon Core. I would describe it as - an attempt at - a "hard-litrpg" (for example a genre I would apply to Worth the Candle). It's also a deconstruction of like Magic The Gathering style land-is-mana game mechanics (but is in no way a fan fiction). Also for now we're doing WW1/Steampunk/Mech (e.g. Scythe) aesthetics, but it will be world hopping.

  This is definitely practice at being a rationalist fiction writer by aiming at what is traditionally a pretty "low-brow/trashy-paperback" genre (I include this story and my own reading tastes in that description, to be clear). I am confident I am going to screw up a *lot* of things and that parts of it are going to be way too wordy. So definitely practice, not claiming to be any good yet. I do plan to have some smart introspective characters, but I am only claiming the main character is in anyway rationalist or genre aware.

  The update schedule is currently planned to be a chapter a weekday and they will be relatively short. I'll likely do a post here every Friday (as that seems within the rules). The shortness is for [aesthetic reasons relating to my motivation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g33prw/d_friday_open_thread/fnq4f6u/). The first seven chapters are going to be abnormally long to set up everything. But who knows maybe I'll end up with regularly longer chapters and scale back my release schedule.

    Very interesting story!

    Recently been binging on Last Angel, so it's rather nice having an intelligent AI protagonist that isn't hell-bent on murdering a bunch of (deserving) people, but instead just a newly sapient being trying to figure out what to do with itself after everything it has ever known is long since gone.

    My main complaint is that while telling us the size of the hangar, you switch from **meters** to **feet**.  Switching between two different measurement systems can be confusing and doesn't make sense from the point of view of the AI.  If anything, it would be rather specific about using a precise measuring system, as it's very *purpose* is to create things that are precisely sized and shaped.

      Yes! Definitely a trope I am deconstructing.

      > My main complaint is that while telling us the size of the hangar, you switch from meters to feet.

      Ooooff I actually caught that in my review-reading this morning. Total slip of the finger. Both were meant to be in meters (an issue of living in country that uses feet all the time, even if I am thinking in metric I still accidentally say inches instead of centimeters and feet instead meters; I am considering writing a linting script to prevent me from doing that again (and other common mistakes I have caught myself making)). I had been hoping I would be able to correct it before anyone noticed...

      Thanks for catching it though! (I am glad someone was willing to call me on it) The entire universe is meant to be metric (let alone the AI as you pointed out would be consistent). Not planning to have any other measurement systems unless they are a joke and have funnier than that names.

  I've enjoyed reading this so far!  I'll maybe try to come back and say more soon, but I wanted to say this since I don't see any other comments so far.

  Congratulations on starting a story!

  This is the story I needed. Thank you for writing it.

  It seems interesting so far. One minor quibble is that for interjections and the like—such as this—an em dash (—) is nicer to read (and also commonly considered more typographically correct), while you've been using " - ", which is still readable but a bit messy especially when there's a lot of them.

  Added to follows, will check back once there are a few more chapters. Thanks for sharing!

  You managed to misspell hangar every single time but I really like the story
