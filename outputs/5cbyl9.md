    Seventh Horcrux might be one of the funniest things I've ever read.  It has virtually no "laugh lines", but I keep finding myself wanting to quote entire, multi-page chapters.

    I should probably pick that story back up. I enjoyed it, got about to the end of the 4th book, but felt like it was losing its charm as it was basically the same gag gone overly long. When I finish some of my current reading list though it's probably worth finishing :)

    I'm not really a fan of these books, the pacing is just too slow for me even if there are bunch of great scenes, but the scene where Jasnah explains her reasons for believing what she does is fantastic. It's especially remarkable considering that Sanderson is a practicing Mormon.

    This isn't even the first time he talked about religion in his books while preaching against his own faith. Mistborn has a fantastic character arc for the theological scholar Sazed having a crisis of faith, and The Path in the Alloy of Law is essentially Buddhism.

      Wait, what? Really?

      This... explains so much about what I disliked about the Mistborn trilogy. Huh.

      >This isn't even the first time he talked about religion in his books while preaching against his own faith. Mistborn has a fantastic character arc for the theological scholar Sazed having a crisis of faith, and The Path in the Alloy of Law is essentially Buddhism.

      Ehh. As someone who went through my own crisis of faith and went from theist to deist to agnostic to atheist over the space of about 10 years, Sazed's character was at times fantastically done, and at other times a walking caricature of Skepticism. I saw his flip back to religious belief coming miles away.

  If I understand the question right, I'd say Ginny in *Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence* is a great example of this.

  I very much enjoyed the story for the most part, and think it did a lot of unique and interesting things with the source material.  But Ginny herself was a heavily flawed rationalist for a number of reasons.

  At risk of beating a dead horse (an obvious horse?) it was her religious beliefs that posed the biggest problem. Despite never getting any actual evidence for her beliefs, Ginny continues to defend them against shoddily constructed arguments by the other characters, and her responses are similarly full of holes. She learns just enough rationality to entrench herself deeper in her beliefs, as described in [How Biases Can Hurt People.](http://lesswrong.com/lw/he/knowing_about_biases_can_hurt_people/)

  Of course it all turns out well for her because this particular character flaw was the result of an author tract, which is unfortunate, but it's important to remember that a rational character is only as "genuine" as the arguments around them. It's very easy to make someone seem smart when you surround them with strawmen.

  Ginny also starts the story with many flaws and shortcomings that made her an interesting foil to the now-somewhat-traditional Rationalist Protagonist. She had some questionable morals. She's obsessive about her idols. She has all the pride of a "deep thinker" without any of the discipline.

  Then, slowly but surely, she simply got better and better at everything. Not through actual, learnable skills or wisdom, which would be alright, but simply by narrative fiat. There was information being communicated, but not knowledge of what distinguishes rational epistemology from irrational epistemology.

  Which was confusing, because it also seemed like the story itself was written to point out the flaws of stories with author tracts, specifically to counter the author tract of HPMOR. This is supported a bit by the scene where Harry starts to subvert the cult stereotype and parody the LessWrong community, but as the story went on and it just kept running with it, it seemed more and more like the writer had trouble distinguishing what actually made the author tract problematic, and simply disliked the flavor, substituting it with their own.

  On top of all that, all the accusations of Harry being a Mary Sue in HPMOR (which I disagree with) apply much more to Ginny in GWSI.  By the end of the story, she's leagues ahead of Harry: not just the chosen one, ordained by prophecy to become the savior of the One True Religion, and by extension, all of humanity, but also able to utterly defeat him and deliver a This is Why You Suck browbeating.

  Contrast that to Harry at the end of HPMOR: he's "chosen" by prophecy to destroy the universe as we know it, and if he's not super careful and super cautious and as rational as possible, he might just kill everyone. There's no similar Sword of Damocles hanging over Ginny's head by the end of GWSI: I have no reason to expect her to do anything other than becomes the new messiah to Wizardkind, and perhaps even all of humanity, with the lost magics she now has access to.

  There was, however, an obvious mitigating factor for the story, that is also important to learn from: the author was on a deadline, and thus churned out chapters as fast as they could. The rate of the writing was, in all honesty, very impressive. The problem is that it seems, in this area, quality was very much sacrificed for quantity.

  I'm not a perfect writer, and I know my readers are frustrated by how slow my chapters come out. Hell, I am too, and if I had a bit more free time and a bit more work ethic, I could probably publish faster than once a month. But a lot of that month is spent researching, poking holes in my ideas, taking the opposing view, and so on. If a writer skips all that and just goes for the low hanging fruit, they're going to have a hard time reconciling how rational they think their characters  are versus how rational they actually come off to others.

    Wait, that was an author tract *in favor of* irrationality? That gibbering nonsense was supposed to be taken seriously? Are you sure?

    I thought the entire thing was supposed to read like some kind of Greek tragedy where the MC doesn't ever learn anything and ruins all their own chances.

      I actually had a number of times while reading it where I wasn't sure it wasn't a crackfic or dark reflection, yeah. Especially when the dementor was revived with dark licorice :P

      But at the time when I read the ending monologue it seemed pretty clear that the tract was meant to be taken straight.

        Went and read the last chapter and epilogues again, and I think I see what you mean.

        Dang though, that is a profound level of not getting it.

    I kept coming back to this thread hoping to find a recommendation/takedown of GWSI, and I've got to say, finding a *ten-paragraph* recommendation/takedown of GWSI was beyond my wildest hopes.

    I'm curious if you read the epilogue I wrote and published a few months after the main story.  I ask because I wound up going for a martyr-fantasy bittersweet ending instead of the simpler wish fulfillment happy ending you seem to expect; it's still very much transparent author appeal wish fulfillment, but of a distinctly different type than you're implying.

    In general I'd say your criticisms stand, though, and I accept them as lessons to learn from in the future.  I do hope people read GWSI both to take what's good from it and to appreciate its many flaws (as I think you're suggesting).  I hope to begin self-publishing better fiction, not written on such a tight deadline, sometime in Q1 2017.  :)

      I didn't even know it existed! I'll have to go back and read it soon, will let you know what I think when I get the chance.

      >I do hope people read GWSI both to take what's good from it and to appreciate its many flaws (as I think you're suggesting). 

      Definitely! As I said, it was very enjoyable, had a very unique feeling of creeping horror from the unreliability of the narration/memory charms, and contained a lot of cleverness :)

      Neat! What's it going to be about?

        Well, first off, it's definitely not rational fiction (neither written primarily with the rationalist community in mind nor written to minimize the number of cognitive mistakes characters make), though I've taken the lessons of rational fiction as general writing lessons.

        But to actually try to pitch the series I'm writing, it was inspired by the early 2000s fundamentalist moral panic over Harry Potter.  I always thought it was ridiculous, both because the actual existence of Satanic magic is at best highly dubious and because Harry Potter is just one entry in the well-established literary tradition of fantasy magic that has generally been uncontroversial.  But eventually I got to thinking "huh, what would a YA contemporary fantasy series where magic is inherently evil actually look like", and decided it had a lot of potential.  Faustian bargains baked into the magic system, necessarily underpowered protagonists and necessarily overpowered antagonists, a deliberately black-and-white main conflict of which all subconflicts necessarily are grayer by various degrees.

        To put it in Imp-from-Worm terms: so there's this Earth with no real parahumans, but two warring Simurghs, one named Fucko McSkullface and one named Bored Mike.  Fucko gives people temporary access to powers if they do her favors (which are usually bullshit and evil), and the results pretty much always suck for humanity.  No one's really sure if Bored Mike exists because he doesn't do supernatural shit very often, but he does exist and spends all his time tweaking shit behind the scenes to make Fucko's job harder (instead of, you know, **fucking killing her**).

          Ha, that sounds pretty awesome. I've been writing a bit of my own "dark YA fantasy" on the side, though I'm still not quite sure where it'll end up going. I'm looking forward to yours!

          Tell me about it. I had a client once whose mother refused to let him read Harry Potter books because she didn't want any of that "ungodly stuff" to "corrupt him."

          This was a mom that, in the same session, admitted to taking said 9 year old client to see the latest Texas Chainsaw Massacre film, and laughed over him crying from nightmares afterward, asking why he was scared since "none of it was real."

          Yeah. That one took a lot of willpower not to lose my professional calm :P

  So much literary fiction covers exactly this that it almost seems like more of a challenge to think of exceptions, so instead some genre examples:

  *Sandman* (Wahhh, I can't put my life back together, wahhh), *Ender's Shadow* (Must be Spock must be Spock OH GOD POKE NO WHY must be Spock) *HPMOR* (Quirrell is so cool, he's totes my bro OH HEY WATCHA DOIN WITH THAT UNICORN), *Avatar: The Last Airbender* (I must avenge my HONOR!).

  All do a good job of getting you in the head of and sympathizing with someone making terrible life choices.

The main character is extremely irrational, but he's good at heart, and through the course of the story you come to empathize with him and understand why he feels like he *has* to act that way.

  Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann is... not rational in a lot of ways. But it's hard to get more fun than that show.

  Stuff happens for the rule of cool, implausible is the rule rather than the exception, and they win through force of will rather than with their intelligence. Half of the characters are completely flat, but the main characters have surprising depth.

    The existence of spiral power sends rationality tumbling end over end.  In a universe where fundamental forces of existence reward the shounen hero mindset of willpower/determination and punish a more logical/intellectual approach, wouldn't the actions of the protagonists be those of a rational actor?  Out of context their actions may seem insane, but in universe they behave in the manner to maximize success in achieving their goals according to what they know.
