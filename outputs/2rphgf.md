  It's technically possible to [transfect human cells](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10657122), through a viral vector, with E. coli genes that make them express trehalose.

  Also this seems to be an area where cryonics and neurodegenerative disease research interests are aligned. For example, there is some interest in using trehalose in the brain as a treatment for [Huntington's](http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v10/n2/abs/nm985.html) and [ALS](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23851366).
