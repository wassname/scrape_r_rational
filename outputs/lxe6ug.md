  Tagging this as a joke would spoil the shaggy-dog (shaggy-snake?) story, but I thought it had enough computation, evolutionary biology, and social impact to be of interest here.

    Got a good chuckle out of me, at least. Thanks for posting it.

    Honestly just the bit in the middle about snakes having evolved auto-Haruspexy was cool enough on its own.

  So haruspex is reading the future on the organs of an animal, and apparently worked pretty well, but they used MAMMALS. Big mistake.

  I like this, but the pedant in me wishes that Hillel could have chosen something other that haruspicy, which is explicitly about reading entrails, not organs in general.

  It definitely does, and hints at the problem inherent to foreseeing, which Philip K. Dick’s book *The Minority Report* expounds upon.
