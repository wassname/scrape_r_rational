  I'm just glad there are things happening in the story now.  Character introspection has its place, but this story has been pretty heavy with it so far.

    Ehh, "slow" update speed exaggerates the problem. Once a week is still fast for the raw linguistic quality we get. While it is still relatively slow for purposes of binge reading, rational worldbuilding still requires a lot of justification etc. that massively moderates the pace of story. Overall, it still manages to stay interesting every update, even if it has a high "filler" quotient.

      This arc becomes a lot more readable if you aren't waiting for sure. I ponied up a few bucks to read ahead and it's less frustrating to bang through chapters.

          Meh, it's only 2.50 per month and I'm willing to support the author to stay ahead. That's less than a beer at a cheap dive bar.

            That said, with over 2,000 subscribers he's making a decent bug on this.

              More power to him.

                That wasn't a criticism. Just pointing out how small amounts like that can still add up.
                ```

  I feel this new escalation really wasn't needed. Just increase the pacing, no need to shove in combat and pointless action at this point in this arc. It will slow the pacing even further. Rain being underground 3-4 episodes was bad, the dealing with people and managing was satisfactory.

  &#x200B;

  This combat now will just slow things down imho. Nothing threatens him there. Just him being a hero and showing off, when him saving the city with his brain and hard work would have been more novel and interesting overhaul.
  ```

    ```
    I think this is the important death knell for Fel Sadanis.  With monsters spawning beneath your bed and in your closet it really isn't sustainable to have civilian housing anymore, and the Watch even intends to go around demolishing houses to solve this problem, if I read the chapter right.  Fel Sadanis won't be *abandoned*, it's still got the all-important teleport pad and barrier stone, but it would be more a military outpost than anything.

    What this does to the story is force Rain to move on.  He can't stick around in Fel Sadanis anymore because there *is* no Fel Sadanis anymore, and there's no point returning here if it's just an encampment around the strategic artifacts.  It puts Rain on the road with no looking back, ready for the next leg of his journey.
    ```

  - u/eaglejarl:

    I disagree. There's a ton of plot happening here, and I suspect it will drive much of the story from now on.

    Rank shift means that monsters will be continually spawning in the city. Do the residents stick around and try to find for their homes or do they become refugees, moving hundreds of miles across a monster-filled winter landscape? Where do they go? If there are monsters spawning in, how many of them are blues? Will new heroes be feeling the area? What about the DKE -- how will this impact their conquest attempts? What about the side characters we've seen -- they've had zero large-scale agency since the barrier went up, since that's not a problem they can affect. Monster hunting and protecting others is something that Kettle, Myth, Reason, etc can do. Plus, maybe some of them end up awakened, which will cause its own changes.

    Also, as another poster said, it's been foreshadowed for a very long time and needed to be paid off.

    Also also, I get where you're coming from about Rain solving things with his brain, but other readers have been hoping for some action for a long time and this chapter *is* the pace picking up from their POV.

      My problem isn't with it happening, it's with it being now. This could have waited a bit. The main problem is the pacing imho not what's happening or the lack of fights.
      ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Needed or not, it has been foreshadowed for quite a while now.
    ```

- u/ironistkraken:
  ```
  So I guess rain will find a blue and raise his level cap?
  ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Not above ground, but area getting its level raised might have altered the dungeon. 
    The spawns being edible does solve the food situation, however.
    ```

  ```
  Binge read this from scratch over the past week. I really enjoyed it. It may be a bit slow if you go for one chapter per week but read end to end the pace didn't bother me at all.

    ```
    Did the underground section stand up well?  My brother and I felt like it could have been slimmed down
    ```

      ```
      I read it week-by-week, so I can't provide a definite answer.  From my experiences interacting with other communities, I'd bet that reducing the real-life time he's trapped from two months to two hours would take the edge off.

  Holy cow, I tried to read this chapter after a long night of drunk gaming with my friends. It was the most surreal Delve experience I had yet. So many characters. So much action. What even was happening lol. (I reread it the day after and it was way more coherent, but the Val reveal at the end just didn't have the same surprise factor)

  Loved the way all sorts of characters had a little slice of the limelight. (Ava was so cute trying to square up to a mushroom man with a dagger \[batshit insane though\]). But I wouldn't do it too often, it is pretty jarring to follow the narrative when we have to see it through so many lenses.

  (Fucking slow clap Val? Really? I'm convinced that his brain is actually just a meme machine for rpg's.)

  Finally, some action! Glad things are moving forward
