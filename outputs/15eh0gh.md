## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Webbonomicon, the guy writing Only Villains Do That, often mentioned here, has shelved it indefinitely to restart their previous serial, The Gods Are Bastards. 

  I got into OVDT from recs here, so never started TGAB. Is it worth reading through the old backlog for it, do you think?
  ```

  - u/Samarium149:
    ```
    TGAB has been [reviewed on this subreddit before although 5 years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/91p1y8/started_reading_the_gods_are_bastards_initial/)

    I personally didn't like it because of the rapid POV changes. I strongly dislike multiple POV because I find myself preferring one POV and then skipping the rest. Given how many POVs there are, I'm practically reading a tiny fraction of the story.

    That being said, the author has proven themselves to be very competent. If they're going back and updating the story, I would expect it's top quality.
    ```

  - u/Krakenarrior:
    ```
    I’ve read up to part 9 (book 9? Arc 9?), and while it’s been a minute I can remember exactly how I felt about TGAB. In a word- conflicted. The strength of TGAB are the characters and the world, but the plot meandered all over the place. The interludes start getting more frequent as the story goes on, and often it felt that the plot got pushed to the side and the world took center stage. 

    That’s not to say that TGAB is bad, it’s one of the earlier web novels (I remember finding it around the end of book 3 of Practical Guide to Evil to give a perspective of when it was actively releasing). The world and characters are great, and if you don’t mind a long meandering plot, the characters and the world will drag you in.
    ```

    - u/NinteenFortyFive:
      ```
      One of the biggest weaknesses of TGAB is that there's a massive cast and Webb was loathe to kill a single one of them. He added plot elements to just made sure nobody named would die, and it just means that villains are constantly blasting off again and coming back with more sunk cost wackyness when they reasonably should have died the last three times they tried to kill the protagonists.
      ```

      - u/Krakenarrior:
        ```
        I forgot about that! It quickly spiraled out of control with characters because of that, and it started with like 9 main characters (the class & the elf teacher). To be honest that wasn’t the worst part, I remember at one point pretty much every named character has a interlude dedicated to them, sometimes more than one, and that includes minor characters, villains, dead and living gods, but the worst one, or at least the one that I stopped reading was when there was a whole interlude dedicated to the gnomes in some random town, and the main protagonists hadn’t really interacted with any gnomes!

        The worldbuilding was cool but it could’ve been handled way better, because half the time it was interludes of people who barely mattered, or were 300 years in the future (looking at you time travel interlude). At least OVDT was much better about this, even though book 3 was a side quest that spiraled out of control.
        ```

        - u/NinteenFortyFive:
          ```
          Honestly, I don't care about the interludes. I actually like them. All my issue is with the fact that "None of the characters are allowed to die" is such a hard rule that all tension is just gone every time there's conflict.
          ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    I remember I liked TGAB back when I read it, but looking back, I feel it has a bit of "first book syndrome". 

    Absolutely monolithic in scale and word count, and enough different characters that I found it impossible to pick back up a couple months later because I just couldn't remember who everyone was (character bloat). 

    Some genuinely good ideas and great character moments in there though, but as other commenters have pointed out, the plot really meanders and doesn't get very far very fast. If I were the author, I'd consider a rewrite or hiring an editor to really chop it down a bit, but if you've got a spare couple of days and nothing to do, reading TGAB isn't a terrible idea.
    ```

  - u/NnaelKysumu:
    ```
    It's worth reading, and I'm glad to hear it's being picked up again. 

    It's long, though. Really long, and doesn't necessarily have a main character as much as a whole cast we follow throughout, which might be a turn off for some.
    ```

  - u/dogcomplex:
    ```
    The Gods Are Bastards:  Probably my favorite rational-ish fic of all. There's a level of worldbuilding complexity and character/system/society understanding to the author that makes me just want to bow down in praise - but it's also written with such humor and fun that the complexity isn't overwhelming and you dont feel left behind. For what is ostensibly a fictional Magic School fic, you really do get an education in how the world (any world) works, and I love it. Caveats to the picky readers: this is an incredibly long series, and miraculously it's not even finished yet - and it's been sitting on the precipice of what will probably be the last book for a couple years now. This is actually kinda fine to me - the world has been so fleshed out you can imagine your own conclusion. But I still look forward to the day the author comes back to finish it - but not before he finishes writing.

    Only Villains Do That - Which somehow I love even more? It's still fairly early days (I'm feeling maybe 1/4-1/3rd of the story?) but just such an enjoyable romp deconstructing the classic Isekai format from the character perspective of the "dark lord" role. Once again, top-notch worldbuilding explored with humor and great characters. A fic about mostly-ethical world domination (mostly through Healing and Incinerate spells) that nobody asked for but we so needed.

    (older reviews, still true.  Will miss OVDT but look forward to Webnomicon taking TGAB to its final form.  One of the best writers of our time imo, yet still developing and improving.  Both around the top of my 50+ ratfic list )

  Any advice on Warhammer fiction or any space opera fiction?
  ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    [Shinji and Warhammer 40,000](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3886999/1/Shinji_and_Warhammer40k). No, seriously. It really captures the heroic ethos of Warhammer by applying it at high velocity to the Eva world. Hilarious but also awesome.

    For a popcorn space opera, have you read *[The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/)*? It’s a Halo homage, but in a way that really emphasizes what I think you’re after.

      Just finished reading last angel 2 days ago. Really cool.is the sequel worth it?




      Btw last angel is exactly the kind of hidden gem I'm talking about.

    You've read Dune, right? A bunch of Warhammer 40k was inspired by it.
    ```

    - u/hoja_nasredin:
      ```
      Yeah. Only the first book but yeah.
      Warhammer manages to scratch that "knight in space" feeling that few sci Fi series have. Maybe star wars. But that's it
      ```

      - u/Dragongeek:
        ```
        It's not in space, but if you are looking for some sci-fi/fantasy blend knights, *12 Miles Below* is pretty fantastic. It takes place on a dangerous Earth in the far future, after many apocalypses have come and gone, leaving behind their imprints on the world like a deadly surface, ancient killer AIs, and more.
        ```

- u/NTaya:
  ```
  Any good romance with a human/non-human pairing? The non-human-er, the better. Definite pass on "other races are human except for a couple of traits" (so, vampires, elves, etc. are instantly out). I would prefer a human PoV, but non-human PoV is also fine, I am down for *anything* at this point. Doesn't have to be rational, just *please* no dumb-as-rock characters who have """"hilarious"""" misunderstandings.

  I am aware of *Marriage And Monsters - An Eschatological Romance* and *Edge Cases*.

  Many thanks in advance.

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      The first one looks good, but I'm unfamiliar with the fandom, and simply skimming some wiki pages and TVTropes as I usually do didn't help much here. It definitely requires canon knowledge. I plan to read it nonetheless, just with a bit more preparation. 

      The second is... eh. The first chapter left me feeling that hyena is going to be written as a human with a couple of quirks, which is something I don't want. 

      The third one is a nope for me, less because of the format and more because it feels like anthro here is for flavor only. 

      Same goes for the fourth. The format doesn't do it any favors for sure, but it's bearable compared to the extreme anthropomorphism. 

      Same goes for the fifth. 

      All in all, Anthro/Human tag is not for me because I specifically want a non-anthro (but sapient and intelligent, of course) love interest. Snakes are at least somewhat non-anthro, so the viper story passes at the first glance, but the rest are just not for me, sorry.

      (Edit: The tag is also full of smut, and I dislike smut.)

      Either way, thank you very much for taking your time with these recs!
      ```

        The first one really doesn't require any fandom knowledge. I was able to read it just fine without knowing anything about XCOM.

      - u/AviusAedifex:
        ```
        You can also look at the Teratophilia or xenophilia tag on Ao3. And you can sort out smut by filtering out explicit stuff.

- u/Lyslum:
  ```
  Recently read [What we do to survive](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51307/what-we-do-to-survive) after seeing it mentioned a couple times in previous threads. I didn't mind that the MC and environment is depraved since the magic system and the apparent power of the MC are fair enough that it makes sense and it stays true to itself, but almost a third of the fic is smut fantasy which really takes away from the main plot. I might go back to it when it finishes or develops a backlog.

  Its a fun enough read, you can skip most of the smut as it doesnt matter and it might be something some day. It takes like 120 chapters to get through 1 semester at this school and while done a bit clumsily, the world building and foreshadowing future plot points as well as building the cast  means the author has larger plans for the plot. If you can deal with the edgy "depraved" acts and the consistent derailments from plot to smut, and want something to read that scratches the magical school itch, I can recommend it.
  ```

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    It's pretty seriously depraved. I think you're even underselling it.

    If you can get through that, you might like Polyhister Academy. The "difficult" parts are much easier to avoid, and it's a similar setting.
    ```

    - u/ivory12:
      ```
      I love Polyhistor Academy. Favourite quest on the internet, amazing setting. That said, I do not love what the playerbase frequently chooses. It's the problem with a crowd piloting a character, which is hard to read about sometimes. Well, IMO. Let's just say if I were the only person controlling Mikelle he would be making very different decisions.
      ```

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        I get that. He has some weird weaknesses that could have been easily shored up. The main one is that he has no weapon or main attack. He's always in a situation where geomancers are blowing everything up and he's just skating around, being psychically invisible, when he should at least shoot a magic crystal bullet at them or something. He still uses that rando magic sword which is the in-universe equivalent of a free Gotchapon machine pick. He also has a build that's perfect for being a computer expert (hiding, information collection, leveling up academic skills), but he's essentially computer illiterate.

        That said, I just don't read the vote threads, and then the story just seems like the guy is pretty specialized. It's actually more interesting that he's powerful but in a somewhat non-optimal way. If I strayed from reader mode, I'd probably be more annoyed.
        ```

    - u/Lyslum:
      ```
      I think the MC's thought process cuts the depravity a lot since the MC himself is uncomfortable with depravity for the sake of depravity itself. The external depraved actions feel forced and some characters are cartoonishly evil and depraved so the tone really doesn't make the content feel as dark as it should be.

      &#x200B;

      I'll check out Polyhister Academy though, thanks for the rec.
      ```

      - u/Amonwilde:
        ```
        For the sake of discussion I'll admit to reading a bunch of it...

        It's sort of framed as the MC needing to do this really terrible stuff to survive (I guess that's even the title), but that always feels like a stretch, or that even the MC can't possibly believe it. A lot of the specific things he does are just really excessive. With that said, many of these things are front-loaded, which I think is a good choice.

        The pacing is really quite glacial. It's one of those books that would be really served by a couple judicious time skips. It's also one of those stories where certain plot points, like having to do the ritual at the end of the semester, are references like 75 times before they actually happen, and the MC repeatedly has litle thoughts about  how, oh darn, he'll really have to get on that, add it to the todo list. That really reads as the author reminding himself to write that eventually, after a while you're rolling your eyes and saying, yeah, you're really going to get on that this time. The story would be better served by applying more pressure to the MC. Every now that then he gets a reminder about how it's a dangerous place, then the story more or less goes back to a cozy atmosphere, even if the MC does do some stuff on paper to defend himself better.

        Personally, I think Polyhister is better, despite the quest format being terrible to read. I'll clearly hold my nose a lot for a decent magical school story.

        Not remotely in the vein of  this thread, but The Magicians is a decent read if you can stand some literary fiction.
        ```

  - u/vaphyren:
    ```
    Imo the smut is half the point, it is a feature not a bug. If you find yourself skipping through it, it probably isn't the story for you.

    Similar sentiment applies to An Infinite Recursion of Time, and most VNs.
    ```

    - u/Lyslum:
      ```
      The actual smut scenes don't really add any key information to the plot. The heavier smut scenes are censored on royal road and the author states that while you can read them on other platforms you aren't missing much that isn't referenced after the smut chapter or section itself.
      ```

      - u/vaphyren:
        ```
        I'm not saying they're important to the plot, I'm saying that generally someone whose first instinct is to skip smut scenes generally isn't the audience for fiction that's written, in part, with the purpose of delivering smut scenes.

        Actual smut aside, you know the descriptions are going to be lewd, the plot are going to be set up for lemon etc. If smut isn't your cup of tea you probably won't enjoy much of it.
        ```

        - u/NTaya:
          ```
          This is not the case for this work, but I read a lot of romance, and I skip all the smut there. I really enjoy character interactions and the build-up to the lemon, I just don't like the fruit itself. 

          I think this might be the case with other works. Hell, I've managed to read *The Erogamer* skipping most of the smut, and yet it became my favorite quest of all time!
          ```

    - u/LaziIy:
      ```
      I don't think you miss anything really if you skim the smut. Author himself says its not vital to the plot to read the in depth smut, and its pretty much summarized after the session. I assume Op means the actual smut and not the casual sex scenes going on in the fic
      ```

  - u/hi____nsa:
    ```
    Smut isn't something that bothers me, but the tag of villainous protagonist does. Is the MC truly villainous or is this more of an anti-hero type of mc?

      Definitely villaneous. >!At the point I stopped (Chapter 40) he had repeatedly abducted random people and tortured them to the point that they were willing to become permanently mind-controlled for the pain to end.!<

He seems to "get" sociability a bit more, but he's definitely still an asshole!<. Considering the entire upper echelon of Avalon is full of psychopaths, I dunno if I'd call him a villain (from the perspective of the story).

    I've read most of your list.

    Vagabond is on permanent hiatus/complete, and it's really good. It's also not too long. It was really nice to see different interpretations of Musashi, one in Vagabond, and another in Baki Dou. Where the Vagabond one is his beginning, and Baki Dou is what he was like at the end of his life. But Baki is like 1000+ chapters at this point so I don't recommend you read it unless you really like fighting manga just for Musashi.

    Golden Kamuy is a great mix of comedy and action, with a really fun cast of characters. Also there's a lot of real? info about hunting, nature, and Ainu that really adds to the world and makes it more interesting. One thing that may or may not affect your enjoyment of it is that the cast is primarily men. And sometimes it gets really homoerotic, even if it never goes all the way. Personally that was a plus for me, but YMMV.

    Freesia is interesting. It has a very dark world, with an unreliable narrator, and the sketchy artstyle made my head hurt when I read it the first time, but it's really good and I reread it a few times. 

    Shamo is a great fighting manga, but it's also very brutal. The MC is quite something to see, but I think it was axed or was about to be axed like twice, so the later part of the story has a really weird structure, where it feels like it should end, but it just keeps going, and then it happens again, and it still keeps going, and the last arc is almost completely disconnected from what came before. I did really like the ending though. Very appropriate for the story.

    Heterogenia Linguistico is the only one on the list that I would say is "rational" and even then it's questionable. It's very focused on linguistics, and if you like the idea of a guy trying to communicate with beast people who don't speak human language, then I recommend it, but personally I thought it was too much.

    Kaiju No. 8 isn't very good. It has a good premise, but it ends up becoming really boring, and the already slow pace of the story is made even worse by the fact that it's biweekly. Unless you're really desperate for a shounen manga, I don't recommend it. 

    Hunter X Hunter is on the other hand, probably the best shounen manga. I watched both the anime and read the manga, and the anime was pretty good, but I still think the manga is better. It's really good, even if it is unfinished there's still hundreds of chapters to read.

    Jormungand again I've read both the manga and watched the anime, and they're both good. If you like action focused on guns, then it's really fun, but otherwise has little to offer either way. >!Unless you really like /ss/.!<

    BIBLIOMANIA is very short, and really good, so I recommend it just for that. 

    Even If The World Is Over It’s Fun To Live. This is one of the better SoL post-apocalyptic manga, which is one of my favorite mini-genres. I'd also recommend Usuzumi no Hate since it has a similar tone. 

    RAINBOW is really, really edgy. If you like suffering, read it, otherwise I don't recommend it. 

    Berserk. Very unpopular opinion, but I hate it. Ignoring the dark setting, which is pretty good. It feels like it includes every shitty anime trope that people use to make fun out of anime. I **despise** the cast. It's like a relic of the past, and more over a very specific past. I've read a ton of manga, from recent to old ones  like Osamu Tezuka's manga, and even that was way better. But I despise ecchi and harem tropes, so if you like it, go ahead.  

    Sweet Home is a pretty fun horror webtoon, even if I feel like the second half isn't that interesting. I'd still recommend it. 

    Otherwise the rest is good too, but I don't really have anything to say about it. I didn't like Hikaru no Go or Seraph of the End though.
    ```

  - u/JohnKeel:
    ```
    The anime for Owari no Seraph is firmly “so bad it’s good,” and I recommend it for that. It’s an edgy soap opera, basically.

    Code Geass is in the same boat, except it’s even badder and even better. The anime is a classic.

  * Edge Cases
  * The Laws of Cultivation: Qi = MC^2 - I've read a good chunk of this.
  * Quill & Still
  * Surviving the Succession (A Transmigration Fantasy) - I also had read a good chunk of this, and it was decent, with a unique (to me at least) angle on the cultivation genre.
  * Double-Blind: A Modern LITRPG - This one is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I like the author in general. However, the societal changes that should have taken weeks or longer seem to happen within hours or days. Guilds and other player-based organizations spring up seemingly overnight after the System Apocalypse. The MC hits the dungeons pretty hard, spending little time to rest, yet there are dozens of other players that are seemingly higher level than him, who also seem to spend much of their time ruling their player organizations.  So I feel that story pacing is even more wacky than HP:MoR, which is saying something.
  * Jackal Among Snakes - I've also read a good chunk of this previously.
  * Tower of Somnus - Also read a good chunk of this and will definitely resume it someday.
  * Tori Transmigrated - I kind of want to know what will happen, but as others have complained, there's an utter lack of tension for most of it.
  * Ar'Kendrithyst - Interesting RPG system. I dropped it around the time the MC involved himself in what was obviously a troll effort and/or trap regarding the founding of that new city. I may still pick it up again.
  * RE: Monarch - Another one I've read a good chunk of.
  * Only Villains Do That - I was following it closely for a while, dropped around the time of the Goblin civil war.

    Cosmic Games was incredibly dumb and bland. It was basically just running through the tropes with a really stupid character who couldn't make basic decisions, but making him look good by putting in even stupider characters. It was mostly grammatical and readable, though, and will probably do well, sigh.

    I really liked Dawn of the Void. You may as well bump it down on your list and wait for the published versions now, though. I just really enjoyed reading it while it was coming out and it has a solid ending, which never happens.

    Wake of the Ravager is inconsistent, and the auto got pretty bored with it, as is his wont, but it has its moments, and he may edit it into something decent. I'd try the published versions that are coming out now/shortly. If you want to read something by Macronomicon, I recommend  Apocalypse, Generic System (more or less complete) or his ongoing but long Industiral Strength Magic.

    I bounced off Quill & Still. I like some of the author's stuff, but think the author often writes for themselves and not for others, it's incredibly specific stuff. I keep an eye on the author and hope they branch out a bit. They hang out here, I think.

    Can't stand Ar'Kendrithyst. In general I find the kind of pollyanna protagonists like that to be highly obnoxious. People who try to fix the world in a high-handed manner typically wind up messing it up. I also kind of hate OP but ineffective protagonists, I'd prefer underpowered but try their best. I also thought the politics was obtrusive in spirit (lots of opinions) but kind of incoherent, the daughter is a wannabe CIA agent and the dad is a weirdo passivist, but not something semi-interesting like a Quaker or a Buddhist. But people often love this story and it's been a long time since I read (a bunch) of it.

    Double Blind is weird. The timeline is certainly weird, it's one of those books like Pact that take place in a few endless days. (Basically like that old show 24.) It has some really great stuff and I love the antagonists (alphabet soup agents make great antags). Many of the characters are memorable, the stakes always feel high, the protagonist has interesting issues without being totally edgy, and the system is pretty cool. That said, feel like the author got in over his head and needed to simplify, resolve plot threads, and move things forward with an outline. It's the kind of story that is easy to get away from you, especially writing serially, and it looks like the author stalled after keeping up a punishing output for a long time. A really smart author and a cool story, but feel like it may not be brought to a conclusion. 

    My two cents on  your upcoming reading.

      Is Dawn of the Void worth reading after the whole >!100 powerups in a matter of minutes and instant scaling to late game or second system etc.!<  

      That portion just turned me off of the entire progression phase of the story.

        Yeah. It's kind of a breath of fresh air, in my opinion, if the story stayed on the track it was on it would get into the same slog that every PF is and never finish. They get a little period of cakewalk for a time. There's more rejiggering and system stuff later and alot more exploits,battles, and strategy. It's pretty confidently ritten, I'd say, I was surprised as for a period I did think he'd made a mistake giving so much power. But I also think a lot of PF makes a mistake by sticking to the same stuff for way too long.

      I bounced off of Apocalypse, Generic System the first (two?) times I tried it. I think I had just read something else right before that where the MC gets maimed very early in the story, and for whatever reason this bothered me a lot when it happened to Jeb right away.

      I could try it again at some point.

        I guess I get that. It's kind of just a (relatively minor) distinguishing element of the MC, the story is not grim in tone overall and the MC isn't there to suffer.

    Primal Hunter is popcorn, but also has more of its story removed to sell than is currently available. I can't in good conscience recommend starting it now. Its acceptable if you had caught up before the chapters started to get removed, but at this point I wouldn't bother.
    And I read the chapters every weekday that they come out, it's ok. 

    Like I really like Beware of Chicken, Virtuous Sons etc, but it's hard to recommend them to people as like more and more ends up only available if you pay for it. Like good for the authors and all, but it is hard to get into for someone who learns about the series later.

      Another annoying aspect is Amazon's forced exclusivity period starting months before the novel is available on the platform. So you end up with situations where say chapters 1-50 are available on Kindle unlimited, 51-75 are pending publication (but pulled from RoyalRoad), and then 76-current are available.

        That bit me in the ass recently. I had fallen behind I Am Going To Die In This Game-like Dimension, and hadn't quite finished book 4. Which then gets pulled while the ebook version isn't yet available. I should either catch up or just wait for the ebook version for the final book 5 of the series.

      It's also hard to get into for someone who learns about it *earlier*. In my experience, authors often rewrite the story in small and large ways with the published release, then as they continue to write the story they follow the new canon with subsequent chapters. This can lead to the web novel readers slowly getting a less and less coherent story as the version they read at release matches up less with the new chapters. 

      Feels like most of the time the web novel + published version combo results in every reader on both platforms losing out in the end. Can't begrudge an author for doing it, gotta put food on the table somehow, but there's a chasm between "not begrudging" and "enthusiastically supporting." At this point I typically just drop any web novel that announces a published version before the web version is finished.

      I mean, if you put your hand out, teh internets will probably provide. You can drop me a line and I can typically help out with requests if you don't want to or can't go digging.

      Broadly speaking, though, I think the fact that some money is coming into this area has meant much better stories overall. When I started reading junky online stuff (let's just call a spade a spade) the environment was much more impoverished. There were a couple gems, but the fact that people can make money means there are some decent and fairly committed authors creating weird stuff that I like. So I can't begrudge.

        royalroad.com was created so people could share fanfiction about the Korean webnovel, The Legendary Moonlight Sculptor, that is pretty mediocre. The fact that we can get some actual good, original content from it now is mindboggling.

    Of those that I've read:

    - The Perfect Run - This was a great read, would definitely recommend
    - Edge Cases - Great fun, deeper than the blurb might suggest, strong +1 
    - Quill & Still - de-rec (dropped after Chapter 30). Great premise burned by poor characterization.
