## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I seem to have run into an issue regarding what happens when you have a galaxy with multiple intelligent civilizations, ubiquitous FTL, but only one civilization surpassed K1 by the time of said FTL, meaning that said civilization outpopulates all the others combined by a factor of 2000, being generous to the smaller civilizations.

  It's supposed to be a tentative Pax Galactica, where technology permits nondestructive solutions to a majority of problems that would otherwise be resolved through violence, effectively post-scarcity, the lowest population worlds extra peaceful courtesy a mix of native culture, the tech, and probably convenient timing of contact.

  Aside from such a massive population ruining some plot-points, it raises a few issues, the most glaring of which is the massive power imbalance. There's US states getting 2 senators when a couple cities outpopulate some states, then there's 2000:1, or more accurately, 200000:120:20:15:5. I could put half of the big civ into Virtual Utopias and the problem would be unaffected.

  There's also the slight problem of whether or not any propulsion lasers still exist, or how difficult it would be to police their production. The level of Orwellian  surveillance necessary to track everything that could be used to sneak off, build a superweapon, and bring it home is mindboggling. (FTL is designed such that it does not work as kinetic weapon, there is somewhat Orwellian surveillance in place to catch more easily-detected locally-made weapons, nothing that could stop someone from flying off somewhere, making a bunch of gunpowder, and coming home with viable gunpowder weapons, but those would be caught before entering effective range. By the time anyone notices that someone brought a megalaser home, it doesn't seem implausible that it could have already been fired.)

  It also seems likely that, due to the numbers, these people would be a supermajority *everywhere*, unless there is a strong disincentive to emigrate or vacation to certain places. I can imagine a "minimal impact" policy that would discourage supermajorities of this group from popping up on inhabited planets, but I don't want them to just not be elsewhere *at all*. If there's some kind of quota system, I'm not sure how it would be enforced, or how the enforcers would decide who gets to go to a protected place.

  I'd also like to minimize things that look like totalitarianism, and while I can see FTL-capable vehicles being manufactured with automated reporting, and *maybe* (big maybe) some way to be overridden remotely, actually using that for anything short of preventing terrorism and warcrimes is anti-preferred. It probably helps that, while things overall are post-scarcity, FTL-capable vehicles might still be costly to obtain. Given a K2-sized civ that could use FTL to set up production anywhere, I'm not sure how believable that is, but I suppose production might be artificially limited due to the impossibility of effectively policing.

  I'm sure there are other issues not coming to mind at present. Feedback on how to deal with this is appreciated.

    Here's the vague outlines of an idea.

    The most populous civilization - let's call them the Heralds - was the one to develop the FTL and distribute it to the other civilizations.

    The Herald's FTL engines are obtusely designed and basically unserviceable except by trained Herald technicians. The technicians are almost cult-like in their secrecy. There are plenty of alien firms who have built knockoff drives, but those are still heavily based on the Herald Drives, and the software is just a straight copy. The knockoffs tend to be unreliable, and the Heralds refuse to service drives that weren't made by them, so the knockoffs aren't very common anyways.

    The minority civilizations grumble about this economic control, but the Heralds provide the engines at a fair price and repair them incredibly cheaply, so there isn't a strong economic incentive to invest the huge amounts of capital needed to R&D a new non-herald design from scratch. (And the Heralds sabotage such projects.)

    Why all this effort to maintain control of the FTL engine tech? Because each engine has the mind of a Herald inside. Choose either an AI based on a scanned Herald mind, or some sort of nasty biotech stuff, depending on your preferred aestethic. 

    These engineminds  monitor the cargo of the ships they're warping, and if they catch a whiff of anthing dangerous (like a megalaser), well... everyone knows that FTL ships just sometimes never arrive at their destination. Oh well. That's a danger of the technology.

    >There's US states getting 2 senators when a couple cities outpopulate some states, then there's 2000:1,

    That's why there are states (as well as The House). And now I'm wondering how the other branches work. (Judges?)

    How fast is FTL? (IRL, ruling Earth might take more than 1 army because you can only get around so fast.) This, and how far apart habited/habitable planets are will shape a lot of things.

  How would a battle play out between a superpowered army consisting of only said superpowered infantry and a combined arms land force(Armor, artillery, infantry) of equal numbers? In this scenario, the superpowered army is assaulting an enemy city from the north.

  The powers range from standard elementary powers to classic sci-fi energy shields (health bars, really) to 'hax' like teleportation and intangibility. In general, the firepower or protection offered by the powers are not significantly more powerful than the military equivalent, but packed within an infantry's associated cost and benefits. It is also notable that they haven't received much formal training, so a strategy would likely to be more effective if they played to the individual's strength rather than advanced military knowledge and steadfast discipline.

  One likely plan of attack would be infiltration in my opinion. Send a small team of select powers to the city and scout out the positions, numbers and leadership, capturing important people and sabotaging where possible, eventually weathering down the opposition until a direct confrontation is trivial. However, I feel a strict entrance/exit control can easily shut it down without including power that is excessively powerful.

  How would you suggest an order of battle?

    The details of any such conflict are highly dependent on what specific powers the super side has. 

    But [this page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMagicVersusTechnologyWar) has a list of works that might serve as inspiration.

    I'd have to wonder how open and empathetic these Amazons would be to having/helping a man in their territory. In order for a group of people to self segregate as these Amazons do, they'd have to have fairly strong opinions about their outgroup/s, I'm having trouble rationalizing how this wouldn't ultimately be driven by strong negative prejudices towards men. If you were to frame this by race instead of gender, the Amazons would essentially be an ethnostate which I think kind of de-romanticizes this scenario and alludes to what sort of people self segregate to this degree. I'm just imagining how a black person walking into a white ethnostate would be received and I'm not seeing empathy and acceptance. Perhaps the Amazons and the guy could use each other to work through their toxic ideologies and misconceptions together, but I could just as easily imagine the guy having his toxic ideas reinforced after being met with bigotry from the Amazons (which could be an interesting way to challenge him later in the story after having made progress away from his own toxic behaviors/beliefs). Maybe a matriarchal society would work better to represent what the Amazons are meant to represent without the baggage that a uni-gender society would carry? Also, if there's going to be polyamory that isn't purely between women, what sort of birth control is available, if any?

        \>Perhaps an important facet I failed to emphasize is that the 'amazons' are, like, decent people in general. Is that hard to believe? ...  They see the other cultures as misguided and orthogonal to their own culture, but not from a bigoted perspective.

        &#x200B;

        I guess my point is that for full segregation like they have, it's going to take a little more than minor cultural differences. Not allowing any men in their society would require them to believe all men are incapable, on a biological level, of integrating into their society, so much so that they are clearly getting rid of their male children (unless they only produce females?). Even if the segregation is somehow purely ideological, you could relate it to immigration bans on Muslims, and depending on your views there, it might not cast a very flattering light on the Amazons. If you're preventing anyone that subscribes to a specific ideology from entering your society you must think their ideology is extremely abhorrent, which is either because it is that abhorrent or there's bigotry involved (and the beliefs of the non-Amazons doesn't sound that bad).

        &#x200B;

        \>I'm curious why you ask.

        Your description of the Amazon's society felt kind of bonobo-esque (very sexually active) but it also sounded like they only use men when they want babies. If you intend to have the guy have sex with the Amazons and for them to be open to this it's either cuz they want babies or they have some means of birth control so it isn't a factor, idk. Also, if the society is all female maybe they're aborting male children? I don't remember why I even asked that part.

    When designing these civilizations, I'd think about birth-rates, and what it takes to have a stable population.

    Up until the modern era, the average woman had around 5-7 kids over her lifetime.  This creates an *incredible* amount of pressure for civilizations to expand.  A farmer's first son might inherit his farm.  But the 2nd and 3rd sons need to go out and find their own land.

    Failing that, they become tenant farmers somewhere, and have to live on denser and denser plots of land, until they can't feed themselves. This is a major factor in why Europe was able to have so many wars.  Sure, war sucks.  But if the alternative is slow starvation as a subsistence farmer, war gets more appealing.

    So, my first question is why your Amazons haven't had their lands annexed by their faster-growing neighbors.

    You could do it.  Maybe the Amazons live on the other side of a river or something, and this provides a natural boundary line.  The Amazons respond harshly whenever someone tries to carve out even a small farm in 'their' woods.  But that's going to have a duality.  You're nice to *your* people, while being willing to murder the poor 3rd son of a farmer who's trying to get himself a half-acre of land and not hurt anyone.
