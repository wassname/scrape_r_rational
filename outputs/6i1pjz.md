## What *irrational* fiction do you enjoy?

### Post:

Books, movies, t.v. shows, general literary concepts, whatever. What fiction do you enjoy that doesn't make any rational sense?

  Anything and everything by Brandon Sanderson is incredible. Words of Radiance in particular is amazing

    Sanderson has yet to write a story I didn't like, but Mistborn is my favorite fantasy series of all time. Even the sequel series The Alloy of Law is great pulp adventure.

      I actually enjoyed alloy of law more, it just felt better written to me
      ```

        I don't know if it's better *written*, but I certainly find it more *fun*. Even when it pulls a Deus Ex Machina it feels intentional for a pulpy story like this, it's supposed to be kind of goofy. The action, comedy, mystery, and chemistry between the characters are all hugely enjoyable and know exactly how serious to take itself. I love the occasional shout outs to the penny dreadful.

          I was shouting and belly-laughing in my empty apartment at the climax of Bands of Mourning. Fuckin incredible.

      Mistborn's probably the only Sanderson story I can't stomach. Dunno, all the characters just feel so flat and cliche.

      WoR on the other hand I think I read at least 4 times.
      ```

  - u/tonytwostep:
    ```
    I'd have to think more about WoR, but is Mistborn really *ir*rational fiction? I think it hits most if not all the sub's descriptions of RF:

    * Sanderson typically uses "hard" magic systems, aka ones with very clearly defined rules, and sticks with them throughout the series (even if the reader doesn't necessarily know all the rules at the beginning).
    * Problem solving is done through intelligent application of resources, particularly in the first book (there's a lot of creative use of very specifically defined powers, such as the ability to mentally push against metals)
    * Factions are driven into conflict by their beliefs/values - one of the main themes of the series is exploring what actually motivates the "heroes" and "villains", and as we progress through the series its shown that with greater perspective, people become more defined by their beliefs than by a black and white morality. Not to get too spoilery, but [series spoiler](#s "even the "deities" aren't purely Good or Evil, but instead are of Ruin and Preservation, which are essentially avatars of specific beliefs")
    * I'd have to go back and reread to confirm, but I can't remember any character actions that occurred just because 'the plot required it'; to my memory, they all occurred for very plausible reasons.

    Just because it wasn't explicitly written as RF, doesn't mean it couldn't be considered as such.

  I'd be hard-pressed to name an enjoyable book that was true nonsense or without reason, but for *alternative* sense and *alternative* reason, the obvious classical recommendation would be Lewis Carroll, e.g. The Hunting of the Snark (read it aloud!).  Lord Dunsany is also good for this.

  Longer books that make alternative sense:  *A Wizard of Earthsea* by Ursula K. LeGuin, *One for the Morning Glory* by John Barnes.  Those continuities both have consistent alternative epistemology that's depicted as working inside them, but isn't rational epistemology, but isn't horribly annoying either.  Some elements of that in Terry Pratchett too.

        I agree, the book was good but damn did it make me feel like shit. I doubt I'll ever pick up the sequels

          It gets better.

          I mean, it gets worse in book 2. Book 3 though.
          ```

          - u/Imperialgecko:
            ```
            Yeah I think its just too emotionally draining for me to finish
            ```

    - u/waylandertheslayer:
      ```
      I've read the first two books only so far, and I feel like the setting was wasted on incredibly unlikeable characters. The lack of growth for the main character throughout is almost unbearable.
      ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        Quentin Coldwater? I'll give you that, though he didn't seem as bad as all that in my recollection. It didn't bug me that much in the books, but it stalled me out when I tried watching the SyFy series... and there he's actually one of the least annoying of the group.

        But in terms of rational/irrational?
        ```

        - u/waylandertheslayer:
          ```
          Irrational enough to make me stop reading. [Spoilers for the ending of book one ](#s "Quentin has the following information: he's being manipulated by a time traveller, so he can't take anything she says/does at face value. Time travel is possible and he has a lead on who made a time-travelling device (the dwarves). He's super sad about Alice dying. What does he do? He mopes around and feels sorry for himself. It's the only story where I've actually felt like Quirrell's 'Nobody ever cared about anyone else' speech was accurate.")

          [Spoilers for the ending of book two ](#s "The afterlife is a shitty place, but it was made that way by other magicians. UNSONG ruined that part of the plot for me, but I can kind of overlook Quentin not reevaluating his cached thoughts in that situation. However, there are plenty of other things that he really wants but doesn't put *any* effort into getting, and not for any deep and meaningful reasons either. Quentin's just fucked around with a bunch of Elder Magic Bullshit, has access to a lot of powerful mages, and doesn't put *any* effort whatsoever into fixing things. There's an incredible asspull about how he doesn't get to go to 'double Narnia' and he just goes 'oh, time to be sad again.'")

          And this is after we're repeatedly told, not shown, that he's supposed to be some super-intelligent wonderboy. Quentin's character can be divided into two parts - how he acts, which is pretty much just 'whatever it takes to drive the plot', and how he feels, which is pretty much just 'depressed/horny/depressed' with occasional breaks for alcohol or drugs.

          ...in summary, I don't really like Quentin that much. He starts off as an interesting and flawed character, then wallows in those flaws for two books without improving much. Every time it looks like he's taken a step in the right direction, he just backslides.
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            I'd recommend you read the third book, even though you felt that way. Maybe especially since you feel that way. I think most of his growth/change/redemption is loaded into the last book.

            But I never really disliked Quentin, because he reminded me of myself, so take what I say with a grain of salt.
            ```

            - u/waylandertheslayer:
              ```
              I might look at it, but to be honest I'm at this point thoroughly uninvested in the story. Perhaps it'll be like with book two, where after a few months I start thinking 'but the setting was good, I want to read more about that' and then pick it up anyway.
              ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            Quentin is never supposed to be some super intelligent wonder boy.  He's pretty explicitly supposed to be a pretty good but not particularly remarkable magician who happens to have a lot of opportunities that other magicians do not.
            ```

            - u/waylandertheslayer:
              ```
              In the context of other magicians, sure. In the context of an average person, he's supposed to be very smart indeed (e.g. look at the start of the first book).
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                Ehhhh, he's supposed to be pretty smart and academically inclined; this more or less matches up with his character and the way he behaves.  He's definitely not supposed to be the smartest person on the planet or anything like that.
                ```

                - u/waylandertheslayer:
                  ```
                  I don't feel like his intelligence matches his behaviour, personally. I can't think of a single point where Quentin does something genuinely clever. On the other hand, we also get very little insight into his thought processes, and his decisions are almost entirely formed based on what the plot requires, so it's probably just an offshoot of that.
                  ```

                  - u/None:
                    ```
                    Which of his decisions aren't the result of him seeking an escape from the real world?  The author doesn't spell out Quentin's motivations, but it's right there in the text if you do any analysis whatsoever.
                    ```

                    - u/waylandertheslayer:
                      ```
                      >seeking an escape from the real world

                      That's an incredibly broad description. It covers pretty much every possible action he could take other than going back to not being a magician (which, incidentally, he *does* do at one point). Is being a drug- and booze-fuelled party animal an escape from the real world? If he were really trying to escape from the real world, why not join Alice in magical research at that point?

                      Quentin doesn't ever properly plan, is seldom aware of what he's trying to achieve through his decisions, is very shortsighted, and generally doesn't come across as competent or smart in terms of how he steers the plot.

    I actually got most of the way through a rational alternate ending for LeGuin's *The Farthest Shore* (third book in the Earthsea series). I might see if I can finish it today, but here's the work in progress: [The Path to the Farthest Shore](https://docs.google.com/document/d/117SC9zOYhLX4mkyK3RBVV5HB0uDEm0i1gaIzMoIpTyQ/edit?usp=sharing) (4,400 words at the moment). Spoilers for the book, obviously.

    I loved the series when I was younger, but *The Farthest Shore* really annoyed me when I recently reread it. Much of the dialogue before the perspective character (Arren, true name Lebannen) interjects is directly adapted from the book, including how Ged treats one of his closest friends.

    My take on it hopefully doesn't require any background for the series, but it probably helps. I tried to rationalise the characters rather than the setting, because the setting's irrationality is part of its appeal.

  Abridged Series. By their very nature, they tend to be pretty irrational, mocking and exaggerating the plot holes and characterizations of the canon materials to extreme lengths or reinventing the characters entirely to make them even more crazy and funny.

  Friendship is Witchcraft, DBZ Abridged, Hellsing Abridged, SAO Abridged, etc.

  Along the same lines: Darths and Droids and D.M. of the Rings are also enjoyable.

    There's a Fate/Stay Night Abridged series that started recently, it only has 1 episode so far, but it's really good.

    Have you tried Death Note Abridged? It has merit for sure.

    ```
    There's a pretty good [Bleach Abridged, too.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yn5HRpTDWXo)

    They started re-doing their older episodes with better quality.  That link is to the re-do of episode one.  They made it past the whole soul society arc in like 12 episodes, and nothing of value was lost.

  Quite enjoying Malazan Book of the Fallen. Here's the opening of the current chapter I'm on. No spoilers. 


  There is something profoundly cynical, my friends, in the notion of paradise after death. The lure is evasion. The promise is excusative. One need not accept responsibility for the world as it is, and by extension, one need do nothing about it. To strive for change, for true goodness in this mortal world, one must acknowledge and accept, within one’s own soul, that this mortal reality has purpose in itself, that its greatest value is not for us, but for our children and their children. To view life as but a quick passage along a foul, tortured path – made foul and tortured by our own indifference – is to excuse all manner of misery and depravity, and to exact cruel punishment upon the innocent lives to come. 

  I defy this notion of paradise beyond the gates of bone. If the soul truly survives the passage, then it behooves us – each of us, my friends – to nurture a faith in similitude: what awaits us is a reflection of what we leave behind, and in the squandering of our mortal existence, we surrender the opportunity to learn the ways of goodness, the practice of sympathy, empathy, compassion and healing – all passed by in our rush to arrive at a place of glory and beauty, a place we did not earn, and most certainly do not deserve. 


  The Apocryphal Teachings of Tanno      Spiritwalker Kimloc      
  The Decade in Ehrlitan       


  It's a pretty close articulation, if not perfect, of one of the major issues I have with an afterlife which I don't think very many people religious or otherwise even are aware of or accept.

    ```
    I'd say Harry Potter and the Natural 20 is pretty similar. It's like rationalist fiction, except that all the lessons they teach don't apply to real life. It's all munchkinning and genre-savviness.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      I'd call HP and the Natural D20 pretty rational. Not rationalist, but that's a whole different ball of Aesops.

  - u/LupoCani:
    ```
    Alt-rational? I have not heard that one before. Could you elaborate?
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      I just coined it in an attempt to describe the ... convoluted, hallucinogenic logic of Unsong. It's a brilliant work, and in part it seems like an utterly rational story about Qabala and Judeo-Christian biblical mysticism... but it keeps stepping off the edge of the cliff and keeping on going. And I just couldn't be arsed to keep finding my footing over and over again so I could follow it.

        Your cardinal error was assuming you *needed* to find your footing in the first place. Should have went for wings instead.
        ```

      - u/trekie140:
        ```
        I agree, but what really got me to stop reading wasn't that it went off the cliff but that I didn't enjoy what I found there. I know a lot of people like The Broadcast, but that just wasn't what I wanted from a story like this. Uriel's reveal about souls is what finally did me in, the story has just become unpleasant to read by that point,
        ```

        - u/ArgentStonecutter:
          ```
          Oh, you mean how he hung a lampshade on the philosophical zombie thing?
          ```

          - u/trekie140:
            ```
            Yeah. Him just deciding North Africans wouldn't have souls but retain all other aspects of being human was just distasteful and discomforting. Apparently he did it because souls are a limited resource for humans, but that isn't how souls have worked in literally any religion or mythology so it just seems random and bizarre.
            ```

            - u/ArgentStonecutter:
              ```
              Well, think about this: don't feel sorry for the North Africans, because they're just like every human in our world. Which I suspect is the point.

              > but that isn't how souls have worked in literally any religion or mythology

              The divine light as a computational structure isn't how most religions work either.

            - u/CCC_037:
              ```
              When I read it, it looked like Uriel did that in a genuine but misguided attempt to help; that without a soul, there was no person inside the body, leaving all of them philosophical zombies, who could *look like* they were suffering (from war, hunger, etc.) but without *actually* suffering because there was no-one there to suffer.

              (In other words, Uriel painlessly killed off an entire race of people to prevent them from suffering.)
              ```

            - u/CeruleanTresses:
              ```
              If I remember correctly, it wasn't that souls were a limited resource, but that consciousness was computationally expensive.
              ```

            - u/RMcD94:

              > distasteful and discomforting

              You know it's fiction right?
              ```

              - u/trekie140:
                ```
                Yes, the point is that it's fiction I didn't want to read so I stopped reading it.
                ```

                - u/RMcD94:
                  ```
                  Yeah and I'm saying that if you might want to check out your moral compass when horrific torture is fine but people lacking an irrelevant metaphysical feature is what bothers you.
                  ```

                  - u/trekie140:
                    ```
                    I pointed out I wasn't okay with The Broadcast either, Uriel's reveal was just the last straw after I was already considering dropping the story. I don't think whether I find a piece of fiction entertaining is an appropriate way to draw conclusions about my moral compass.

  I keep coming back to Doctor Who, though that may be childhood loyalty as much as anything. What I find in general is that I can stand scientific implausibility, and even self contradictory implausibility, and I can stand idiotic protagonists up to a point, but I can't stand protagonists who always fall through the same emotional flaws time after time after time, especially when ordinary people I know are capable of doing better.

At the very least you should watch The Husbands of River Song, that episode is fantastic.
