      It weirds me out that you're phrasing that as if I was part of that conversation. I wasn't; I wasn't even aware that conversation had taken place.

        Translation: /u/narfanator has altered the deal, pray he does not alter it further.

          damn, didn't realize I had that kind of authority. Feels... heady.
