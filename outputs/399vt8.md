## Warehouse 13. Rational or not?

### Post:

I'd like some feedback on this. It seemed pretty logical to me. weird stuff scattered around the world snag,bag,tag it, scp style.

  Hell no. Half the episodes' threats are caused by absolutely dreadful handling of artifacts. Sometimes, highly dangerous items fall off **shelves** with **no guardrails**, right next to countless **other** highly dangerous items that can react to each other. The warehouse would've gone up in flames centuries ago, possibly taking all of Earth with it.

  That aside, the artifacts operate on magic and "powers as the plot demands". You can't understand them, you can only rely on the technobabble the "smart" characters spout from some font of inner knowledge. 

  Not that the characters have much curiosity either, or sense of self-preservation. Nobody says "hey, maybe we should put some guardrails on this thing". People lie to each other, fail or refuse to communicate for contrived reasons, misuse artifacts, steal artifacts, **play** with artifacts, and utterly fail at the evil overlord list. They spend most of their on-screen time [juggling balls](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImprobableBehaviorTropes).

    100% this.

    I watched it on the reccomendation of a friend who described it as "SCP lite". The first episode alone had my eyebrows twitching in annoyance. The behavior of the Warehouse's agents when handling Artifacts should have gotten them killed a dozen times over at least, and if they had survived the mission by some stroke of luck, demoted to D-class and set to cleaning 173's room.

  There's no real method to the madness, though. I don't get the feeling that there's any coherent worldbuilding.

  The lack of any major artifact creation munchkinry by anyone seemed like a missing piece, especially since we saw the process of creation at least once in the show. There was also very little on the way of researching the specifics of how artifacts work and are created in any sort of scientific manner, which may or may not be possible, but it wasn't shown being attempted.

    Yeah. We did see an alternate timeline where such research was going on... but why couldn't we have the non evil people doing that sort of thing too? (well, minus the evil parts. You know what I mean.)

  ```
  There are no rules, and no real worldbuilding. I got sick of it after a few seasons as I always do with SyFy shows. Continuum is the only rational sci-fi show I can say I've seen on TV.

  No, the show is almost completely irrational. There was potential with the idea, but it was never taken anywhere. In fact, the use of artifacts within the show was almost explicitly "mystical" in the sense that they should not and cannot be understood.

  What I mean by this is that the effects of the artifacts were somewhat known, but causes and reasons were never investigated. In fact, there is a suggestion that they either should not be investigated or could not be. (Either suggestion would be irrational.)

  In addition to this problem, the setup of the world itself is unlikely. If their behavior is at all common then the world should have been destroyed a long time ago. But if the world was not destroyed, then that behavior would not be tolerated. This also applies to the other safety and methodological conclusions others have mentioned.

  Not rational. The closest thing to Rational W13 was the alternate timeline with what's-his-name running it as a scientific lab. And that version was flat out evil.

  Basically, I'd like to have seen a non evil version of _THAT_.

  As is, other than that there wasn't much of any sign of anyone going "hey, let's figure out how all this artifacting is going on, let's study these things, see how they actually work."

  I mean, some of that was implied to have happened at _SOME_ point in history, given some of the tech/etc that the Warehouse had access to... but there was nothing at all about an active research division, etc etc.
