## Mother of learning shaping exercises

### Post:

One thing I found very interesting about the mother of learning was the shaping exercises.  Each shaping exercise seems to try and take complex task and try and distal them to their simplest forms.  I am trying to come up with out shaping exercises.  

Divinatation

Foresight: take a automated dice roller and predict the roll of dice.  has the problem of false positives and general guessing if someone can come up with a better exercise please say.

Transmutation: The exercises in the story already are very good so I am trying to think of the next steps for them.

I would like a shaping exercise for dimension magic, teleports, illusion and soul magic. 

If anyone can come up with other shaping exercises that would be cool.

  I put way to much thought into this, but I'm not entirely sure that you can come up with shaping exercises for most of the things that you want. There is just too much complexity, it'd be like trying to break a complex algorithm down into assembly. It's technically possible, but not practical in a usable, on the fly, sort of way.


  Lets take illusion for example. An example shaping exercise for this would be something like changing the refracted color of a marble from red to orange. Because I don't have anything else to compare this to, to equal a DnD wizard's shitty first level illusion spell, silent image, the wizard would have to shape the refracted color of whatever size patch of air would be needed for the illusion. That's an insane amount of complexity, even without getting into how precise the illusion would have to be to not be obviously an illusion, or the other senses like sound and touch. A human going through time loops would literally become insane before mastering any of these fields through shaping, from what I understand of the Mother of Learning magic system at least. (Except maybe soul magic? Not well explored yet)


  TL;DR: It's easy to come up with shaping exercises, just decide how magic makes a thing happen, then break it down to the finest manipulation that you can.
