    You're the creator of RationalReads? Cool, nice work! 

    So, for this to work, I think it's important to notify people of new updates without much delay. That rules out crowdsourcing, no matter how we encourage people. The next option would be to pay mechanical turk to do it. 

    But I'm more programmer than anything else, so I'm leaning towards scraping the books' websites or RSS feeds. Most books I've found are either blogs, plain websites, or a publishing platform of some kind. I should be able to write one scraper *per type*, and re-use it for multiple books. For example, the same one can handle all 3 of wildbow's books. I can write another for anything on fanfiction. 

    I'll probably have these run every 5 minutes, and maybe make myself a little list of things that changed so I can check for errors once in a while. 

    Not to worry any potential authors: I'm not planning on scraping the sites *content*, just scanning for new entries and linking to them.

  Just to give you a heads-up, fanfiction.net in particular seems to frown upon people scraping their site. A friend of mine used to have a site that periodically (twice a day) pinged FF.net about a user-selected list of fics and generated an RSS feed of updates. It worked for a while, then they started blocking it.

  NOTE: See the clickable prototype above. Click links to get an idea for how the site might work

  So there are lots of great books being published. There are many publishing platforms, but many of the best authors like to control their content. It's super annoying to try to keep up with serial fiction. It would be nice if there were an app you could launch that would show you which books have chapters you can read. Like the podcast app, but for fiction. 

  The idea is to create a site and mobile app that make it easy to subscribe to books anywhere on the intertubes. 

  Features:

  - keep track of which chapter you are on
  - notify you when new chapters are posted
  - works no matter where the book is published
  - directly links to author's content
  - some kind of discovery of new books (although this isn't the main focus)

  My main questions:

  - Do you usually read on your computer, tablet or phone?
  - Would this be useful to you?
  - What other ideas does this give you?
