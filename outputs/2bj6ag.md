## [Q, Mk] What would you ask Loki? (Two Year Emperor)

### Post:

Jake of [The Two Year Emperor](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9669819/1/The-Two-Year-Emperor) fame has 8 questions that he's allowed to ask Loki. Loki is allowed to not answer, but if he does answer he must be truthful, complete, and non-deceptive. 

I know several things I'm going to have him ask, but there's a few questions I haven't accounted for yet, so I am seeking the Wisdom Of The Reddit.

What would you ask?

(EDIT: I'm experimenting with a new [Mk] == Munchkin tag. What do you think?)

  Since not-answers don't count against me, no reason to not shoot for the moon, at least to start out with - that's just good strategy. Besides which, each not-answer gives information, because you know that it's something that Loki can't or won't answer. I guess I would also see if boolean operators would work within my questions, so that I could get some more mileage out of them and acquire information, but I am guessing that wouldn't fly - still, no real penalty for trying, and hopefully he'd like my pluck. As for what I'd actually want answers to, with the caveat that I'm not thinking *too hard* about the precise wordings (I'm not sure if you've seen the Open Source Wish Project, but you need to be very clear about what it is that you mean, even if you have a guarantee that the answers will be truthful, complete, and non-deceptive).

  * Among all the things that I don't know, which piece of information would be the most advantageous for me to know?
  * Are there any potential useful allies that I do not currently know about, and how can I meet them? (possibly rephrase so that can't be counted as two questions - I'd be more specifically interested if there is dissent within the undead empire that can be leveraged)
  * Which of the people within the humanoid resistance is secretly working for the enemy?
  * What is the most easily accessible single point of failure for the undead army?
  * Where are all of the liches phylacteries located? (Which is hopefully considered a single question - figure that out first before blowing all of the questions on this one)
  * How do I turn the undead empire against itself?

  Rumsfeld gets a lot of flack for it, but the unknown unknowns are a very real thing, and those are the most important to ferret out if at all possible - it's just a matter of phrasing the question such that Loki is compelled to give you answers to the questions you don't know that you needed to ask.

  I'm not owed 8 answers. I'm owed 8 honest answers and 7 that are merely truthful, still left over from my last deal.

  Loki, of course, will decide which set of rules he wants to play by for each individual question, and there's nothing stopping him from deceiving me about which deal he's honoring.

  If I don't remember that, I'm screwed no matter what I ask.

  The number one wish is "Can I have more wishes."

  So I'd ask him "What easier relatively successful ways could I and the empire use to get favors or requests from various gods including you?" If there are other gods who Loki knows desire something and would aid who he could ally with that would be great, knowing exactly what Loki wants him to do to win favors like the cannons, answers and such would be helpful.

  Saving his life is also helpful. "What are the major ways in which it is likely or certain that undead will invade or subvert the defences of this city."

  Since Afi is scary.

  "What plans and schemes do the Liches have that are interesting to us?"

  I like the [mk] tag.
  ```

  - u/DeliaEris:
    ```
    Me too. However I think it would be more machine-readable if you formatted multiple tags like [Q][Mk].

- u/clawclawbite:
  ```
  Are their any gods besides you who are actively aiding the undead forces beyond granting spells?

  If so:

  Do they know about my background and homeworld?

  ```
  What are the 7 questions I can ask you to get the most advantage for myself out of this?
  ```

  - u/Zephyr1011:
    ```
    You would probably need to further define advantage. It's somewhat ambiguous as is. Does it mean greatest life expectancy for you? Greatest expected happiness? Greatest chance to defeat the dragua?
    ```
