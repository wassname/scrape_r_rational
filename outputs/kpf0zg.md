  I try to read this in relatively large chunks, as that makes the pacing seem much more reasonable (for me at least). The last chapter I read, they were trying to break the dungeon core, I think? Can anyone who is current advise on whether or not this would be a good place to read up to? The chapter name seems promising.

    136 dropped on Patreon and seems to be more or less the start of another arc, so yeah 2 months

    Yes, I would recommend this chapter. If you want to get a bigger chunk I would say next good point would be in (patreon spoiler) >!about 2 months!<

    It's hard to answer without spoilers. Personally, if I were following the strategy, I'd have thought 127 a better break point. I definitely believe other people will disagree though.

    No, I don't think so. Though better than any other recent chapters.

  I'm sad that the comments weren't all "I can't believe that Rain still hasn't leveled up!" :)

  - u/SleepThinker:
    ```
    Nobody would believe it if he did level up.

    ```
    I thought it was finally, he leveled up.

    Spoiler: He didn't.
