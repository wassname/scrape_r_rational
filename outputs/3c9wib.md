  Last week I submitted a one-shot parody of S1E21; several people asked for more and I had had a great time writing the first one, so here are three more.

    There are also stupid opponents. Are you planning to write about rational snakes too?
    ```

      Hadn't really thought about it, honestly. Maybe? It would pretty much mean "game over, SG-1 dies"...which might be interesting. We'll see, I guess. Thanks for the suggestion.

        Make it Baal. A few times he was *so close.* He was the best villain in the series. And he at least tried to be rational on several occasions.

        He was also a monumental troll, for a Go'auld.

        Rational Goauld who is not a crazy megalomaniac: Huh, you're clearly less technologically advanced than we are, but your planet makes a lot of neat stuff. We should set up a trade agreement.

        SG1 member: What a coincidence, that is exactly what our mission here is.

        Management: Dammit, start trying to kill each other or I'm deleting this universe!

  Thank you! I've seen first season of SG-1 and while liked the show because of different cultures designs I always had a lot of questions to the plot.

    You're welcome. 

    SG-1 is actually a lot better than most shows when it comes to being smart. For example, they actually do reverse-engineer some of the tech they capture so that in the later seasons they are flying spaceships of their own. There's still enough stupid to make for good parody, though.
