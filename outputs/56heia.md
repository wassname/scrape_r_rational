## Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

The Powers:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *clearly* defined rules that are consistent. The powers may be original or may be from an already realised story.

* The power to be munchkined can not be something broken like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

The Reverse Munchkin:

* In these scenarios, we will find ways to beat someone or something with a power which is, well, *powerful*.

The Problem:

* In which we solve problems posed by other users. Be smart and expect other users to be smarter.

Note; All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have been thrown back in time and somehow became ruler of a small feudal territory in a medieval era, and other lords and barons are watching to see you fail and take your territory. No one is going to outright invade, but you need to keep your territory running smoothly and producing wealth despite potential sabotage. What would you do?

  If you can't tell, I'm desiring recommendations on stories where a modern day person is sent back in time or to a more primitive world and attempts to improve it.

  P.S. /u/gods_fear_me have you considered letting the auto moderator do the posting from now on?

    Assume England at 1200 C.E.

    Pasteurization would be a big deal. I fund the building of small civic centers in every moderately large hamlet. Under a new law, all cow farmers may sell their milk on the market only if it has been "treated" by someone at a civic center that I have told how to pasteurize (the treating is free of charge).

    The civic centers also offer smallpox vaccination by cowpox. Before that, tests are done to determine the correct amount of cowpox dosage to insure smallpox immunity. The vaccination is distributed among the largest urban centers to begin with, but eventually are made available to the larger population.

    I believe that I could design a gravity based plumbing system that would be a moderately large boon to sanitation in urban centers. It wouldn't be perfect, but it would do much to slow the massive death tolls in cities at the time.

    These benefits to the health of my subjects would allow for larger cities. Using the funds from the "magic milk" that my farmers produce, I would begin further development of the central city of my territory. I don't know enough about engineering to allow for huge buildings, but a better plumbing system combined with sensible urban planning would allow for a continuously growing city larger than its neighbors. I fund the development of a few more large schools and offer tax breaks to literate citizens. The environment of the time wouldn't allow me to introduce chemistry or advanced biology yet, but it would still provide a greater base of educated citizens to generate innovation.

    To generate more wealth, I could provide a base form of insurance to nobles of the surrounding fiefdoms; they pay me money every year, and when their grain harvest isn't enough to feed its citizens, they get grain supplements from me, among other things.

    I'm not a huge military tech buff, but I could plant the idea of the cannon into the heads of some local craftsman and see what happens. Within a generation, I might have cannons (or something similar) at my disposal. I think I'm reasonably good with diplomacy, so that could reasonably suffice for a time.

    From here, I aim to alter educational, social, and economic systems such that, after my death, innovation and urbanization would continue. I get an heir and have him or her co-rule with me for a long period. I probably wouldn't take military action against other fiefdoms unless I had to.

    Sorry if it's a poor quality answer, I'm new at munchkin-ing.

      > Pasteurization would be a big deal.

      Pasteurization is very much a boon for increasing the shelf-life of milk.  However, that only became a concern when people started living away from freshly-squeezed milk during the industrial revolution.  Your subjects would likely all have their own cows or access to freshly produced milk, making the need for pasteurization limited to those not living on a farm, i.e. probably just you in your castle.

    It's probably better to find a ruler and cooperate with them than to try to do everything alone. Granted this would water down a lot of potential changes, but I think it's still net beneficial. With low tech, there's realistically not much you can do to monitor and prevent sabotage attempts from within. Major upheaval should be avoided, because if the locals are displaced and disgruntled by it then there's not a lot you can do to stop them. That means working within the established system.

    Munchinry: Go to a library, start with books on memory management/enhancement and end with the last book in the library. If you don't manage to remember the contents of a book, touch it again. Go to another library. After the first library, choose national libraries or university libraries. Read books on learning languages if you encounter a book of a different language. See if the power works on audiobooks. What counts as a book? See if you can print all the data from Wikipedia on a print that's barely enough to read from and bind it into a book or more than one if necessary. Don't expect all data from books to be accurate.

    > physically read the book cover to cover.

    How slowly?

    I imagine most people have a number of reading speeds, speedreading, casual reading, contemplative reading, etc. If you read a book cover to cover over the course of 10 hours instead of 5 I would say most people would soak more of it in.

    Also how does the outcome of this occur emotionally on you? Say you read something that makes you laugh, and cry, are you filled with all of the emotions at once?
    ```

    - u/TBestIG:
      ```

    Well, I'd just go into my local university library and run my fingers along the spines of the stacks.

    That should probably be sufficient, but I may book a trip to the Library of Congress. If there's a decay, I might try to procure books which are especially interesting to me.

    What would I do with that knowledge? Probably try to establish multidisciplinary connections in research. After all, I won't have encyclopaedic knowledge, but I should still retain enough to see how things connect and know what is and isn't applicable.

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    When you say it has the same effects on you mentally, I assume you mean in terms of your ability to remember it and not, say, making you extremely tired.

    If a book had an emotional ending, would you find yourself feeling that emotion after your speed reading? Would it be possible to mentally poison the speed-reader with a particularly disturbing or psychologically targetted passage inserted into a book?

    There's also potential munchkinry about what constitutes a book. If you pay somebody to stitch a bunch of books together you could read them all at once, though why you would bother when all you have to do is touch them is another matter.

    More importantly, if you could somehow manage to read Wikipedia you could absorb a lot of information, although you'd run up against normal human memory limits extremely quickly even with the world's best memory techniques.
    ```

    - u/TBestIG:
      ```
      The emotion while reading would affect you as much as it would directly after reading a book the regular way. I think one would have to have a lot of knowledge of psychology to write a book that could 'mentally poison' someone, as opposed to just disturbing them or putting sick images in their mind.
      ```

- u/ILL_BE_WATCHING_YOU:
  ```
  **From your perspective:**

  Your power gives you the ability to send exactly 1 bit of information back in time to the last time you used your power. It *appears* to function under the [Novikov self-consistency principle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle) That is to say, if you receive a 1 or a 0 from your future self, you will, for some reason or another, end up sending that exact same bit back in time. Each time you send a bit back in time, you immediately receive another bit from your future self. You never end up trying to create a Grandfather paradox. (Either you never got around to testing it, you always got cold feet at the last second, or it doesn't seem worth the risk to you.) You wonder if your power can be leveraged in any meaningful way.

  **In reality:**

  Your power works by splitting the timeline into two. In one(Timeline A), it feeds you a 1, and in the other(Timeline B), it feeds you a 0. These two timelines are otherwise identical. It lets the two timelines run until you attempt to "send" a bit of information back in time in one of them. This is actually a delusion on your part; your power does not actually send the bit back in time, it simply receives the input and compares it to the bit it fed you in the past. If the bit you attempt to send "back in time" is the same as the one you received, then it splits that timeline and repeats the process. If the bit does not match, then it ends the timeline. This is why it appears to follow the Novikov self-consistency principle; all timelines in which it doesn't are instantly deleted. You are unable to communicate with any of your copies in parallel timelines.

  Example: Suppose that in Timeline B(the one in which you received a 0) you attempt to "send back" a 0 to your past self. Since this matches the bit you were given in the past, Timeline B will instantly split into two timelines, Timeline BA and Timeline BB. In Timeline BA, your power then feeds you a 1, and in Timeline BB it then feeds you a 0. Timeline A still exists. There are now 3 timelines;

  Timeline A: In which you received a 1, and have not yet attempted to "send back" a bit.

  Timeline BA In which you recieved a 0, "sent back" a 0, and received a 1. 

  Timeline BB In which you recieved a 0, "sent back" a 0, and recieved a 0.

  If instead, however, you attempted to "send back" a 1 in Timeline B, that timeline would end, and only Timeline A would remain. (the one in which you received a 1) If you then tried to "send back" a 1 in Timeline A, it would split into two timelines, Timeline AA(in which you then receive a 1) and Timeline AB(in which you then receive a 0). 

  If there is only one remaining timeline running, and you attempt to "send back" a bit that is the opposite of the one you received, then your power will simply kill you instead of ending the timeline. 

  There is no limit to the number of timelines you can have running concurrently.
  ```

  - u/InfernoVulpix:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure I would kill myself with this.  Since I don't know how the power works automatically, all I know is that it appears to follow the Novikov self-consistency principle.  The reason I know that is because that's how it always happened, right?  But to learn that I'd need to experiment on my own.

    In fact, I wouldn't even know that it *was* time travel if all that happened was I sent the bit of information back and immediately got a new one.  For all I know there are aliens sending me single bit messages and watching when and how I respond for whatever reason.

    Since I know nothing about this power except for that I am receiving one bit messages and can send one bit messages, one of the first, most obvious things I would do is send the opposite of the received bit.  After all, maybe the aliens sending messages want me to show I'm not just repeating them.

    Boom, every timeline dies.  The simple fact of the matter is that I wouldn't go anywhere near munchkinry until I understand the powers I'm wielding, and I won't get that far without sending the wrong bit back and seeing what happens.  While you could argue that one of me would decide not to take the test, the difference between me that received a 1 and me that received a 0 is so minimal it wouldn't change the outcome of my decisions.

    *But*, let's assume I get past that hurdle.  Say I got a neatly wrapped information packet telling me everything you say I should know about this talent.  Here's something I'll end up trying, even if it doesn't make sense by what the packet tells me about the power.

    I'll sit down at a computer, refresh the message and get a 0 or 1.  I'll type it into a web page that translates between binary and decimal and repeat.  Dozens of 0's and 1's creating ludicrous amounts of timelines, but also forming a binary code in the translator.  The key here is that for every exponentially large number of timelines where I receive garbage info, there's a few timelines in which I receive coherent information completely by random (It is also likely that I receive 75% of a coherent sentence, and am prompted to continue until it 'completes').  One timeline might end up being warned about rain tomorrow (regardless of if it rains tomorrow or not), another might get a message predicting the death of a celebrity.

    Most of *these* messages are worthless garbage predictions as well, but since I've brute forced *every single possible binary code of that size* I'm guaranteed that every piece of information that I would consider an accurate prediction gets at least one timeline in which it is expressed.  The me in those timelines become convinced the power produces information ex nihilo, and do it more.  What's more, if I go into another set with a goal in mind, there will be a timeline with an answer that satisfies my 'question'.

    Among an incalculably large sea of disappointed and disillusioned failures to produce useful information, there will be at least one of me who can sit down at a computer, have a question in mind, and abuse time travel so hard that I get the answer out of nothing.  Impossible equations would fall before me.  The solution to the world's greatest problems in an afternoon, so long as I ask the right questions (and even then, my power could 'correct' me).  I could ask how to become supreme ruler of the world, and versions of me would hear *every possible way to do it*, with the methods even taking into account factors no one on Earth could predict.

    And, from inside the timelines, I would never even realize that I'm leaving thousands of me, millions of me, vigintillions of me, quantities of me we don't even have numbers for, stuck with garbage nonsense and a power they consider far less useful.  Some precious few of me will generate misleading information and resent my power for it, and there will be one poor sap who, every time he tries to get coherent information, ends up with the rickroll url.

  You've recently made a friend who, despite being well into high school, still has an imaginary friend he regularly associates with, to the degree of having conversations with her in public. Normally, you would find such activity strange, but this is different, because you can see her too. In reality, your friend was unwittingly granted temporary access to powerful magic, which he used to think up an imaginary friend who, thanks to the magic, is now very much real. The only problem is that neither of them believe this, believing her to be merely a strangely intelligent figment of your friend's imagination.

  Seeing as she exists only through vague magic, the conditions of her existence are as follows. She is invisible, inaudible, and intangible to everything and everyone save you and your friend, essentially existing in an overlapping plane to our own with you two being the only things to overlap. On her end, she can do pretty much anything, from pyrokinesis to matter creation, but the only things her powers can interact with are, again you and your friend. She rationalizes this as a) your friend made her, so of course he can see/interact with her, and b) you being clinically insane and out of touch with reality, interacting with some sort of overlapping copy of her.

  My challenge to you fine people: convince the imaginary friend of her existence. Bonus points for munchkinning her power, limited as it is.

  P.S. Sorry if the problem doesn't quite fit here, I'm a bit new to this sub, and thought this might be a place to crowdsourcing it (for reasons of defeating plotholes before they emerge)

    She definitely knows she's real, because what does she do when he's asleep?

    As for munchkining, any physically hidden information is yours. Cheating on tests is trivial. Winning the Randi prize is easy. There's definitely more exploits of the power as described...

    ...but I want to move onto questions. 

    Does the internet work in her "world"? Can she get a cell phone and look things up? Are there other other people there, and can she interact with them?

    If she's not intangible to you and your friend, how much force can she exert on you? Can she pick you up? If she makes fire, does it warm you? If she makes cold, does it cool you?

    Does "pretty much anything" include: Teleportation, telepathy, manipulation of time, manipulation of space, the creation of complex things you don't know how to make (cell phones, alzheimer's cures), tracking/tracing magics, learning/memory magics... I'll stop there.

    Are there types of magic she can do that imply things like souls (ghost summoning), or that animals have intelligence (talking to them)?

    Can she make friends that only exist in her world? Can she makes copies of herself? Can she make copies of "real" people (you, your friend).

    not really munchkinry, just my only real option:

    since it's a copy of me, the copy in the box will probably be too lazy to do super productive things for me just because I want them to do those things, and will feel safe and secure knowing myself to be in charge of the box, so they'll probably just faff around drawing butts until they get bored and start to despair for loneliness and ennui and then they'll get to work on getting out of the box

    so, speed up the me in the box, give them as much outside stimulus as I can to keep them as happy and informed and feeling connected as I can, sell their paintings of butts for a living (and any other productive work that isn't itself integral to keep for a larger goal, like any coding I might happen to get done, etc), and hope that they eventually figure out how to make us god

    if they ever despair too much, slow them down and talk through ways of making them feel fulfilled. Being boxed would be a really lonely soulcrushing experience for me so it would be a constant struggle.

    I'll assume that the me-in-the-box inhabits a nice virtuality (say at least a decent appartment), because sensory deprivation would be... bad.  And that I have a general purpose programmable computer in there, which runs at subjective time and can send and receive bytes from outside.

    Now I can partition my interests, and address the relevant subset with an internet-connected EM.  This is very useful, as I spend a lot of time working with computers...

    Presumably the black box should be secured in a reputable colocating exchange, for minimum latency and maximum throughput (ie multiple 10Gbps links).  It's probably worth spending a lot of time and money on hardware and caching strategies to reduce EM latency, since whatever the tolerable threshold is that maximises dilation of subjective time (even if you can 'sleep(10)' the EM).

    Pay for all of this with freelance development work.  Read a lot.  Watch movies.  Collaborate with physically-instantiated self.  Investigate telepresence :)

    Does this mean you also have insanely good reflexes? Are you always in slow motion?  Or is there some sort of automatic detection that is able to recognize when something "dangerous" enters your radius rather than a speck of dust or an air molecule.

    Additionally, if you're able to control temperature by controlling molecules, do you have to consciously apply your power on every molecule individually?  Or is there some sort of subroutine that you can call by wanting to "cool down the air" and then it understands that and applies your power to the necessary molecules.

    Does this have infinite processing power and can do anything no matter how complicated instantaneously?

    Does it have infinite precision?  If I flood the area with poison gas can it pick out and reject all of the poison particles while leaving the oxygen untouched?

    Does it work while you're asleep?  Do you have to tell it ahead of time what sorts of things to protect you from, because if so I can try all sorts of weird wacky things and hope you didn't think of one.  If not, how does it recognize "danger"?

    Depending on the results of the above, and the resources I have available (since "no upper limit" means you're capable of annihilating the earth, I expect every government on the planet wants you gone, so I expect to have a lot of support.)  I tentatively propose:

    chop your head off while you sleep

    nuclear bomb

    poison gas bomb

    flood the area with water (even if you keep it away from you with a 1 foot bubble, no new air will be entering the system)

    burn everything (locally to remove oxygen, or in a wide area to cause you to starve)

    poison your food, and/or use some sort of narcotics, depending on whether you can detect "poison" as a danger since you picking it up will give it momentum

    And so on.  I just have to hope that even if one of these does work it works quickly and you don't decide to annihilate the earth in revenge anyway because op op op op.

      Points like this bug me.  They remind me of the moments where Wile E. Coyote runs off the edge of a cliff and is magically running on air, but as soon as he looks down he starts to fall.

      Gravity doesn't work like that.  Sure, you can't walk on air, but what's *worse* is that the difference between walking on air and falling is whether Wile E. Coyote knew that gravity was misbehaving.  It's as if Wile E. Coyote could suspend the laws of gravity because he didn't know they were supposed to apply.

      Either this power over momentum works against all logic of reference frames, just like Wile E. Coyote could initially run on the air, or it never works like expected because of the problem of reference frames, just like when Wile E. Coyote falls to the ground.  But not both, and definitely not because they suddenly became aware that what they were doing was impossible.

    Its even more powerful than that.  If you have precise enough control, you can instantly cool anything to near absolute zero by completely nullifying the kinetic energy of the molecules that make it up.  Conversely you can super heat anything by increasing the kinetic energy of the molecules.
