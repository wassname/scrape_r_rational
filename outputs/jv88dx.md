## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've surprised myself this November by, on the whole, keeping up with NaNoWriMo, and I think part of what is helping with that is, 1) focusing less on writing something *good* and more on just writing, and 2) publishing what I write online so that I can track both my wordcounts and people's engagement.

  All that said, [To Hold Dominion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/37261/to-hold-dominion) is a xianxia-inspired (though not particularly xianxia-esque) high fantasy story about three characters from different worlds, and a mysterious tournament. I'm not writing it with any specific rationalist bent other than my own predilection for rational stories... Anyway, I'll copy/paste the Royal Road summary below, which might give a better idea.

  Cassiel is a student in the Valley of the Crystal Sun, doomed to obscurity and neglect because of her failure to fully integrate the vaunted Sunlight Crystals.

  Iyojin is a studious Weaver in the Paperhall, working to complete her new Chitin weapon in order to graduate, even as pressures mount.

  Lairas is a wanderer and a thief, and has just gotten away with the biggest theft of his life - stealing a Spirit of Slaughter from Wellspring Barrow.

  Their lives are about to become entangled, as each seeks achievement, insight, and safety in the mysterious Tournament - an event that will pit warriors from across the continent of Inara against each other for glory.

  Any recommendations for SF/F novels whose protagonists are in their 30s/40s and, like, secure in their lives? I know that's sort of an antipattern in the genre but I'm curious to see if there's a body of work that is rooted in self-knowledge and the sort of steadiness that seems to be so rare in the teen/early-20s protagonists.
  ```

  - u/rdalex:
    ```
    "Secure in their lives" would be hard to find unless you're specifically asking for slice-of-life. But you can look at Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga, which starts with Aral Vorkosigan and Cordelia Naismith in their 30's/40's. It then continues with the next generation for long enough that they, too, have whole books as fully adults.

    Eh, "read Bujold" is basically an evergreen rec at this point anyways.

    You can also look for Asimov, I don't think he ever wrote any character younger than thirty. I guess that's why Robot City was done by other people.

    You'll also find that  the "steadiness" you're looking for in character written as 40-somethings is as much an illusion in fiction as it is in reality. Because let's be honest here: none of us 40+ know what we're doing any more than we did when younger. We just fake it better and better.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Funny story: Bujold is how I met my wife, because it was in her OkCupid profile. So yeah, I've definitely read everything Bujold. (Even if Penric Deals With A Plague was just too goddamn on the nose.)

      But they are in fact among the perfect examples, because the kind of *supported* confidence that they bring to the page is really relaxing to me, and I'm glad that she brought that level of confidence and maturity to the other characters over time. (Ivan. <3 )

      But yeah, "read Bujold" is definitely an evergreen rec! And I'd say that "read Jemisin" might also qualify. And of course Marie Brennan and Jo Walton have written books from that perspective too.

    *Alloy of Law* and the other second-era Mistborn books (by Brandon Sanderson).  Wax is in the process of settling down from his adventuring adolescence.  He is starting to take his role as a Lord more seriously by undoing the damage that his neglect has caused, but discovers a new case which highlights the tension between his time as an independent lawman from the frontier and his central role in the city's economy and high society.

      Neat! Didn't think about these. Thanks!

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure *Blindsight* applies, Siri Keeton has a lot of other issues, but he's a professional established in his field.  Heinlein had a few that are good middle age characters: *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* and *The Cat Who Walks Through Walls* have middle and late middle aged main characters with an established life and second career.  Two more transhuman instances are *The Quantum Thief* trillogy and *Accelerando*.  A SCi-fi-ish fantasy or Lovecraftian sci-fi the Laundry files (YMMV but by Stross like accelerando) especially after book 2 deals with a Hacker/Necromancer/Spook working as a troubleshooter/middle management, with an special mention to *The Annihilation Score* which focuses on the PhD wife of the usual main Character dealing with the severe emotional trauma of her role in wetwork and her spooky effects on her husband while continuing to climb the greasy pole (yes they are both spooky spies).

    The [Quarter Share](https://www.amazon.com/Quarter-Share-Traders-Golden-Clipper-ebook/dp/B00AMO7VM4) series gets there eventually - by the second or thirdish book the MC is in his 30s and secure in his life. 

    The story is very slice of life, and the setting is kinda Horatio Hornblower In Space. 

    There's also the [EarthCent Ambassador](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K4I391A?ref_=dbs_m_mng_rwt_calw_tkin_0&storeType=ebooks) series, which again starts out with a 20something protagonist who's in her 30's or 40's within a couple of books thanks to time skips. 

    Also fairly slice of life, but in this case the books remind me of the more laid back Star Trek episodes - there's a focus on dealing with aliens, particularly because she's an ambassador from Earth on a trading station.

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    It takes a series to get there, but maybe Farseer series by Robin Hobb? The first series covers Fitz's life from adolescence to 20s, then the second series covers from his late 30s to beyond. IIRC the last series covers him in his 60s.
    ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      If I gave up on the first series because I was too frustrated with the main character's personality, would the second or third be worth trying?
      ```

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        Probably not. I haven't finished the second series, but from what I hear the main attraction towards to series is the flawed characters. Fitz keeps ruminating on his mistakes and takes steps to fix them, and then falls back to the same self-destructive behaviors that put him there.
        ```

          >I haven't finished the second series (...) Fitz keeps ruminating on his mistakes and takes steps to fix them, and then falls back to the same self-destructive behaviors that put him there.

          There's a plot reason why Fitz is stuck in that rut in the second trilogy. The end of book three heals that problem, so I'm curious to see if he grows more as a person in the third trilogy.

    You might enjoy Eight, on Royal Road. Protagonist is mentally mature and isekaied into an 8 year old's body.  The story stays away from uplift themes, and is more of a survival type story at first. It's not strictly rational though and has some woo-ish stuff.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Thanks for the rec! I'll definitely take a look, and I appreciate the woo-warning.

    There's Scalzi's *Old Man's War* which is imo a fantastic series and has a large amount of adult protagonists. Especially in the later books, the protagonist, Harry Wilson is very grounded, knows who he is, and not boring.
    ```

  - u/TMGleep:
    ```
    I'd recommend checking out The First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie.

    A few of the protagonists there are, well, perhaps mature is the right word. They certainly know who they are at the time the series starts, though some of them are trying really hard to deny it.

    It's brilliant, the characters are great, and it has the absolutely best depiction of a barbarian in fantasy literature history.

    Do be advised, though, that it comes with every trigger warning possible, which will still not prepare you for how grimdark and gritty it is.
    ```

  - u/sprague-grundy:
    ```
    "Secure in their lives" is a bit of a tall order, since characters need to want *something*.  I think the protagonist of the Skylark series has the steadiness you're talking about.  There's a few unsettled aspects of his life (e.g. a romantic plot), but he's very sure of who he is, which I think might be the property you're looking for.

    In general I think a lot of older sci-fi where the character is a professor will have this property.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Skylark the E. E. Smith series? I have made note, and thank you!
      ```

  - u/elysian_field_day:
    ```
    Malazan Book of the Fallen perhaps? To be fair, there is basically everything in there, you can have a protagonist who's lived through the ice age! Doesn't get much more settled than that!

    But yeah jokes aside a lot of the characters are mature adults, not settled in the slice of life way mostly as the books tend to focus mostly on wanderers, soldiers and people in times of great societal change (a feeble attempt to cram the awesome, humongous storyline into some sort of category) but there is a distinct lack of YA-ness even in the young adults that do play a role (it takes like five chapters in the first book for the young officer the story follows early on to get murdered in an alley).

    A lot of the characters are fairly sure of their place in life, and settled in their mindset - responsible adults surviving in a dangerous world, basically.  
    FYI the books get very dark at times, but they are also *excellent.*

  I saw the movie [Circle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3118452/) (on Netflix) some time ago and really liked it.

  >Held captive and faced with their imminent executions, fifty strangers are forced to choose the one person among them who deserves to live.

  Essentially a group of strangers from a pretty wide cross-section of society (race, gender, sexual orientation, wealth, etc.) must convince each other who to kill for one of them to stay alive. They're stuck in a room, each in a small circle, and can't move. They can only interact by talking, so we (as the audience) have to judge each of them based on their values and biases.

  The only thing I didn't really like was >!the end should have been left more open-ended!<. But other than that the movie was enjoyable.

  ---

  I've been reading [Gorae Byul - The Gyeongseong Mermaid](https://mangadex.org/title/41161/gorae-byul-the-gyeongseong-mermaid) and I really like it. It's a manhwa (Korean comic), but I feel like it's a good fit here, mainly because of the characters. Similar to the above, we really examine their goals and motives.

  >"If the life that you had regained, was one that I had breathed back into you… Is it too much to hope for you to love me back with that life?" The year is 1926, in Japan-occupied Joseon. 17-year-old Soo-a is an illiterate handmaiden working for the household of a prominent Japanese collaborator. One day, she discovered an injured young man lying unconscious at the beach, an independence activist called Eui-hyeon. The sweet and innocent Soo-a nursed him back to health, and Eui-hyeon told her the tale of the "Little Mermaid", a princess of the sea who saved a prince from his death. Having fallen in love with Eui-hyeon, Soo-a was determined to meet him once again. But she knew not then, of the fate that awaited the "Little Mermaid" on her quest to reunite with her beloved.

  It's very grounded, and shows Korea under Japanese rule, the Korean independence movement, and the people caught in between.

    I saw, or close enough, Circle a while back and it always kind of confused me. >!The ending just demonstrates humanities intrinsic selfishness, which isn’t really a new or interesting concept.

  - u/Tenoke:
    ```
    I watched it before based on multiple recommendations here and do see why it gets mentioned.
    ```

  - u/dogcomplex:
    ```
    So, I think this might be by the same creators as Circle, but there was a fairly-decent webseries called The Vault where a bunch of college students are locked into individual rooms and have to figure a way out of an elaborate escape room puzzle (which gets weirder and weirder).  

    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC4D2F8A427AB8B85

    If I recall - somewhat clever, and a really cool concept.  Sometimes get annoyed at the chars for being a bit slow, but overall interesting.  Imo better than Circle (which I thought was a bit one note and heavy handed), but not without its own flaws

    (Note: I agree with disrecommendations below, though thought it still had some merit)
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      Having just watched The Vault, I'm going to disrecommend it. The characters are not just slow, they're [Holywood zombies](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level1intelligent). Most of the runtime serves no purpose, it's a god-damn mystery box. And the ending was a cowardly mystery box, leaving most questions unresolved and not building upon the rest of the show at all despite the narration trying very hard to pretend otherwise.
      ```

  Couple of short things I wrote:

  [Timeless Love](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/jtipl7/timeless_love/), a post-canon HPMOR flash-fic. How would HPMOR!Harry react to being dosed with a love potion?

  [Extra Shiny](https://www.reddit.com/user/Roxolan/comments/hthwp9/extra_shiny_an_ai_dungeon_luminosity_fanfic/), an early attempt to write GPT-3-assisted rationalfic that immediately turned into a rationalfic parody. I kept track of which part were written by me and which by the AI, which I found interesting.
  ```

  - u/Weerdo5255:
    ```
    Ha, that's HPMOR Harry alright. Looking at this someone really needs to get him drunk as well. I like the internal recognition that utility analysis is impaired, but in the impaired state being unable to fix it in a reasonable fashion. 

    Mind altering substances are a bitch to logic around even going in prepared, hence the term mind altering.
    ```

  - u/JohnKeel:
    ```
    I feel like I have to complain- Timeless Love really abuses the term “precommitment”. Unless there’s some external compulsion to follow through, what you’re describing is regular commitment, backed only by willpower (and possibly by devotion to the rule of not breaking commitments).
    ```

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      I get what you mean, and appreciate your comment. 

      But it's often used in a not-literally-compulsive sense in the LW community. Since e.g. a human can't physically force their future self to one-box Newcomb but we still need a word for "strongly deciding" to one-box, such that Omega can predict your future actions and find you one-boxing. [The wiki](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/pre-commitment) calls it "effective pre-commitment" (as opposed to a "formal pre-commitment").

      Since Harry had not promised in advance to ignore mind-control-induced desires, he can't retroactively stake his devotion to promises on it. Well, he can under some decision theories, but in this fic he does not.
      ```

      - u/JohnKeel:
        ```
        Even so, that's not the standard terminology, and there are perfectly good ways to describe deciding on something strongly in advance (perhaps, say, "committed to doing x"...)

        I get your intended meaning, I just really don't like the phrasing.

        ETA: In particular, "precommitment" being Odysseus tying himself to the mast rather than just deciding he really doesn't want to jump into the ocean is a valuable distinction to have, and watering it down in this way seems unhelpful.

          Brilliant.

          She doesn't owe mind-controlled Harry anything, and non-mind-controlled, non-blackmailed Harry has been willing to be obliviated for a good cause, but also she'd want to be the kind of person Harry can trust implicitly...

    If you can stand what is probably one of the worst translations ever applied to an otherwise excellent work, maybe try [World of Cultivation](https://dreamsofjianghu.ca/%e4%bf%ae%e7%9c%9f%e4%b8%96%e7%95%8c-world-of-cultivation/)? 

    It's a great story that's totally let down by its translation - but somehow, that doesn't entirely stop it. The MC is a fairly standard cultivator with amnesia (he lost his memories about two years ago), but he's driven to optimize what resources he has in order to get stronger. 

    The story starts out as almost a cookie clicker type thing - the MC has X fields of spiritual grains which he needs to take care of in order to generate Y income using Z spiritual arts - but the plot quickly smacks him in the face and forces him to scramble to keep up.

        oh also fyi the munchkined fic of Harry Potter you read was probably [Harry Potter and the Natural 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20), which is more about munchkining D&D 3.5 in the real world.
        ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        In the version I've just started reading, the translation is technically proficient... except that they've chosen not to translate a bunch of terms, saying what they mean in the footnotes once and relying on the reader to remember what they all mean. I'm going to try using an extension (Word Replacer II) to replace those terms with English versions, and I'll see how that pans out.

        EDIT: Nope, I've fallen at the first chapter, where *jie* can be translated as either singular or plural and I'm not sure I understand what some of the other terms mean, even with the footnotes. A great disappointment.
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          Yeah that's more or less what I meant - the translation is very "keikkaku means plan" / "call a rabbit a smeerp". Pretty much all of the stuff they left untranslated has perfectly serviceable translations, so it just ends up making the thing hard to read.

          It also doesn't help that at some point they redid the first 25 chapters in 5 chapter chunks, so you have to go five chapters before you get the annotations.

    You might be thinking of Harry Potter and the Natural 20 for the munchkined fic.  If so, The Two Year Emperor is another one in a similar "D&D rules as written" genre.  (You'll need to poke around a bit to find the original version, the one on Amazon had all the D&D terms changed for copyright reasons.)  There's also Erfworld, if you're down to read a comic.

    You might also enjoy some of the time loop Naruto fics.  I think people on this sub like Time Braid?  Someone's probably already recommended Mother of Learning to you; it's probably the best of the time loop stories.

    The TV series Alone is also pretty good if you like survival content. All the footage is self recorded by the contestants who are dropped off in the wilderness somewhere and have to fend for themselves for as long as possible (multiple months sometimes). Not exactly rational content, but the people who learn and adapt and develop better strategies tend to do better.

Aside from generally good writing, worldbuilding, characterization, plot, etc, I want to highlight one thing I enjoyed about them:

  >KRYAL'S CROSSOVER CREED: Equal Opportunity Awesome, and its prerequisites: equal opportunity competence, amazement, and involvement. (Applies to non-crossovers as well.)

  Does anyone have recommendations for crossovers where both sides are treated fairly, the problems they face straddle the lines between the two established worlds so both can contribute, and so on?  Most fics that I see tend to tell a story about *one* side of the crossover while incidentally including the other, but Kryal seemed to (mostly) merge them into a seamless whole.

  - u/sibswagl:

    This is actually an anti-recc, because this is what bothers me about [snipers solve 99% of problems](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20644262/chapters/49023794), a Harry Potter/Full Metal Alchemist crossover. I do actually mostly like this fic -- the characterization and writing are mostly solid, the dialogue is fun, etc. But I get really bothered by how consistently it portrays the FMA characters as smarter and more mature than the HP characters.

    And like, look, I get it. Harry Potter suffers from a lot of worldbuilding issues and characters do get handed some pretty big idiot balls. Everybody has read the [Why Harry Potter needs a gun](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/8kr0n1/why_harry_potter_needs_a_gun/) copypasta and HP:MOR. But c'mon, you're just gonna let the FMA characters completely smoke the HP characters? >!Just off the top of my head, they imply (it hasn't been tested) that they'll just snipe Voldemort to buy themselves some time while he gets a new body, Hawkeye throws off imperio on her first try, Ed beats up Moody and Snape simultaneously, and Ed and Al *create an array to turn off magic* (I haven't actually watched FMA, I think that one is canon?).!< Like, if you're gonna curbstomp one setting so hard, why do you need 200,000 words to do it?

    It's like, Dumbledore has to be explicitly told "hey, even if we can't kill Voldemort permanently, it took him 13 years to get a new body last time, so why don't we kill him again to buy some time?" Like, in canon, they didn't do that because Voldemort is guerilla fighter who can match Dumbledore 1:1, not because *they didn't think of it*.

    That's not even getting into the more minor ways HP characters are dumb, like the teens getting their wands confiscated by Ed multiple times (they try to Obliviate Al for some dumb reason, I forget), or being completely fooled by Mustang's "oh I'm a harmless politician routine", or being confused/horrified by the idea of legal prostitution (yeah, IDK, that one was weird).

    (Also, I just realized this fic is 200,000 words long and haven't even made it to Hogwarts yet. Jesus.)

  I'd like to third the recommendation for '[Somebody That I Used Tahno](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/somebody-that-i-used-tahno-a-lok-si.670771/#post-49799620)', recommended here a [month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/je3ans/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/g9lsiho/). Made my way through it and found it to be quite a page-turner, with character behavior broadly reasonable given their motivations, abilities, and dispositions. Fave part would probably be the slow-burn romance. Currently reading "[Theogony](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13576158/1/Theogony)" -- again, not *rational*, as only a tightly constrained embodiment of rage could be, but well written and I think enjoyable for fans of Worm and the God of War series. It's also got the implausible "all ye olde mythes are *real*" thing going on, but that's a trope I happen to enjoy.

  I also have a **request** for a recommendation: I've read a number of magical elementary school stories (e.g. Harry Potter), a few magical high school stories (e.g. Year of the Griffin), and even a magical college story (e.g. The Magicians). Are there any good magical *grad school* stories, esp. at the doctoral level? Dealing with magical dissertation committees, magical publishing, magical lecturing, a more mature, level-headed approach to magical relationships, etc. Something that has [Piled Higher and Deeper](http://phdcomics.com/comics/most_popular.php) energy, e.g. the describing that trope-y first-college-class scene where our fish-out-of-water protagonist looks around the lecture hall and sees the mysterious snake sorcerer cloaked in shadow, a gleaming, armored paladin, a princely middle eastern stereotype adorned in jewels and scimitars, a scantily clad tree nymph, etc. etc. but from the perspective of their seen-it-all-before grad student instructor who just wants to make it through this first lecture to get back to grant writing and experiments. Maybe also something with a harder magic system able to invert Clarke’s Third Law (“sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from technology”).

  Alternatively, any (magical or non-magical) fiction that features adult characters experiencing grad school, or else a magical school story told from the perspective of an adult non-student (a groundskeeper, a teacher, etc.). Unseen Academicals comes to mind, but I felt that to be more a story taking place at a university than a story for which the university setting was essential.

    I know I'm a one-note wonder on this subject, but I found the Commonweal novels by Graydon Saunders to scratch this itch. The first book is pretty much "military SF in a fantasy setting" tropes plot-wise in order to introduce you to the setting, but the second book is sorcery vocational school for a group of adults making a career change into being wizardly.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      I felt the second book to be such a slog and I barely finished it. I don't know about you but after the ten thousandth description of the exact details and measurements of what they're doing I was bored out of my mind.

      Like, as an idea I love it. You get a group of once in a million mages and what's the best use of them, civil engineering of course. It's a fantastic decision.

      However, I've never felt more than this story could have shaved thousands if not tens of thousands of words by just fucking drawing it. It's just so bloody dull to read, and there's no payoff for it. Nothing ever comes of knowing that they had to do it by 3m instead of 4m, hell even all the fancy materials they get to use is just, I don't know porn for an engineer about what they'd do if they didn't have a budget? Like, wow it's going to last 10,000 years instead of 1,000 what an exciting thing to tell me, are we going to experience that difference? Is it ever going to matter to the plot or even to the characters? It's like he read the Wikipedia article (or more likely a dozen deeper books) about canals and then wanted to tell me all about that with a practical example. Half of the book could almost be submitted as proof for a civil engineer graduate that they can design a canal from scratch.

      The first one was pretty good [well, at least it was interesting/different enough to make up for its flaws] and I don't know about the rest after that since I stopped after finishing the second. It took me two months to read the second one and six days for the first (and tbh the first is already written in an almost obnoxiously difficult manner, it reminds me of reading Robinson Crusoe or something). Compared that to ASOIAF: https://i.imgur.com/RXIHpDy.png

      This is what I wrote in my own notes section on my book history after finishing it:

      >!This is like reading a civil engineers manual, who tf thought this would make for an exciting and interesting story. I get that it's a good way of demonstrating how the characters can really impact the world by massively terraforming and causing huge economic changes but still story benefit do we get out of fifty pages of measurements. If he wanted to do all this he should have just put in pictures. There's a reason irl engineers use blueprints not describe stuff because describing stuff takes forever and is impossible to picture. Also I feel like the constant mention of metals and compounds is meant to be bragging about how amazing they are but he uses it so liberally and they got a house from an elemental with zero cost so why not just do that with whole villages I don't understand why no one would try to do it before on a larger scale. On top of that though they talk about how low the chances of death are they don't talk enough about how lucky there were 5 untrained adult wizards lying about at the exact same time  !<
      ```

      - u/PastafarianGames:
        ```
        That last bit they do actually talk about, but maybe not until the third book. Also, they're not all untrained (one of them is trained enough that he has to drop out) and they're not all adults (Zora's underage).

        But the fan description of the books is literally "A civil engineering manual lost in a fairytale", so I'm not disagreeing with the main thrust of your statement in the slightest.
        ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          Yeah I don't want to disparage people because I think it's an accurate description and if you like it go for it but it's not the case that you like the first then you like the second. 

          Well as I recall they didn't mention it and that section was just my own internal comments so I won't die for what I spammed out stream of conscious style. Still I don't recall her being a child, so perhaps instead of adult I should have wrote old enough to be educated in a rather independent manner without any, well minimal, parental guidance (was it her who went to see her mother?) 

          Even with the drop out it's still ridiculously unlikely considering the numbers suggested and the graph presented. I expected it to be mentioned in the distribution of mana scene at least.

          Six almost untrained and four definitely untrained (the guy who left and the soldier) simultaneously was great odds

          not only that, but the island survival part of the book is a good example of early rational fiction. It clearly shows a smart and practical protagonist acting rationally to solve his problems, and only failing due to lack of knowledge, not lack of logical thinking.  


          I would even go so far as to say that "island survival" is the BEST medium to show a rational, or even rationalist character, because they exist in a sort of isolated vacuum without other people, just them vs nature. Its the easiest medium to show "rational thinking vs practical problem" kind of a plot.

          I don't hate Crusoe, actually I quite like it, it was just what comes to mind when I think of nonstandard English. Even looking back at it it wasn't that hard tbh but it was the first time I read anything like that so it was difficult for me even as an avid reader.

          It was a book that took a while to read at the same pace and grip me because first I had to do so with the language then the content. I felt similar with some of the language choices in Commonweal, especially the sentence structure. 

          Could not tell you what age I was, at least 10 I'd guess whereas I'm now 26 so take it with that context

      That's a weird fic. A major part of the story is the protagonist being isekai'd into another dimension and passing a bunch of classical music(think Mozart, Beethoven, etc) as his own. Which is fine, do what you gotta do, but the guy does it without expressing a hint of guilt or anything, ever. On top of that he's so smug and proud about all the compliments and accolades he gets. And he NEVER tries to compose his own songs or anything even adapt an existing song a bit, it's ALWAYS plagiarism. 

      As I read it I couldn't shake this feeling that I was being wooshed, that i had missed an important detail. It was only when I stopped reading the story and thought about it a bit that I realized that I was going through a sort of culture shock. I just couldn't picture someone being so proud of being a plagiarist the way he was, there had to be another element that I was missing. 

      Like I said, super weird.

          That’s an interesting idea. A couple of counterpoints off the top of my head:

          * [Worth the Candle](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle). I don’t get the impression that anybody in the story has any problem with “stealing” intellectual property.
          * [The Merchant Princes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_Princes) series. Again, nobody seems to think that importing intellectual property is a big deal.

          I don’t think I (a left coast American) would have a problem ripping off somebody else’s work in another universe, though I would feel weird about accepting praise for it.

            Am I wrong or is the fact that Arthur plagiarized most of his works in WtC definitely a point of contention? I can distinctly remember Juniper and Raven express negative feelings about it, and possibly others as well. The idea is that Uther is an otherworldly, mythically perfect being, but the more they learn about him the more the myth is tarnished by reality, with his unapologetic plagiarism a part of that. 

            Additionally, Arthur at least had the decency to make his works adaptations, fitting to the time he found himself in. Star Wars becomes a medieval knights tale, for example. And he was doing it purely from memory, so his knowledge and skill as a writer was essential to the stories being viable works or art. Just knowing the plot of Romeo and Juliet is not enough to right a good book about it. In contrast, in Throne of Magical Arcana the MC just inexplicably has a library in his head with perfect copies of an untold number of books in it, including sheet music for countless classical songs that he goes on to recreate exactly and pass off as his own. It's different.

            Honestly, if I got heaped with praise for plagiarised achievements, I suspect it'd be pretty hard to not feel smug for having pulled off such a successful trick. Objectively you wouldn't deserve nearly as much praise, but subjectively you'd be justifying it to yourself unless you put actual effort into keeping yourself humble.

      Not really, IMO.  I've watched Korra and also read 'Somebody That I Used Tahno', and feel that both are slightly above average but not great.  

      Republic City and the bending is all portrayed in the show, and IMO those visuals are the best part of it.  In the fic though, lots of the description and interactions in the story assume you know what's going on.  It starts in media res *and* in a flashback *and* with an unreliable narrator, which is much harder without knowing the plot of the story beforehand.  Korra's setting and plot also has idiosyncrasies that the fic just rolls with, which are easier to absorb in a visual medium (eg, like giant mecha exist but guns don't).

          If you're talking about how it was handled, then I'd agree.

For example, Star Wars the Clone Wars actually had decent politics in it, especially towards the end of season 6 with the banker clans and what not. Can't think of any other at the top of my head though.

        It had a huge like to dislike ratio, before that got removed.

        To summarise - The Legend of Korra is a bad show attempting to cash-in on the popularity of the original.

        It's crew and humour are bland and forced as hell compared to the cast from the original series and it's better than the aspects from the original show that doesn't either care about it or wouldn't have significantly and improved the original show that much.

        You can still love it and it has quite a few moments, but there's no way in hell that it holds a candle light to the original in terms of overall quality or someone else put it: 

        * *I walked into this video like, “I love the Legend of Korra, but somehow, this video will probably still manage to convince me it sucks.” I walked out like, “I still love the Legend of Korra, but now I know IT SUCKS!!!”*

          It's an alright show.  They get most of the combat right, and republic city itself is pretty cool the way only steampunk '20s can be.  But I don't think it's as good or as deep as the first avatar and it doesn't give us as much to think about.

          I'll give it a watch though and see if that video changes my mind.

    The best part about Somebody that I Used Tahno is that it ends, satisfyingly. Most plot threads are tied up neatly and the ones that are left aren't big enough that it's annoying.

    I really liked the romance too. The characters have their own priorities and motivations and the romance serves to deepen their actual bonds instead of becoming something separate from their roles in the story. It's an overall satisfying package, highly recommend.

    Oh and as a rec for your request, if you're able to tolerate the initial inconsistencies in Ar'Kendrythist, it gets really into magic research. Granted it's not really magic grad-school, and there's a few existential threats that get in the way of magic research. It's more like magic professor, except the professor is foreign and has really specialized knowledge. Later on in the story the protagonist works with archmages who are leaders in their own field to research different types of magic or figure out ways to gain spells easier and cheaper. He even joins magic school as a grad student of sorts, and takes classes and does terrible in some and well in others. Even later on he works directly with other archmages to develop new spells, and sometimes gives lectures to other archmages.

  Volume 10 of the Japanese Light Novel series So I'm a Spider, So What? just released earlier today(and it was damn good), and I'd like to recommend it here. Based on previous threads, I see a lot of people like the typical JP isekai setting you always see in manga and anime, although it's unfortunate how most of them tend to be horrible.

  I'm really impressed by Spider though, I feel it's the only JP isekai that does the normal isekai story well. Isekai is like the junk food of fantasy imo, the setting and elements are pretty cool, but they're usually done incredibly shallow, with most of them just copying the same tropes and cliches, with very few actually putting in the proper world building, character building, and personality to make it good. Spider is an incredible isekai that really utilizes every element of the typical isekai story properly.

  Before I talk more about it, I will say that some may be divisive about it. It starts off as a litrpg monster reincarnation story, but later on it moves away from both the litrpg grinding and monster elements, and some people may be bothered by it. If the fact that it doesn't stay as a litrpg grinding monster story, then I'm sure you'll really like Spider, because the story is fantastic.

  Whenever I read or watch an isekai, I'm always very cynical and judgemental, and realize that the worldbuilding is shallow or makes no sense. Questions like 'why is there a litrpg system in the world?' and 'why was the mc even reincarnated and why do they have cheats?' and 'why is it always a hero vs. a demon lord?', tropes and cliches that a lot of series cling to without any proper purpose or reason, it's just there. In Spider, every element of the story has a purpose. There's an important and logical reason why the MC and her classmates were isekai'd, and why they have cheats, and why the MC even reincarnates into a spider. There's a reason why there's a litrpg System governing the World. There's a reason why there are humans, elves, and demons, and there's a reason why there's always a human Hero and a demon Demon Lord, and all these elements are crucial to the overarching story and play into it in very satisfying ways as the mystery of the world is slowly unraveled.

  Story elements aside, it has a lot of personality, charm, and soul. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/SrCiFZy) a little excerpt from the latest volume, and the author exudes personality and emotion into the writing, making the novel feel so fresh compared to the dry, exposition-heavy, and boring isekai novels and MCs you usually see. The writing is very balanced. It's not always humorous, the author knows how to write comedic moments and tones, but the character development and emotional scenes are handled exceptionally as well. There's a lot of serious, intelligent, and grim characters too, and the writing captures those moods perfectly. The ending of volume 10 blew me away with the MC's revelation and conviction, but I won't reveal that here as its MAJOR spoilers.

  The story is really impressive too. The author respects the readers' intelligence and doesn't do exposition dumps or trite plot points, the  way the story progresses, reveals, and misdirects is phenomenal, I'll just leave it at that. The characters are exceptional and all are very well-written, with many being foils to each other or making excellent use of the isekai setting. The MC has been fighting for survival ever since she was born, and through those struggles has the ability to change the world. Another classmate is born as a human prince and serves as commentary on the generic isekai protagonist, clinging to the ideals of his past life and wanting to change the world without sacrifice, except he doesn't have the strength or conviction to carry it out. Another classmate, best friend of the human prince reincarnation, reincarnates as a girl and has to struggle between the identity of her past life and her current one, as well as deal with her ever changing feelings for her best friend(who is unfortunately generic and thus oblivious). This character is actually written and handled exceptionally well, as light novels are notoriously bad at writing women. And so on and so on. Spider takes the typical elements of the generic isekai setting and crafts an absolutely stunning story.

  The story is surprisingly rational too. There's a lot of bits about the world and how things work. In this volume the Demon Lord orders her Demon subordinates to put down a rebellion, and the novel goes over how despite there being a litrpg System, virtually everybody has stats in the several hundreds range, with people having stats in the thousands being pretty much legendary warriors, so battles between two armies will be virtually equal. The MC, despite occasionally being a bit goofy, is very competent and tries to optimize her stat and skill growth, especially so when she's training Vampy.

  So if you like JP isekais and aren't bothered by the fact that the story shifts away from level grinding or being a monster, I'd very highly recommend this story. I personally think there's no JP isekai better than So I'm a Spider, So What?

  The last time I talked about Spider here, some mentioned that the price might be a bit high, as its a light novel series. There are some ...easily accessible methods, if price is a concern for you.

  Additionally, the series has some really [adorable](https://imgur.com/a/M5HYfIh) illustrations.

    The attitude/personality/charm/soul as represented by your exerpt seems incredibly commonplace to me in Japanese LNs including isekai stuff. Or at least, a lot of works are written in a very similar 'voice', and I could very easily imagine a passage just like that one showing up in any of dozens of them.

  First, a meta recommendation: If you have a library card but haven't been going to the library (for obvious reasons, natch) [Overdrive/Libby] (https://www.overdrive.com/) are services that let you 'check out' virtual books from your library. Wait lines can be fairly long, but the trick there is to just place multiple holds at once, and then at some point the books will start to roll ib. 

  Their book discovery service is pretty mediocre, so I would recommend setting up a GoodReads profile, tracking the books you've read, and seeing what they recommend you. 

  Now, for actual pieces of fiction:

  [All Systems Red] (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32758901-all-systems-red) - Murderbot discovers what it means to have free will. Humorous and well written. Covers a number of rational-adjacent topics, but the main character is deliberately written to be irrational.

  [A Deadly Education] (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50548197-a-deadly-education) A more mature 'magical high school' novel. The setting is deliberately irrational, but the characters take measured actions to achieve their goals.  Good, fun read.

  [Esquestria: The House of the Sun] (https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/esquestria-the-house-of-the-sun-a-pony-cultist-experience.71721/#post-16913694) Pony cultist quest. Endearing characters, a simulationist take on events (as per the dice rolling), and an author fond of eldritch horror make this a worthwhile read.

    I'd like to put forth an anti-recommendation for this one. I had typed out a explanation, but as it turns out the linked goodreads page [has a great review that very precisely sums up my frustrations with a work that I really wanted to like.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3585134911)
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      I think the reviews criticizing Novik of racism in her work (even if they don't go so far as to accuse Novik herself of racism) are really far off the mark. The main character has a very transactional view of relationships as what is clearly a coping mechanism, not as some sort of proxy for denigrating other cultures. Yes, people from other cultures are shown in negative lights, but given the very global nature of the novel's characters, that was practically impossible to avoid. Accusing this novel of being racist when its entire point is to demonstrate the unjust power of entrenched, exclusionary ingroups is to completely miss the point.

      Maybe if this had been Novik's debut there would be more reason for suspicion, but her Temeraire series is a pretty pointed critique of imperialism and racism (both in the magical and mundane senses).
      ```

      - u/sephirothrr:
        ```
        My prior enjoyment of the Temeraire novels is one of the reasons I wanted to like this work, and at the same time of of the reasons I was eventually so disappointed with it. 

        Perhaps it's the case that this specific work hits closer to home as the character and I are of similar backgrounds (which itself is another reason I really wanted to like it - representation in fiction really is nice), but it's only skin-deep at best. To take a line from that review that perfectly encapsulates what I'm not sufficiently eloquent to say: "her Indian heritage is a veneer placed on top of a character who is otherwise just a default white protagonist." The "diversity" depicted in this work is written in an incredibly orientalist and imperialist manner - claiming that a character of one background yet characterized by unrelated tropes shows a basic lack of any research or respect given to the topic at hand, that speaks louder to me than other elements.

        I realize that this may sound like strange pedantry from someone who's too close to the topic at hand, but reading this novel was a very dissonant experience, where at every turn I found the details to be in opposition to the greater themes, and as such, despite my best efforts, I couldn't enjoy it.

          I think you went into this work looking for the chinese students to be chinese, and the arabic students to be arabic, etc. but in the context of this work, the chinese students are chinese *international students* and the arabic students are arabic *international students*. To the extent that this story is imperialistic, it's that it does recognize the inherently imperialistic nature of modern schooling and globalization. The students resemble many of the foreign students I met in college myself, with different native tongues but western sensibilities. There is a significant difference between your a average, say, indian, and the type of indian that grows up learning foreign languages and consuming foreign media, with the backing necessary to enter a prestegious international school. 

          In fact, it explicitly points out towards the start of the work that the scholomance's anglocentrism is a direct consequence of how european imperialism affected other populations, and that resurgent foreign enclaves are actually working to subvert that.

          And while I would agree with some criticism that the main character is designed to be easy to self insert into (dark witch? Noted several times in the story to be athletic and attractive, but without paying attention to any specific features? Intimidating aura? Catches the eye of the school's most popular boy by acting aloof?) I would take issue with calling her a default *white* protagonist, especially since she'd singled out among her own childhood community for being nonwhite.

  Started going through my old collection of Artemis Fowl fanfics after glancing at the horrid movie for a few minutes. 

  In a bid for some new recommendations, this is rational adjacent [Artemis Fowl and the Book of Ages](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4453992/1/Artemis-Fowl-The-Book-of-Ages) a continuation after Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony, revolving around the consequences of Artemis's manipulation of cause-effect outside of time at the end of that book to save a certain LEP officer. 

  Time Travel, and a bit darker than the books but not excessively it's a good self contained story that has and ending.

  As a request, has anyone got anything rational around Sword Art Online? The closets I've found is abridged[...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0&list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU)

  I thoroughly recommend [Reverend Insanity](https://boxnovel.com/novel/reverend-insanity/), the first Cultivation story I've gotten into. The premise is that an evil powerful Cultivator (originally from Earth) is finally struck down by the righteous, just as he manages to get a reincarnation power, so he has the advantage of 500 years hindsight to maximise his paltry resources and get ahead of his rivals. In spite of the OP-sounding premise, his every success feels hard-fought as he navigates between penury, cultivating with his average talent and keeping below the threshold of being targeted by stronger families and institutions for all his outrageous deeds.

  The whole thing genuinely feels interwoven and dynamic, the MC desperately struggling to keep ahead of everyone he's abused and slighted. It's like Worm in that aspect, every action having consequences, things that happen in early chapters coming back 100 chapters later. Each chapter is very hard to predict, there's all kinds of 2nd and 3rd level games being played. The other characters act reasonably; MC has to expend effort to push them into a corner and they'll strike back if they can. They have their own goals too.

  The whole thing is very very long. If you've ever sighed at seeing a story that's under 100K words because why even bother... there is no such problem here! The translation is good I guess, though I have nothing to compare it too.

  On the other hand, the MC is unrepentantly evil. It makes sense for his character, moulded by 500 years of an ultra-Darwinistic world with its own inequality-rich magic system. So if you're on the lookout for an even slightly good MC who'll hesitate before ritually sacrificing a young girl to be eaten by a bear in order to get stronger, this isn't for you. He's much the same as HPMOR Voldemort. If there's a moral of the story, it's: "always go your own way and follow your ambition, no matter the consequences for anyone else." If there's a single theme that stands out it's :"Organizations, tribes and countries are all parasites, trying to lure you in and subjugate you: there is no true right or wrong, only strong or weak". Now I think about it, this might be veiled criticism of the CCP. Overall, the story isn't pointless edge, it's heartfelt, steelmanned and genuinely insightful IMO.

(I frequently use the version at [camas.github.io](https://camas.github.io/reddit-search/) because it has more search refinement options, and it allows me to search through my own comment history.)
