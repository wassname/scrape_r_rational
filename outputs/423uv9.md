## [WIP][Q] Additional Magic Classes

### Post:

To help with my new harry potter fanfic I'm working on I'm reading the books again and am finding myself disappointed with the lack of extra magical subjects offered. So I want to add some more that seem reasonable based on Harry Potter's cannon. Right now I think that ritual magic,wandless magic, and illusion magic would be good, but was wondering if you guys had any other ideas of what to add.

  I think you should group magic by effect, not cause. If you want to add ritual magic, what does it do that 'normal' magic doesn't? If it transforms things, you might as well put it into Transfiguration. If it enchants things, Charms. And so on, and so forth. During canon, the contents of lessons changes rather a lot from year to year, and we never see the contents of Year 7, so you can even plausibly add it without being too AU.

  Illusions would be a good example of a new subject, if you really want one. However, think about how it would break the setting. Do the villains know it? If so, how does that change the background of the setting, before your story starts, or if it doesn't, why not? Basically, any *useful* power you add should change a lot of the setting, and any power that doesn't change the setting much isn't very strong. It's a bit of a problem unless you are willing to rewrite large parts of the history and magic system from scratch, like in [Wit of the Raven](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven) for example - the changes in worldbuilding become apparent after a few chapters, although the start is a little uninspired.

  How about lessons on creating actual magical items? Sure, making another hogwarts is out, unless it's _that_ kind of fic, but it should have at least theory on how to make stuff like wands and whatever.

    That's a good idea. We see several times even Fred and George seem to be able to enchant items with shield charms so it would still follow cannon, as long as I don't start having people learn how to enchant  philosophers/sorcerers stones it shouldn't be world breaking.

      I'm pretty sure enchanting items with some magic is different from making magical items. I think the latter needs magical parts and it might not be all just casting a spell at a mundane object, like the stuff for core for the wands. There is a reason why some brooms are better than others, unless you think they just keep refining their make broom fly spell wand flicking and pronounciation.
      ```

      - u/Luminnaran:

        True, the books don't go over the specifics and broom making and the like should be more complex than simply better flight charms. However I would generally consider both enchanting gloves and brooms to be the same subject  simply different variations. The same way conjuration and switching are different forms of the same type of magic, transfiguration.

          I think it'd stand to reason if an Enchanted item, one with a permanent effect like a broomstick, would require a magical component prior to wandwork, while, by contrast, a mundane item could be *Charmed* by wandwork alone, but the effect would be strictly temporary.

          It's not like there isn't, apparently, a large variety of miscellaneous magical resources lying around, and an entire magical economy that trades in them almost exclusively.

          EDIT: I tried looking into it, and as an example, while we know that no wizard knows why muggles need rubber ducks, it's unclear if there is even a market among wizards for materials with interesting-but-purely-mundane-in-origin properties, like rubber.
          ```

  There's got to be more to magics of the mind than Occlumency and Legilimency, right? There could be an elective course in the later years on things like magical mental illnesses, how exactly *Imperio* works, dream magic, the risks of bootstrapping your test scores, and the current theory behind hypothetical long distance telepathy spells.

  I was going to say something about how "elective course in the later years" is likely the best place to add most subjects not already in the core curriculum, but then I remembered that if this particular brand of magic were real, I'd want almost *all* of it, save for theory and a few simple charms, to be confined to college courses with many prerequisites.

- u/Escapement:
  ```
  Arithmancy and Ancient Runes can both do literally anything or everything you want, neither of them have been really defined and tied down at all by Harry Potter canon. A fairly common fanon would be something like Runes to make magic items, and Arithmancy for making new spells - but really whatever you want to roll with is plausible for these classes to do, neither of them are terribly well described or at all interesting in canon. Also, the reason for Astronomy to exist as a course is pretty mysterious and weird, and having the night sky actually matter in some way to magic could be interesting.

  I think that it would be sort of weird to have illusion magic bracketed out as you describe, and not part of e.g. charms or whatever. I like illusions a lot, and think they're underused in most fiction with magic, but what narrative purpose there is to having an entire extra class about them in specific instead of having a scene with Flitwick teaching an illusion spell or a character picking up a book of illusion spells is really not intuitively clear to me. I mean, I don't hate it, and I think that most fanfiction doesn't go far enough in transforming source material... but if there's no underlying reason, spending wordcount introducing a new OC and a new class with new stuff in it just seems sort of pointless.
