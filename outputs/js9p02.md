## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  So I've been working on a idea for story and had a few questions to make the world building a bit more coherent.

  Story Title - Terms and Conditions

  Elevator Pitch: The story is a comedy inspired by Yu-gi-oh, Metalocalypse, and Penny Arcadeâ€™s paint the line. Where death, intricate conspiracies, destruction, social upheaval, rebellions, and more occur around simple games. All while the games master tries to do everything he can to ensure the games finish with minimal death and destruction since the stupid players constantly look for loopholes, unorthodox playing styles, and cheating to make the games more dangerous and chaotic.

  The story takes place in a world similar to our own except for the existence of a very small number of people born with powers that often have strange conditions that can causes its strengths/capabilities to vary wildly. In the past before guns and science, they were the premier players of the world. But in modern times they are seen as little more than occasional scientific curiosities. Most governments give very generous incentives for people to register their powers and beyond a powered person using their power for occasional pranks or the odd crime every few years, they are pretty much ignored.

  The main character is a man currently suffering from crippling depression and anxiety. He has recently gained a power that allows him to form mental contracts others, which forms a geas on the brains of the participants to give them incentive to follow the contract. If a person believes they have broken the contract, everyone under the geas instantly knows about it and they have to suffer a random mental penalty. But to compensate, there is also a random mental benefit you gain as soon as you are put under a geas to encourage the participants to follow the contract. This geas cannot be put on someone who is unwilling to have it. It must be voluntary.

  The punishments are temporary and can include things like blindness, increased sensitivity to pain, severe and uncontrollable muscle tremors, the inability to recognize faces, unusual delusions, and visual/auditory hallucinations. Rewards can include things like enhanced senses, being able to temporarily use bullet time, increased memory recall to the point of mental time travel, a cure for mental disorders, improved learning capabilities, etc. If a person actively hates and fights the geas it only lasts a few weeks but otherwise it can actually last for months and potentially even longer if the person under the geas desires the benefits from staying under it.

  Despite how powerful his ability is and how easily it would make him wealthy, the main character does not register himself as a powered person. He does not like or trust his government and considers them idiots beholden to the rich and immoral corporations that have ruined the world and the environment. Instead he decides to use his power to try and make himself happy and get over his depression by pushing people into playing games with him. As he is a former game designer who used to design board games and he has always been a huge fan of media involving mental battles, unorthodox strategies, and heavily studies game theory. Everything goes well until people realize that they can win a VERY powerful prize in his games and every single government, wannabe conspiracy, and more do everything in their power to win his games. Hilarity ensues.

  So specific questions:

  Realistically what US agency would be in charge of handling super powered people in the US if they were very rare and, usually, not particularly dangerous?

  What are some realistic consequences if politicians and bureaucrats in government literally lost their ability to lie? Beyond the comedy aspects, which is probably going to be hard to write.

  Any funny ideas for contests that people take WAY too seriously? So far I have: Bird Watching, a the floor is lava race across a desert, a massive card game tournament with unusual rules, and a scavenger hunt with simple clues that people over analyze.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    If you gain benefits from entering into these contracts, could the contracts be stupidly specific and unlikely so that you could get these benefits without any real cost? "I promise not to eat live mongoose while married to a woman named Ermina Willingham III." And then make a dozen contracts like that so you get a range of benefits.

    A high stakes game of chutes and ladders, or any other game where the outcome is completely outside the players' control, would be funny.

    Losing the ability to lie isn't particularly bad, you just have to be clever about what you say. If it's a temporary affliction, they take some sick days off work.
    ```

    - u/TheAnt88:
      ```
      Not really, you have to give up something meaningful or make a solemn promise for the power to kick in. If you say gave up eating any meat that would be enough to work. That said, there are certain circumstances where his power will improve and in his strong state he could make such a contract but it would probably not last very long or give you much of a benefit. The main character is also limited in how many contracts he can have open at once, so he probably wouldn't waste it.

      The actual circumstances are due to a winner of a game winning while the main character is in a strong state and not realizing it. The winner gains the ability to make a rule that people have to follow in a certain range of themselves, as long as they themselves are willing to follow it. The winner makes a rule compelling people to tell the truth and goes to Washington, with a good chunk of the city suddenly losing the ability to lie without warning. It isn't just lying, you are literally compelled to tell the truth though you can just remain silent. But this isn't a good look for the politicians that choose not to talk to anyone. Funny chaos ensues before the winner comes clean and admits what they did out of guilt when there are several suicides/deaths. This act makes the gamesmaster infamous and leads to the chaos of the games as everyone dreams about what else they could win.

      A completely random game could be funny though I think giving some way to change the dice rolls by adding/subtracting would make it more strategic depending on what they do.

        > A completely random game could be funny though I think giving some way to change the dice rolls by adding/subtracting would make it more strategic depending on what they do.

        Well, yeah. Of course adding some method of affecting the outcome would make it more strategic. But the humor is in having high stakes and analysis for a game that gives small children the illusion of strategy, but any adult sees after reading the rules that you do a bunch of dice rolls but ultimately have no method of changing your chance to win or playing better than your opponent. It's an overly complicated coin flip.

        Imagine a character who is world renowned for winning the Chutes and Ladders World Championship 3 times in a row, and everyone in universe takes this seriously.
        ```

    Self-modifying games like Nomic, Mao, or 1000 Blank White Cards could be interesting, although very complex when applied to this power.  Especially since you typically play multiple rounds with round winners jockeying for more control of the series/tournament. 

    If you're looking for comedic effect, improv/theater games that encourage absurd behavior are a pretty direct path: think of playing Zip-Zap-Zop with somebody famously dignified, like the Pope or the Dalai Lama.  Party games like Truth or Dare or Spin the Bottle fall into this category, too.  Doubly so, since many of these have no victory condition, or extremely subjective/vague victory conditions.

    Collaborative/co-operative games like Pandemic where all the players either win or lose together would be interesting from an outside game-theoretical perspective.  Some people might strategically try to lose on purpose, effectively introducing meta-level of co-opetition. Games that allow multiple winners or allied victory are also similar.
    ```

    - u/AlmostNeither:
      ```
      If you're really trying to ratchet up the absurdity, can you imagine intense 24-hour news coverage/analysis in the style of national election media frenzies but instead covering people trying to guess how many marbles are in a huge jar?

      Or you could distort children's games like Musical Chairs or Duck Duck Goose into horrifying bloodbaths.

      Would the power be extensible to games played asynchronously/asymmetrically/remotely?  Could the person with the power just publish a YouTube video with a "You laugh you lose" or "you flinch you lose" challenge and see the world line up to attempt it?

  Cantrips are minor spells.  In D&D, they are, like all other spells, mostly themed around dungeoncrawling.  Imagine you lived in a quasi-modern world, where introductory magic theory was a high school class.  Not everyone learns, even most who learn the basics have little true aptitude.  But the end result is that maybe 80% of the population can cast a few minor cantrips.  With all that cumulative brainpower thrown into the mix, we'd definitely get some cantrips that were actually optimized for daily life, or work.  

  What cantrip-level spells would you want for your job, or daily life?  What might other professions want?  What are some non-standard uses for existing cantrips that could be applied to normal circumstances?  For example, when I posed this question to my friends, one got hung up on how Mage Hand could revolutionize competitive gaming, just by freeing players from the limitation of their physical number of button-pressing digits.  A divination to immediately comprehend dimensions or sizes might be invaluable for many professions, say, carpenters.
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Existing cantrips:

    * Guidance is a D&D cantrip that gives a small bonus (+1 in 3.5, +1d4 in 5E) to any skill check. If cantrips can be cast constantly like 5E ones, then this one cantrip is enough to justify the high school magic curriculum by itself. Especially for professions that consist of bashing your head against a problem until you succeed, like artists and engineers, you'd want to cast that constantly (unless you had a better, non-stacking bonus).

    * Cure Minor Wounds (3.5), in addition to curing a paltry 1 HP, also stabilizes a dying person, making it competitive with a complete course in EMT training.

    * Mending is a lot better than glue, tape, etc, so that's worth knowing. 

    * Minor Illusion doesn't have any canonical limitation in fidelity, so that's a remarkably powerful tool for data visualization, communication, giving presentations, and so forth. 

    * Prestidigitation is, as always, endlessly useful. It flavors food, so that's at least enough to barely learn to cook and never buy spices.

    New spells:

    * All sorts of minor divinations would be useful. Magically measuring things is very handy, I'd expect a lot of variation on that by trade - off the top of my head carpenters, architects, transportation engineers, tailors, chemists, and athletes.. Medical divinations seem particularly important - even if it's just weight/height/pulse/blood pressure that's some time saved for a nurse and a godsend for an EMT. I wonder whether magic's idea of how hard error-checking is differs enough from a compiler's idea to be useful in programming.

    * Mending only works on broken things, but if you could make a variant that works on raw materials then you can use that for superior welding, carpentry, and other trades. I feel like a material-specific version has to be limited enough to count as a cantrip (Weld, Join Wood, etc).

    * There are attack cantrips that create fire or frost, which presumably could be modified into more efficient and less combat-ready forms of heating and cooling for chemical processes.

    * There are attack cantrips that create small amounts of a material - acid in particular is popular. Again, a version that fills a cup with acid can probably make more acid than a version that was designed to fling acid at your enemies (Create Water makes at least two gallons of the stuff). It's not clear whether the conjured acid disappears - free matter creation is always interesting, but temporary matter is even more interesting chemically. Imagine a chemist gets to perform an experiment in an acid solution, then the acid disappears, precipitating the result instantly.
    ```

      ```
      > I wonder whether magic's idea of how hard error-checking is differs enough from a compiler's idea to be useful in programming.

      If nothing better were possible, a divination to make you notice those hard-to-spot syntax errors would be invaluable.  Something like "bring something I would recognize as an error more directly to my attention" seems like the sort of thing Vancian magic can do easily, because of how the writers conceptualize (or, rather, *don't* conceptualize) magical data processing.
      ```

      - u/jtolmar:
        ```
        > writers conceptualize don't conceptualize magical data processing.

        Exactly. Magic always has an element of "do what I mean" to it, which is especially valuable if you can get it into a computer. Anything in the "this code doesn't do what you think it does" space would be incredible.
        ```

  - u/grekhaus:
    ```
    A dismissible variation on Create Water would have a wide variety of applications in chemistry and manufacturing. Not just creating solutions were you can remove the solvent at will, but easily creating high quality vacuum chambers by filling a container with conjured water, sealing it and then removing the water.
    ```

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    Considering what other things the cantrips do, it'd probably be really easy/cheap to make a combination of a specialized cantrip and a specialized non magical USB I/O device, that is a far higher bandwidth+more intuitive in both direction to all our current I/O devices like screens or keyboards.

    Failing that, using Minor Illusion inside a controlled camera setup would still instantly let you move complex images from your visual cortex to software on the computer, letting anyone with the cantrip do in seconds what takes a digital artist or 3d modeler hours. Not only would this revolutionize the arts, it'd also be highly useful for CAD, any scientific use that needs a 2d data array, etc. You might also be able to crate the illusion of hovering text or a written text, which together with text recognition AI lets you input text in a similar way. 

    Any cantrip that create matter from nothing (like Create Water) OR telekinetic force (like Mage Hand) would utterly revolutionize everything related to space, and shift things violently back to favoring manned spaceflight, because you have infinite Delta-V and probably have to carry a lot less supplies for life support.

    Can mending fix broken *software*? Even if it has to have been fully functioning in the past, that still solves enormous swaths of system administration and tech support. It'd also be extremely handy for lost backups, hard drive restoration, etc. 

    Any spell that cools things break thermodynamics, and has a ton of scientific uses cooling small samples or high tech equipment. It's also really handy when your food is to hot so you don't have to wait for it to cool down. It could also have uses for pushing any tech that needs a cooling system and gets overheated, from gaming PCs to machineguns. 

    Looking at druidcraft and heal minor wounds, you could probably create some really powerful but extremely small scale agricultural/rapid growth spells, useless for staple crops but extremely valuable for spices, medicine-producing or sample bacteria, rapid testing of genetically engineered organisms, stem cells, etc.

    You could probably fairly easily make a "recharge batteries" cantrip from Shocking Grasp and Mend, that's really useful in everyday life (no more having to plug your phone into the wall for hours!) but also in survival situations recharging things like flashlights or water purifiers.

    Cantrips can produce small amounts of chemicals, such as acid or noxious gas. It is possible that with modern testing, R&D budgets, and knowledge of chemistry, you could create more powerful substances such as medicines, drugs, much more lethal toxins, neutralizing agents, etc.

    Combining the above with the healing and druidcraft bits, and the brain-targeting of Message, and modern knowledge of brain anatomy, you might be able to create an infinitely repeatable and extremely addictive "wirehead" cantrip, that just creates overwhelming pleasure and joy. This one would probably be quite illegal, but also have the biggest incentive to be created and the most popular. 

    Trustrike could probably be modified slightly to be useful aiming other things than attacks, and a lot of devices and skills involve hitting a narrow target. Also this is combat related but it'd be much more powerful with combat being so dominated by guns.
    ```

  I have this idea for a story:

  **What if anti-procrastination pill was invented?**

  Imagine a pill, that if taken daily, removes the need to procrastinate, and prevents akrasia. After taking it, for 24 hours, your actual behavior matches your conscious goals and values, and you are incapable of acting against your rational judgement. You feel motivated to achieve your goals, in order on how important and practical they are. You find it easy to delay gratification, and are not easily distracted from your tasks.

  How would society change?  


  For simplicity sake, lets say the pill is cheap to produce, abundant, and has no major side effects.
  ```

  - u/AlmostNeither:
    ```
    I think the most interesting thing about this idea is having an external verification of internal properties of my mind.  I'm a chronic procrastinator, but one of the things that I've learned is that at least some of my procrastination isn't procrastination.  The problem isn't that I am having trouble doing this thing I want to do.  The problem is that I've convinced myself that I want or should want to do something that I don't really want.

    Now, this doesn't account for all of my procrastination.  Honestly probably not more than 10% of it.  But the segment it does cover has been really important to my personal growth and understanding of myself.  If I could just take a pill and suddenly have the truth that there are some things I just don't want made apparent to me without the need/opportunity for extended introspection, I'm not sure how things would change for me, but it seems likely to be just as dramatic as the actual effect of removing procrastination from my habits.
    ```

- u/lsparrish:
  ```
  I have a plot bunny idea for a reverse-isekai where a peasant from a fantasy world gets reborn as a normal person in this one. They would have various preconceived notions about levels, experience, buffs/debuffs, dungeons, and so on, as well as the old person in a young body trope. Every time they slip up about their original world, people dismiss it as them just being a bit of a nerd.
  ```

- u/burnerpower:
  ```
  The world has a karma system. Generally whenever "good" activities are performed karma goes up, and whenever "bad" activities are performed karma goes down. At certain thresholds of karma people get a personalized ability. For example at 100 karma they get one ability, then at 1000, then at 10,000 ect. With the same but in reverse for negative karma. (-100,-1000,-10000, ect) The abilities also generally increase in power with more karma.

  With no more specifics than that, what are some general effects this would have on a world? What are some ways people/governments might try to rationally exploit this?
  ```
