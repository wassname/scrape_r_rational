  Maybe he does something to split himself, with the evil part of him becoming the other kind and the rest becoming the captain?

  Aha. The Comet King can't enter Hell even by committing evil deeds, because he'd be committing them for the greater good.

  But the Comet King isn't perfectly good, is he?

  >If anyone harms you, even the littlest cut or scrape, I will come against them as fire and night. I will destroy them and their people, uproot everything they have built, wipe them utterly from the Earth. And I will do this even if they are the only archangel capable of running the universe, and they have nobody to replace them. What is best for the world is that I not do that. 

  Committing sins so you can save the world, ultimately, motivated by the good. Committing sins as part of a roaring rampage of revenge on Thamiel for torturing your wife ...

  The "Comet King = Other King" theory just got a lot more plausible.

    ```
    But have you considered robin = otherking

    edit// wait wait, robin committed suicide to get to hell, something didn't work with this plan, comet discovers marriage name, comet hesitates giving the name to robin believing she would die when hell is destroyed(glowey eyes takes the name away), comet traded himself for robin, robin after suffering at the hands of T comes back as the other king

      Is Robin ever portrayed as a powerful kabbalist though?
      ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      Both are good theories.  Is there any evidence so far that might discriminate them?  I'm intentionally discarding the masculine connotation of King.
      ```

        Evidence? This is a world of troll logic

        The world is fractal sometime stories split and combine characters, the bird and archer are being split and combined in a new interesting ways with this thoery

      What is the relevance of him discovering the marriage name after she has died?
      ```
