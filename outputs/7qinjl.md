  I'm having fun with this. Still early days, but it looks promising.

  Very much enjoying this! Currently my thought is that the FBI (and therefore USST, plus maybe other orgs) know that Delphic is human and are humoring him for their own reasons, perhaps so they can surveil him without suspicion. The fact that he works a lot installing his monitors means that he has long periods offline, even if they don't correspond to a normal working day. Plus he has to sleep, even if only for a few hours each night. For a digital entity, even one with limited processing power, to be offline so often is bound to raise some flags. And Delphic can't be the only Thinker-type super out there.  

  I like Peregrine's characterization a lot. Makes total sense for someone with those powers to be so straightforward and abrasive. His super-speed isn't limited to flight either, so to him the world may move at an infuriatingly slow pace, hence his quick temper.
