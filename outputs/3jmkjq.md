## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

    Having tried MealSquares and Soylent for Months and Weeks respectively, here are my thoughts:

    * Soylent, for all its ease, still takes too much time and energy to make and clean up afterwards. It also goes bad in one or two days after you make it, so uneaten soylent is a problem, and I found myself not finishing a full bottle more often than not. Soylent is addressing these issues with a pre-made, disposable bottle version (which is slightly more expensive). 
    * Related to the above point, I find that Soylent works better as a a small supplement to your daily food (15-20%) rather than a food replacement. It is also significantly better with some sort of sweetener. This combination makes it more like a milkshake you have once a day, rather than bland goop you have all day, or replacing all your food with milkshakes **shudder**.
    * When I tried MealSquares, they were too dry, and neither savory, nor sweet enough. And, unlike with Soylent, I couldn't easily add more water or sweetener. They're palatable with some sort of sweet beverage, such as tea or soda, but I feel like they are also best used sparingly, like a replacement for a breakfast muffin, rather than replacing food entirely.
    ```

      Is there some reason you can't make less Soylent at a time?  I know practically nothing about it that isn't a result of following this thread, so maybe there's something I just don't know about, but that strikes me as a really obvious thing to account for.

    I tried a DIY soylent once. It wasn't inedible, but neither was it pleasant. Far better than starving, but that's about it.

    My roommate tried MealSquares. He managed to nibble on one piece a little.
    ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    MealSquares are fine, but very chalky and bland. Imagine a boring breakfast muffin that someone tried to make with the consistency of a scone but accidentally used wood dust instead of butter. Because they're aggressively boring, they're not actually BAD, just supremely not-pleasing to eat. 

    Very dense, but otherwise would make an acceptable breakfast food to eat with a cup of coffee or something. I couldn't imagine eating these more than once per day. As it is, I only eat them rarely.

    I got an order of Joylent, which is the danish equivalent. It was pretty good. Then me and a friend made a home made version which we called Super Drink. It was also pretty good. Not amazing, not terrible. Cheap though, because it is primarily oats and protein powder. After a while you can develop a taste/craving for them, which I assume is my body craving whichever vitamins/minerals I'm missing which it provides. 

    I tend to drink them late at night, at times when I can't be bothered to cook or when I'm in a rush and going to the climbing gym. I have always had a hard time gaining weight and I credit a decent amount of my recent 4-5 kg increase to being able to drink soylent late at night when I would otherwise not bother eating.

    As a dedicated cook who enjoys trying new things it would never replace everything or even most things, but it is certainly a good alternative for when I can't be fucked to cook and would just eat freezer pizza normally.

  I'm reading a novel called _Wired_ (by Douglas Richards), and it's...horrible.

  The antagonist is a woman. Every time she's introduced to a character, they have to comment (in dialogue or in narration) on her appearance in relationship to their willingness to have sex with her. This is pretty annoying.

  The thing that's unusual about this book is, there's working intelligence augmentation. Absurd levels of it, in fact, far beyond what should be possible, plus the effect is temporary. (The author didn't do the research for pretty much any topic the book talks about.) But, as is explained in a four-page author rant, this intelligence augmentation is inextricably linked to increased selfishness, decreased concern about others, and an uncaring attitude toward social consequences. That author filibuster was overly cynical and had a lot of prose that smacks of the sort of person who hangs about in /r/atheism: people got smarter and more independent over time, so religion came in to stop us from killing each other, diminishing our effective intelligence.

  Anyway. The antagonist can control herself well enough not to go on murder sprees as long as she stays in a sensory deprivation chamber while under the drug's effects, and that's with iteration #78, where the previous iterations are weaker in both psychological effects and intelligence augmentation. There is an obvious solution to the problem. Use the maximum safe level of augmentation to find another drug that will compensate for the lack of goodwill toward your fellow humans. Set up situations where you will be rewarded for helping others. Engender in yourself a sense of ownership toward the world so it's a point of pride to eradicate malaria, clean up the oceanic garbage patches, and ensure that everyone has clean drinking water. Ask yourself: [what would Orange Lantern do?](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.272850/)

  Everything else in the story is wrong and annoyingly so, but this...it's just such a huge miss that I can't stand it, and the author seems heavily invested in the insuperability of the problem.

  I've posted the [second chapter](http://talesfromaeria.tumblr.com/post/128269703332/wanderlust) to Wanderlust, a hard science fiction story about life aboard a colony ship in deep space. I could probably use some help to make sure all my maths work out and it comes off as sufficiently plausible.

  So, because I spent the month of August living by myself, I've actually spent the last few days worrying about

  >  The cost of living in Portugal? 

  Now that I have a sort of planned end date for my Master's (assuming nothing goes wrong with my thesis), and by extension this allows me to plan a future date for financial and living independence from family members, I'm even more fearful about the next year's evolution of the local prices.

  Specially because with the upcoming elections I'm seeing every political party in opposition to the current far-right, austerity measures being woefully incompetent, with the only hope of mine for a more rational opposition being personified by a 29-year old woman which seemingly up until now is the only rational and positive agent in a political system which thrives on meaningless catchphrases and outside support instead of proper results. Of course if she won we might suffer the same thing that happened to Syriza+Greece, and that is not an enjoyable perspective for the future.

  On the other hand, I'm thinking about perhaps writing a small fanfic of the [Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_%282015_animated_film%29) movie which at the same time plays it straight with the silly aliens and cars made which work on juice, but with a legitimate alien intelligence as the "occupiers".

  I've just finished reading *Jam* by Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw. (The author also does a series of web videos called *Zero Punctuation*, you may have heard of him from there.)

  It's a black comedy about a jam apocalypse, which is superficially similar to a zombie apocalypse except with man-eating jam instead of zombies. The joke is that nobody is prepared for the apocalypse and what groups of survivors remain are making it up as they go along. This includes the genre-savvy everyman who has always dreamed of being a world hero, the survivalists, the pragmatists, the hipsters, the organisation that works on existential risk, and a variety of groups who think they're the sole remaining bastion of civilisation. The characters are definitely not rational - 99% of everyone they know is dead, and the remainder is quite understandably going mad if they weren't already.

  I think it's quite a funny deconstruction of rational fiction.

  Why does the post have so few upvotes? By my count, a dozen people have commented, but only four of them have given upvotes to AutoModerator's post. Is there some reason for which you're so stingy with your upvotes?

  (I'm reasonably sure that the "vote-fuzzing" kicks in only at much higher numbers.)
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    People don't vote. This is endemic to reddit. The reason for it is that voting takes both effort and attention, which people have been trained not to spare. We have ~3,500 readers on this subreddit and the most upvoted thing of all time has ~160 upvotes.

    So it's not necessarily that people are stingy with their upvotes, it's that they just don't think about voting too much. Part of this is that voting up or down has very little personal utility. It's something you're doing for other people, not for yourself. This is especially true for AutoModerator, since the upvotes don't do her any good, so it's not like you're giving a reward, which is how some people think of it.

    And yes, vote fuzzing doesn't kick in until much later. Soft-capping is the other factor, and that doesn't kick in until the mid thousands.
    ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    Most people do not vote, even commenters. I upvote everything I see in r/rational that I like in order to encourage people, but there's no reason to really upvote automoderator posts since it's not like our frontpage is busy enough that it'll fall off quickly.
    ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    Thank you for the reminder.  I was still in last week's thread up to yesterday or Wednesday, and it's worth my vote.
    ```

  - u/Chronophilia:
    ```
    No point in upvoting automoderator posts. This subreddit moves slowly enough that any new post will end up in the top 5, and it's likely that most regular readers will see every post no matter how few upvotes it has, so the normal function of upvotes as "bringing good content to the front page" doesn't work.

    I upvote posts to make their author feel rewarded.
    ```

  - u/IomKg:
    ```
    I've mostly been treating reddit as a big forum so maybe i am missing something because of it, but is there any particular point to upvoting other than increasing the visibility in situations where lots of content exist?

    If so why would it be needed to upvote these posts particularly seeing as the number of posts in general, and votes for those posts in particular is so low?

    Also this is an offtopic thread, nothing to bad, but not something particularly valuable(i.e. you will want people looking at the top topics in a few months\years to find it).

    - u/ToaKraka:
      ```
      > Is there any particular point to upvoting other than increasing the visibility in situations where lots of content exist?

      No, that's really the only function of upvotes ("karma"). However, if a person's personal Reddit front page is filled with a zillion different submissions (most of them from subreddits other than this one), a post from this subreddit may need some extra upvotes to appear on that person's personal Reddit front page--especially if he hasn't activated the "Don't show me links that I've upvoted/downvoted" option.
      ```

      - u/IomKg:
        ```
        Hmm wasn't aware of that usecase, so it is interesting.
        But isn't that usage pattern broken in any case? i mean it is inevitable that some subreddits would have significantly more upvotes than the others, and that wont have any relation to how much that person is interested in their content relatively ?

  Any thought's on how I could extract useful energy from the equivalent of a small wood fire that burns constantly using 16th Century technology, and D&D magic?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    A boiler and a turbine, perhaps. The first practical steam engine was patented in 1606. Problem is, it won't produce much energy.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Make an [aeolipile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile)! Efficiency is going to be a problem, and you'll have to find a way to keep it topped off with the water that you're losing due to steam (because I think a condenser is probably one of those things that's beyond the tech level). I almost suggested using a decanter of endless water to fill up the tank, but if you've got one of those then you have easier ways of getting energy.

    I have no idea how much torque you could get out of such a device, but that's my opening offer for someone else to beat.

    Use it to cook.

    If you have access to D&D magic you don't need anything else to break your average campaign setting clean in half. Google 'Tippyverse'.

  Not quite off-topic, but any recommendations for books with interesting magic systems? Especially with interesting non-obvious emergent stuff.

  The Mistborn trilogy is pretty good.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Brandon Sanderson's stuff in general is good; he knows his magic systems.

    *The Merchant Princes* series by Charles Stross has a pretty dead-simple magic system, but the emergent social/economic stuff might be up your alley (this series often gets mixed reviews; if at all possible, get the reissue that shrinks it from six short books into three fat ones).

    *The Powder Mage* trilogy by Brian McClellan also has interesting magic systems, though one of the primary ones is of the "ineffable workings" variety (though it still works). McClellan was a student of Sanderson's and the influence is pretty obvious.

    So this is a random interesting thing I'm just going to tag along on...

    I've got the outlines of a setting bouncing around in the back of my head.  High-fantasy space-faring, originally whipped up to be an RPG setting.  One of the things it's got is an elemental magic system.

    Now when you've go got an elemental magic system you've got to have them interact with each outer.  One thing I feel like I see a lot is the "Pokémon maneuver" - when your electric user and your water user blast the same thing at the same time, breaking down water into component matter, and then a fire user chips in and gets a much bigger fireball than normal for that much power expenditure.  I specifically don't want that in this setting (it's got interplanetary islands and magic and no humans, after all), but then I'm not sure what to do.

    I like the setting, and I would be down with fiction being written/writing fiction in it, so I thought about making a main post here.  But I'm not sure if anything I wrote would be "rational"/"rationalist".

    So if anyone's got ideas or thinks they can help probe, that'd be awesome.  Or I can also share more of asked.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      There are a lot of ways to do elemental magic. The rock/paper/scissors approach is pretty standard, but there's nothing that says you have to go with that. What you have to ask is what you want out of the magic system; how do you want people to use it and how do you want it to impact the world. Personally, I start with some basics and then work my way forward, so that if there *is* a cool maneuver that you can do with some combination of things, it comes more naturally as a result of what you've established about how these things work.

      I would personally suggest posting to /r/magicbuilding instead of /r/rational, since they're experts in the subject of magic systems. /r/rational most often tends to try to break things that are presented to them.
      ```

    - u/TimTravel:
      ```
      The most important part of a magic system is what it can and can't do. Remember: good restrictions make things interesting. The theme is "just" flavor. Flavor is important too of course, in an aesthetic sense, but it doesn't really affect functionality.
      ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    Have you read Sanderson's stormlight archives, or The Name of the wind?

    The *Runelords* series ([Reddit](http://np.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ket47/rthfrunelords/), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41322-the-runelords), [TV Tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRunelords)) is pretty cool.

  Fear the Walking Dead. I understand that they have no concept of zombies in their universe, fine. I understand that it's more of a soap opera than a survival guide, that's also fine. Why can't we get the perspective of a person who is more competent? Not a doomsday prepper, but say, someone that perhaps witnesses an attack, doesn't immediately launch into head-in-the-sand mode, and is like "holy shit, that just happened, this PLAGUE spells doom, I have no contingencies for a situation like this, I need to get moving RIGHT NOW" 

  That would be greeeeeaaaaaattttttt.
  ```

  - u/TimTravel:
    ```
    I have two main problems with zombies as they normally are presented in fiction.

    1. Zombies don't run farms. Given their hyperviolence they're going to starve to death in two weeks, max. A zombie virus could certainly end civilization in a few connected continents, but humanity will survive unless someone is intentionally infecting people on every major continent or the virus has a long gestation period.

    2. Zombies are predisposed to violence so they're going to be twice as likely to fight each other as uninfected humans. This is the point they never bother explaining and I have a hard time suspending disbelief on this.
    ```

    - u/PL_TOC:
      ```
      David Moody kind of bypasses #2 in his Hater trilogy. The 'haters' aren't undead, but are hyperviolent and recognize other haters by sight/vibe. Entertaining read, though I didn't like the main character and I felt some story potential was wasted.
      ```

    - u/Uncaffeinated:
      ```
      I thought that normal fiction zombies don't need to eat and don't fight each other?

      I suppose it depends on the particular type. "Virus" zombies are more problematic than explicitly fantastical undead.
      ```

      - u/TimTravel:
        ```
        I'm only talking about virus zombies. Undead zombies are typically not contagious and really have nothing to do with virus zombies.

  I've been reading a bit about US history with the Sioux Nation.

  The US government signed a treaty with the Sioux Nation (the Treaty at Fort Laramie of 1851) establishing that the Black Hills were theirs and paying $50,000 per year for 50 years for limited land use rights. The US violated this treaty, ceasing payments after ten years. Several years after the US broke their treaty, the Sioux opened hostilities (because the US was still using their land, which had no legal basis any longer thanks to non-payment).

  This second treaty (the Treaty at Fort Laramie of 1868) guaranteed certain lands to the Sioux Nation, and additionally specified that the US government would ensure that the relevant groups would have at least 160 acres of farmland per person. Additionally, they were allowed to hunt outside their sovereign territory. We should have stuck with the original treaty, but if we couldn’t do that, this was at least halfway decent.

  But then the US discovered gold in the Black Hills and forced the people living there to move, using the military. Thus they violated their second treaty. This didn’t break into open warfare for several years, though, when the US military attacked in Montana, which had been promised to First Nations people for their exclusive use.

  Unfortunately, might makes right, or if not right, then at least a large measure of control over what happens. The Sioux were dependent on imported food, so the US threatened to cut off supplies until they agreed to a new treaty. Since the land had already been surveyed and prospected, this new treaty was able to restrict them to unprofitable lands. The treaty claims that the ceded territories were purchased, but there’s no record of a proper, legal exchange. The US Supreme Court has ruled that the treaty was illegal, and the US has paid for the land, but the Sioux are attempting to refuse the transaction. If successful (a prospect that has approximately a whelk’s chance in a supernova), several hundred thousand white people would be faced with a choice of moving or living under a Sioux government, and the Sioux would have to choose whether to grant them citizenship. I would like to see this, mostly because it’s largely the right thing to do and partly because I like seeing more nations on the map. (Still waiting for Styria to declare independence. Or at least Cornwall.)

  The original treaty covered about 40% of South Dakota.
