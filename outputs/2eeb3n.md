  I like it when the author assumes that I'm smart. But sometimes that means that I don't quite follow. What does Sakura think that Kakashi knows (that someone searched her notes?) and why does she think he knows it (he admit he didn't make the mess?)? Somehow she seems to believe that Kakashi knows something about her missing hours?

    I guess it's the disadvantage of writing for the binge reader, where everything is more fresh in memory.

    Basically, Kakashi told her that he didn't make a large mess of her notes. However, her notes *were* a large mess, which means something definitely happened, and that somebody else *has* been in her notes.

    Then he proceeded to say [this](http://prntscr.com/4g2g0i). Maybe it's too subtle, I don't know - it seemed... moderately straightforward to me. But then again I might be biased, since I already know what's going on.

      Gonna be a bit of a dissenting voice here and mention that I interpreted the conversation the way you seem to be explaining it. That was actually my favorite part of the chapter, as I'm a bit of a fan of sideways speech. I hope to see more of it from sneaky, ninja-like ninja.

    Sakura thinks Kakashi knows about her memory loss at graduation evening (I have trouble keeping up too, too many fics, too many story lines), and she questioned Kakashi in a roundabout manner, basically fishing for info, his response is a bit too subtle for me, but I think that's what the author wanted to express.

  This chapter ended up delayed by two weeks because RL got rather thoroughly in the way and prevented me from writing for a time. However, now I'm back home in a stable environment and have learnt my lesson, so the schedule shouldn't suffer any more setbacks.

  I will perform better in the future!

    I've noticed! I'm not complaining, but I don't want you to think that your updates won't be missed, either. I've a bit of a backlog (with fanfiction in general, not your story) but I'm happy that there is a new In Fire Forged chapter, anyway.

  ```
  After reading this chapter, the specific inclusion of Ino makes me increase my belief that "a Yamanaka did it" (regarding the missing hours) to about 70%.

  Really good to have you back, looking forward to seeing where this is going.
