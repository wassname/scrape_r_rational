## [BST] What kind of world would this magic system produce? Wat would you, personally, do with it?

### Post:

[EDIT: argh, *what* would you do with it?]

Medieval-eque tech level, but with widespread crystal-based magic items.

* Self-contained fireball spells, a bit worse than modern-era guns and bombs in terms of aim, firepower etc.
* Magical blades capable of cutting through most materials on a solid hit.
* Teleport spells capable of zapping a vehicle moving above a certain speed (relative to the Earth, lower speeds are harder to pull off) to an empty area roughly near a specified location anywhere in the world.
* Magical Uploads, which can be copied and "reset" fairly easily by anyone in physical contact with them. Uploads can control other magic items they are in contact with, and project basic illusions (not sophisticated enough to fool human eyes, but enough to communicate.)
* "Golem" limbs and body-parts, based on a human or animal model.

Magic items will run essentially forever, although they're not self-repairing (unless you build in an upload who knows how to repair them.) They don't require any kind of power, thermodynamics be damned.

There is another kind of magic; bloodline magic, which is hereditary and fairly broken (mind control, telekenesis, mind-reading, precognition, self-focused biokenesis, and increased aptitude with crystal magic.) But it severely increases susceptibility to mental illness, to the point where it's extremely rare beyond a level so low that it could be mistaken for luck/skill. Bloodline magic is not passed on to any uploads you create, and there is no known way to induce it beyond selective breeding.

In addition, there is a well-known and widespread (albeit mildly expensive) plant poultice capable of curing most injuries and diseases, although it cannot regrow amputated or sufficiently damaged body parts.

  The creation of magical perpetual motion machines is energetically favored, and there is a half-life-per-cubic-centimeter rate at which space spontaneously becomes transformed into magical suns. Once created, they release energy into the regions around them which, while subject to the inverse square law, still provide energy to use to accelerate the process in the surrounding space since it has a higher energy density to use to spontaneously cause the transformation.

  Your universe catches on magical fire and burns down immediately because you made hard vacuum flammable and the kindling point absolute zero. In the next one, don't damn thermodynamics.

    well maybe the power source is not obvious at a local level. maybe each fireball cast reduces infinitesimally the universe's background radiation or taps on the planet's magnetic field? let's keep the universe not splodey XD

    This is kind of an awesome answer. I almost want to see a story that explores this death spiral, though perhaps not so catastrophically.

    Magic crystals can only be produced from the blood of a murdered god, and the gods are all dead :P

    Still.

    *Good* answer.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    I have to admit, I'm a little unclear on your reasoning re: crystals and poultice are banned. (You're almost certainly right about the witch-hunts, though.)

  Use cutting blades and golumns to make massive self propelled barges. Combine with canals and lakes and you have a massive influx of cheap travel and trade. The world is connected. 

  Magic tanks and mobile defense towers around all of the lakes. Defense in depth is hard. Anything landlocked is safer, but much more cut off from supply.

  Seems like a pretty deadly place, heavily biased towards offence rather than defence. A teleport spell, but no tele-blocker to keep your house safe from invading teleporters. Fireballs, and unstoppable blades, but no magic shields or anti-fire potions. Seems like the thing to do is to gain a decent stockpile of fireball amulets, build up a force of magical uploads then build a castle. The uploads are weak at close range, so make sure they never get close. Keep them behind defences and arrow slits. If you can just graft on golem limbs, why stop at just 2 arms for a warrior? Especially if 2 can hold normal weapons while the others all hold crystals. It seems more and more that a properly outfitted person would have an extreme advantage. 

  As for the bloodline mages, they'd pretty much be walking natural disasters. I mean really, mind control and precognition alone is enough to make the Simurgh fearsome. Telekinesis of swarms of magical razors would cut down just about anything. Biokinesis to harden skin into armour and re-route injuries. The only thing for it would be to hope they're too mentally compromised to plan properly or else they're going to be in charge of the place, or at least some local places. It would make a good Warring Gods age which destroyed all that came before, Shinsekai Yori style. From there you can imply various things about how this all came to be if you like. Sufficiently advanced arseholes or whatever.

  The magic crystals don't run out of charge, so it seems fighting would be limited basically by population total number of crystals. A large part of war would be capturing enemy crystals seeing as i'm assuming that more don't get built often (if at all). If you have them, and your enemy does not then you've basically won. Consequently a decisive battle would be doubly so, because their force is suddenly much stronger for all the extra uploads and fireballs that they've looted that you no longer have. 

  Looks like wars would come pretty often, no real limit on it on the arms side, teleporting carts would sure make dealing with a supply chain easier. Works for messages and orders too.

  How was crystal magic discovered? The history is important, because the people in power back then are presumably still around.

  How viable is a von Neumann upload golem? To quote HPMOR's chapter 119:
  >Someone would think of it, someone would talk, someone would try it. The probability was as close to certainty as made no difference.

  Or, to put it another way: What costs more, constructing an upload golem or raising a baby to mastery? Because that's the way the malthusian trap goes.

  Can the magic items do anything other that what you've listed?
  ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  What does teleporting do to the objects momentum? Can you just drop objects off of a cliff and teleport them, or do you have to limit stuff that you don't have to worry about breaking, and teleport normal stuff by using a pulley system and tying it to a boulder you toss off of a cliff?

  The magical uploads would give you post-scarcity economy. Find some people who like working and upload some copies of them. Since they won't have to worry about much themselves, they'll work for you. And since you can copy the people who work more, you can find people who are really willing to work.

  Since uploads don't seem to have to worry about lifespan, it seems likely that they'll end up in power.
  ```

- u/puesyomero:
  ```
  manual work is over. golems take over most manufacturing and menial jobs like agriculture, textiles, construction, etc. after the initial die-off of hungry jobless peasants the economy settles as a pseudo post scarcity economy arises where only the crystals themselves are worth something and pay for services, art, or prestige as most goods stem from them. jobs are basicaly creative, or finding mines/crystallizing mana
  ```
