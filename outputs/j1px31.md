  Well this arc title is promising.
  > *Tunnel Vision sold me this body.*

  This seems REALLY tenuous. It strikes me as the sort of "realization" that comes about as a psychological defense mechanism. Ana was starting to realize that Commonplace (however monstrous their methods) had legitimate arguments and reasons to fight while the Principality was worse than she'd believed it to be. Her black and white, "Commonplace bad, Paragon good" worldview was threatened. Just before she's actually forced to adjust her beliefs and admit the world is more complicated than she thought, however, she latches on to a flimsy connection that lets her blame Commonplace for everything wrong in her life, thereby letting her continue to uncritically reject everything that doesn't paint Commonplace as the spawn of Satan.

    It definitely is. There is zero proof that Commonplace sold the body, her logic is basically "Commonplace uses shell companies and Sapphire Industrial is a shell company, so Commonplace must own Sapphire Industrial!"

    >It could be a coincidence.  Lots of shifty people used front companies.  But the timing made sense.  Grace Acworth had become the Pyre Witch, and begun her takeover of the mob a year or two before I’d been struck with Loic’s Syndrome.  In the chaos after the Treaty of Silence was broken, no one was paying attention to the black market.  It was the perfect time to make a quick buck off gullible Humdrums.

    >The insight was so obvious, so clear.  How had I never seen it before?

    She goes right from "it might be a coincidence" to "I'm 100% sure" just like that.

      There is this though:

      > Then it washed over me.  Sapphire Industrial.  The fraudulent corporation **I’d stopped investigating a few years ago.**

      It is possible that, if she got her hands on any of the important documents for Sapphire, the details might have matched the documents they were just given. It's hard to say without access to those documents, and without a complete explanation of what this vocation does.

    The funny part is that it's equally likely that the government has just as much, if not more, involvement in Sapphire than Commonplace does. Shady corporations don't tend to have solid or consistent political ties.

    But Ana doesn't think in those terms. She treats the government and Commonplace as hard factions, instead of what they effectively are; two groups with ties to the same societal elite and access to technology engaging in a power struggle.
    ```

  ```
  Ana? What are you doing?

  You get back on the plot rails and ally with the morally ambiguous rebels this instant, young lady!
  ```

- u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
  ```
  So...is Ana finally admitting she doesn't care what's right and is more concerned with her personal vendetta? Because that's sure what it feels like.
  ```

  - u/AcceptableBook:
    ```
    I'm not so sure. I think she's saying that she doesn't care for "revolutionary" movements that actively hurt the people they're supposed to be protecting. It is definitely personal, but I think her point might still stand on its own.
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      The link between Commonplace and Sapphire Industrial is tenuous at best. It's like saying "Stalin liked steak, so eating meat makes you like Stalin." She latches onto it when her worldview is challenged, and she flat out said she doesn't care about the injustice of world or anything else anymore,

      >I don’t care what happened to Maxine Clive.  I didn’t care about Buttercup Lodge or the origins of chassis or all the endless injustice at the heart of this world.  I didn’t care about her Helmfirth conspiracy, or her hijacked Parliament, or her ‘gods’, if they even existed.


      It does feel like she's trying to justify her actions, but it's getting harder to ignore that she's helping preserve a greater evil. And it requires turning a blind eye more and more often to evidence that runs counter to her ideals.
      ```

      - u/AcceptableBook:
        ```
        Hm. I get your point. I agree that Ana's assumption here is far from ironclad. But I think your analogy is possibly not that generous to Ana. There's (maybe?) a difference between an argument that goes "Stalin liked steak, so eating meat makes you like Stalin." and "Commonplace operated a lot of these specific types of shell companies during this time period, they were the biggest players in the black market at the time, and Sapphire was one of these types of organizations." Like, steaks are relatively common, but shell companies fitting a certain criteria might not be. 

        To be clear, I'm not trying to argue that Ana is right or wrong. I'm just saying that she might be basing her assertion on information that we're not privy to. I think the fact that we weren't given that much information about Sapphire is a questionable authorial choice, and I think we should wait to see where madwhitesnake takes it before coming for a decision. In my opinion, they've done a good job of creating complex characters with complex motivations, and I don't think that they're going to buck that trend anytime soon. I think that whatever path Ana is going to take, is ultimately going to be her own way and not anyone else's, for good or for bad.
        ```

    I feel like that's being a bit uncharitable. She's confused, she's depressed, she's hurt, she doesn't know what to believe, so she's latching on to one thing that is viscerally *real* to her amidst all these confusing conspiracies and competing "truths." It's a purely emotional reaction; it's not that she doesn't care what's right, it's that she doesn't *know* what's right but she does know that her life sucks and she wants someone to blame.

    I think if you asked her "Do you care about doing the right thing? Do you care about helping people?" her answer would be "Of course!" The issue comes when you ask her what the right thing *is*, when you ask her *how* she's helping people, because she's sort of having a meltdown right now (understandably so) and so she's refusing to think about things that are emotionally distressing such as "is the group that I've idolized my whole life, who I have committed crimes for, who I have *killed* for, actually evil?" and "do the terrorist have a point?"

    She's letting her emotions lead the way and not really thinking about the "conclusions" they're leading her to and the broader ramifications of her actions. Which, yeah, that's never really a good thing to do and it's easy to criticize her for from the outside, but considering she's a homeless fugitive with a terminal illness who recently lost her superpowers due to being betrayed by the government she idolized, I think it's understandable.
    ```

  - u/Mr-Mister:
    ```
    I think it’s more that she’s more inclined to punishing a particular evil that hits closer to home than she is to keep going after the biggest picture stuff.

    Saying that it’s wrong for her to go after the body scammers instead of the big picture stuff is like saying that it’s wrong for people to work in animal rights organisations when there is still much work to be done in human rights (mind you I’m not condemning that at all).
