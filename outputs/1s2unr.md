## Spoiler tags!

### Post:

We use the same system as on /r/HPMOR, so [context for spoiler] plus (#s "spoiler goes here") gives [context for spoiler](#s "spoiler goes here"). It shows the spoiler if you hover, and works on mobile. Let me know if you have any critiques.

ETA: It's 100% fixed now; thanks again for all of your help everyone!

### Comments:

- u/None:
  ```
  It doesn't look like /r/HPMOR. There's a big blank space where we should be seeing "context for spoiler".
  ```
