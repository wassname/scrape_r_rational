  Summary of the relevant chunk of the video: "hyper-rational decision-making agents" will have their morality eroded over time if they follow game theory too closely.

  Response: Only if their time horizon is short. Game theory in particular and rationality in general tell you how to achieve whatever your goal is. If your time horizon is short (e.g. "how do I win this game of poker"?) then they will lead you to cheat / do sloppy work / etc. If your time horizon is long (e.g. "how do I win a game of poker every night for the rest of my life?") then they will push you towards prosocial behavior that demonstrates integrity and thereby improves reputation, as lacking reputation makes it harder to convince others to help you.

    I think part of the problem is that people generally dont understand their own value systems and their relationship to morality and game theory. My theory is that there are actually four types of morality with different functions in society: Punish Defectors (eye for an eye), Reward cooperators (golden rule), minimize suffering, and maximize flourishing. Morality only cares about the outer game, not the minigames contained within the outer game. That's why people can be rivals with each other in the context of a board game but still be friends outside it. If you lose a minigame you've only lost a small amount of payoff, and your total payoff across all minigames can still be pretty high. I wonder if people who are poor sports or cheaters tend to be people who think they have a low payoff in the outer game so they try to gain as much payoff as they can anywhere they can get it, even at the expense of other people's outer game payoff.

      Another aspect of it is that people tend to heavily discount the value of things that will happen further out into the future versus things that will happen very soon. 

      It's not that we make a rational decision to do so, our brains simply evolved to think:
      Eating one chicken today is much better than not eating today and eating two chickens a year from now (what, you don't want a 100% return on that investment?)

      Either that, or people whose outer game payoff is so high and guaranteed, they don't have to fear losing it anyway. For example, they're disgustingly rich, or they're very powerful, so people will pander to them regardless of how shitty they act.

    It's worse than that. This is the same tired Hollywood lies about how business people are or always become evil. Lies about how empathy and rationality are opposites. About how anyone who seeks to win doesn't care about or must give up on caring about others. 

    It's repetitive toxic BS in service of priming people to accept the premise that capitalism is evil. Having good actors and a story that grabs your emotions doesn't save it if you're able to notice the ugly cliches.

  There are no 'hyperrational decision makers'. At best some decision makers are slightly more rational than others. We are all running on roughly similar hardware, and that hardware is a scary collection of kludges thrown together by evolution. We are way better at rationalization than at making actual rational decisions.

  I don't know the source material here, but the fact that a law enforcement person ends up risking jail time (@12:25) is good evidence that he was not that good at managing his risks, was not rational and was rationalizing instead.

  So, don't trust yourself, I guess. And don't blame game theory for your own irrationality.

    > So, don't trust yourself, I guess. And don't blame game theory for your own irrationality.

    That's nicely put.

    The problem is that characters in mainstream fiction are often never self-aware enough to apply these principles. Fiction with characters that have a healthy dose of self-doubt but still face meaningful struggles is way too rare.

  While a goal might be rational, and you might use rational strategies to achieve that goal, becoming so obsessed on achieving that goal that you ignore any other consequences of your actions is irrational by definition (but sadly, not uncommon).  That's why so many people who identify themselves as "rationalist" also identify themselves as "utilitarian": if you pretend that the only consequences of your actions are the intended ones, you're deluding yourself.

  To put it another way...  I'm going to define "ethics" as an optimal self-consistent moral code, defined such that every person benefits from every person adhering to it, and such that the most good comes to the most people by doing so.

  If someone tries to pursue a goal, even a noble one, but disregards ethics in that pursuit, then that is harmful to society, both through the breach of ethics itself, as well as the example it sets for other people striving to achieve goals.  The rational thing for society to do is to remove any incentive for defaulting on the ethical obligation by taking away whatever they've achieved, and, in addition, apply punishment so that the person is worse off for their lapse.

  If you do that, then a rational actor would price the removal of achievement and the disincentive into their decisions, and continue to adhere to the system of ethics.

  We, and the characters in "Billions," don't live in a world with such a well-defined ethical system (yet), but something resembling it is still there, and, whole I haven't watched the show, it sounds, from that video, like it's those societal disincentives that are punishing the characters for their moral lapses and obsession with achieving their goals at any costs.  If they're not pricing that into their decision-making, then, however rational their goal, they're not really behaving rationally, even if the methods they take to achieve that goal adopt the trappings of rationality (e.g. game theory).

  Game Theory makes a number of assumptions, (which you should examine before using) and even in hypothetical scenarios, its idea of rational isn't necessarily the best way to go. All this criticism of Game Theory misses the obvious one: what do you value? Game Theory's recommendations of what to do are based the value you place on outcomes. (As well as everyone else's view, so you can predict what they do. If you see "following Game Theory" as bad, say, morally, then maybe you haven't taken into account the value you place on being moral/not being immoral.) What's next, criticizing 'expected utility theory' for 'recommending you buy lottery tickets'?

  This is the classic Hollywood trope that rationality and empathy are not compatible, and in classic rational fic's like HPMOR, it can be demonstrated that this is not the case. Someone ignoring their empathetic urges to complete a certain action without taking into account the value loss of losing their sense of empathy, is acting irrationally in my mind. 

  I'm kind of sick of seeing this trope in the same way that I'm sick of similar tropes such as  smart people only being written to sound smart instead of actually acting in smart ways.
