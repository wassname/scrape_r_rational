## Does this story have a lot of flaws scientifically?

  So the human body consists of more than 60% H2O so ... Yeah, if being allergic to water in the bloodstream was a thing, then insta-death. There however is a poorly understood skin condition that some people have causing just their skin to have issues upon contact with water. https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquagenic_urticaria&ved=2ahUKEwjxrMa8ruHeAhWZXysKHQHLA9MQwaICMAx6BAgNEDI&usg=AOvVaw2i3UXNRoOGqHUSEYTWwyMt

  Honestly it's a bit of an odd choice for a book and feels like it falls into an "uncanny valley" of plot, it is neither something realistic enough to take seriously, nor sufficiently obviously false as to become readable as fantasy/SciFi, from the sound of it there is no world building to explain this, the same emotional effect could likely have been made in a more realistic way.

  Honestly it sounds like the kind of trashy SI badly written woe is me fanfic that I drop 5 paragraphs in

  Not Heidi Falconer (and/or someone pretending to be Heidi Falconer) again?
