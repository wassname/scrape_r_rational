  I'm reading The Martian and Ready Player One, both are absolutely awesome(RPO is not rational, but I love it anyway). 

  I was very surprised to find out that Andy Weir(the author of The Martian) wrote the RPO fanfiction, I think it's really cool.

    HAH! This is the best thing I ever read, somehow it's not annoying to read netspeak, so that was pretty great.

      Relevant to the subreddit by theme and conceit, and to the post by way of author.
