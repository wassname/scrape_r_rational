## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Is it too soon to talk about The Last Jedi?

  Screw it. I'm talking about The Last Jedi. To be more precise, I want *to talk about talking about movie*, because the discussion of the film is filled with fallacious reasoning and hardly any communication despite the enormous quantity of dialogue occuring. 

  First, a disclaimer: I never watched any trailers and wasn't spoiled on anything which happened before I saw it. Even so, I personally didn't like the film very much, but that's mostly because I didn't like The Force Awakens or anything it did with the franchise. However, I really do feel that The Last Jedi did many things which only exacerbated those problems without actually doing much that was "courageous and praiseworthy".

  Anyway, here's what I've observed of the film's reception, both online and offline:

  * The film is truly polarizing. By the time credits roll, you have a pretty strong opinion of whether it was a good movie or not. This seems to be by design, and if so the creators certainly succeeded. However, this quality also means that there is very little middle ground to be had.

  * There are/were vocal hate-mobs on both sides. It's stupid but true, and definitely colored the immediate reception and discussion of the film moving forward.

  * The original Star Wars trilogy is more of a sacred cow than ever This is one of my biggest dislikes of the new trilogy. If someone says "it's like poetry, it rhymes" one more time, *I am going to vomit*.

  * The movie has high highs and low lows. Liking or disliking the movie largely depends on which one outweighs the other for you.

  With that out of the way, let me talk about somewhat spoiler-y things:

  Fans who love The Last Jedi say:

  [The Last Jedi Spoilers](#s " "The fans who hate the movie are just mad that their elaborate crazy theories about Snoke's backstory / Rey's parentage / Luke Skywalker / Kylo Ren / The Resistance / The First Order / Rey's power / etc. are wrong and they're whining about it."")

  [](#s "Of course the sidequest to the casino planet was important! Look at all the character development that happened!" I just want to say that it's pretty stupid that the height of the galactic ultra-wealthly leisure activity is a perfectly bland modern earth casino.)

  [](#s "What about the original t trilogy? Those movies had the same qualities as this one. Why are you mad at this one and not those? It's hypocritical." Oh my god, I am so sick of whataboutisms.)

  [](#s "The haters are just mad that the white males and rich people in this movie are all dumb and terrible while the real important characters are the women / asians / blacks / hispanics / robots / aliens.")

  [](#s ""Kylo Ren is so hot." Well, you got me there.")

  [](#s ""The fans who hate the movie aren't true Star Wars fans, they're just kids who grew up on the prequels and can't comprehend the artistic genius of this film." The movie absolutely is very clever and layered with many subtleties. The problem is that I dislike almost every single one of them.")

  [](#s ""The Last Jedi is a movie that challenges Star Wars fans." oh god kill me now")

  Fans who hate The Last Jedi say: 

  [](#s ""The movie is too long and has bad pacing, and the side plots are pointless." Yeah, 'cause that's never happened in a Star Wars movie before."")

  [](#s ""Rey is a total Mary Sue. She never fails at anything despite having known how to use the Force for like six days max."")

  [](#s ""The white males were rewritten to be dumb and terrible just so that the women / asians / blacks / hispanics / robots / aliens could show how not dumb and terrible they are."")

  [](#s ""The movie is full of plot holes and dumb plot-devices which force the story in a direction which turns out to be pretty dull."")

  [](#s ""The fans who love the movie aren't real Star Wars fans, they just have a rose-tinted view of the original trilogy and would celebrate every blockbuster Disney throws at them."")

  I don't have the heart to go on. The two sides are continuously talking past each other. It's nonsense. Reading /r/StarWars is an exercise in futility these days.

  At least the memes are good.

    Congratulations Rian Johnson, you've done the impossible: You made *Revenge of the Sith* look good.

    I have a list of grievances with this movie longer than my arm, but topping the list is this:

    > Darth Vader in *A New Hope*: The power of the Death Star is nothing compared to the power of the Force.

    > Luke Skywalker in *The Last Jedi*: The power of the Force is nothing compared to the power of the First Order.

    ---

    As for people *telling me why I hate it*... screw you guys. I hate it 'cause it's bad, and I can develop a very extensive case for why this is. Bad storytelling, poor characterization, stupid messages and themes. What's confusing is the [92% of professional critics](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_the_last_jedi) who gave positive reviews. I'm not sure whether it's kinder to suppose they're lying, or that they have bad taste. I suspect they're trying to rate the movie as they think a fan would rate it, but not being fans, they really can't.

      > What's confusing is the 92% of professional critics who gave positive reviews. I'm not sure whether it's kinder to suppose they're lying, or that they have bad taste.

      Is it possible they're reviewing it objectively as a film, whereas you're looking at it through the eyes of a hardcore fan?

      Not to say individual reviewers can't be biased, or have bad opinions, or "be lying".

      But if I hated a movie that 92% of professional movie critics gave a positive review...I would just figure that movie must not be for me, not that it's objectively terrible and that 307 of the 334 critics who reviewed it are either wrong or liars.

      **EDIT:** And note that just because 92% of critics give it a positive review, doesn't mean it's a 92/100-scored movie; it just means 92% of critics recommend seeing it over not seeing it. I found it good enough to say it's worth seeing, but I'd still only score the movie around a 6/10.

      Personally speaking, while not a fan of star wars in general (I've only seen bits and peices of the original movies, and read through a novelization of #3 ages ago, but most of what I know is through cultural osmosis), I've loved the 3 most recent films. Part of that's just the fact that I fetishize dogfighting (Poe is easily my favorite character), but the rest of it is for reasons I suspect fans would feel the exact opposite about.

      Number one: Rei. I like that she's a competent character who drives her own plot, makes her own decisions, and in general is a "strong independent woman who don't need no man ~~except kylo ren~~." In that sense, she reminds me of Taylor from Worm or Catherine from A Practical Guide to Evil, works I am also very much a fan of. Sure, she takes up a lot of attention from the plot, but that's fine because she's a deuteragonist anyways, but I think that attention is well deserved because of her tendency to be proactive. It's for those same reasons that fans think she's such a mary sue, and maybe she is. But I'm signficantly more tolerant of mary-sue-ness than most fans would be, so it's a non-issue for my enjoyment. 

      Number two: plot similarities to the original star wars trilogy. This one is pretty simple. Fans aren't very interested in seeing the exact same story repackaged, but I'm seeing this plotline play out for the very first time (excepting for all the other hero's journeys I've seen, anyways), and the CGI and SFX is miles better than the originals.

      Number three: thematic issues. I personally haven't spent enough time talking to fans to understand why they don't like the themes in rogue one, but for me it's fundamenally a non-issue. There are a number of themes that I disdain (anti-technology hippy dippy stuff, predestination, and of course the laundry list of stuff I'd vote against at the ballot box), but aside from that I'm willing to swallow a lot. A *good* theme enhances the story, but otherwise I just ignore thematic elements. For reference, I enjoyed Sucker Punch purely on the basis on its fight scenes. That being said, the whole "actiony characters taking action" thing (Rei, Finn, Poe) thing *is* a theme I enjoy, so I'm all for it.

      Overall, The two main-series star wars films have been (depending on how I'm feeling at the moment) 7.5-8.5/10 films for me (would recommend to a friend; would recommend they shell out to see them in theatres) and Rogue One was an 8-9/10 film for me.

        > (excepting for all the other hero's journeys I've seen, anyways)

        Ah, yes. Just so. *The Last Jedi* takes this away, doesn't it?

        > thematic issues

        *Themes* shouldn't be things one agrees or disagrees with. They aren't *policy preferences*. One of the themes of *The Last Jedi* is the need for leaders rather than heroes. I'm fine with that theme *in isolation*. But not in **the middle of a freakin' heroic tale**! The story ends up undercutting it's own theme (like when Rose stops Finn from his suicide run against the cannon; she saves him from his heroics at the cost of everyone else's lives).
        ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          >One of the themes of The Last Jedi is the need for leaders rather than heroes.

          What? The Last Jedi in no way had that theme. There was some dialog early on that made you think that it would, but that dialog gets contravened since in literally every scenario, personal heroism won the day, it didn't actually had that theme. The masterminds (Leia, Snoke, the purple-haired lady whose name I forget, the FO general) had their contributions dwarfed by the personal prowess of the characters who actually got the majority of the screen time. Snoke gets offed by Kylo, not some elaborate plot. The purple-haired lady's plan to save the fleet only works because she goes full kamikaze, rather than any tactical genius. Leia does no leading when unconscious.

          This star wars movie, just like all the previous ones, has a theme about how the actions of a few are what end up deciding everything. Incidentally, that's not a theme I like (because despite your protestations, themes are subject to personal taste), but one I tolerate because it's so omnipresent I'd have ignore the majority of works if I wasn't willing to consume stuff including it.

    I have mixed feelings about TLJ. It's flawed, but I think I'd rank it in the top half of the "main sequence" SW movies (not counting *Rogue One*).

    Here's the thing: a lot of common complaints (or variants thereof) about TLJ, could apply to *any* of the SW movies, even the sacred original trilogy.

    In the fiery trash heap that is TLJ discussion, I came across [this very level-headed review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_3_W4GRb44). One of the narrator's best points, I thought, was this:

    > Every *Star Wars* movie sucks. I'm one of the biggest SW fans, but you gotta admit, this shit's dumb.

    > But, it's still awesome.

    > We just make different excuses for the SW movies that we enjoy.

    > I've talked to people who hate TLJ, but then they say they love the prequels; they come up with all sorts of excuses for why those movies are good.

    > Basically, this is the kind of series where you really need to just accept the dumb stuff, and enjoy the stuff you like.

    It's disappointing to see people throwing such extreme hate towards TLJ. It's perfectly fine if you don't like it, but you can't point at every flaw in the movie for reasons why it's "bad", while ignoring similar (or much bigger!) flaws in the SW movies you like.

    *Empire*'s one of my favorite movies of all time, and is now critically acclaimed, but it's got plenty of problems. Heck, when it first came out, [the New York Times reviewed it as boring and pointless](http://www.nytimes.com/1980/06/15/movies/moviesspecial/15EMPI.html).
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:

      Yeah, I switched between "Oh my god, this is so dumb" and "Omygosh this is awesome!" many times during this movie.

    There were so many utterly baffling things about the movie. I feel like my recollection of the other entries in the series is inaccurate enough that I can't really judge its relative merit, but I didn't come away with a great overall impression.

    There was one moment in particular that immediately undercut all the explanations for the way things played out in previous movies. No spoilers here, but regulars here may work out what I'm referencing.

    Imagine if, in the sixth book of Harry Potter, Harry used his dose of Felix Felicis (liquid luck) to devise an improved version of the potion, iterating upon it until he had attained an alchemical Path to Victory.

    The audience would probably have otherwise assumed that that wouldn't work, even if no explicit reason for that was apparent. After all, if the solution was so easy, why was it not already done? Why didn't the Order of the Phoenix use it, why didn't Voldemort? And now that the secret is out there, won't everybody just do that all the time? Shouldn't this massively change the world of Harry Potter?

    The new Star Wars movie has a moment like that. I can only assume some writer needed a way to get themselves out of a corner, but in doing so they made so many triumphant moments of the series seem utterly pointless.

    I think Star Wars, especially Disney Star Wars, isn't really my style any more.

      There actually is an (extended universe) explanation for some of that.

    I am really upset about this movie. I think it had a lot of potential and i saw the seeds of it while watching but it really didnt make a lot of sense.

    [spoilers](#s "Why are the space physics not consistent ? why arent shields consistent ? Sometimes they work sometimes they dont. doesnt make a lot of sense and it took me out of the movie.")

    [spoilers](#s "Why didnt holdo tell poe the plan ? It doesnt make sense and we would avoid the stupid casino scene and the whole stupid subplot. Finn deserved  better than this.")

    [spoilers](#s "Why isnt poe punished for his insubordination. Rebelion works like a millitary organization. Not respecting orders twice and leia and holdo are like 'oh such a hotblooded rascal he is ohohohoho' ")

    [spoilers](#s "I am actually fine with things not being that explained. But in ep 7 we clearly got this set up by JJ abrams and it seems like it was just thrown away. Rens Knights, Snokes Origins etc. the fans desevred some explenation.")

    [spoilers](#s "How does lightspeed work... Why couldnt holdo just leave the ship with others ? What about the shields. Why didnt they do this earlier. Why isnt this weaponized yet ? if they can launch things like that they didnt need to destroy the death star with some clever plan. Just ram a ship into it... or a couple.")

    [spoilers](#s "The whole scene with lukes astral projection wasnt that bad but i have mixed feelings. He dies anyways so why couldnt they make him fight with kylo in person. On the other hand the dissapearance of his against the image of twin suns was nice and all.")

    [spoilers](#s "What about Carrie fisher? Does it mean we will get a CGI actress in ep 9 or will she die offscreen ? Also the superleia scene...what ?")

    [spoilers](#s "Rey is too strong for training in force for that amount of time.. idk seems kinda weird.")

    [spoilers](#s "Snokes death is almost comedic") 

    [spoilers](#s "Kylo characters is really inconsistent i feel. He still is a bit of an edgelord and then he isnt and i dont know what to think.")

    Things i liked about the movie:

    [spoilers](#s "Luke rejecting the jedi was a pretty cool thing in theory. But they didnt follow through with it.")

    [spoilers](#s "Kylo and Rey working together to end the sith and the jedi was a cool concept which we didnt see executed.")

    [spoilers](#s "The cinematography was gorgeous and every shot of the movie looked awesome")

    [spoilers](#s "Snoke calling out kylo on being a wannabe vader")

    edit: I havent listen all of the things i liked/disliked since i couldnt remember all of them but those i think are the main ones

    The movie doesnt have balls. It tries to do many things at once but at the same time it doesnt follow through.

      >[spoilers](#s "Why didnt holdo tell poe the plan ? It doesnt make sense and we would avoid the stupid casino scene and the whole stupid subplot. Finn deserved  better than this.")

      [spoilers](#s "Out-of-universe the reason is threefold: to subvert the unspoken plan guarantee (making the audience think there's some plan that's going to save the day, but then turning around and having the first order actually be smart enough to hard-deny it), to give finn some screen time (and in turn, get a romantic subplot in there), and to set up the final scene with the force-sensitive kid. In universe, while I don't think there's an explicit reason, it's easy to think of potential unspoken reasons: to contain information from FO snooping until it's too late, in an attempt to use the unspoken plan guarantee to keep morale up despite having such a risky plan, because the acting admiral didn't want to risky any opposition to her plan on grounds of "running away" until it was already to late to change course, etcetera. It's inelegant that they force us to think up our own reasons, but it's not impossible to.")

      >[spoilers](#s "Why isnt poe punished for his insubordination. Rebelion works like a millitary organization. Not respecting orders twice and leia and holdo are like 'oh such a hotblooded rascal he is ohohohoho' ")

      [spoilers](#s "Morale reasons, probably. With so few people left, punishing the orchestrator of the closest thing the rebellion has had recently to a sucesfull attack on the FO wouldn't go over well with the very, very small contigent of rebellion forces remaining.")

      > [spoilers](#s "The whole scene with lukes astral projection wasnt that bad but i have mixed feelings. He dies anyways so why couldnt they make him fight with kylo in person. On the other hand the dissapearance of his against the image of twin suns was nice and all.")

      [spoilers](#s "This part was actually pretty clever. Think about it-- how would Luke even have gotten in range of the base without getting killed by orbital FO forces? How would he have gotten into the base in a timely manner without walking directly in? How could he have stood against the incredible amount of firepower kylo ren had levied against him for any reasonable length of time? Kylo ren is so powerful he scares luke; had Luke actually come personally, he'd been obliterated. Sure, he was a powerful guy, but he's not omnipotent. So instead, he makes an extremely ballsy bluff. Banking on the fact that Kylo Ren would *overestimate* his capabilities, he sends a projection instead to get Kylo to waste his resources and time. And the plan works flawlessly. Kylo notices discrepancies in how Luke acts, like how he doesn't leave marks on the sand and he constantly dodges lightsaber strikes instead of engaging. But Kylo fears his legend so much he still takes Luke seriously, and it buys the rebellion the time to escape. Plus, having luke actually die to kylo ren would legitimize him, and boost morale for the FO. Instead, he has one last "fuck you" and doesn't even leave a corpse. If Luke had come personally, he'd have been blown to giblets by the first AT-AT shot, the rebellion would have lost its will to fight, and this would be a duology instead of a trilogy.")

      I feel like you misunderstood the "Jedi must end" theme. The audience is never supposed to *agree* with it, we're supposed to root for Luke to *overcome* it as his character arc for the film.

It also would be more interesting to actually explore the whole "Last Jedi" thing and not only  present it as another thing to overcome.

  Modular origami provides an easy way to make gifts that look *significantly* more impressive than they actually are. You don't even need to be an expert in paperfolding.

  0\. Get a few hundred Post-It Notes (or generic square sticky notes). (Tip: It's okay if the side lengths are unequal by a millimeter or two, but any worse discrepancy means you should look for a better brand of sticky notes.)  
  1\. Make a [waterbomb base](https://www.origami-resource-center.com/waterbomb-base.html) with a sticky note. (Tip: Start with the adhesive strip on your right side and stuck to your folding surface. Use valley folds for the diagonals, then take the paper off the surface and into your hands and make the first non-diagonal fold by squashing the paper up all at once. Rotate the wings around and repeat for the other non-diagonal fold.)  
  2\. Make a [preliminary base](https://www.origami-resource-center.com/preliminary-base.html) with another sticky note. (Tip: Follow Step 1, then invert the result.)  
  3\. Slide the preliminary base on top of the waterbomb base. Try to ensure a snug fit&mdash;but not *too* snug. (Tip: The preliminary base should have its adhesive strip on the inside of one edge. Fit the edges of the preliminary base to the wings of the waterbomb base in this order: First, the one with adhesive; second, the opposite edge; third, the other two edges.)  
  4\. Fold the protruding corners of the preliminary base inward, over the edges of the waterbomb base. This is a *module*.  
  5\. Repeat steps 1 through 4 until you've made twelve modules. (Tip: *Do not* stop at eight modules and try to make a square antiprism or a gyrobifastigium in Step 6. The angles will be too tight, and the finished model will look bad.)  
  6\. Assemble the modules into a [cuboctahedron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboctahedron) by sliding the tips of the waterbomb bases underneath the edges of the preliminary bases. (Tip: If a connection is difficult, *be gentle*. This goes *double* for the insertion of the final module.)

  Steps 1 through 6 should consume about 45 minutes. Examples of the final product can be viewed [here](https://boards.4chan.org/po/thread/558840#p559188).

  Some actual code progress!  I finally was willing to admit that I had bitten off more than I could chew in selecting Ember and Symantic UI, so I tried to figure out what to move to next.  I considered just doing it all in Unity targeting WebGL, WebForms in ASP.NET, and saying screw the web and just doing it in a mono-friendly WinForms app.  You might (or might not) notice that all of these are in C#; I was certainly pining for something familiar.


  After about a day’s worth of waffling I sucked it up and took the recommendation of some of the kind-hearted souls on Discord and just started doing basic html/javascript using first bootstrap and then jquery/jqueryUI.  It was certainly nice to have a system simple enough that problems were obvious again, and throwing things together has been much faster:

  https://i.imgur.com/1lM9TIf.png

  So not much to look at, but functional (for all of the two things it can currently do).  Now that I have a foundation to iterate on, and a workflow that, well, works, things ought to move much more smoothly. Over the next couple of weeks I think I can (with the help of our friendly neighborhood Discord) knock out a decent visual port of the old Bill’s PC and start hammering out some functionality.  I’ll also get a web server set up, I think, so that people can start tinkering and offering feedback.


  I’m going to skip next week’s update, since we’ve got both Christmas and New Year’s coming up.  See you in 2018!

  Not sure what to do with my life and I think I should probably make a decision.

  Current qualifications:

  - Engineering degree and ~5 years experience in project management (traffic engineering)
  - Computer science degree but with no coding experience
  - Speak French OK (B1/B2) 
  - One third of a health degree (focus in nutrition)

  Current work situation:

  - Very stable full time government job with a boss I don't like working for very much
  - Very likely to get an opportunity to work a very similar job in terms of pay/stability/etc by doing job 
  - Take 1 day a week off during semester times to study completely unrelated nutrition degree because I find it really interesting

  Current academic situation:

  - I've gotten a high distinction for every unit I've studied so far and per above I've finished a third of my course, which includes units across several difficulty levels but does not include much of the complex chemistry I'll be doing starting next year.

  - For the most part I really enjoy it but assignment season can be very stressful

  Current living situation:

  - Poly, two stable partners (5 years / 10 years respectively)

  - Really shitty house that has lost some but not value since we bought it, needs expensive repairs in the medium to long term, really just needs to be bulldozed

  - Love the area we're living in

  Current extended family situation:

  - Me: Things are pretty good

  - Partner #1: I hate his family for Complicated Reasons, but we're hopefully going to patch things up over the next 6 months

  - Partner #2: His family doesn't accept us for being poly, his sister hates us, his parents side with her, it's very sad for all concerned.

  Current financial situation:

  - Me: earning a decent wage but taking a 30% pay cut to attend uni; essentially supporting the family

  - Partner #1: Lost job this year, will be studying full time to be a maths teacher in 2018 and in 2019 will be fully qualified teacher with basically a guaranteed job. Comingled finances.

  - Partner #2: Doing phD (his second but who's counting), not expected to earn money until 2020, doing part time data science job. Finances not combined, pays "board" to cover his room in the house and all groceries/bills. This is about half to a third of his weekly income.

  My current general desires/stream of consciousness:

  - I want to spend ~6 months in a francophone country and become fluent (C1/C2) in French, this is a childhood dream. Achievable: in the middle of next year I get 3 months of paid time off, I should be able to take that at 50% pay and make it six months. I am planning on taking this time in 2019 after P#1 has finished his teaching studies (both partners want to come with). 

  - I am aware how unachievable this is, but I want my supernatural romance thing I'm writing to become the next Harry Potter. However I don't think I care enough about this goal to put the time / money into it that would be required so I am mostly content: but I feel I should mention this?

  - I just want to be able to do whatever I want without worrying about money but due to the household's financial situation I'm very much forced to keep working my engineering job.

  - Although I'm studying "to be a dietician", I'm not sure I actually want to be a dietician in terms of what they actually *do*, even though that field is hugely varied (you can be clinical/hospital/corporate/public health/do online stuff/etc the possibilities are really endless). I just want to have the knowledge a dietician has.

  - I probably want to do the 2.5 kids white picket fence thing and my government job is definitely the place to spend my reproductive period due to the excellent benefits

  - I should probably do EA or earn to give or whatever?

  - I feel like I'd be happiest living an "independently wealthy" lifestyle where I just study a lot of different  things and then work in the field for a while and then get bored and go learn new things???? Or maybe I'd really enjoy being a housewife?? I like baking and wish I had time to keep the house clean????????

  - I actually really enjoy project management but feel underworked in my current job, this is unlikely to change as I really struggle to get my boss to give me more work to do for some reason ??????? 

  So yeah that's where I am at the moment. Going to take it one year at a time. Starting on the complicated chemistry units next year to work out if I even want to do organic chemistry for the next 6 years of my life. 2019 we'll do the France trip. Then in 2020 I'll  have some idea what my white picket fence will look like...

  - u/GaBeRockKing:

    The vast majority of the stuff you talked about I un/fortunately have no reference frame for, so I'll address the one thing I do have some ideas about.

    >I am aware how unachievable this is, but I want my supernatural romance thing I'm writing to become the next Harry Potter. However I don't think I care enough about this goal to put the time / money into it that would be required so I am mostly content: but I feel I should mention this?

    The idea I get, looking at the relatively-recent crop of massively successful, trendsetting books (e.g. harry potter, hunger games, twilight) is that they share a number of qualities:

    1. They have widespread age appeal. Your book should be, in effect, PG-13. You don't need to get 8-9 year olds in your net (they don't buy books anyways) but you should have something that precocious 11 year olds want to read, without being so aimed towards kids that middle aged people don't read it. This is a bit of a truism, to be fair, because if it was easy to make your book appeal to everyone, everyone would do that. But hyper-popular novels seem to follow a few guidelines: cursing should be censored, fantasy-fied (Odin's nutsack!), or used very sparingly; sex scenes shouldn't be in the first book, and should be fade-to-black or be extremely vague; violence should be thrilling, rather than graphic; no puzzle that readers are expected to solve should require education beyond a straight-C high schooler; and no moral conflict should have more than three sides (the viewpoint character's side, the antagonist's side, and optionally an "objectively right/wrong" side).

    2. They contain escapism tailored towards the era these books were released in. Different varieties of escapism work under different circumstances. The hunger games started getting released around the time of the financial crisis, so the rebellion of the lower classes against the exploitative bourgeois resonated. Twilight has similarities, in the sense that the vampires are rich as shit and don't have financial issues. I can't really speak about harry potter (I'm not qualified to do in-depth analysis of the late 90's) but you can look at a lot of fiction released in the wake of either the great recession, or earlier, 9/11 that provide a way for readers to escape from the realities of the world we find ourselves in.

    3. They have widespread genre appeal. To make a truly popular work, you need to appeal to the greatest amount of people possible. That means an action/adventure plot with a romance subplot (or a romance plot with an action/adventure subplot), plus a dash of slice of life for decompressing after action scenes. The amount of romance versus action should be tuned based on whether you're trying to apply to a predominantly male or female readerbase, with the understanding that men are stereotypically less tolerant of romance than women are of action.

    4. They're the trope codifiers, not the trope creators. There were magic academies before Harry Potter, postapocalyptic YA dystopian novels before Hunger Games, and vampire supernatural romances before Twilight. But what these novels did was take an existing genre, and codify it so well as to make it mainstream. More recent works in their respective genres are now compared to those works, not necessarily because those works are shining beacons of quality writing, but because those works did such a good job of assembling the right components together, and welding them together into a cohesive, commercializable whole.

    5. Extending from #4, while these works were at the forefront of new fad genres, these works weren't the first works in their genres to get attention. The genres they belonged to were already making headway and already attracting readers; and these works took advantage of that to get initial publicity, and helped the genres reach critical mass. Let's look at rational fiction, a much smaller phenomenon, for comparison. With stuff like Clarke's third law gaining prominence, we've already been seeing much more intelligent worldbuilding in recent works. Works like HPMoR and Worm didn't singlehandedly cause a revolution. Instead, they took advantage or an existing trendline, and then crystallized these trends into a recognizable formula-- the rational/ist fic-- and in turn, these books get more famous as people read other works in the genre because they're so central to it already.

    So in sum, to become a worldwide hit, a work should follow the following strategy:

    1. Find an up-and-coming genre that's still underground (for now.)
    2. Write a work that codifies the genre in its modern state
    3. Tweak it so it's maximally commercializable.
    4. Hope you roll a nat 20. If not, restart from step 1.

    Note that nowhere on this list is advice about writing *well*. Because the thing is, only writers really care that something is written well-- most everyone else just wants to be entertained. You need technical accuracy because easily apparent mistakes will cause you to lose credibility, but you don't need to write *Infinite Jest* to get popular.

    Now, the question is, can your paranormal romance fulfil these criterion? And even if it can, do you want it to? Targeting a niche market can be both less risky and more (emotionally, albeit not necessarily financially) rewarding.

    > Partner #2: Doing phD (his second but who's counting), 

    Wait, is that something people do in real life? Once you have your government-approved paper of Being an Important Person, why would you ever go through the mind-numbing bureaucracy of university studying for another... what, 5 years?

    > I am aware how unachievable this is, but I want my supernatural romance thing I'm writing to become the next Harry Potter

    I'm guessing you know this, but you usually have to write at least one or two other works before you get your The New Harry Potter.

    > I feel like I'd be happiest living an "independently wealthy" lifestyle where I just study a lot of different things and then work in the field for a while and then get bored and go learn new things

    Is that something that works well for a government career?

    When I think of "multi-class" life builds, I think of people working as independent or contractors, doing a lot of networking, etc. I have a friend who wants his future life to be like that. (I'm more after the "domain-specific Renaissance Man" ideal, personally)

    What are your marketable skills?

      > Once you have your government-approved paper of Being an Important Person, why would you ever go through the mind-numbing bureaucracy of university studying for another... what, 5 years?

      No idea. Mid-life crisis for that guy I guess. This post is probably my start at the same thing.

      > Is that something that works well for a government career?

      Not really. But I like the hours in the government and the lack of bullshit that private companies have; though not all companies are the same.

      > What are your marketable skills?

      So... a copy of my resume? Here's my list of skills in my resume:

      * Very experienced in project management, including scoping, budget management, design reviews, management of external contractors, and consultation with internal and external stakeholders
      * Financial management skills, including managing budgets, forecasting expenditure, and reporting
      * Aware of OSH policies and legal obligations, with experience on construction sites
      * Able to prioritise, organise, and complete work within set time and manage conflicting demands
      * Reliable in meeting deadlines and producing high-quality outputs
      * Highly organised to complete projects on time and within budget, meeting scope and quality requirements
      * Comfortable working in a team, including supporting others and seeking expert advice
      * Skilled at thinking laterally and recognising opportunities to deliver projects in innovative ways
      * Communication skills, including interpersonal skills, report writing, and preparation of contract documents
      * Keen interest in technology and desire to use it to streamline processes and procedures
      * Typing speed over 100 words per minute
      * Good working knowledge of Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux and macOS
      * Familiar with the Microsoft Office suite (including Project and Access) and \LaTeX
      * Familiar with programming, especially macros in Microsoft Excel
      * Experienced with automating and simplifying existing processes
      * Familiar with a variety of specialist software packages, including ArcGIS and AutoCAD
      * Conversant in English (native), French (advanced), Italian (intermediate), Thai and Esperanto (novice)

      Probably have others - I'm quite charismatic, really good at writing/communication, very quick at doing things, etc.

      I really do enjoy project management. I also wish I was experienced enough to be able to make money consulting, set my own hours/etc, since that would be ideal - could work less, charge more for my services, and attend classes on the side. I think that might be something I could do with a dietetics qualification more than my engineering qualification.

      I also think that there'd probably be some people who would think a dietician who is also a qualified traffic engineer is a big selling point, so I might be able to leverage that somehow? I'm sure there's a startup that would love me-in-5-years.

        I meant it as "What else could you do if you quit your job?", but sure.

        I definitely get the urge to just... get more skills, even if they don't directly translate into a new job or raise. Consulting does seem pretty in line with your other objectives, money aside.

        Have you seriously explored that possibility? Maybe you've left it aside on general principles, but if you looked deeper into it you'd find a better-paying consulting market for your skills or something? (I'm kind of grasping at straws here; your life seems optimized beyond my abilities to give useful advice)

  Two days before Christmas, two days and a week before 2018. I'm mostly taking a vacation and being burned out (only one day before I get back to Paris, yaaaaaay!), but I've been thinking about my New Year resolutions, and I want to write my thoughts down.

  I feel like I've been getting into a rut last school year. The excitement of being in a coding school, working on actually interesting projects has faded, the projects have started to feel less like challenges and more like *work*; same thing for my internships.

  Since September, I've been trying to get myself back into the mindset of having dreams and working to achieve them. I've started to work on my video game project and to exercise regularly, but next year I'd like to pick up the pace permanently.

  Wildbow's advice for personal projects is "do something and stick to it"; where you commit to following a schedule, and over time you gain enough momentum that it's harder to break your record than to keep going. I've never managed to get into that kind of momentum for more than a few weeks. I'm going to try again in 2018, hopefully taking into account the errors of the past and all that.

  Which means I need to figure out what I want to have achieved by the end of 2018. My tentative list is:

  - Learn about important computer science fields: system administration, networking, machine learning, package managers, sandboxed package managers, computer graphics, modern UI, and advanced programming language theory.

  - Get a distributed network of back-ups and VMs so I don't have to constantly re-install everything.

  - Release a playable, "I would pay money for this"-grade version of The Tesseract Engine.

  - Participate on at least one Open-Source project; I'm leaning between Atom, Dlang and Battle for Wesnoth.

  - Learn about and learn to use as many useful applications as I can; whether phone apps, web apps, Windows apps, or browser extensions. Learn about and set up self-hosted versions of apps I already use.

  - Work with a friend on one productive project per month. These projects would be anything from blog posts, RPG scenarios, drawings, mini-webcomics, animations, small games, small maps for a game editor, fanfics, etc. Every project would have a hard one-month deadline, after which we'd switch to something else.

  - Keep exercising on a regular basis. Practice parkour out of a gymnasium on a regular basis (I've only done it indoor so far).

  Also, learn at least three music instruments, two martial arts, six foreign languages and star in the lead role of a box-office Hollywood movie.

  Seriously though, I think I have a fair shot at keeping to at least half of these resolutions. I'm trying to find commitment mechanisms that are more opt-out than opt-in, and to set myself up with reliable friends who will keep me working when my motivation falters. A lot of it depends on what I manage to get done in the two next months of free time I have (January and February); whether or not I manage to get on the right track.

  By the way, The Tesseract Engine updates will resume next Saturday :)

  As some of you may know, I write worldbuilding supplements and related resources, which I publish through DriveThruRPG. 

  Earlier this year, I told the sub about Species Shock, a Kickstarter campaign for a book that would dig deep into a fictional alien species and its world, evolutionary history, culture, and other characteristics, and release the whole thing into the Creative Commons. 

  The campaign went well, and I'm pleased to announce that [Species Shock is available for free](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/227722/Agloanikoi-The-Gameplayers-Species-Shock). It's 74 pages long, so there's a lot of meat there, and while it's written from a hard scifi perspective I have heard of at least one person planning to adapt it for fantasy. 

  You may also be interested in [Strange Nations](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/200950/Strange-Nations-A-Worldbuilding-Resource), a collection of "drag-n-drop" cultures that can be easily inserted into most settings and a wealth of supplementary information on such topics as low-tech methods of long-distance communication and the many uses of cactus. Strange Nations is also free. 

  If you like these, then please check out my other offerings on [DriveThruRPG](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/10909/WMB-Saltworks) and consider [supporting me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/WMBsaltworks), where just the $1 tier will get you free copies of anything published in the last month and opportunity to guide my future projects. Anything that I make from Patreon will be reinvested my projects: logos, more and better illustrations, software and so on.

  Second mostly independent point, but you know how they always say, "grades aren't everything. Lots of people who do really well in school aren't successful". I really worry that's me sometimes. I know I can get all A's if I work hard enough in almost everything. The only class where I really didn't feel like that was true was German. I can get an A. I know the steps to doing it and and general despite my focus and motivation problems I even manage it the vast majority of the time. I'm not sure how to translate that into life in general sometimes.

  OK back to work now.

  So, imagine the USA were a dystopia where Mexican immigrants are summarily executed by the cops if they're caught, and it is the official policy to do that.

  Then one day, Trump decides "You know what, reading the Mexican immigrants' rights is a huge wast of time, let's not do that anymore". And it starts a HUUUUUUGE controversy, with thousands of people protesting online and making Youtube videos with titles like "Miranda rights are for EVERYONE" or "Mexican deserve to be read their rights too!".

  Being unfamiliar with the US' situation, I ask "Does it really matter if Trump wants their rights to be read? If they aren't read, it'll come up at the trial and the judge will be constitutionally required to let them go, right?". To which people tell me "No, you don't understand, Mexican immigrants are actually executed without a trial, so they don't have an occasion to invoke their constitutional rights". I say "Wait, what?" but it's too late and the other guy is already back to shouting "Miranda rights for everyone!"

  This is roughly [how I feel](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/12/18/links-12-17-silent-site-holy-site/#comment-580111) about the net neutrality scandal right now, and about [the "Internet in US" situation](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/10/us-internet-is-slow-expensiveand-the-fcc-has-proof/) in general.

  ---

  This is an area where I'd appreciate explanations from anyone familiar with the logistics involved: why does the US have so many regions under oligopoly as far as Internet access is concerned?

  I'm still looking into it, but as far as I can see the answer is "because the FCC never seriously enforced its local loop unbundling regulations". Local loop unbundling is when whichever company owns the cable that connects your house to its network has to lease it to any company that asks. Unbundling your local loop and not doing it is spectacular. It seriously reduces the cost of setting up a new network, which allows competition on a "unattainable libertarian fantasy" level.

  So of course the US doesn't have it. Or does it? I'm guessing that some states implemented it better than others. Again, I'd be very open to better info if anyone can provide it.

  (also, apparently setting up your network can be way harder in some states than others depending on their [utility pole legislation](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/verizon-supports-controversial-rule-that-could-help-google-fiber-expand/))

    Because on one side, we have libertarians (regulatory capture is the great evil! Monopolies don't exist!) and on the other side we have the socialists (Monopolies are the great evil! regulatory capture doesn't exist!) and never the twain shall meet. Or more explicitly, because gerrymandering + the primary system partially cancels out the chief advantage of first past the post voting (a trend towards centrism) and since pork barrel spending got outlawed, there's no incentive for true compromise.

  1) What has been your average experience with corporate events so far? How dull, unbearable (or, in contrast, interesting and rich with potential of making social connections that are valuable and interesting to you) do they generally end up being for you? 2) Have you noticed any difference in quality depending on the industry that the event-organiser corporation was operating in (e.g. governmental sector v.s. financial \ banking v.s. IT etc)? 3) How do you usually react when the management tries to force you into attending such an event, and seemingly can’t understand and take a "No" for an answer? 

  \- \- \- \- 

  Also, how can I make this oncoming experience at least somewhat bearable for me? I think there’s gonna be 100-150 people present, and usually I start panicking and freaking out even when I have to attend a gathering with only 20+ people that I don’t know too well.

  And finally, how to avoid answering questions that I don’t want to answer because I find them to be too personal -- without offending the people throwing those questions (who may or may not be looking for a reasons to get offended)?

    Boring is usually the term to use. Show up, eat, chat maybe a little, slip out when you've had enough. Especially with that many people, you ought to be able to bail just about anytime.

    My only contribution to industry differences is that the type of company to throw a big event is the kind of company who thinks that by so doing they don't have to pay as much, since after all, fun is a compensation of sorts, right? The best companies I've worked for don't have events (outside of maybe buying lunch from time to time) because they respect us enough to just pay us and not try to be all buddy buddy.

    People who don't know how to take a "no" very quickly lose the privilege of deserving truth from me, and start to get answers that will make them explicitly in the wrong to keep pressing afterward, like "I can't, I'll be out of town on a quick trip to visit family" or "I've got a family member in from out of town, who I rarely get to see" or similar.

  I'm completing my first week back working full time after a semester of classes. I remember this from sumer, but it's coming back strongly now. 40 hours a week just feels like too much for me. I get home and I feel like I have no time or really energy for that matter. Is this something that gets better? Are there strategies for managing this? I don't think it's that I don't like my work. I do, I enjoy being a programmer a lot and while the company I'm at now is by no means where I intend to stay, it's nice enough and I like my coworkers. It's just that as childish as it sounds I'd like to be able to like look at Reddit more and maybe work on some of my own projects or learn some new tech or science. 

  It doesn't help that I need more sleep than I think the average, but it's what it is. Are there any companies seriously offering lower work weeks? Say 30 hours with 6 hour days maybe. I'm really feeling like I'd take the pay hit right now.

    I don't understand your question. The ban is the moderators' fault, not yours.

      Because I was trying to have a discussion with rational people about very important beliefs that I’m questioning before I put them into practice, and it resulted in the mods declaring I can no longer discuss them on this sub.

      I can’t help but feel singled out by a community I identify with. That’s why I’ve been afraid to post anything here since the ban. I also still haven’t found a satisfactory answer to the question I asked and don’t have another community of critical thinkers to turn to.

        You're supposed to be angry toward **the moderators**. This conclusion seems too obvious to be stated, since anger toward the moderators\* is *the default state* for all people who frequent moderated forums, so you won't need to change anything about your opinions.

        \*Or the administrators, if the moderators are merely subservient enforcers of admin-created rules

    Huh, I'd wondered at that particular ban. So you're the culprit!

    Lol, but seriously, mind giving me a summary on what exactly went down? I find it somewhat impressive that a topic in a sub based on rationality was so divisive that the mods banned it. Like we could probably discuss the relative merits of bestiality and not get that topic banned, so I was very curious to hear about American politics getting the axe.

      [Nothing much.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7j2qas/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/dr3mk8b/) It was pretty civil, except that at one point u/trekie140 looked through the opponent's post history and noticed thons participation on r/The_Donald, which u\/trekie140 assumed makes thon inherently unsuitable for rational discourse. At that point u/eaturbrainz posted in mod-colour, with every appearance of agreeing with u\/trekie140 and declaring thons intent to look through u\/trekie140's opponent's contributions to that thread "to see where the propagandistic shitposting begins". u/CouteauBleu argued against u\/eaturbrainz's possible abuse of moderator privileges; u/PeridexisErrant agreed with u\/CouteauBleu, then suggested the ban, to u\/CouteauBleu and u\/eaturbrainz's agreement.

      Personally, I think that blanket ban is an overreaction, but I didn't read all previous discussions (immediately prior to and immediately after Trump's election, for example), so maybe it's justified in the light of past incidents.

    If you are feeling guilty and want to do something to make up for it, I recommend sending PMs to apologize or to say that you have no hard feelings against others and that you just wanted to clear the air so no one is uncomfortable on this subreddit. Maybe look back at the comments to see what mistakes you made and what you could do differently in the future?

    Hope this helped.

      I don’t feel guilty about any of the things I said, I feel guilty about starting a discussion that overtook the thread and upset enough people that the mods decided to not allow similar discussions. I don’t regret saying anything to anyone, I just don’t know if I should regret engaging them in the first place.

        That particular discussion did not upset that many people, I don't think. I assume it was merely a continuation of the trend: US politics discussions on r/rational very frequently turned unpleasant in the past, and it was simply the last straw.

        u/PeridexisErrant, am I correct?
        ```

        - u/PeridexisErrant:

          Yes, absolutely - that discussion was not unusual in any way, I just happened to have seen too many dissolve into non-communication lately.

          u/trekie140, please don't feel guilty - (a) it wasn't your fault; (b) you were quite reasonable in both content and tone, and (c) this particular discussion was not particularly upsetting. The rules change is a recognition of persistent collective failure, *not* a reaction to that specific thread!

        You are not to blame for what anyone does or say. The question you asked about ideological purity/rights and whether or not it should apply to people who oppose it was a fair and valid topic to discuss.

        I would say that you shouldn't feel regret or guilt for bringing it up. The fallout is on everyone who said unpleasant things. Also the discussion didn't seem too terrible, but rather it was just the last straw in a long line of political discussions leading to an unhappy conclusion.
        ```
