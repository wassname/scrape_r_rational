  Just throwing this out there, for anyone who isn't familiar with Oregairu:

  Hikki isn't a loner. He's lonely, and in denial about it.

  I'm tossing this out for anyone else who would get frustrated with his "Herp derp I'm a loner yup so lonery WHY DOESN'T ANYONE LOVE ME!?" attitude. It irritated me until the above clicked.

  Come to think of it, Hikki is a perfect one to make !smart crossovers. Internal monologue is built in his charcter, he is pretty smart, cynical and is completely ok with morally dubious plans. You can throw him anywhere, probably barring most dark settings.

  I have started to read it and there is one thing doesn't make sense to me.

  Why on Earth would Hikki **want** to return home? This new universe is better than his home universe in nearly every regard.

    ```
    He misses his family and friends from home, basically. That's why he enjoys verbal sparring with Lyon, since she reminds him of Yukinoshita.
    ```

  I haven't watched Danmachi so I'm not sure how good the munchkinry is, but there's a lot of it. The writing quality is pretty good too. A lot of internal monologue, but that's meant to mimic the style of the Oregairu light novels. The character interactions are good. The only annoyance I have is the way thoughts are presented in between lines of dialogue, which can be a little hard to follow.

    Readable for those unfamiliar with either original work?
