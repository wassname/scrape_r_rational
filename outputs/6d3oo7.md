  ```
  "Herbivores may be eaten by carnivores, but predators NEED their prey.  Y'know what 'omnivorous' means?  ALL-CONSUMING, [censored]."

  ...This makes me want (if I had more time) to try to write a story about 'All-Eaters' and the horror of coexisting/warring carnivore and herbivore spacefaring civilisations as they failed to fit within the civilisations' expectations/framework.
