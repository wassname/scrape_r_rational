  While in all honesty the greater political sentiments are out of my wheelhouse, i do still love Amadeus' line "It is not enough to be correct in *principle*, Catherine. If you cannot offer a practical way to deliver on your beliefs, then they are wind." I also love how upfront he is about the fact that she's dictating as if she was the conqueror as if it wasn't on the table that she still could be.

  More and more, I feel as though this is setting us up for a different-protagonist sequel.  (A youth who starts out attending Cardinal instead of the War College.)

  I think it's a mistake to place Cardinal anywhere on Calernia. Not only does this leave it open to siege and conquest from conventional armies, it also gives the very groups you don't want to give more bargaining power - Praes and the Free Cities - a ready-made grievance to bargain with. Giving Procer and Callow easy access to what will become the capital of the continent while everyone else must trek through would also make it easier for future rulers of either nation to gain the kind of undue influence which would lead to civil wars.

  The Twilight Ways are therefore the obvious choice. Not only are they territory unclaimed by any nation human or fae, they're also far closer to every point on the continent than anywhere else you could choose. The concept of distance exists in Arcadia, but it's been noted before that travel through the realm is faster than any other means. A portal opened in the Free Cities will be closer to the ruins of Liesse (the obvious place to put Cardinal just for sheer narrative weight) than anywhere else you could place the city, and the same could be said of a portal in Ater or Keter, assuming the displaced Empire Ever Dark manages to settle the Crown of the Dead.

  This would also serve to cement the city as *the* place to be for mages. After all, you need to have access to mages to even get there! They'd be a vital part of the city's infrastructure just due to location. Keeping the city connected to the world would give ambitious mages something to do, distracting them from flying fortresses and giving them ready-made cushy prestige positions as gatekeepers. Only being accessible through portals  also gives the city an additional defensive perimeter and the ability to cut off trade and mages from rebellious states. It might even defend the new center of Calernian governance from the gnomes, should they appear again, as they were noted for their technology, rather than their Arcadia portals.

    Your own point in favor of the Twilight Ways as the place for Cardinal invalidates one of your points against. Specifically, because the Twilight Ways exist, it doesn't matter where on Calernia you put Cardinal, anyone can get there or get out through the Ways. Procer and Callow can't control access to the city when anyone can essentially just teleport in. 

    While I agree with you that locating the city in the Ways would add a measure of physical defensibility, it would also require some form of metaphysical defense to prevent someone from just unclipping the shard from Creation and casting it adrift with plenty of Named and most of Calernia's preeminent scholars stuck inside. And there's nothing to say they can't still use the Twilight Ways as a stronghold of sorts to retreat to in the event of attack while still making use of the benefits of keeping the main city in reality for day-to-day operations.

    I think this Washington DC solution where the land is granted from two member nations but becomes no longer a part of either is probably for the best given the situation that had Pilgrim put on the crown. If Cat had shaped the realm instead, it might have ended up perfectly designed for what you're suggesting.

      >Specifically, because the Twilight Ways exist, it doesn't matter where on Calernia you put Cardinal, anyone can get there or get out through the Ways. Procer and Callow can't control access to the city when anyone can essentially just teleport in. 

      Two points:

      Cat could just consecrate more connections in callow than in anywhere else.  There is still the  physical distance required to travel *to and from the Calernia side of the portal*. 

      Arcadia also does *kinda* reflect the real world.  There could be many reasons why real world distance might also impact average travel time. 

      Of course, if real-world distance doesn't matter when it comes to the Twilight ways, then the whole discussion is moot.  They could locate the city where Cat suggests while having it be connected everywhere that matters through the ways.

    That's all well and good until, for example, the next incarnation of the Helike Tyrant uses **Rend** to tear apart Cardinal from Creation

      ```
      The fact that nobody has successfully shut off the capacity for Arcadia portals indicates to me this isn't possible. They've made Arcadia impassable by turning it into a hellscape and shut off scrying by slicing off a bit of Arcadia, but they haven't ever shut Arcadia out entirely.

    While true, I feel that the old rule of “don’t rely on a magic sword or you will be stabbed to death with it” applies here. If everything relies on the big magic city drenched in blood and power, it opens some stories that won’t end well.
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  I like that Black points out how utterly impossible the "No Named rulers" would be to enforce. It always felt like the weakest part of what we knew about the Accords.

  What happened to the usual person posting chapter updates? This is twice now I've been surprised by a change of post title format.

    I’m in Germany with only a mobile phone on hand. Maybe this was the correct time to pull out, considering that I’m apparently the only person who can’t take the school idea seriously.

  You probably should have the series in the title.

  I never really bought or cared much about the "Magical neutral 
   super-academy in the middle of all nations" much. Fun to read, but more in the "Don't think about it too hard" way. 

  Even when the background is explained in more detail, those stories still read like a convoluted explanation for the author getting to play the school setting.  

  PGtE really changed that up for me. Living vicariously in the current, seeing how desperate everyone is to get the wars to stop, it really makes the school settings seem not only possible, but the best possible plan they could come up with. I think I'll enjoy school settings in any work a lot more now :)

  I don't really trust Black here, at all.  Like, he's always been the exception to Cat's weird 'everyone I fuck over becomes my minion' ray.  He doesn't want to reform the grand game, he wants Below to win a round of it.  He isn't about to betray the Empress.  I think he's just telling Cat what she wants to hear, getting himself out of her camp alive.

    This would be changing the rules of the game and as we already saw in the fae arc that in itself is a win for evil. 

    The status quo is evil losing in the end. This is evil not losing, that is a win for evil even if good doesnt lose aswell. Edit: and showing that non zero sum games are posible, were 1 side losing is not required for 1 side to win, is the moral of the everdark arc

    - u/LilietB:
      ```
      Non zero sum game is something Black and Malicia have made their basic philosophy: "if we are a net drain we are removed". He was willing to fight with her - one of his oldest and closest friends - and break their Empire in half over it.

      The Accords might as well be his project in the first place.

    He very much wants to reform Praes so that it is not...well Praes.
