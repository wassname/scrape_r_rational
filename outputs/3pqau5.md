  Wow, I can't believe I never thought of them just asking the prisoners what the Yeerk's plans are, it makes so much sense now

  And things just keep accelerating in pace. Jesus. Within a matter of weeks, this war is probably going to be over one way or the other. Competent Yeerks are scary as *fuck.*

  One thing I'd recommend is finding a way to make the Interlude work as it's own chapter. Perhaps using arcs like Worm, or make the interlude Chapter 9. The interlude packed a lot of meaning into a small space, and people are very likely to just skip over it when archive reading if it's not it's own chapter. And it needs to be read at least twice to understand it.

  You've read Worm; imagine how the short chapter would have gone if it had been part of a larger chapter. Nowhere near as impactful if you weren't reading the story when the original short chapter was posted.

  I wonder how far Erek's programming goes. Presumably, the Animorphs wouldn't be able to share any attack plans with Erek if it involved the plan of violence. But is infestation violence? Would the Chee be able to use a small amount of violence to prevent a large amount of violence? (Forcibly disarming someone to stop them killing?)

  And Rachel clearly knows some disturbing stuff now. The hospital being a major infestation push is the third worst. The school might be the second worst, but I'm sure the worst is yet to come...

  This is going to be interesting. And...now I have to wait two weeks for the next chapter! Argh!

    Not if they have their canon origin story, where their creators were destroyed by agents of Krayak while the Chee stood by, unable to help.

  Cheeee!

    HOWLERS.

      ```
      Optimized Wizards/AI > Optimized Fighters, though. Even being hobbled to being unable to cast any damage-dealing spell doesn't outweigh vast technological superiority. Someone needs to explain to Erek that institutional poverty directly harms a vast majority of humanity and then maybe we end up with instantaneous post-scarcity society? (Probably not, but it's worth a shot.)

      Also, their original weakness of shared memory (and thus ability to insert new records into the insecure system) doesn't seem like a "stupid" or easily avoidable weakness and thus would be likely to continue to exist.

      On top of all of that, the Howlers never actually came to Earth, so short of direct interference, we might get to just ignore them for the time being. (Yeerks + Howlers, on the other hand... that would likely be bad, so hopefully that doesn't happen.)

  Great work so far!

  I'm still clinging to my initial problem with a rational!Animorphs story - I don't see how competent Yeerks can possibly lose. The story should be over in 2 weeks with a total Yeerk domination of Earth, if they just do the minimum obvious thing - go to Washington D. C., take control of all of it, do likewise for other important capitals, within 2 weeks they should effectively rule the world's governments.

  I'm not sure if it was explained in the story yet why they chose this city vs. the above plan.

    Not explained in the story yet.  There is an explanation (coming soon), and it may not satisfy some readers, but it's probably the best possible place to ask readers to spend their suspension-of-disbelief points, in terms of return on investment.

    My first thought is that it has something to do with Esplin's plans.

  How enjoyable is this to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Animorphs?
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Pretty enjoyable, I would predict. There have been setting changes, so I don't think you need prior knowledge. 

    If you read it, please let me know what it's like so that I have a better idea of how it comes off to someone who hasn't read Animorphs before.

    A few years ago I found a collection of all the books in ebook form and read through them all. They hold up surprisingly well even when read as an adult, and have some pretty mature and interesting storylines (David, Visser One, the Auxiliary Animorphs...). Reckoning does a good job of compressing a lot of the action, but I would still recommend the original books.
    ```

    ```
    very enjoyable. I read maybe 3 Animorphs books out of 50? books and I'm loving this fic.
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Didn't the setting and the characters get introduced in like the first book? Anyway, I'll probably start it tomorrow.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        If you do, please let me know what you make of the first chapter (it's the part where you're most likely to be frustrated/confused as a new reader, but if you find it palatable, you'll be able to take the rest of the story without any worries).
        ```
