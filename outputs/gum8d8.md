## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Any good, rational time travel stories? Ones that really explore deep into the ramifications of its mechanics. 

  An example in HPMOR is when Harry tried to use time travel to pull answers out of nothing through logically using a closed time loop. The result was finding that time itself worked like the funny-illogical format of HP magic.
  ```

  - u/causalchain:
    ```
    [qntm's ed stories](https://qntm.org/ed) has a bit of interesting time travel. He also made a post discussing some of the multiverses that can be created with time travel.
    ```

  - u/Determinor:
    ```
    Have you played the flash game called "No one has to die"? It's a very interesting take on time travel where your consciousness is transferred with a machine to a set time in the past and when you transfer into the past, you end up in a parallel universe but can't really know which parallel universe you jumped into.
    It involves brute forcing with a brilliant experiment to find out if the machine actually worked, time travel hell and discussion about said time travel mechanics. The gameplay isn't much and isn't that great, but it serves the purpose of narrating the story and the story is all that matters.

  Hello everyone, I've been lurking a bit on this sub and finally felt like I had a question worth asking. I would like y'all  recommendation for stories where the main character is an AI or other such created intelligence. I has read two or three of those set in the Mass Effect universe, and they were glorious.

  Finally, what are your favorite rational fics from a first person POV?
  ```

  - u/adad64:
    ```
    Have you read The Crystal Society trilogy? That's probably my top rec.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      +1 - Crystal Society is IMO the book that does the best job of representing a nonhuman artificial intelligence.

        It does. But it doesn't become overly boring, stupid, disagreeable or badly written. It's just, not as good, deep or interesting anymore. I'd still recommend reading the whole trilogy.

        Or in other words: Quality drops off, but not in a Game of Thrones kind of way. Not even in a Lost kind if way.
        ```

  - u/Azaraphale:
    ```
    I have two recommendations, as long as you don't mind that they are not strictly sci-fi. 

    [Mud's Mission](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31919/muds-mission)
    This is a fun story from the point of view of a mud Golem. The mechanics of it are treated almost identical to what you might expect from a robot, even going so far as to have "The three rules of Golemancy."

    [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion)
    This one is from the POV of a biological weapon with a loose human personality framework stapled to it.. Less of an AI in the traditional sense, but it is still a constructed intelligence with underlying directives driving its motivations. Worth noting that this one has a tendency to vacillate between super campy and body horror.
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      I thought that Mud's Mission started out really strong but in the last 20 or so chapters the 'artificial intelligence' protag could have been replaced with any numbers of antihero litrpg protags both in terms of personality and actions taken. I don't know if it says more about Mud's Mission or about the antihero litrpg trope.
      ```

    - u/hwc:
      ```
      +1 to _Super Minion_.
      ```

  - u/Amagineer:
    ```
    [Post Human](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22848/post-human) is pretty good. The viewpoint character is a digitized human, capable of self-modification.
    ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    No-one's mentioned [Murderbot](https://www.goodreads.com/series/191900-the-murderbot-diaries) yet, those are jolly good fun.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Murderbot is kind of weird because murderbot thinks of itself as an AI, but that's mostly a coping mechanism to handle all the traumatic stuff it's had to go through. It's basically human on a fundamental basis.
      ```

      - u/sl236:
        ```
        ...there's also the asshole research transport if murderbot itself is too human for you, of course :)
        ```

        - u/IICVX:
          ```
          ART is also fundamentally pretty human, just omni-competent. It's kind of like a Sherlock Holmes type of character.
          ```

  - u/SeekingImmortality:
    ```
    I enjoyed the combined efforts of human and ai in https://farmerbob1.wordpress.com/
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      What's it about?
      ```

      - u/SeekingImmortality:
        ```
        Set in seemingly mundane modern day, Man learns that through unknown means he'd been implanted with an instance of an AI that lives within nanomachines mainly housed within his bones.  The AI had been with him for years, learning to observe his brain state and perceive through his senses but unable to communicate with him, but has just become able to do so through freak chance.  And because this protocol of non-communication has been broken, this instance of the AI and the man must work together to survive or else they will both be destroyed.

        Generally rational approach to intelligence gathering regarding the various threats and mysteries, in terms of what the heck is going on and how do you protect yourself from threat when facing the reality of such a gross invasion.

        I will note that the first few chapters include some pretty extreme body horror (self-mutilation), but that this aspect tapers off significantly after that.
        ```

        - u/Watchful1:
          ```
          I lost interest in this one pretty quick once it was revealed >!multiple secret societies. Secret societies are basically like the antithesis to rationality. You have to hand wave away so much to explain how large organizations remain secret like that.!<

    ...actually, what do we think? - does [Threadbare](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15130/threadbare) count? - or is the MC just a human in a funny character shape? What about [Dogs of War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35827220-dogs-of-war)? What properties of storytelling make the created intelligence too human?

  If any of you are on SV or like quests at all, Rihaku is running a [new one](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-simple-transaction-i.66727/) as of last month. I would call their writing style more “epic tone” than “rational”, but the whole thread argues about build votes and choice optimization quite a lot, actions tend to have strong actual consequences, and the payoffs tend to be satisfying, so if you like that sort of environment you should drop by the thread.

  Recommending [Path of the Whisper Woman](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26494/path-of-the-whisper-woman). It follows a girl who wants to become one of the right-hand women to their spooky goddess.

  I'm recommending it here for two (and a half) reasons: The worldbuilding is done well, in that it's not just infodumping information on you, but is instead revealed organically; while the story is nominally about the viewpoint character's quest to become a "whisper woman", it's also largely about dealing with the psychological trauma of dealing with manipulative/abusive/narcissistic parenting, and so spends a lot of time examining thoughts and thinking processes and whatnot; reason one half is that I just think it's really good and ought to get more eyeballs.
  ```

  - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
    ```
    Shit, this atmosphere is so incredibly bleak.

    Edit: Unless I'm missing something, this is a humanity that will never rise in any way beyond their current existence. That's the worst part. I thought UNSONG's setting was incredibly depressing for the same reason, when it was revealed that the night sky was only an illusion, that our dreams for space travel are already dead, that there is no other place we can go. And this story is even bleaker.
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Hmm I started reading that one but I wasn't quite in the mood for the style; I'll give it another shot.
    ```

- u/WEEBSRUINEDFANFICS:
  ```
  I am looking for self insert litrpg/gamer fanfics that is not pure wish fulfillment. It needs to have a sense of survival showing that the SI wants to grind in order to survive the antagonists of the world. Fix-it is unrealistic they should make it a point to avoid confrontation and grind safely as possible. Gamer in south blue, a one piece self insert litrpg fanfic, makes a point in avoiding the main cast like the plague. I love it how the author always mentions that there is someone always stronger than him which makes a goal for the SI to surpass.
  ```

  - u/WEEBSRUINEDFANFICS:
    ```
    And yes I read worth the candle lol
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Ar'Kendrithyst is pretty good about not being wish fulfillment, although a lot of it is slice of life. The main character gets powerful pretty quickly, but even now where he is regarded among the most powerful mages, it's pretty clear that he's missing a lot of the knowledge and power that other people at his station have. Highly recommend for its vibrant world and good characters. 

    The Paragamer has the mc get gamer powers in Worm. Good characterization and the author does a good job at making the character have the potential to be powerful, but still at street-level (so far). It's on hiatus right now, although what is there is pretty good.
    ```

  - u/Chaotic_Evil_10:
    ```
    Most stories by Sir Lucifer Morningstar on Fan-fiction are probably the type of thing that you are going for.  He specifically tries to avoid things such as the idiot ball and plot armor.  Generally his stories are pretty good. Go check him out.
    ```

    - u/Darkpiplumon:
      ```
      About the author, if you haven't read any of his stories you should probably know that they are better or worse written edgefest with dark and inmoral protagonists. Don't get me wrong, I actually do like some of them, but that's a warning that applies to everything he writes. That and sometimes rapey lemons.
      ```

    - u/WEEBSRUINEDFANFICS:
      ```
      I’m a fan of his work. The only problem is most of his fanfics has a lot of lemons. But the well written plot makes me stay and read the rest.
      ```

  - u/SecondTriggerEvent:

    Delve's pretty good at conveying survival. The MC advances quickly, but he's still a small fish in a big pond.

      Well, maybe quickly in word count terms. The one chapter a week pace is kinda killing my interest.
      ```

      - u/SecondTriggerEvent:

        Ah, I meant more, gains experience quickly. The meticulousness of the narrative isn't aided by a one-per-week schedule, I agree, though there's a decent archive binge already.

  YMMV but recommending [Camelot the musical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot_(musical)) for anyone interested in a different media form than the usual - it looks like there's some [Youtube recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG0Z_JX_zk) of a 1982 version. Not super-rational but has strong themes of fragility of civilization / rule of law which resonated with me a lot.

  Stoic fiction? Sometimes reading stoic advice is too much work, but Stoic characters make the most of the hard-to-optimize real world in an admirable way. It appeals in a similar way to ratfic, and I learn from it. I would read the hell out of Harry Potter and the doctrines of Stoicism.

  So any Stoi!fic recs?
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Senlin Ascends maybe? I remember the main character being beset by a lot of setbacks, but he keeps getting back up and moving on. 

    Curse of Chalion also has a well meaning main character picking his life back together after a war injury.

    ```
    Vernor Vinge's *A Deepness in the Sky* might suit.
    ```

    - u/ramjet_oddity:

      ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      I never took his works as really hard science fiction. There's lots of unexplained or unrealistic technology, maybe because it's a slightly older book.

      It's still a really good story, but the space travel, combat, technology, etc aren't well explained.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Vinge's Zones of Thought setting is almost explicitly techno-magic. If you're in the right zone you can probably McGuyver a self-bootstrapping AI out of a lemon and a bit of wire.

        Nice.  The rest of the Orthogonal series is worth reading, and it gets more space opera/technologically advanced as the series progresses.

    Most of Alistair Reynolds’ work would fit this. Try *Pushing Ice* or *House of Suns*. Also seconding the Greg Egan rec.

      I have read *Revelation Space* and *Revenger*. How hard-science are *Pushing Ice* and *House of Suns*?
      ```

      - u/dysfunctionz:
        ```
        Similar to *Revelation Space* I’d say. *House of Suns* is distant future but has no FTL or much in the way of technobabble. *Pushing Ice* is a bit harder as it’s mostly near future, again no FTL, reasonable engineering extrapolations from current technology, and he did the math on most of the orbital mechanics.

  What do you guys think of Pedestal and Pokemon: The Origin of Species? These are both pokemon fanfics I've been looking into reading.

      Not OP, but I've played Pokémon Blue. Haven't seen the anime and haven't touched the other games (yet). Will this be enough, at least for some basic form of enjoyment?
      ```

      - u/Smartjedi:
        ```
        I'm about 40 out of 81 chapters in, and I'd say that's sufficient background knowledge for you to read and enjoy it. The general framework for Origin of Species is based off of the Kanto region which is the first gen of games along with Pokemon up to the fourth gen (Sinnoh region - Diamond and Pearl). Not all Pokemon are physically described as they appear so you might need to google what they look like as you read if you want a picture in your head. 

        Most of the major side characters like gym leaders are from the first gen so remembering who they are adds enjoyment. There are a few insider Pokemon culture jokes that might go over your head but I wouldn't let that stop you at all from reading. I highly recommend reading it, been having a blast with the story!

    ```
    > Remains of the day

    [That book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day)? 

    I'm not sure if it's "artsy" in the same manner, as I haven't read the novel, but [Birds of a Feather](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936) has significantly more advanced prose than most rational fics. It's a Harry Potter fanfic, where Hermione is born in the 1920ies and somehow strikes up a not-friendship with young Tom Riddle, who becomes not quite as monstrous in his youth. They both attend Hogwarts eventually.
    ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    I mean, if you liked Remains of the Day you're probably somewhat different than me, but on the other hand, you're asking for recs here...

    *You* by Austin Grossman is quite good. Um, I'd describe it by comparing it to Tad Williams' *Otherland* crossed with the classic play-within-a-play gag and set as a nostalgic retrospective, but that's a bit of a niche reference.

    Or if you want something more classic, Herman Hesse's *The Glass Bead Game* is really good. The first section at least.

    Iain Banks' *Feersum Endjinn* was fun.

    *China Mountain Zhang* by Maureen McHugh actually isn't super literary from a prose perspective, but it's good, and it's about people.

    Oh, and how could I forget Gene Wolfe's *Book Of The New Sun*. Literary out the wazoo.

  Random question: what's up with the capitalization of words in some rational fics, and rationalist writings more generally?  (Or: am I completely making up this phenomenon?)

  I can try to dig up examples if desired, but I have a strong sense that frequently Eliezer Yudkowsky writes sentences along the lines of, "Curing death would be Good", or, "It would be Madness to do artificial intelligence research without pondering the control problem".

  Does this come from Terry Pratchett perhaps or something? Am I totally making this up?
  ```

  - u/lillarty:
    ```
    Sometimes it is used to differentiate between descriptors and perceived universal laws. Think in terms of D&D; chaotic and Chaotic are very things, same with good and Good. Good is a fundamental property of the D&D universe that even the gods must adhere to, while good is just the opposite of bad. Capitalizing it refers to the platonic ideal of the concept rather than a specific instance of it. This is likely what most of what you're seeing from these sorts of writers. 

    More generally, it is making the word into a proper noun. The white house in your neighborhood is different from The White House, where the capitalized one refers to a specific, often famous version of the more generalized noun. 

    Also, as u/Flashbunny said, it might just be someone mistakenly capitalizing something. All nouns in German are capitalized, so Germans who learn English often have a hard time determining whether or not they're supposed to capitalize a word since it depends a lot on the context. I'm sure many other languages have similar differences in capitalization but I'm not as familiar with them.

      Ah yes this is a great way of putting it, thanks. The D&D origins seem plausible to me!
      ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    I've seen odd capitalisation from authors for whom English is not their first language - the specific example that comes to mind was a German author I think. Other than that, it might just be a weird way of emphasising something?
