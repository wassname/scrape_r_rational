## Is Graven good rational fiction?

### Post:

I recently read and quite enjoyed the kinda short web novel [Graven](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24066/graven), a kind of mid-apocalyptic story that mixes superheroes with some nice cosmic horror aspects. One thing I liked about it was the really inventive use of superpowers that are very complex. The story doesn't have that big a cast, unlike some superhero serials, so there's a whole lot more time spent on each individual character, and some of the characters have powers that feel to me a lot like what rational fiction is famous for--specific rules that are taken to their extremes and used in creative ways to solve "puzzles" (win fights). The first POV character Max-Out in particular made me think of this.

However, I'm not incredibly versed in rational fiction, so I'm not sure whether Graven actually qualifies as much as I think. Has anyone else read it to know?
