## [Weekly Challenge] "The Chosen One"

### Post:

## Last Week

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3clxme/weekly_challenge_ever_after/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Ever After". /u/eaglejarl is the winner with [his story](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3clxme/weekly_challenge_ever_after/csx3z7h), and will receive a month of reddit gold, super special winner flair, and $50. Congratulations /u/eaglejarl! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

##### This Week

This week's challenge prompt is "The Chosen One". [See the entry at TV Tropes.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne) This is what happens when destiny says so, or when the last of his kind needs to do what only he can do. Sometimes, the Chosen One is picked by his community, while other times it's the universe itself. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, July 22nd.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

##### Next Week

The prompt for next week is "Rational Horror". We've had a few discussions in this subreddit recently about what that might entail, especially [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3bxvav/rational_horror/). Is it delightfully existential horror? Lovecraftian unknowability? People responding reasonably to a serial killer stalking them instead of running down into the basement? Genre-awareness? This is your chance to show your vision of that definition.

**Next week's thread will go up on 7/22.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

    This was chilling. And it makes a really good explanation for a lot of things about Superman -- things like: "why does he do this?" and "If he does it because he's Good, why does he take breaks?" And so on. 

    Thank you for writing it.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:

      Thanks man. Appreciate the feedback! And it almost feels like canon, because Golden Age Superman was killing people all the time. Not to mention the collateral damage from any big fights probably took out a few innocents each time as well. But we never see the Man of Steel bothered by that at all, despite him being a paragon of good and justice.

    I quite enjoyed this one.

      As did I, it also prompted a reread of "The Metropolitan Man". Enjoyable as ever.
      ```

      Thought i responded to this comment when it was made. Guess I didn't.

      Anyway, it makes me pretty happy that the guy who rationalized Superman liked my Superman story :)

    I feel like the "lives saved" number should be 1-2 magnitudes higher.  Also, lovely story.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      I calculated that amount with some vague numbers. [](#s "At this point, Supes has been at his new game for a few months. I chose around 6. I chose to imagine he saves about 35 people per day, as he is restricting his efforts (for now) to the city of Metropolis. And also just doing it for fun, so he's not optimizing. 35 x 180 = 6300. And then I just tweaked it, so it sounded organic.")
      ```

  - u/notmy2ndopinion:
    ```
    Great mash-up of Metropolitan Man, Dr Manhattan, and Scion!

    [Worm spoiler](#s "I can totally see Lex Luthor playing the role of Jack Slash in instigating the Superpower's slide into darkness, with Batman playing the role of Skitter, playing the role of ruthless hero sacrificing whatever it takes to save what he can. To be perfectly honest, if Batman vs Superman doesn't include tones of this story, I will be sorely disappointed!")

    This is a spectacular interpretation of the distancing from humanity that a Superpower would realistically have.

    I really liked this. This seems horrifying enough you could have submitted this for Rational Horror, also.

    I did not see that coming. Nicely done.

    I had to read it twice to get it. When I did, I laughed.

    The Staff of Rewop - sounds like something guarded by the Knights of Ni.

      Hey thanks!

      About the names, [](#s "Rewop is just power spelled backwards and Maresian Cign is an anagram of Nigerian Scam").

      I realize the whole point of it was the ending, but it left a seriously awful taste in my mouth anyway. Of course she can break herself out of one self-alteration of questionable morality, but if she self alters into a paperclipper clearly she is automatically doomed forever and will never be able to see the error of her ways. If she was going to get herself stuck with her changes, the first thing should've stuck her; this result just feels inconsistent and forced.

      Basically, it's the same thing that irritates me about Alex Beyman (http://www.inkitt.com/AlexBeyman) stories.
      ```

      - u/Coadie:
        ```
        Sorry about the taste!

        My idea was that some decisions will lead to other decisions that may end up being irreversible. Just like with life, it's not always a single, defining decision, but rather a series of decisions that then leads up to the one decision that you cannot turn back from once made.

    The ending was absolutely hilarious. Loved it.
