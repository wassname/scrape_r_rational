  I'm still amazed to see Cat refer to Black as her father so nonchalantly.
  ```

  - u/Daddy_Kernal_Sanders:
    ```
    Once she gave in she just accepted it fully. It’s super cute in a fucked up way.
    ```

    - u/Razorhead:
      ```
      What's fucked up about it? Black has been more of a father figure in her life than her biological father ever was, so what's wrong with referring to him as such?
      ```

      - u/Ardvarkeating101:
        ```
        I remember when my dad first let me execute my would-be murderers.  It’s a special time in every child’s life.
        ```

        - u/Razorhead:
          ```
          Despite how fucked up Black and Cat and their actions may be, the nature of their relationship is kinda not.
          ```

      - u/Daddy_Kernal_Sanders:
        ```
        \>_>

        I love black, but uhhh my dad sure as fuck never once put his love for me aside to further one of his plans. And neither has he ever stabbed me in the chest, nor I his stomach.
        ```

        - u/Razorhead:
          ```
          And yet the relationship still holds strong. And isn't that what family is all about?
          ```

          - u/Daddy_Kernal_Sanders:
            ```
            Doesn’t make it less fucked up. Normal people don’t find the true meaning of family by one teaching the other how to most effectively change the world through violence, murder, and cunning.
            ```

            - u/Razorhead:
              ```
              Oh I never said that Black and Cat are normal people. They most definitely are not. But I don't think that the relationship between them is that fucked up necessarily.
              ```

              - u/Daddy_Kernal_Sanders:
                ```
                I still can’t see in what world a father being able and *willing* to put his love in a box and go and risk death for his child *isnt fucked up*.

                Yea they have normal good moments, but the relationship is messed up because of it. Not to the pint either of them wants to sever it, but we’ve seen cat talk about her resenting it.
                ```

    ```
    "Take an apple from a farmer of the Kingdom, and in 50 years his grandson will find yours on the other side of the continent, sock him in the eye and take 3 apples back."
    ```

    - u/FormerlySarsaparilla:
      ```
      We need some fan art of Cat being held aloft by the Woe while reading from the Book of Grudges, Thorgrim-style.
      ```

      - u/Allian42:
        ```
        How I think it would go:

        Masego makes a spell to lift his corner for him so he can read in peace. Indrani immediately let it go in favor of scratching her bum. Hakram holds half the weight by himself. There is a pillar of pure gold on wheels in place of Vivienne, which is nowhere to be seen.

        Akua is, of course, ahead of everyone throwing flowers to make a path. The fact that those are funerary flowers is completely accidental, she assures Cat.
        ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Eh. Outside that one time when the rioters got the legionaries on leave (until the Procerans fucked it up), average Callowan's spite seems directed mainly at the people who *aren't* occupying their country.
    ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  The dispute between Razin and Elvera happened more quickly than I expected, and ended more peacefully too. Though I doubt we've seen the last of it.

  I wonder how EE handles those off-screen conflicts, if he considers what each character would do and basically writes a draft without publishing it, or if he just throws dice or something.
  ```

  - u/Turniper:
    ```
    I very strongly doubt EE is the dice rolling type.
    ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  I don't really understand what happened there at the end. Can someone elaborate?
  ```

  - u/Ibbot:
    ```
    Ever since Indrani almost died in the Everdark due to Wonter going crazy, she’s been put in situations where her formidable fighting prowess can’t save her if things go south.  This is psychologically very difficult for her to deal with.  Cat wants to make her deal with it because it’s best for her in the long run.  This makes Imdrani angry, in addition to how being put in situations like that makes her feel.
    ```

    - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
      ```
      There's also the fact that she's scared of Masego dying, and Cat repeatedly running off into danger without backup is magnifying this fear and anger.
      ```

      - u/vimefer:
        ```
        I suspect Cat just explained to Indrani what kind of recklessly perilous plan she has to get the Grey Pilgrim onboard with the Accords. Thankfully she only punched Cat.
        ```
