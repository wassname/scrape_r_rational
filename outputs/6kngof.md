## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I don't know if this one has been done yet, but one I've been thinking about a bit is the ability to fit in.  As in, people around you don't think twice about what you're doing or why you're doing it, and that it's totally normal that you'd be doing it.  What would you do with such a power?  The only rules I can think of for it would be that you cannot do stuff that absolutely no person would be able to do without raising some eyebrows, such as breaking the glass around the Mona Lisa, and you cannot turn it off.

    Duct tape a person's eyebrows to their chin. The path of the tape will prevent them from seeing, speaking, or mostly importantly, raising their eyebrows. As the victim can no longer raise their eyebrows, the action goes unnoticed, thereby allowing you to blind anyone of your choosing long enough to perform more heinous crimes.

    Can you work as a cashier, and when someone pays with cash, would they think it's totally normal for you to take all their cash without giving them any change? 

    Can you walk behind the banker's counter, pretend to be a banker, and then start taking people's credit cards? After all, a banker can do those things, so this isn't something "absolutely no person would be able to do without raising some eyebrows". 

    Also, what is the duration of this power? People might think it's perfectly normal for you to take their credit cards at the moment you are taking them, but later when they check their credit card bills and notice huge expenses, would they realize "wait, this isn't right..." or would they still be "yep, totally normal. nothing to see here."? And if they do eventually notice that something is wrong, would they remember that it was you specifically who took their credit cards?

    If people don't remember that it's you specifically, then there's an even better way to make money: industrial espionage. You could walk into the research labs of successful companies, steal their secrets, and sell them to rival companies for lots of money. This only works if your ability makes you anonymous though, otherwise you would end up with a knife in your back.

    For more ethical purposes, you could also use this ability to fight crime. You wouldn't be able to actually get in physical fights though, since even though you would appear totally normal, it actually is totally normal to punch bad guys, and it would also be totally normal for the bad guys to fight back. No, instead you should become the greatest journalist ever. Walking into all kinds of war zones and restricted areas, filming all kinds of evils while the evildoers think it's totally normal for someone to be filming their actions. So you would expose all the villains and allow the good guys to capture them.

  You have come into the possession of an Actually Magic 8-Ball, having bought it from a mysterious corner shop that wasn't there the next day. The AM8B is all-knowing and 100% honest, but the shopkeeper warned you that it does come with a few limitations.

  * Each ball comes with a limited number of uses; you got this one on sale because it only has one left.

  * It only answers questions that can be answered by one of the [standard 8-ball answers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball#Possible_answers) (i.e., only yes-or-no answers).

  * Each of these answers only means its literal meaning, so no "answer 'yes' for 1, 'don't count on it for 2', etc.".
  ```

    > Each of these answers only means its literal meaning, so no "answer 'yes' for 1, 'don't count on it for 2', etc.".

    Hmmmmmm... I'm pretty sure you can ask convoluted questions to make the 8-ball have at least 10 different meaningful answers even if they all mean their literal meanings. All you need to do is to include self-reference.

    This is because a standard 8-ball has 10 distinct ways of saying yes. So call them "Yes1", "Yes2", "Yes3," ..., "Yes10".
    Let Q be an important question that has 10 possible answers labeled 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

    Now ask: Magic 8-Ball! Tell me if the following boolean expression is true!

     * (Q = 1 AND 8-Ball answers "Yes 1") OR 
     * (Q = 2 AND 8-Ball answers "Yes 2") OR 
     * (Q = 3 AND 8-Ball answers "Yes 3") OR 
     * ...
     * (Q = 10 AND 8-Ball answers "Yes 10") OR 
     * OR 8-Ball answers "No".

    Now if Q = X, for some X in [1..10], the 8-Ball has to answer "Yes X". 
    Why? Because if the 8-Ball answers "No", then the boolean expression would be true, meaning the 8-ball isn't honest.
    If the 8-Ball answers "Yes Y" for some Y not equal to X, then the boolean expression would be false, meaning the 8-ball isn't honest.
    So the only way for the 8-Ball to be honest is to answer "Yes X".

    Hehehe.

      We can take this one step further by realizing that when you ask an 8-ball for answers, the 8-ball doesn't answer immediately, or in any fixed amount of time. The amount of time it takes to answer is based on its inner workings.

      So if we assume this 8-ball is all-knowing and 100% honest, it has to be able to choose which answer to give when asked a question. But if it has the power to choose which answer to give, surely it also has the power to adjust the timing at which the answer is given!

      Therefore, before asking your question, first set up a camera to record the 8-ball's timing with extreme precision. Now every time unit counts as a distinct answer. Add these distinct answers to your boolean expression, and voila! OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS!

      Well ok, there's probably still a character limit of sorts based on how precise your camera can be, but it is still a way higher number of distinct, meaningful answers than two. And considering the camera technology available today, you could probably get pretty good answers for questions like:

       * What are the winning lottery numbers for the next lottery?
       * What is the chemical formula for an optimal cancer-curing/anti-aging/[insert other medical miracle] drug?
       * Who is the optimal person for creating a friendly AI if we askers of the 8-ball now gave him our support?
       * What is the approximate direction and distance to the nearest habitable planet?
       * Which of our current systems of morality would produce the [best] future? (for some definition of "best").
       * What is the longest list of presidents this 8-ball can give such that electing these presidents results in an optimal future?

      And perhaps the question with the highest risk and highest reward:

       * What is the most concise yet viable method of creating a time machine?

      If you're unlucky, there's no way to make a time machine in a concise enough manner for the 8-ball to answer. 

      If you're lucky... time travel back to before you asked the 8-ball. It's time for **infinite questions**.
