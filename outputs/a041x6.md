  Not exactly related to this chapter, but something is bothering me about genjutsu in NTBS's world. So to dispel genjutsu you need the intelligence to realize you're in one, and the chakra to purge the hostile chakra, so why can't the nine-tailed fox, and other spirits, who are both intelligent and have chakra defend themselves against genjutsu?
  ```

    Good observation! I do in fact have an explanation for this. This is one of those times when I would have liked to write much more about the underlying mechanics, but it slowed down the pacing of the story too much for me to fit it in. I did however manage to include this segment in the Forest of Death:

    >“He’s right,” said Sakura. “Humans that  lived in areas like these slowly evolved to use chakra consciously, as  opposed to ordinary animals which only ever use it passively. Some  scholars even say that the reason we grew intelligent in the first place  was because it allowed us to use chakra better, by harnessing the power  of our concentration and imagination. Although, that does raise the  question of why most people are unable to become ninjas, despite the  clear evolutionary advantage it offers…”

    And then in [Chapter 29](https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2017/12/18/chapter-29/) from when Jiraiya was teaching Naruto the summoning technique:

    >He looked up again. “Dad… this mount  whatsit place where the toads come from – you said you’ve been there,  right? Was everything else there really huge as well?”  
    >  
    >“Oh yeah. Giant trees the size of mountains, huge toadstools… you’d have to see it to believe it, kiddo.”  
    >  
    >“So just  like the Forest of Death then,” Naruto said, realizing. “Did you ever  summon toads in another area with huge trees and plants like that? And did the contract last longer then?”  
    >  
    >Jiraiya  blinked. “Huh, come to think of it… I summoned Gama Bunta in this weird  valley in the Land of Grass once – huge place filled with crazy stuff –  and he never popped ‘till we got into combat with this rogue Grass ninja  and he took a few bad hits. Never really thought about it, but that was  pretty strange.”  
    >  
    >That settled  it. “Dad, it sounds like these giant animal spirits can only survive in  areas with lots of natural chakra like the Forest of Death or this Mount place they’re from, and if they go away from there they slowly run  out of chakra until they die from it. I’m guessing whoever invented the  technique made it so that it automatically calls the spirits back to the place they were summoned from when that’s about to happen.” And in  fact, that implied they were not spirits at all, but just unusually  intelligent chakra animals.

    And of course, all of this eventually leads to Naruto summoning Gaara when he releases the One-tailed beast, as explained by Hiashi afterwards:

    >“So that’s how you did it.” They all turned  to look at the person seated at the far end of the table: A pale man  dressed in white robes and brown haori who could only be the lord Hyūga  himself. “You knew from your own experience that when a host loses his  struggle with the daemon within, he becomes vulnerable to targeted  techniques such as genjutsu and sealing, the same as any other spirit. That is how you summoned him to your position and slew him despite the sheer difference in power. Ingenious.”

    It's never stated explicitly, but the idea here (and what Naruto definitely realized, even if he never said it out loud) is that humans and chakra creatures like animal summons and the Tailed Beasts went through two different evolutionary paths: Humans evolved to use chakra consciously, and so acquired a resistance to foreign chakra such as techniques that might otherwise be used against them. Chakra animals instead evolved the ability to absorb chakra from their surroundings, giving them incredible natural strength and resilience (as well as weird mutations) but making them vulnerable to techniques that inject foreign chakra into their system like genjutsu.

    The obvious question then is how Sages work, but that will be explained at a later point in the story. :)

    &#x200B;

    tl;dr: Spirit animals cannot resist foreign chakra because they *are* giant balls of foreign chakra.

    I hear what you're saying, and this is more of a literary device than a rational analysis, but genjutsu are essentially the only thing with any possibility of restraining them, so they are what have to be used within the narrative.

    Then when characters employ things like the sharingan, which the original material describes with such hyperbolic language that they may create 'perfect' genjutsu, it doesn't matter how smart and powerful the kyuubi is because it is not PERFECTLY smart or omnipotent.

    The interplay between the original work and fanfiction allows for liberties, I remember yudkowsky saying that his readers would have criticised and questioned the existence of Azkaban if he had invented it, but because it was in the source material he had much more liberty to play with it.

    Not a perfect response and I have no time to edit, my flight is taking off. I hope this describes at least the direction of my thought.

    But also, you're right.

  I really like the direction Sakura is going in, and can't wait to see how a rational story handles ninja medicine.  One of the things that fascinated me the most about canon, was the medical stuff; the biology of ninja powers, and how its one of the few things about Part 1 that the creators actually thought about it, and extrapolated into Part 2. In a world where having certain cells/genes/organs can grant you powers as extraordinary as manipulating time and space or X-ray vision, characters like Danzo and Orichimaru felt like perfectly natural villains. Maybe it's cuz I do a lot of biology in real life, but I can't to see how this story approaches bloodlines.

  I love how Naruto is more Ninjutsu oriented, but I did feel like almost every rational Naruto story missed an opportunity to explore how truly broken somebody could become in the Naruto universe with magic chakra powers, rationality, and an in-depth understanding of biology. I think Sakura, in this story, is really going to scratch my itch for good old fashioned biological transhumanism in a Naruto story.

  Though when you think about it, in this fic Naruto is already a lot like a good version of Orichimaru. If he started looking into medicine, that parallel could become even stronger. It would be interesting to read a story where the whole Generation Xerox thing is swapped, because, when you think about, even in canon, Naruto fights a lot more like Orochimaru than Jiraiya. Reliance on weird, basically innate abilities? Check. Incredible regeneration? Check. Summons (shared with Jiraiya but still)? Check. Add a flair for invention and curiosity about the deeper workings of ninjutsu and chakra, and you basically have the Snake Sannin, reborn. 

  Plus that would mean two characters looking into two different kinds of biological transhumanism, and that would actually make my day :D

  Awesome chapter, as always.

  I've been trying to read this for months now. It's always interesting, but it hasn't grabbed me like Methods of Rationality, Luminosity, or The Waves Arisen did. 

  Thanks for reminding me to return to it!
  I hear great things, but I don't think i've gotten to the good parts yet.
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:

    I'm glad you're giving it a chance! Can I ask how far you've gotten? There's definitely an upward curve, but the climax to the Waves arc is almost universally beloved so if you don't like that you might be disappointed.

    Also, when you say you're hearing great things, do you mean here on r/Rational? Or is the story being discussed on other forums as well? Because that would be pretty neat if so.

      My family has been into lesswrong since pre-HP MOR. Both my brother and sister have recommended The Need.

      I've only gotten through the first ten chapters or so. It is an open tab so I go back to it when I remember it's there.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        That's really cool! My brother recommended HPMOR too, and all my other siblings have read it as well. It's nice to have something to talk about with each other at family events when you don't care about sports :p

        Be sure to tell your brother and sister that they have excellent taste in fanfiction!

          Well, thanks to the holidays I am up to date! Around chapter fifteen I got hooked and had trouble putting it down.

          I love how every combat is brutal and uncertain, and I can't wait for the next installment!

            Glad to hear it! Chapter 15 is where I really started to hit my stride so that makes sense. I've always loved writing combat scenes and can't help but treat some of the chapters leading up to them as a bit of a necessary evil :P

            I hope you enjoy the holidays!

  Can I just say I loved, loved how Sakura met Tsunade. Amazing characterization. Most writers don't get this aspect of her personality as well. The banter between Ino and Sakura was great too.  *I didn't say it, you thought that* hahaha

  Interesting take on techniques too.

    Thanks! Fixed now. On my website at least.

    Man, I really wish there was an easier way to edit this story on every website/forum at once. <\_<

  The comments on this chapter remind me that I need to go and re-read this one of these days; I'm looking forward to it! Some thoughts:

  &#x200B;

  * The bit where Sakura figures out the truth behind poison-release really made a bunch of loose threads click for me. The whole story became clearer after reading about her realization. Maybe that was just *my* moment of insight, but good job! I'm really starting to see what the overarching conflict of the story is about and it's hitting all of the points that I'd always wanted to see addressed. 

  &#x200B;

  * It seems like our main characters inherited a world in a precarious equilibrium, with a worldwide conspiracy to keep people from figuring out the truth about chakra and techniques, and the more ordinary conspiracy that the military-industrial complex has shaped politics to keep itself alive forever, to the detriment of regular people everywhere. I'm excited to see what each character learns about this ugly world and what they do about these two big problems. 

  &#x200B;

  * Right now, it looks like Sasuke is the only one who's okay with the status quo regarding the two conspiracies, but narratively I expect that to change. That makes me expect that the truth behind the Uchiha massacre will be related to changing his opinion on at least one of the conspiracies (my bet is on the military one). 

  &#x200B;

  * If I were writing this story, my endgame would be Team 7 starting a political revolution by teaching all of their followers about the secret to techniques and then their faction managing to dissolve the stratocracy.
