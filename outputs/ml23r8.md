  I gotta say, I'm a fan of the unfailingly polite magical T-1000. Really hoping that he and/or his master don't turn out to be secretly evil.

  I'm also liking this first impression of the Neke Islands. It seems like a much more pleasant place to live than the Principality, although that's a rather low bar to clear. I'm sure it's not the utopia it looks like at first, but I'm hoping the problems we'll eventually see are less severe than "secretly controlled by a cabal of magical bigoted imperialistic autocrats."

  Man, Ana really needs leave her bias at the door. It's one thing to be paranoid, which is more than justified, but she's just being spiteful here. It reminds me of that scene way back when she's at the Commonplace rally and they're listing grievances against Paragon and she's just going "No, you're the bad guys!" each time.
