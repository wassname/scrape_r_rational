  I saw all the comments on the previous chapter complaining about the revisions, so I just wanted to pipe up and say that I'm still reading and enjoying! The ending scene of this chapter was very powerful.

  I like this fic, but I'm a bit put out by how powerless Taylor is in this world. Her power is great and she's not getting any appreciation for it :(

    If she won right off the bat, what would I put at the end? One of the issues with the serial format is that the resolution isn't just 200 pages and a binge-reading session away, so it can get a bit frustrating. Some people go too far in the other direction and have their protagonists win win win the entire time, but that sacrifices the story's structure and longevity for short-term zanyness. I hope to strike a balance in the future, but for now I'm going for structure over everything and damning the consequences.

        >I would enjoy crossover-possessions, alternate universes and self-inserts a lot more if the protagonist didn't end up with a brand-new set of skills IN ADDITION TO all the skills of the original. 

        Did you ever find any good ones like that? I'd love to read one as well.

      I see what you mean. I guess it felt weird that Taylor is basically "a glorified telephone" who no one's taking seriously. 

      Like, with her power, she shouldn't have to revel in smugness when gauthier overrules mercy, because taylor could have shut her down way before that if she really wanted to.
