  This chapter is on the shorter end, for which I apologize. I hope that it's at least some consolation that there's a 2,500 chapter waiting in the wings (and that the chapters in this story are still getting longer on average)

  ```
  Nothing actually happened in the chapter and yet it was really interesting, also because it actually had to do with the previous chapter
  ```
