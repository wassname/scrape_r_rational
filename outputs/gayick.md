## [RST][WIP]The Flower That Bloomed Nowhere, chapter 18(21). Also I completely changed the opening chapters in response to feedback.

I was feeling a bit defeated with this project in regard to lack of interest, but rather than give up, I decided to go back and make some changes to the opening of the story based on the feedback I received here and elsewhere. I cut the first three chapters entirely and revised several others pretty comprehensively. 

I'm not sure how much this will help, since trying to fix a story in progress can be hard, especially since success in this format is tied up deeply with the nature of the web serial market, but it seemed worth a shot. If it ends up working even less, I can always change it back, or kill my darlings and rewrite it very differently. Let me know what you think!

  I'll check out the story tonight, but your tone was rather glum so I was reminded of [some advice for web authors I recently read and think may be helpful.]( https://wanderinginn.com/writing-faqs/#9)

  > **Question #8: Hey, I was wondering if like when you first started on here did you get discouraged by comparing your growth to others on here? (Referring to RoyalRoad website)**

  >I try never to compare myself to others. My advice is simple. Never look at your ranking. Never look at your views. Just keep to your schedule and write on. That’s why my main story is NOT on Royalroad–it’s on my own site, where rankings don’t matter. I only put my story on Royalroad after I had my own community. My advice to all web writers is not to expect even more than a single comment until you’ve been working for 6 months.

  > 6 months, with no views, no comments, no recognition. I think that’s the bar people struggle with. And it will be far, far longer if your goal is sustaining yourself with writing monetarily or achieving accolades. There is no good advice I can give besides keep writing for the sake of writing. For the one or two people who read and enjoy your work. If I offer any other words about ranking, numbers and so on, it will all be subjective and unhelpful.
  > 
  > Advertise your work, by all means. Stress about it, engage your audience, all those good things. But write because you want to, not because you’re expecting something for it.

  So hang in there (or don't), beat a dead horse (or don't), just write whatever you have the passion for. If I recall, the renowned time loop story in webfic circles (MoL) had a very small following for years after starting in 2011. The updates were consistent but sparse and I don't think it really got much recognition until late 2014.

  Best of luck and hope this time loop lives up to its potential!

    That's advice I've heard a lot, but to be honest, I think you can only put so much stock into it? You hear it from people like Wildbow and Pirateba, but their experiences might be examples of survivorship bias - they wrote something niche and with a bit of first-timer jank, but their work managed to reach the right audience at the right moment for the format and took off. There are far more web serials that authors have labored on for years without ever gaining any recognition.

    On RR, there are stories that are so good at pushing the right buttons that they can catapult to earning a living wage for the author within _weeks_ of being launched. Obviously, I'm not writing something that's going to have that level of mass appeal. But I think if a story, in spite of being marketed, doesn't get some kind of respectable audience by 100k words, then something about it is flawed, and pushing ahead rather than trying to find the problem will only trap you in a writing death march.

    But still, thanks for your kind words! I hope it picks up, too.

      Definitely, and she also addresses the fortune factor and the elusiveness of success in Questions #3 and #10. Yes, the vast majority of stories and authors will never gain the recognition they're seeking because there's just *too much* content out there (monopolistic competition and Sturgeon's law). Like you say, success right off the bat is a matter of luck and standing out from the crowd. But if writing is your intended career or you're invested in succeeding, you can't depend on luck.

      Don't worry about RR's viral equivalents of popcorn flicks. Firstly the spirit of the above advice is to prevent yourself from falling into a psychologically harmful inferiority spiral (unless you're the rare type that thrives on competition/envy/spite). Secondly, Royalroad's standards are a terrible metric for aspiring writers. It rewards certain tropes, formulas, and writing styles (e.g. bite-sized cliffhangers) that don't really help you improve as a *writer*. The takeaway is that if you want the RR kind of success, you either have to (1) "sell-out" to the formulas that work for Royalroad's target audience, (2) keep writing new stories until something sticks by the law of averages, or (3) simply perservere, get better at writing, and eventually write a story that's so good the boundaries don't matter.

      That said, I do think there are some flaws with the introduction that's seriously hamstringing it and reader interest, but I've already sent you a PM about it. I mentioned first-impact appeal, but web serials are particularly sensitive to first impressions. For the majority of the audience, I'd say the introduction is the gatekeeper. Unlike paid-for novels and e-books where there's a sunk cost, with web serials, you usually have one opportunity to set the hook and line. Not only that, the more readers you can convince to follow it, the more there's word-of-mouth. Self-promotion marketing like this thread helps, but I think word-of-mouth recommendations are the most effective type of marketing in the web serial world. In response to your OP, my opinion is that the intro should be rewritten. Rest by PM.

      edit: [coincidentally, Brandon Sanderson just had a keynote about why it's so damn hard to achieve success as a writer](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/gduql0/brandon_sanderson_on_the_common_lie_writers_tell/).

  I had this bookmarked not because it didn't interest me but because it lacked chapter and I'm afraid to get invested in a story that could get dropped by the author early on. Please don't feel down and keep up the good work.

  Don't feel too discouraged! The world that you have created is an interesting and unique one, and I'm sure people will be drawn to that. Regarding the prologue chapters, personally I thought they provided a compelling reason to read and unravel the mystery of just what the hell happened.
