  I tried starting this a while ago but the prose and the huge run-on paragraphs put me off. Just in the first chapter the author used "grunted" instead of "said" *four freaking times*, and it doesn't stop there. I hate it when the prose keeps breaking your immersion. The author should really read [this guide to grammar in speech](https://www.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/4n5rhl/grammar_in_speech_in_speech/) that was linked here awhile ago. 

  Does it get better? Should I give it another try?

    I honestly never noticed that. The prose might not be a thing of ephemeral beauty, but it's a fun story that does interesting things.

      It's pronounced enough that I wonder if it's a deliberate stylistic choice.  It's a fantasy setting where narrative has ontological power and the incessant other verbs in place of "said" and descriptors instead of names/pronouns make me think of trope-filled, old school cheesy fantasy.

    Try re-reading it while distracted. IMHO your annoyance has deprived you of a beautiful scene of a scheming magnificent bastard, though this chapter does reference a number of running gags. Also, note the score, despite almost no comments.  It appears a lot of us appreciate these chapters.

    No. I like the wordyness. It's a taste thing, not an objective value.
