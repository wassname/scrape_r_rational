## Good cultivation or power up fiction

  Assuming you mean Will Wight's Cradle series, while I enjoy it a lot, I would in no way call it rational fiction. There are no clearly defined rules (e.g. basically anything is possible through some special technique, with no clear limits or restrictions), the protagonist manages to skip a ton of the hard work through deus ex style interventions, bad guys frequently carry the idiot ball, and a lot of stuff seemingly only happens because the plot demands it. 

  All that being said, check out Worth the Candle. It's a SI portal fantasy where the protagonist is dropped into a world based on the tabletop universes he created on earth. He seemingly has a character sheet that he can view and progresses through the story while leveling up and gaining new skills. This is a terrible description but basically it's really well written, has great characters, and includes the kind of power up mechanic you are asking about (although it's more a slow burn and not the constant crazy ratcheting of power levels seen in things like Cradle)

  The only xianxia story I've ever really liked is the forum quest **[Forge of Destiny](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/)**. Ling Qi definitely does receive a fair amount of good fortune, but it is to a lesser extent than most xianxia, and she works damn hard to climb from the very bottom, supported by a voterbase that does a *lot* of careful planning and math to ensure optimal resource usage. Very well-written too. Great setting. 

  Seconding *Worth the Candle* and *White Collar Cultivator*, they are both good.

  I like [The Storm King](https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/16476/the-storm-king), a slow burning and western take on cultivation.  
  There's lots of others I want to recommend, but a lack of rational-ness or the existance of 'grandpa's in rings' disqualifies them.  
  So I'll talk about my own story, [the Dao of Magic](https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/11397/the-dao-of-magic) for a bit. The main character is thrown onto a medieval dungeon and dragons world after his ascension into a higher realm is blocked. Each artifact - except for a spatial ring containing some food - is built by his own hands and the tennants of science. Lot's of pseudo science, I'm sure, but least I try to reason out all that mystical mumbo jumbo instead of blaming 'endless streams of unfathomable power with an ancient air' without explaining what's really going on.  
  EDIT: No epubs, but I'm working on an endited version, it should come out soonâ„¢-ish.
