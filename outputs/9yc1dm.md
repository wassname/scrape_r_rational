  Yep, definitely tearing up a bit. It really took my a while to actually like Grak much, but the backstory chapter opened up a new vista, and this chapter just killed me.

  >***Wardproof:*** *Grak can selectively ignore wards that would apply to him, the things he wears and carries, and up to one other person (at a time). This ability activates automatically when the effect of the ward would be undesirable and can be selectively applied to any ward Grak chooses.*

  Hella thematic. It is a superpower that will protect him from even his own Annihilation Wards for as long as he doesn't want to die.

    But that’s what he wants.

      ```
      I mean there's that whole thing about wanting to not go on living but when it gets to it they can't actually go through with it. Almost certain that whole thing with the Annihilation Ward is the thematic reason that he's getting that passive buff, as a magical manifestation of that lingering reluctance.

  Thanks for reading. As usual, there will be no (intentional) break between books, and the [progress spreadsheet is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PaLrwVYgxp_SYHtkred7ybpSJPHL88lf4zB0zMKmk1E/edit?usp=sharing). Mild progress related spoilers follow, i.e. how far we are from the end; >!I think that at this point, there are between two and three and a half books left of the story proper. When I started the story a year and a half and nearly 800,000 words ago, I wanted to hit [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED], and that's the direction we're moving in. If it's more than that, it's probably because I indulged myself in diversions.!<

  A big thanks to [all my donors on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales) and everyone been following along.

    Really? We're actually >!more than half way through!< already?

    I actually thought this was going >!to encapsulate years of!< Juniper's life. Similar to how Uther spent decades of his life in Aerb. And you are telling me that Juniper is already >!more than half way through his 'story'!?!!<

    >!I mean he hasn't broken even one exclusion zone yet and there's at least 13 quests for that. Not to mention possible quests for exploring the other 62 zones, quests for empire building, all of the other companion quests, or even quests for dealing with the gods.!<

    From my perspective, Juniper is >!a good way into making his way through the 'game', but nowhere near half way. But you are implying that he's 2/3 of the way through.!<

    This was a major surprise!

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Note that the books have been getting longer as they've gone on, partly because there are more characters to deal with. IIRC Book I comes out to 60K words or something like that, while Book VI was 216K. In theory, >!that might mean that three and a half books would come out to be 700K words, which would put us at the halfway mark by word count, if not by abstract-plot-units!<.

      Edit: I do think there's a temptation to run forever and become something like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, where it's just going to continue on indefinitely until it either becomes unprofitable or the writer dies. Aside from burnout, there are a lot of problems with attempting something like that, and how much there is to say about the same set of characters or the world they inhabit is definitely one of them. Then you get into issues like maintaining proper power scaling, maintaining tension, etc., and it becomes clear that degenerate narrative cycles that keep looping forever are really difficult to do in a way that's satisfying to readers (and maybe more-so, for writers).

            Wales writes well, but I don't think it would be too easy to identify it in a crowd.

        So is Arthur's life a hint about that? Did the GM realize this and now he gave a clear end state to his world? That's a fascinating thought thanks for this comment.
        ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Note that, as Joon moves away from "Diablo III"-mode and towards "Civilization V"-mode, both the amount and length of timeskips is increasing. It could that there's e.g. only one or two book left, but these books will span decades as Juniper's adventures get longer, more systematic and less varied.

    Huh, this is at odds with what the DM said in Chapter 79:

    >“That would be telling,” said the Dungeon Master. He flashed me a  smile. “And for now, I plan on being just the right amount of opaque.  They weren’t set up to wait forever though. **Amaryllis will get over you,  if you let her.** Null Pointer Exception will too -- she’s malleable.”

      You could also argue that she is not letting herself get over it by dialing the soul stat down everyday instead of letting it run its way. But I can understand, if she feels like her love to Joon is forced on her by the DM.

        Oh come on.

        You live to be 100 years old. During that life, you forge a empire, defeat gods, spearhead amazing technological developments, knowing that it's all for nothing and the only thing that will remain is a bunch of books you write about it. Your love life is bitter and twisted, your relationships are either mercenary or toxic, and your soulmate is forever gone out of your reach.

        Knowing what you do, and knowing that your younger self might fuck her only chance at a fulfilling love life out of arrogance, do you really not send her a message, for the sake of a dumb promise you made 80 years ago?
        ```

        - u/PM_ME_CUTE_FOXES:
          ```
          That's all totally true.

          The length of a hundred years mustn't be understated, and one of the things I respect most about WtC is Wales' willingness to bite the time chamber bullet and treat it as real-time, where things happen, instead of just a contrivance that inputs a Smart Person and outputs Useful Results.

          Still, from a Doylist perspective, gotta keep an eye on cthulhuraejepsen and Dice Guy.

    Fenn in Ch 34:

    > ***Quest Accepted: Summer’s End - Return to the place where Fenn received her scars and bring justice to the elves. (Companion Quest)***

    Grak in Chs 43, 106 and 137:

    > ***Quest Accepted: All That Glitters - Return to Darili Irid with Grakhuil once da has gathered enough gold to satisfy da nad self-imposed penance to da nad former clan. Speak with Grak to learn more. (500/1000) (Companion Quest)***

    > ***Quest Updated: All That Glitters - Go with Grakhuil Leadbraids to the mausoleum of Darili Irid when he’s amassed one thousand pounds of gold. You are the only one who can help him make peace. (517/1000) (Companion Quest)***

    > ***Quest Complete: All That Glitters - Grak has returned to his home and confronted the disaster that took place there. Keep an eye on him. (Companion Quest)***

    > ***Companion Passive Unlocked: Wardproof (Grak)!***

    > ***Wardproof:*** *Grak can selectively ignore wards that would apply to him, the things he wears and carries, and up to one other person (at a time). This ability activates automatically when the effect of the ward would be undesirable and can be selectively applied to any ward Grak chooses.*

    Solace in Chs 44 and 57:

    > ***Quest Accepted: Taking Root - The world has but a single druid, tending to but a single locus. With the locus so constrained within a magic bottle, no more druids may be inducted, but removal might prove fatal. With your help, druids might stalk the world once more. (Companion Quest)***

    > ***Quest Updated: Taking Root - The world’s last druid has died, leaving the last locus severely constrained and untended. Eventually the imperfectly self-regulating cycles of life within the bottle will fail and the locus will die, unless you can find a way to remove the locus and transplant it into the wider world, where it was always meant to be. (Companion Quest)***

    Amaryllis in Chs 80 and 104:

    > ***Quest Accepted: Pregnant Virgin Princess - Amaryllis has accepted the gift of Yaxukasu Axad. In nine months, she will give rebirth to Solace, and the world will once again have a druid -- if there’s a locus to provide her a grove. (Companion Quest)***

    > ***Quest Completed: Pregnant Virgin Princess - Amaryllis has given birth to Oorang Solace, bringing her back from the dead. If another of your party members dies, don’t expect it to be so easy.***

    Completing Amaryllis' companion quest involved her giving rebirth to Solace—who remains a companion—instead of unlocking a companion passive. Curiously, the completion message for her quest was not flagged with "***(Companion Quest)***" though, so that might be an oversight.

    No other companion quests to date.
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      Mmm, I actually don't think that the "Companion Quest" tag in the Pregnant Virgin Princess quest was referring to Amaryllis, I think it was there as a reference to Solace's companion quest, since the last line references the locus. Solace's death was directly reflected in the updated description of her companion quest of saving the locus, and the quest to revive her was presumably tagged as a part of that quest. 

      It seems like there is one big Companion Quest for each party member, and completing with grant them a very strong buff on par with this. Another reason to think that was merely linked to the locus quest, and Amaryllis' companion quest hasn't triggered yet.
      ```

      - u/icesharkk:
        ```
        Yeah I never saw that as Mary's quest. I think Mary's quest will be much more twisted. Not directly related to her family. Something like her somehow being Dahlia so the family could retain the entads claim. So he quest would be to recover the centuries of memories she's lost.

  - u/RUGDelverOP:
    ```
    Fenn's was something involving going back to her homeland, but her quest got deleted. Solace's is settling the Locus down. AFAIK there's no quest involving Bethel, Valencia or Raven, and I can't remember if Amaryllis got one or not.
    ```

    - u/tjhance:
      ```
      I think it's interesting that Joon didn't get a companion quest "help Amaryllis revolutionize technology on Aerb". This is despite her explicitly wanting it to be "an open plot thread" (chapter 124).

      But I note that Fenn's and Grak's were both very personal quests. So I suspect Amaryllis, if she gets one, will be similar.

      One possibility is that: (spoilers encrypted text) >!The first encrypted message says 'Juniper can help you with [being too cautious and manipulative]'. I suspect, if she ever gets around to asking Juniper to help her with that, it will trigger a companion quest.!<

  - u/CoronaPollentia:
    ```
    Wardproof is borderline broken in a world where ward magic is a major concern. On Aerb, though, it's just one of many magics - it's definitely a major one, but compared to the bullshit that the council of Arches can output at this point, it's frankly not unbalanced.

      ```
      So when the idea was first floated a week or so ago, we did find your pre-existing wiki. Can't remember the exact discussion, but ultimately we decided that we wanted a fresh start. We weren't happy with the "worth-the-candle-webnovel" URL and, with only seventeen pages already out there (most barebones TODO pages) and no idea who the editor was, opted to start over with a better URL and permissions to mess with templates and site formatting. We're trying to adopt a chapter-by-chapter methodology for adding information to the wiki, rather than a more scattergun approach. Didn't mean to tread on your toes; are you in the Discord?

  ```
  *Reading the chapters individually and spaced out to maximise my enjoyment and curtail my desire to binge them.* 

  **Notes on Chapter 135 below:** 

  * I'm loving Bethel's weird architecture obsession. Wonder if its meant to hint at something deeper going on in her psychology. A desire to show off and exert her power? Also seems to weirdly interat with her idea of "houseness" if she doesn't want to feel like a facility but keeps building giant rooms.  
  * So Pallida is definitely into Amaryllis in this timeline as well. Seems to be mostly transference from her ancestor which is kinda gross. Can't see that ending well, even if they went okay in the alternate timeline. 
  * Juniper and Raven both seem to be downplaying the extent of what happened in the library which is troubling.
  * The fox guard have a bunch of weird rituals and stuff going on. I imagine June will have to go visit them some time and complete a quest of his own to prove he's the Chosen One TM. 
  * I hadn't thought about the possibility of the basilisk image being in his soul. That’s a problem in that it makes it harder to prevent/defeat the level up obsessed Juniper next time. Though it could also serve as a defence against hostile soul magic. They haven't discussed how to prevent the levelup problem in the future, which seems like a ticking time bomb. 
  * Lots of hints about Amaryllis overusing the time chamber. 
  * Juniper definitely needs SOC badly. It’s a force multiplier. He's more at the stage of managing other people and interacting with big powers than he is dealing with 1v1 physical threats, short of DM contrived situations. 
  * June and Amaryllis's relationshi continues to be a complicated mess. 
  * Bethel seems to be evolving into an advisor kinda role. Maybe she desires to be useful in ways beyond being a house. The deliberate creepiness also seems to be a way of keeping people at a distance. Would be interesting to see longer conversations between her and people who aren't Juniper.

    > They haven't discussed how to prevent the levelup problem in the future, which seems like a ticking time bomb. 

    Juniper tried to use his new abilities in Spirit magic to deal with that (chapter 136, just after the conversation with Grak). We still have to see whether it sticks or not, of course...

    Notes on Chapter 136: 

    * 	• Re the kinrael bit at the beginning of the Grack interaction, I can't tell if juniper is actually being totally clueless or was trying to be funny. 
    * 	• Grak really just wants to be loved. :( I wonder if his messed up arranged marriage thing has left him with insecurities about his self worth as it relates to romance, hopefully he can learn to get value from friendship type relationships as well. 
    * 	• The spirit fiddling seems like it should work from the description, but narratively speaking it feels too easy. Maybe there are going to be unanticipated negative side effects to messing with the spirit. (Maybe that’s why Arthur banned it?)
    * 	• Platonic Amarylis and Juniper time is nice. 
    * 	• The discussion of personal identity with levelup!Juniper is interesting. Resolves some of the issues we were talking about in discussion of the last chapter  
    * 	• Still no interaction with Valencia. 
    * 	• I love the magic satellites. 
    * 	• Plastic mages sound scary af.
    * Pallida seems very happy with being onboard, sems to have casually enough assimilated.
    ```

      ```
      Chapter 137

      * Time for Grak's companion quest! 
      * Have we heard of Altek before? I don't recall them. 
      * The Daril Idrid people seem like assholes already. 
      * Not clear how this was all expected to work, given how long wards last, even with distnace and travel time it would seem more cost effective to have a travellign warder visit them. Or Grak to work as a warder in other nearby places and send money back. 
      * Interesting getting something narrated from Grak's perspective. He seems more self aware than Juniper, or at least direct about it. 
      * The rest of the hold should really not have been surprised at his reaction, given they had already inferred he was putting off coming back. Trying tp forcefully reintegrate him into everythng at once was bound to fail 
      * Bethel being able to fly is another addition to her ridiculous range of powers now. She's like a flying fortress. 
      * How is juniper smelling the place if he's breathing from an oxygen tank? Aren't they airtight?
      * "I felt my stomach churn when I saw a larger corpse cradling a smaller one in its arms." Ah fuck, right in the feels. Reminds me of a similar thing in the ruins of Pompeii. 
      * Juniper's description of his granfather and his own depression is really moving. Can't really put together coheret comments on any of the suicide stuff. 
      * Juniper's parents are sounding increasingly neglectful and awful. 
      * And the game interface has to undercut a meaningful moment as always. Fuck the DM.

  I wonder what Fenn's companion perk would have been. Probably something to do with bows.

  Also, because the thread got deleted, I have a quote for the Amaryllis being a DMPC from the [Amaryllis POV Chapter.](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/31229865)

  >he said a small prayer to each of the five gods, and then a final, sixth prayer to the Dungeon Master that Juniper believed was the one true god of Aerb. Prayers to the gods had their own specific structures to them, with motifs and iconographies that the pious were expected to adhere to, even if prayer itself was next to useless. The prayer to the Dungeon Master took some thought, because no standards existed for praying to what was only a theoretical deity.

  >Dungeon Master, if I must be on your railroad, let me ride the train with good humor. If I must roll the dice, let it be known that I would not object to you fudging.

  Surprised nobody’s talking about both Joon and the interface gendering Grak as male. Even Grak’s own story does it! Which maybe indicates it’s being told by future-Joon. Seems really weird (for the interface) and disrespectful/inconsiderate (from Joon). 

  Joon messed things up with Fenn in part by not respecting her or trying to understand her on her own terms. _Terms_ are literally part of the problem: she gets mad at him trying to respect her by accepting “washater” as a word for the interface because she already suggested it 30 chapters ago and he just totally forgot. So it kind of seems like a lesson unlearned.

  OTOH, Grak and Joon’s relationship is very different, and this is a good example of how you can really connect with someone and help them out even while misunderstanding a basic fact about them.

      Thanks for the clarification! I think if the emotional impact of the passage wasn’t so important, it would have been pretty cool stylistically to have it shoved in our faces that Dwarves are Different. (In kind of the same way that it’s cool to read about experiences very different from your own.)

      Enjoying the story as always, btw! Don’t take this comment as a negative response to the chapters overall.

      I’m also curious if you’ve read Ada Palmer’s Terra Ignota series, a really deep/engaging sci fi series that plays with sex and gender descriptions a bunch.

    Yeah, that threw me for a loop too.

    We had a lot of detail on Grak not actually being male and Joon just being an everyman who just rounded them off to male, but when they get an interlude chapter, they just go on using the male pronoun.

    Grak does refer to all the dwarves we encounter as male (iirc, I don't feel like going back and checking) so it might be them just not really caring and using the pronouns they're used to in most of society, though that seems weird for the flashback at least.

    I'd personally be interested in WoG on what we're actually supposed to draw from this.
    ```

    - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
      ```
      I tried it, but in practice, it reads *way* too awkwardly and distracts from what the text is actually saying (especially using the established Groglir pronouns). It would have been more accurate to the internal view that Grak has of himself, but that accuracy would probably take away from other aspects of what the narrative was trying to convey. I also briefly tried it without gender at all, by skipping pronouns, but that had similar problems with awkwardness.

      In general, you shouldn't take anything from it. Grak doesn't view himself as male, he views himself as a dwarf, but in Anglish it's customary for dwarves to take male pronouns, in a similar way that the vitrics take female pronouns, and for the most part people don't have a problem with this, especially since *most of the time* dwarves code male. (Notable exceptions include pregnant dwarves, dwarven midwives, dwarven childrearing, dwarven occupations, and dwarven sexuality.)

      Now that being said, the game interface should consistently use dwarven pronouns, since that's what I did in the past; I will fix that.
      ```

      - u/bacontime:
        ```
        The Anglish custom for referring to dwarves as 'he' could also just come from the speech patterns of amateur Anglish-speakers, without even taking the male coding into consideration.

        In Mandarin Chinese, spoken pronouns are non-gendered, so "ta" can translate to 'him', 'he', 'she', 'her', or 'it', depending on context. ("ta de" for the possessive) A consequence of this is that Mandarin speakers learning English will often use the male pronoun even when inappropriate. eg:  
        > "You forgot your phone. I left him on the kitchen table for you."  

        So a dwarf comes into town, you make friends with them, and they start telling you about their family. They refer to all of their relatives using male pronouns because 'h' is easier to say with a dwarven mouth than 'sh', and honestly the whole gendered-pronoun thing is still confusing them. So even if you are a species which doesn't associate beards with maleness, you walk away from the conversation with the impression that all dwarves are male. 

        Sure, highly fluent dwarves might realize that "they" is a better translation or prefer the nuance of loan-word pronouns from Groglir, but the majority of dwarves won't even notice the difference unless they think about it.

        In fact, I'd expect the stereotype to be that dwarves don't understand what women are. When a chinese person refers to your mother as "him", it's confusing for a moment, but then you realize its just a translation mistake. When a dwarf does the same, it's plausible that the dwarf really doesn't know your mother's gender.

          Oh yeah, French speakers make that mistake all the time. (there's no "it" pronoun in French, and all nouns are gendered, even stuff like "kitchen" or "table")

      - u/citrustouch:
        ```
        Have you thought about using "they/them"? It's used in many modern English contexts to refer to a singular nonbinary person, and personally, I think it flows well. Grak, coming from a species with no sexual dimorphism, seems to literally exist outside a binary gender system.

        Even it sounds a little quirky, language changes as people use it. It'd be cool to see explicit nonbinary representation in a story regardless.

      They didn't get into a fight about it the second time Fenn brought it up (in ch 117), she just got annoyed:

      >“We don’t know enough,” I said. “We don’t even know if [Uther] was playing by the same rules. If we had different rules -- I mean, it seems like we did, doesn’t it? His so-called Knack seems stronger than whatever you’d call the thing that I have.”

      >“Washater,” said Fenn. She seemed unaccountably annoyed that I’d asked. “Just an elven word that fits pretty well.” She paused slightly. “It means a system of rules, basically. I don’t think you’d want to call it a game.”

  First of all let me say, I'm really glad we've gotten back to more Joon-centric arcs lately. The Amaryllis arcs were fun, but it did feel like the party was starting to drift out of focus and Joon's renewed interest in all of them has helped to cohere the story a bit. It's nice that these side quests that have been piling up are starting to get resolved, though I've got to say Grak's quest felt like it was almost... too easy? I mean in the real world sense, sometimes all it takes is a friend being there for you, and Joon finally recognizing Grak's personage and acknowledging it might have been the narrative hurdle he needed to overcome. But in this game world that Joon finds himself in, *nothing* has ever come as easy as a road trip and a short speech before. I do hope that the others pose a bit more of a challenge- the best parts of this story have consistently been Joon and the others rising to meet the obstacles presented to them, and lately it's been in more of a planning and conversation mode which isn't as viscerally thrilling.

  I'm really disappointed that Fenn is increasingly likely not to come back. She was easily my favorite member of the main trio, and I think her character added a lot of much-needed lightness to the ponderous and kind of soggy Amaryllis/Joon non-relationship. While her loss might be narratively useful, it's very unsatisfying to see her cut out so completely and Bethel's turn as comic relief isn't really filling the void.

    >though I've got to say Grak's quest felt like it was almost... too easy?

    You seem to think that Grak's quest started and finished in this chapter. But in reality that's only when the quest ended. Technically, Juniper has been working on this quest from the very moment he met Grak.

    It was a very difficult thing for Juniper to emotionally connect to Grak (since da nada reminds him of his worst moments). Plus there was the whole bit with learning Grak's language.

    While this quest hasn't involved any fighting, I would definitely say that it's a quest reward that was well-earned. If it's a reward well-received is another question.

    I think this was an attempt to show character growth on behalf of Juniper - him relating his suicide attempts to the suicidal Grak and then bonding over it. It is, as far as I know, the most detail he's gone into it in the story. I'm not even sure if he broached the issue with Fenn or not.

    > I'm really disappointed that Fenn is increasingly likely not to come back.

    I agree that the absence of Fenn has really changed the tone of the narrative, and I also think that it's a detriment. I was never really enraptured with any of the romantic threads of this story as they felt, often at times, a bit under cooked, but I did appreciate the lightheartedness that Fenn brought to the story and she's really missed on that account. 

    As you stated:

    >  lately it's been in more of a planning and conversation mode which isn't as viscerally thrilling.

    I have the same identical thought. In the last batch of chapters I complained about the lack of "rising action/tension" in the story - for instance, we were told and not *shown* all of these horrible things that are on the move to end the world and I felt like that really cut the legs out from underneath what should be a feeling of impending crisis. 

    I hope to see some forward progression in this direction soon.

  > She put up a network of ‘satellites’, hung in place above Aerb using rotating shifts of still mages and other magics

  Wait a minute, why a network of satellites?

  Wouldn't it be cheaper to have a single flying fortress of computing and radio signals, that should be able to communicate with the entire hex? (it being flat and all). You'd get economy-of-scale benefits on a ton of infrastructure that way: teleporting personnel on and off the station, teleporting materials, security measures, all database operations (databases are *way* more efficient when all the data is stored in a single building), etc.

  On the other hand, a single satellite is more vulnerable to things like terrorist attacks and exceptional failures.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    When I wrote that, I was thinking mostly about signal interference; Aerb isn't a single flat surface, it wraps around, so if you're high up and broadcasting in all directions, the radio waves will overlap.

    One of the other problems is that light on Aerb undergoes a kind of anti-refraction as it travels through the air, which shortens the apparent horizon (only really notable in a few places, and implemented partially to save me time trying to work out atmoplanar haze and viewing angles). Without that, the downward bend of light due to gravity would make you appear to be living at the bottom of a huge bowl, which is weird for no good reason. I haven't done any calculations, nor described the mechanism that makes the anti-refraction phenomenon work, but it's definitely a complicating factor in terms of radio transmission.

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        'Wraps' in the sense that if you go far enough north, you end up south. Assuming that radio waves didn't bend at all and there was no atmosphere to muck things up, a powerful transmitter wouldn't just cover the entirety of Aerb, that signal would keep going and cause interference. Someone standing at the notional 'edge' of Aerb would be getting signals of equal strength from both 'north' and 'south'.

  So... in the original summary the author claimed this would be a harem fic. Then the summary was changed to take this out. Now that Amaryllis and Joon pairing seems to be becoming canon after all, I'm starting to wonder if maybe the DM really did plan for Joon to be romantically involved with everyone in his party eventually.

  I will be amazed if this actually is able to happen naturally, but the DM seems to have a tendency to plan out everything in advance down to every last butterfly effect. The question is, is AlexanderWales a skilled enough writer to make it happen without looking forced?

    The DM has explicitly said that he improvised a lot, and that he was ready to react to Joon & co going off the rails. For instance, they completely ignored the Rising Bile insurrection, which was blatantly meant to be a sidequest.

    [Chapter 106](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/34742768): The One-Hand Warder:

    >“You keep using the word penance,” I said. “A self-punishment?” The game had told me as much, in the text of his companion quest.
    >
    >Grak wasn’t looking at anything in particular. I greatly preferred conversational tooth-pulling with Fenn, where getting her to speak meant wading through jokes and diversions rather than silence.
    >
    >“Something happened to Darili Irid,” I said. I paused, watching him. “You came back. They tried to force a life on you. You left. And then -- I don’t want to guess at what tragedy happened because they didn’t have a warder. I will guess, if you don’t tell me.”
    >
    >“It is time for us to go back,” he said, finally switching to Anglish.
    >
    >“Something horrible,” I said, staying in Groglir. “An invasion? A theft?” I wasn’t that eloquent to him, I’m sure, since the ideas I was trying to express had to be cobbled together from words that I already knew. “Assassination?”
    >
    >“Accident,” said Grak. I saw his jaw move slightly as he clenched his teeth. “A ward failed. They had hired a warder, cheap, part-time, to replace the old dwarf I was meant to take over from. He had little training. Little knowledge. Three years, provisionally licensed, but,” Grak rubbed at his nose with the back of his hand. “Darili Irid was deep beneath the surface. There were complex wards to shape the flow of air, to keep it clean. We used processes that were dangerous. When the ward failed, the air fouled, quickly.”
    >
    >“Oh,” I said. “Your father … ?”
    >
    >“Everyone,” said Grak.
    >
    >“Oh,” I said again. “Shit. That’s,” I folded my hands in my lap instead of saying more. It was horrifying, for a start. I had questions about how such a thing could even happen, what safety checks had failed, what alarms had been silent or just not installed, but before I could put my foot in my mouth, I realized those were the questions that Grak would have asked himself in the days and weeks after he’d learned it had happened. He wasn’t telling me so I could diagnose the problem, or propose a solution. “Can I -- how many?”
    >
    >“Two thousand, three hundred, forty-six,” said Grak. “Everyone.”

      Specifically, this bit:

      > By the early 1970s, many mainframes acquired interactive user terminals operating as timesharing computers, supporting hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing. Users gained access through keyboard/typewriter terminals and specialized text terminal CRT displays with integral keyboards, or later from personal computers equipped with terminal emulation software. By the 1980s, many mainframes supported graphic display terminals, and terminal emulation, but not graphical user interfaces. This form of end-user computing became obsolete in the 1990s due to the advent of personal computers provided with GUIs.

    Unfortunately, the .mobi converter that AO3 uses can't handle files past a certain size (for unknown-to-me reasons), and this isn't going to be fixed in the near future. Easiest method right now to get a .mobi that Kindle can handle is to [download Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/download), load in the .epub, then convert it to .mobi.

      Yeah... Didn't think about the fact that he'd just have done that at the first opportunity.

      Though I'm not sure it is enough. Even if you could edit out all trades of a heroin addiction from a former junkie and make him as clean as someone who never used, he could still get hooked again if forcefully fed heroin a few times. And leveling up is described as better than any drug by orders of magnitude, and increasing with every new level. It could well be that all Spirit can do is not requiring him to tune his "level up" value every morning.

      In fact, in chapter 135 (IIRC) he even says he had to find a workaround by using Spirit to strangle his connection to the memory of extacy caused by all the previous level ups. The next time he levels could form a brand new memory, requiring him to be wrestled down again.

- u/nytelios:
  ```
  So much heartgripping emotions in the past few updates and it was immensely gratifying to see Grak and Amaryllis' personal dramas surface in a fashion that Joon can no longer brush aside 'cause low SOC.  I felt like his new insight into SOC's true value is giving a shape to the endgame approach (namely, overpowered Loyalty bonuses and companions) and what I think is the overall game's intended theme - forming positive, deeper relationships in spite of trauma/grief and learning to rely on others in hard times*. SOC's rise would also be a wonderfully ironic dig at dump stat memes and typical D&D games. The DPS-build synergy munchkining is always fun, but character-building and little poignant details is what really does it for me. I'm unashamedly hoping those >!2-3.5 books left!< suffer heinously from the ninety-nine rule.

  \* I read [this article a while ago that fit so snugly into my belief in the game-as-therapy](https://old.reddit.com/r/science/comments/9mh3ig/psychiatrists_are_using_vr_to_submerge_patients/). This game wouldn't meet a million ethical principles, but who knows what psychotherapy will look like post-singularity.

  That aside, the one thing that's stuck with me lately is Amaryllis and silly reflections on determinism in romance. I admit to being borderline paranoid of her since the start because of her manipulative streak, but the latest (heartbreaking) revelations on her love for Joon weirdly left me simultaneously melancholic and hopeful about her existence. When Vervain was alleged to be a DMPC, I thought there was a small non-zero (creepy) chance that she was one as a DM mindfuck, but now I consider her a DMNPC (an NPC that the DM crosses some lines in creation/manipulation so that it feels like she was "created" with a tacked-on explicit purpose). AFAIK, Amaryllis isn't aware that Joon perceives her as the epitome of beauty (i.e. definitive proof of DMNPC-hood), but she's still in this limbo where she was likely "built" to pair with Joon yet at the last moment the DM stepped back and said "compatibilism, bitches! you get free will!" I try to imagine what purpose/romance-by-design is like and one part of me recoils and rebels at the farcical "choosing" with such a fundamental value rigging and another part sneers with "well, where are your complaints about oxytocin and biology? if it makes you happy, do it." Honestly, I've never been sold on the Amaryllis-Joon ship (part of it is rebelling against the obvious bait), but I am rooting for Mary's happiness, which she deserves, if only for Cypress' sake. What strangely gives me the greatest hope is the throwaway line on dwarven romances: 

  > which was much more about mutual understanding, intellectual compatibility, and close intimacy than it was about the physical.

  Some random thoughts:

  What happens if Grak tries to walk through the bottle? I was thinking he could simply lead the Doe through, but I'm guessing they'd probably hit glass. 

  Due for a respec soon-ish if the 100/28 math is retroactive, all that gold would easily put Gold Magic as one of Joon's strongest abilities given that he has both Essentialism/Spirit to strangle the call of gold. If only Grak isn't against it, which could be vaguely possible given his redirection from material penance into saving the world.

  That was such a sneaky and silly reference to Threadbare. Belly button lint and anise \*eyeroll*. Not that cafeteria-food-subsisting teenagers would know, but anise is amazing in some meat dishes.
