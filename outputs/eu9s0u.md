Sorry for anyone who woke up today looking forward to reading the final chapters of *Mother of Learning*!

You will have to console yourself with the news that it's only one more week of waiting instead of another month.

  Statistically speaking, unlikely. But oh well, can't act entitled over a free awesome story..

    I bet he really tries to get it out for Groundhog Day.

  I really hope it gets released 2-2  because that's Groundhog day and that would be neat.

  Appreciate the progress update, and I'm happy that the ending isn't being rushed out before it's ready.

  It's better this way. February 2nd is Groundhog Day.

  Update from Patreon:

  **1 Week Delay**

  I think I can say with some certainty now that I work better with a concrete target date as my goal... even if I don't actually meet it. My writing went a lot better than it did previously - the chapter that had been giving me a great deal of headaches is half-way done and I have a solid plan so there should hopefully be less rewrites and discarded sections.

  My dear readers are doubtlessly less pleased than me with this result, since they still don't get any new chapters and I've delayed things yet again... but what can I say? I'm glad I have such a patient audience, willing to wait literal months for me to finally wrap up the story.

  The new target date is **February 2nd**, one week from now.

  Wait, final? Is it wrapping up? I haven't been following it but Mother of Learning is on my short list of stories to check out.
  ```

  - u/Iconochasm:
    ```
    Supposedly the final release will be a batch of all the remaining chapters.
    ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Start reading. It's pretty long.

  ("Consolidate" means to gather together into one, usually stronger or firmer, whole. You probably meant "console", which means to give comfort for grief and/or disappointment.)

    Whoops. I shouldn't type when sleepy....

    Thanks.
    ```

- u/Green0Photon:
  ```
  Tbh, I don't care if takes another month or two. I'm sure the final chapters are going to be amazing, and *I really need time to do a reread*.
  ```

- u/Reply_or_Not:
  ```
  Iâ€™m super hopeful that he actually gets it out tonight!
  ```

- u/NestorDempster:
  ```
  Any final bets, probabilities, hypothesis, or guesses as to stuff that is going to happen?
  ```

  - u/SansFinalGuardian:
    ```
    they'll keep extending the hiatus daily with increments in accord with the harmonic series' terms + 1 and leave the fic in the middle of the climax forever.
    ```
