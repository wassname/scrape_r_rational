    I'd agree with this. Bean is a genius and no one else figures out what he figures out, and the reader can't follow along. Achilles is "evil" and not sympathetic or understandable besides being evil. I think this is more a supersmart character beating everyone by virtue of the author declaring they are a genius and giving them the answers than anything in-universe. Or any application of rational thought in universe.

      Definitely, the *Ender* series had pretty good worldbuilding, but it wasn't *rational* worldbuilding.

  Idk, this counts, right? An even-more-rationalist version of *Ender's Game*?

    I think so. Discussion probably won't get far outside of people who have already read the book, but I don't see why not.

    Edit: Actually it's looking more like this doesn't belong so much.
