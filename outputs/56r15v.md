## [DC][RT][Book] Orconomics

### Post:

You know those [D&D Economics posts](http://www.critical-hits.com/blog/category/critical-hits/columns/dungeonomics/) that come up from time to time here? [Orconomics](https://smile.amazon.com/Orconomics-Satire-Dark-Profit-Saga-ebook/dp/B00O2NDJ2M/) is a novel based on the same idea. It's a standard D&D style fantasy world, but with actual thought behind the economy. 

I just read the book in a single sitting, and it feels like the sort of thing that would happen if Michael Lewis (the author of *The Big Short*), GRRM, and Terry Pratchett decided to write a book together. It's not quite as good as any of those authors on a technical level, but there's clear influences in style and tone.  

It's a really good short read and very much the sort of thing I think this subreddit will enjoy. 

To go through the checklist: 

*  Most things seem to have plausible reasons. There's no deus ex machina for important characters in tough binds. 
* All of the characters are consistent, there's no idiot ball, though there are some idiots. 
* Factions are defined by their values and how those values interact with the economic systems of their world plays a key role in conflicts that develop. This entire aspect of the world-building is very well done, everyone has reasons for what they're doing and nobody is just doing things for the Evulz. 
* The economic rules of the world are sane and consistent. Other systems, like magic, seem like they're sane but it's not well enough developed to be sure. Magic in particular is likely to be one of those systems that is underspecified enough that there is a likely plausible consistent system that we'll never find the details of. More Patrick Rothfuss than Brandon Sanderson. 

My main gripes: 

* The protag seems just a shade shy of level 1 intelligent, while most of the villains seem to be at least that smart. I suspect this is the sort of thing that just means there's room for character development in future books, but it is a wee bit frustrating as a reader. 
* Some of the foreshadowing is a bit heavy handed, and being that far ahead of the main characters just means that you can see possible trainwrecks coming from further on. 
* This is apparently the first in a series, and there's a large number of threads left hanging. My main complaint here is that I want to read[ the next book but it's not out yet](http://www.jzacharypike.com/books/SonOfALiche/). 



Other Notes: 

* The author likes their puns. Or at least backronyms. It's very clearly a satire of tabletop gaming and has a tongue in cheek tone. I enjoyed this but YMMV.
* The main characters are bad at communicating. This isn't a problem for me since immature adults do exist, but again YMMV. Again, likely fodder for further future character development. 
* Honestly, in a lot of ways this feels like a really topical commentary on both economic events and race relations. I really like this, but YMMV.

  Just read it. It was a fun read and I agree with most of your points. Would have been better if the foreshadowing was a bit less heavy handed but as it is, it's a very good book.
