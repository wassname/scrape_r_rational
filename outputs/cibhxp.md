## Just finished reading Luminosity. Feel cheated.

### Post:

What follows will probably be a rant. Spoilers for Luminosity and the general direction of Pact ahead.

So, after you finish a fic, you know how you can summarize it in a generic way and find out what "groove" the story fits? The most well known is probably the hero's journey. Protagonist from humble background finds out he is special → is hunted by some sinister force → finds out how to use his powers, achieves character growth, makes allies, faces hardships → finally triumphs over the evil force, leading to a happy or bittersweet ending.

Very cliche, true, but enjoyable. And there are other such formulas, in fantasy, science fiction, romance, etc.

You can play with these formulas, of course, or just make a new one. What I've noticed in some rational and rational adjacent fiction, though, is formulas that are not enjoyable at all. And worse, you only realise it when you're already invested. Stories with no payoff.

Let's take Luminosity as an example. It reads somewhat like this. We get in the head of a likeable, introspective, rational protagonist. → Major change happens in her life. Changes species, finds love. → Nothing major happens for a lot of words. There are one or two minor conflicts. → Main character overreaches, makes some shortsighted choices. → Predictably, (mostly) everything she loves is destroyed. Angst follows. The end.

Is it a realistic outcome? Sure, I guess. Do I want to read it? No. There is no payoff. No choice the protagonist made ever ended up mattering, except for her mistake. You can write a story about anyone. It can be about a prisoner of war, getting tortured for 600 pages straight, without managing to do anything in the end. It has happened, it is deffinitely realistic. But why would I want to read it, or write it for that matter?

Now that I am talking about constant torture, let's take Wildbow as another example. Pact can be summarized as this: The protagonist is playing a high stakes game of Texas hold'em poker. However, the dealer has decided to only deal him out twos and sevens. No matter how well he plays, he can never win. We read about his constant stream of defeats and his angst until inevitably he loses everything. The end.

Am I being somewhat uncharitable? Probably. Still, I think that is the bigger picture of the work. And Pact would be amazing if the plot was about anything else - the writing, the worldbuilding, they are truly excellent. Instead, it is about a man getting beaten down for a few thousand pages.

It's not like a story like that can't be done. The [Son of Suns trilogy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/SonOfSunsTrilogy) is one of my favorite works of fiction, and for a lot of it's length it is literally torture porn. But the protagonist has to get up in the end, be clever or persistent, and actually achieve something. Else why are we reading about him, when we could have been reading about anyone else?

I suppose my question is, why do people write stories like this? I do know that a lot of people find them enjoyable. I just want to know why.

  It ends tragically to set up conflict for the sequel--you gotta read both to get the whole story.

  The biggest thing to keep in mind is that Luminosity is a two-parter, and its downbeat ending is meant to be understood in terms of the existence of its sequel. Looking at Luminosity alone is like looking at The Empire Strikes Back alone. 

  Without spoiling more than I have to, I'll give an assurance that Radiance ends very, very upbeat.

  As for stories which genuinely do work like this, though, IDK for sure. Maybe it's a literary form of BDSM. It's cathartic.

      More seriously, that doesn’t terribly affect my point. I might find it harder to understand someone who’s into ruined orgasms than someone who’s into masochism, but it’s still a thing that does *something* for some people, same as these stories. 

      (I might compare it to edging, though, actually, if we’re going full force on the sex analogy. There’s generally no release with these things, just a build up of tension—sexy pleasure in one case, stress in the other—and then the process stops and we move on with our lives.)

  In the case of Luminosity, the second part, Radiance, provides at least some of what you might have been seeking.

  To the bigger question:

  > I suppose my question is, why do people write stories like this? I do know that a lot of people find them enjoyable. I just want to know why.

  Part of it is just the joy of being transgressive. There's joy in telling a story that diverts from expectations, because it means that the story can be fresh and new, even if there are only one or two diversions. Stories that do things that stories aren't supposed to do have, by this metric, their own intrinsic worth.

  Part of it is that fiction can provoke lots of feelings, tragedy and sorrow being one of them, and some people enjoy ... well, maybe not being sad, but having their emotions provoked. People like to feel fear from horror stories, for example, because they like that feeling, even if it doesn't come with any catharsis at the end.

  Part of it is that fiction can *say something* about the world, and sometimes, you have to have a tragedy to do that. Sometimes the world ends. Sometimes a couple breaks up. Sometimes bad things happen and it's just *bad*, there's no recourse, there's no real resolution. An author might have to have a "bad" ending or torture a character in order to express the thing that they're trying to express, and a reader might be willing to accept that torture in order to "get" the message in this weird form of communication that is prose fiction.
  ```

  - u/foveros:
    ```
    I do agree with your point, and my problem isn't with tragedy per se, but mostly with despair. "Tragedy happens, what can we do about it?" Is a useful message.  "Tragedy happens, what can we do about it? Well, turns out that the answer is nothing! We can only be miserable forever." may also be useful message... in a short story. But residing in that character's head for an entire book is just torture.

    I suppose that the "You are immortal, but now get to be sad for the rest of time." in luminosity's ending just rubbed me the wrong way, but at least it ended after that. I might give the sequel a shot, now that I saw that the main character is different.
    ```

    - u/MayMaybeMaybeline:
      ```
      The sequel is actually a good bit better than the first book, at least in my opinion.
      ```

    - u/DuplexFields:
      ```
      > "You are immortal, but now get to be sad for the rest of time."

      That's the point of a lot of vampire fiction, to be fair.

      I have a suggestion. Read the "Flashes" slice-of-life vignettes compilation if you don't mind spoilers for "Radiance." You'll know by the end whether you'll want to read Radiance or not.
      ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Have you ever read actual tragedies? Like, not stories that have tragic parts, but a whole book (or whatever) that gets actually advertised as a "Tragedy" first and foremost. Or watched a theater rendition of an ancient tragedy for that matter.
      ```

- u/absolute-black:
  ```
  People are already commenting about luminosity, but Pact also has intriguing worldbuilding, fantastic characters, and a bittersweet conclusion. It was also explicitly a way for the author to learn and grow as a writer by playing with that kind of breakneck pacing. Pact has a lot of emotional depth beyond senseless grimdarkness.
  ```

  - u/sfinebyme:
    ```
    It's hard to understand or care about that emotional depth, though, when it's so unremittingly awful that by 2/3 of the way through, you just can't care anymore.

    With the exception of Evan, there wasn't a single character in Pact whose fate I cared about. Everyone is basically a giant asshole and even Blake felt like a weird, broken tabula rasa (on some level I get that that's the point), but I just found it hard to give a shit about him. *Especially* after the bit with the drains.

    And then there's supposed to be this huge, dramatic thing where like the fate of the town is in question, and I all I could think reading it was, "good, just get dragged to hell, Jacob's Bell, because you're a goblin-infested shithole and the world's better off without you."

    Having said that, the world-building itself is *wonderful*. I think I would've cared about literally any story OTHER than Blake and Rose Thorburn. Like the Astrologer - who was her mentor? What was that relationship? Why was she so broken up about his death? Were they lovers? What was their magic like? They sounded really fucking interesting.

    Even Peter Thorburn, giant asshole that he was, sounded like he had a more interesting backstory than the story we saw. What was going on in his life? How did he self-sabotage every meaningful relationship he had? Show him being clever and snarky and vaguely attractive because some poor girl thinks that kind of cynicism is "worldly" after her sheltered upbringing. But then the relationship sours and eventually they break up. She grows and learns and ends up a better person for it, but Peter's still stuck being a giant asshole, unconsciously carrying the Thorburn karmic debt.

    Or the Knights of the Basement? What's up with them? They sound freaking hilarious.

    Or what happens when a practitioner lies and becomes forsworn. We read a lot about it, but we never actually take that journey with someone. Let's read about a person we like who finds out the supernatural is real, does the ritual to become a practitioner, and then gets put in a situation where s/he has to lie or sacrifice something infinitely valuable to them. Then we follow as their life crumbles due to the lie. Somehow they make some huge sacrifice that earns redemption and some small measure of power returning to them, but the lie they originally told gets revealed anyway.

    Or, or, or...

  ```
  i mean pact isnt about *winning* we find out fairly early on >!that Blake is basically doomed to lose, and the end he manages to claw out still gets him his friends and his freedom. So even if he doesnt manage to get the Golden End(tm) its still a /Good End/. not to mention how along the way he definitely fucks some shit up.!<
  ```

- u/ToaKraka:
  ```
  Maybe the reader cares more about the world in general than about the protagonist in particular.

  See also the many alternate-history stories that have no protagonists at all (Flint and Turtledove notwithstanding). There's a scale from "literally nothing but dialog and you have to guess from context what the world looks like" to "the world is an afterthought that exists only as a background for the plot" to "the plot is just a fig leaf to allow the author to show off his worldbuilding skills" to ["literally just a description of the author's world"](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/).

- u/Flashbunny:
  ```
  To put more succinctly what others have already mentioned: Luminosity is effectively half a story, with Radiance being the second half. It doesn't have a happy ending because you haven't reached the ending yet.^*



  *Really, you're slap-bang in the middle of the "Darkest hour" story beat.
  ```

- u/pldl:
  ```
  I completely agree. Much of my enjoyment of rational or rational-adjacent fictions I choose to read comes from the rational part having intellectual payoffs that less rational fictions rarely do in an elaborate manner . There may be some awesome torture porn rational fic out there where there is a excellent happy ending, but I will not be the one to tell you about it. Unless there are small victories, small payoffs, reading the stories you describe is pure boredom. 

  Most of the tragedies I've enjoyed are shorter stories or not fiction, because I never expect a happy payoff in a short story, and history has the benefit of probably being true. 

  For me, a generalized "good" ending give a vague sense of hope and expansion, like there are infinite possibilities that could happen in their futures. A tragic ending usually feels like the exact opposite, and has the bad effect of retroactively making the entire story pointless (from a certain perspective).

  A positive ending that doesn't feel like a cop out or a deus ex machina is hard. A positive ending that feels like the characters earned it is hard.A positive ending where even though you expect it, it still felt at times like they might not have made it, is hard.
  A negative ending is easy. Shit happens. Shit happens all the time. It's always going to be easy to make a bad outcome realistic. 

  As for why people would write stories like this, it's because humans in general focus on the negative way more than the positive. And when people write, their stories often reflect some aspect of life. So it's not surprising sad stories get written when the author tries to ground the story to reality in some way.

  >No matter how well he plays, he can never win. 

  >it is about a man getting beaten down for a few thousand pages.

  It's about different meaning of winning. In rational world you can not have absolute win, like become immortal supreme god of the universe. You can only optimize, get maximum number of points. You will die anyway but that doesn't mean you have to stop playing the game, the scores still count. The worse the odds the higher the scores. Both Pact and Worm protagonists scored pretty well.
  ```

  - u/himself_v:
    ```
    Yeah, I haven't read Pact so maybe it's different but Worm had this done well. It's a shounen where you're waiting for the protagonist to power up and she just excruciatingly doesn't. Well, she does, but not quite in a "BANKAI!" way. It never feels like she's a big deal. There are always gods and titans fighting with tsunamis in the background of this normal girl relying on bugs to maybe save a few of her friends.

    It changes so slowly that you don't notice by the time they're gathering half the city's superhuman force to apprehend her.
    ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  I predict you will be fully happy with the ending to the sequel, Radiance.  >!To me though, it swung things a bit too far the other way; Luminosity's ending made me feel desolate sadness and loss, but Radiance made me feel a bit cheated of any sense of loss at all; it's basically a "too perfect" happy ending that didn't feel fully earned. !<

  All stories have to choose to fall somewhere on the continuum of sad to happy endings. Dystopic novels like 1984 tend to have downer endings to drive their point home, and I think that makes sense because it fits the narrative theme of the story, but for me the best endings are never at one end or the other. A happy ending needs a note of loss or worry about the future, and a sad ending needs a note of hope.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Uhh Radiance ends with >!Edward no longer loving Elspeth and Elspeth no longer loving Bella!<, if I recall correctly the final words of the story are >!Elspeth being like “Yeah I don’t really love my mom anymore, but I’m reasonably certain that I’m happy”!<… there’s a good dose of bitter to go along with the sweet

    I do think the good guys had an unrealistic amount of help given their end goals, but the plot wrapping up too tidily isn’t the same as being too happy an ending.
    ```

  - u/DuplexFields:
    ```
    I accidentally read Flashes first, a series of vignettes that occur throughout the entire series, and it had spoilers for lots of things I didn't know were spoilers at the time. Whoops! But having read it and knowing the end from the start helped me get through the angst and tragedy of 90% of the prime stories.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  If you want a break from all the angst, grinder and general wallowing in despair, I highly recommend There is no Epic Loot here Only Puns. It is literally my favourite story ever including published works. Not exaggerating. The amount of happiness each chapter makes me feel is unparalleled. Only thing that really comes close in feel good factor is either Good Omens or Discworld.
  It also doesn't sacrifice any plot tension.

- u/FeepingCreature:

  Eventually I just found Pact funny. I think I stopped taking it seriously when Blake's new traumas started invalidating his earlier traumas.

- u/loonyphoenix:
  ```
  I agree, I didn't like the ending of Luminosity, but not just for that reason. One additional problem with it is that it's also not a logical consequence of the minor mistakes of the protagonist, but also quite a Diabolus ex Machina. It's been a while since I read it, but if I remember correctly, the reason everything went to hell was some kind one in a billion coincidence. (Some specific and already plot-relevant person turned out to be Bella's singer?) Like, what am I supposed to learn from that? You can't protect from colossal misfortune. Sure, it could happen, but a Diabolus ex Machina is even less satisfying as an ending than a Deus ex Machina. And the reason, I think, you pointed out well: it doesn't feel like there is payoff.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    \> (Some specific and already plot-relevant person turned out to be Bella's singer?)

    No, that wasn't it. >!You're thinking of an early event in the sequel. The reason everything fell apart in Luminosity was because Bella awakened the whole wolf tribe, which then proceeded to do what the wolves do, namely kill trespassing vampires, and as soon as word of this got out, other vampires came over and hammered them. Quite logical, really.!<
    ```

- u/earnestadmission:
  ```
  Pact is good, actually. Watching someone fight the establishment is fun and worthwhile regardless of the ending. And it’s a breath of fresh air to have a protagonist that doesn’t win simply because they have the “mandate of heaven” or “chosen one” backstory from day 1.
  ```

- u/Diggsi:
  ```
  I felt similar afterwards, but one thing that I came to enjoy overtime was how it stands as a counter to a lot of rationalist fic. A lot of the heroes on rat fic get away with things just because they've thought about them a lot. This ending shows that just because you're trying to be clever doesn't mean you'll get handed a favourable outcome.
  ```

- u/RMcD94:
  ```
  You want to read it because it's different and ensures that there is tension in other works you read because you can't be sure it's not that kind of book.

  I'm also more surprised that people here are this shocked that other people like to consume different media.

  It's like superhero fans who never want anyone to die.
  ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  I dunno if you are on the right subforum for dunking on tragedies.  Like, our whole deal is that we want the simulationism to be gud, yeah?  Like, nothing in the tags off on the right side are like 'the ending must be happy, yo'.
