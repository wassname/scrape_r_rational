    I'm curious what her response is going to be when they actually show up with Grey Hunter eggs. She seemed pretty unflappable, but two unknown teenagers with vast magical skills showing up outside her undetectable residence with items she wanted but had yet to request from them should merit some reaction. I guess they could bring Lukav or Kael along, since she's somewhat familiar with them, Alanic too, I wonder?

    It would be funny if the eggs weren't an ingredient for some potion or ritual, but just something she really wanted to try eating.

    Did that one simulacra of Zorian's turn into some sort of gun design enthusiast? It sounds like it started with normal anti-personnel rifle and now is playing with some huge magic-assisted anti-materiel rifle. The only job for the golems will be to make sure the eggs don't get crushed, because it's going to have absurd firepower enough on its own.
    ```

      One use of grey hunter eggs would be to farm them. I don't think that's Silverlake's plan, but it could be worthwhile after the timeloop ends, even if just as a source of enhancement potions. Security would be tricky; I think individual alchemical metal cells with airlocks for feeding, all inside a pocket dimension, could be viable.
      ```

      - u/MacDancer:
        ```
        Oh God imagine a little army of those things. They don't even have to be trained, just release 'em out of their pocket dimension and laugh...
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Farm them inside the orb?
          ```

          - u/MacDancer:
            ```
            I was thinking of Silverware making a new pocket dimension similar to the one she keeps her house in, but that works too... Hordes of angry death-spiders on command is probably more valuable than a broken down old palace. 

            Of course,  competent mages probably use anti-dimensionalism wards in combat...
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              How many mages are "competent" by Xvim standards? Because that's who trained Zorian in teleport warding.
              ```

            - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:
              ```
              I just did a literal spit-take when I read "Silverware". Thanks for that. :P

        > even if they do try to peg it as it comes out the cave entrance.

        Why wait that long? Just put it on a magical platform, lower it into the gully, and fire into the hole. Based on the trap simulacrum's experience, it'll sense them coming, but they should still have a moment of time to fire before it emerges.

        Myself, I'm curious about what kind of ammunition they plan to load up that will be suitably devastating to the spider without damaging the eggs.
        ```

        - u/I_Hump_Rainbowz:
          ```
          Armor piercing could work. It would not explode outwards as much and would sufficiently kill a giant armored spider.
          ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > I'm curious what her response is going to be when they actually show up with Grey Hunter eggs.

      Probably she'll demand explanations and they'll tell her about the loop. Zorian already tried it, but she wasn't interested in talking until he brought her the eggs.

  ```
  Little over 2 and a half years left... The end is nigh... I'll miss this story.
  Good to see they're still improving.
  ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    Haha yes. And if you count the black rooms, they still have 5 years left. Or did they have access to one or two additional black rooms? Which means they still have 7.5--10 years.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      They have access to more black rooms, but much less efficient ones. One stretches a day into 13 days, the other into 5, IIRC. Useful, but much less. Also less psychologically hazardous.
      ```

      - u/dbenc:
        ```
        Well it was implied they might reverse engineer the black room tech and apply it to the pocket dimension, so who knows how long subjectively they might have left.
        ```

      well, in this chapter, they spent nine of those restarts, so they're now have 33 remaining.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Isn't it 9 restarts since they found out where the orb was located?
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          Ah, that's true.

          > Nine restarts had passed since the restart in which Zach and Zorian had found where the orb of the first emperor was located. 

          They found the orb, which was seven or so chapters. Since then, nine restarts have passed. The first of those restarts began this chapter and there were 42 restarts remaining, then eight more, so 34, not 33.
          ```

  - u/monkyyy0:
    ```
    They still need to kill red robe post breakout, presumably he is able to kill qi, break into a royal treasury, and teleport across continents. Expect a several year war after the time loop
    ```

    - u/ENTERTAIN_ME_DAMNIT:
      ```
      But Red Robe didn't need the key to get out - he just left, which is why Z+Z are stuck in this situation.  

      I seem to recall Zach saying that RR isn't much without the litch backing him up, so I would be very surprised if RR can stand up to Z+Z on his (?) own.  

      That said, RR won't be on their own. They'll have an army behind them, this time with summoned demons. I can only imagine that there will be quite a lot of combat once they break out of the loop.
      ```

      - u/GeraldVanHeer:
        ```
        I think that's something everyone's discounting. The Ibasans aren't just going to have undead, QI, controlled monsters, and war trolls...

        They're gonna have demons.

        *Lots* of demons.

        And neither Zach nor Zorian know a whole lot about how to deal with those.
        ```

        - u/ENTERTAIN_ME_DAMNIT:
          ```
          Alanic does. At least, I think he does.  

          The problem I see there is that Zorian might have straight-up forgot about the demons.  
          As I recall, they've only been mentioned once - and no one has sought advice on how to combat them.
          ```

          - u/GeraldVanHeer:
            ```
            I assume Alanic knows a fair bit, but I think both of them have largely forgotten an entire third of the invasion will be based in demons.

            With the artillery barrage, regardless of red robe's support, aiming for the churches and temples.

        Nah, it hasn't been ignored since then. Zorian speculated about Zach being able to fight it in chapter 56, they took a solid swing at it in chapter 63, and they were using it to make potions of mana perception in chapter 65.
        ```

        - u/aeschenkarnos:

        ```

- u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
  ```
  Ok, scenes in this chapter (of 7,600 words) were:

  > 1\. capturing the orb by themselves (1,304 words \ 17%)

  > 2\. chasing off the hydra, some speculations, and some banter (1,422 \ 18%)

  > 3\. getting one new infobit from the Guardian, tying up two “loose ends” that I remember being discussed here (spamming  of the Guardian with questions, and bringing the Orb inside a Black room) (2,453 \ 32%)

  > 4\. the public’s eye on Kael and on Imaya's house (457 \ 6%)

  > 5\. meeting with a fire elemental (638 \ 8%)

  > 6\. the House Letova heist (582 \ 7%)

  > 7\. fast-forward sequence for nine restarts (804 \ 10%)

  I feel like #4, #5, #6 were too interesting to get so little screentime. To me, they felt rushed in the manner that the later chapters of [*The Games We Play*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RyuugisTheGamesWePlay) have felt rushed. 

  How would you go about fixing that if you wanted to make them bigger, though? Move them to the next chapter to allocate them more space? Make #2 and #3 the shorter scenes? Something else?

  ---

  >on the usage of portable canons against the spider

  Are they supposed to be used as tools of area-denial and shepherding the spider in the wanted direction? Because if they directly hit her from those rifles, the eggs won’t be likely to survive.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I expect that we will see the results of those various endeavors in coming chapters. Pretty typical pattern.

    And I just started reading The Games We Play a few days ago...I'll have to see if I feel the same way about it.

    I'm rather curious about what kind of payload will be in the cannon. Regular bullets would be problematic, indeed, although it's likely that at least a few eggs would survive. OTOH, a sufficiently potent magical warhead might work well, especially if they can get a shot off while it's still in its lair.
    ```

  - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
    ```
    I agree: I wish there had been significantly more time spent on all of these scenes. Unfortunately, this book is full of situations that were summarized. This, imo, is a major shortcoming of the book. I feel these instances are usually done for the sake of pacing and lack of time for the author, so I can sympathize. It would be great if the book gets published and these scenes all get fully fleshed out.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      :D Publication would more likely be a *barrier* to fleshing things out. Publishers don't want to use extra paper on each copy. They likely wouldn't even touch MoL, as a debut work, without drastically shortening it.

      I think the time-skips are OK. Sometimes there just isn't enough new stuff happening to warrant detailed description.
      ```

      - u/Cheese_Ninja:
        ```
        I've always felt that each arc of MoL lends itself fairly well to being its own book, such that a published version would be a trilogy. There would be plenty of opportunity to flesh things out, but in this case, I feel like this timeskip would still be useful. There's just too much minutiae that could be seen as distracting from the overall story. Their actual goals are much more limited than their eventual skillsets would indicate: 

        1. Leave the loop.

        2. Neutralize RR.

        3. Prevent the Ibasen attack.
        3a.Neutralize the necromancer mayor.
        3b.Neutralize the Dragon Cultists in and around Cyoria.

        Everything else is just a bonus they were forced to acquire to achieve their goals.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Sure, MoL could become a trilogy. Unfortunately, as I understand it, the rule of thumb is that publishers won't touch a debut novel over about 100k words, tops - and each arc is double that.

          There might be more flexibility with ebooks, I'm not sure.

          I'd love to see it published, but I'd be sad to see it cut down by 50% to fit.

        Silverlake is almost certainly a master of dimensionalism, significantly surpassing even Xvim (who doesn't know much about pocket dimensions), and IMO is very likely to be one of the Immortal Eleven. Both of which are a big deal for ZZ.

            ```
            Short version: 11 mages who brewed and drank a potion of agelessness. They can be killed (Oganj killed two), but won't die of natural causes.

            I strongly suspect Silverlake is one of them. 90 years old but looks half of that: no white hairs, no missing teeth, no trembling or weakness in her hands when butchering the salamander. Advanced magical knowledge, apparently including pocket dimensions, which even Xvim doesn't know much about, but especially with *potions*. Doesn't give out her last name. If the Eleven will be part of the story at all, she's hands-down the best candidate.

    I had speculated in the past that Veyers transformation into Red Robe involved possession or merging by some sort of ancient fire elemental that was actually old enough to remember the Sovereign Gate. Or at the very least that his bloodline awakening ritual was flawed in some way to open him up malicious influences.

    Ways the fire Elemental Salamander Kilnfather thing would relate to Veyers' bloodline awakening ritual:

    *Yellow, slitted eyes

    *Fire magic

    *Elemental spirit infused into living beings

    *Hostile tendencies

    I'm still assuming he's RR, because of Zach's memory wipe and the timing and thoroughness of his disappearance. But there are still a ton of unknowns.

    About 1.75-1.85 years, if they managed to use all 3 of the Black Rooms for an extra 45 days each loop. I've got to wonder if Zorian is going to hit his peak mana capacity soon. 

    I'm not sure how much Zach's skills are improving, but Zorian seems to have made considerable progress over that skip. And they're even richer now? If they don't blow all their money on anti-Ibasen invasion measures and paying back people who helped them upon leaving the loop, I think they're set for life.

    I feel like once they leave the loop and figure out RR, RR isn't going to be much of a match, even if Zorian doesn't get the doubled mana capacity upon leaving the loop that Zach has currently.
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  If Controller powers really are tied to the Key pieces, then that means Red Robe had one.

  Of course, we only saw that near the end of an iteration, and it was an iteration where he had an idea that there were other loopers, so it's not surprising that he would have collected a suitable weapon. What would be more interesting is his confrontation with Zorian at the very beginning of the next iteration, before he had time to assault the treasury or visit another continent (and he certainly didn't fight QI). Unfortunately, the fact that he didn't use purple beams there doesn't tell us much, since he wanted information, so he likely wouldn't have used them on Zorian whether he could or not.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    I kinda forgot, what key was in the royal treasury? Was it the knife? If so, that would hint at Red Robe's very high status in noble hierarchy.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      It was the dagger, yes; Zorian came close enough to confirm that. Whether the dagger controls the loop ejection power is speculative, though.
      ```

- u/RMcD94:

  Not sure how to particularly pinpoint it but I feel like the writing quality this episode was not up to the usual superb par I have come to expect of this series.
  ```

  - u/aeschenkarnos:

    It's the grammar. Normally he does a couple of proofreading passes to tighten it up, however I expect he didn't get time for this chapter.

  I've been so hungry for this chapter to arrive.

  * how did the Chameleon drakes get the God Touched Hydra to materialise out of the orb? They don't have a handy soul marker. This is the third instance of a group being able to activate a special gateway. The first being the Silent Gateway adepts activating the Bakora gates, the next was the red robed fanatics whom were releasing the Primorial with their chanting. Here it is a group of lizards and a pocket dimension. 

  * What does this tell us about the nature of this mechanic? Next question is, does this help Z&Z in any way? 

  * nice to see a return of the magical rifle

  * Lots of good info about portable dimensions. 

  * Zorian using soul magic as a means to telepathically communicate with his simulacrum. You guys predicted it!

  * The Grey Hunter. How does a magical canon *not* destroy the babies on her belly. So what's the plan, Zorian? Now I can't wait for the *next* chapter.

  * Next up: Silverlake, and back to Pocket Dimensions. This is why I enjoy this story do much!

    > how did the Chameleon drakes get the God Touched Hydra to materialise out of the orb? They don't have a handy soul marker.

    It should be the hydra which has the power to jump in and out of the orb. Maybe the hydra was even created at the same time as the orb as it's guardian. The only thing the drakes did was make a lot of noise to call the hydra out.
    ```

    - u/Fomalhaut-b:
      ```
      Thanks! That makes so much more sense. Especially since Z&Z were concerned that the Hydra would pop out of the orb at any time.
      ```

  - u/spanj:
    ```
    That depends on if the projectile is explosive or not. A non explosive projectile should only pulverize within a reasonable range of the projectile's diameter. So shoot it's head or upper body.
    ```

- u/DTravers:
  ```
  >"It is," Zorian agreed. "And maybe there really was such a place inside the orb, once. But teleport platforms and recall stones don't last all that long without regular maintenance. Not for centuries, at least. And there is a chance that something inside actively broke the mechanism. Say, **a giant rampaging hydra**…"

  >"I didn't think of that," Zach scowled, reclaiming the orb again. "We just don't–"

  >When Zach deployed the orb the fourth time, there was a much louder whooshing sound than usual and the two of them suddenly found themselves standing next to **a gigantic pissed-off hydra**. It immediately pounced on them with an unearthly roar.

  I am very disappointed that these descriptions aren't the same.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    They aren't the same circumstances. "Rampaging" would just be the hydra doing its thing as usual, whereas in this case, if we assume that the hydra was aware of the repeated deployments - like someone repeatedly opening and closing your front door - it was specifically irritated.

    Don't know how it was able to leave the orb, though. Probably related to the fact that it can teleport.
    ```

  - u/Mr-Mister:

- u/gvsmirnov:
  ```
  [Chapter 39](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/39/Mother-of-Learning):

  > "It's a trick that some alteration experts use if they want to be able to **create complex objects without carrying the originals with them**. They use a spell to record the blueprint of an object, **storing it inside their heads**, then simply use that blueprint to **create copies of the object whenever it strikes their fancy**. Well, provided they have the correct raw materials. In your case, that would be a blank book of similar dimensions to what you're trying to copy and a bottle of ink."

  Zorian gave up this method of storing information after learning the more efficient memory packaging technique. But combining this with the Orb's vast storage capacity seems to allow for munchkining lots of stuff across restarts?

  I could not find any indication of whether or not the objects can be magical. But taking the word "blueprint" optimistically, we can expect that with good shaping abilities and enough crystalized mana, it should be possible to instantiate various magical objects in arbitrary numbers. On the other hand, Zorian does not seem to be using this method (at least, explicitly) for creating things, so maybe it only works for mundane stuff.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    You may have a good point there. Zorian has focused on using his headspace efficiently, so he has just stored blueprints for notebooks, and later just for the ink on them. But with practically unlimited space, yeah, he should be able to store blueprints for instantly fabricating golems, or his prototype magic cannon.

    You're probably right about magic items needing more work, though. You can't craft a spell formula without being able to actually cast the spell. In light of the latest world building post, I'd say that the mage has to direct mana into the formula in much the same way as directing mana into the elements of a regular spell.

    So he could likely fabricate golem bodies en masse, but he'd have to individually craft the animation cores, which was always the hardest job.

  I'm pretty sure nobody here needs it, but for any new readers out there I've updated by ebook builds up to chapter 73: https://github.com/asdkant/bookify-mol/releases

    Yeah, but they put way more points into Wisdom and Intelligence than they did in Charisma.

  someone posted a link to this story on r/hfy 


  after finally getting through it all...wow, that was good, can't wait for the next chapter.


  Are there any other hidden gems like this I have been missing out on?

    Well, [there's the recommendation thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki), but personally, I'd recommend Worm
    ```

      Eh, Worm has had a lot of effort put in and it shows, but it's extremely long, and dark/gritty enough that it ended up being too much of a slog for me. I gave up at...probably about halfway?

      If you want a superhero story, I like [Doc Future](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) better, though book 3 is still in-progress.

  i got to say i found this chapter unusually boring, think it might be because there was almost no dialogue in the entire chapter so it just felt like an extensive monologue.

  new knowledge are the relic powers. and that is nice.

  found it odd that they'd spend time building houses, i mean even as a mage, just magic-ing up a house should be really costly mana wise so i can't really see Zorian building anything that way.

  i hope the next chapter carry a bit more umph.

    The house building was mostly to have fun I think.  They have to do that every now and then.

    It reminded me or my days playing Minecraft. Blocky houses built in the wilderness that no one will ever find again.
