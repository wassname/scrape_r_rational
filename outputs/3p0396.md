  Normally they say "don't read the comments". In this case, read the comments. And hurry up before qntm takes the page down.

  The discussion of extensions to ZFC and how you can't actually use simple axiom schemas to extend ZFC to avoid Gödel2 was really useful.

    Why would Sam do that? Just in case, I've archived the page [here](https://archive.is/KCpif).

    Anyway, this doesn't seem like immediately /r/rational material, but it ties in enough with last year's GEB readthrough that I think it belongs. If I were you, I'd've tagged it with [GEB] to signify that link, but I digress.

      Sorry, but I'm never going to get around to posting the discussion on the last three chapters.

      I consulate myself with the potentially false statement that if anyone managed to make it that far with me, then they probably finished the last three chapters without me.

  >This may or may not be the first part of a project to abridge Douglas Hofstadter's "Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid", which somehow takes hundreds of pages to cover the same material.

  I am entirely offended! If Hofstadter had merely wanted to cover Gödel's results, he would have had the book he read as a teenager republished!

    Yeh, I thought that was a bit excessive too.
