  *Awesome* chapter.  Orochimaru continues to wreck all of the good guy's plans, and I'm loving him for it.  

  Despite Anko's secret pleasure at Hinata's emigration, there's no way that this isn't a crushing blow to their plans.  Orochimaru continues to play one level higher than her, and their remaining options just dropped way down.  His utter competence is great.

  Honestly, I would be totally fine if they ended up joining Sound, or at least the genin, and work with Orochimaru to expand it and save the Elemental Nations from destruction (presumably the Republic, but the Akatsuki and other related things are huge threats as well). I just want to see more of this guy and the nation he's made.

    Thank you!  I'm glad he's coming off so well.

    It's actually a bit of a problem; of all the characters in the story, Orochimaru is the most fun to write and, I suspect, the most fun to read.  I'm actually considering writing a sequel to this with him as the main character, but I don't think it would work -- he's just too powerful on every axis.

      Maybe center the sequel around his heir, in the distant future?

      I think this is the exact reason Lord Vetinari never got his own discworld book, and I think using Orochimaru in the same role works astoundingly well.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        "The same role" being what, exactly?

          Perhaps I should expound a bit- Vetinari served as the ultimate necessity in discworld- he was ruthless, firm, cunningly peerless, and unquestionably the most powerful man in Ahnk-Morpolk, and yet no one wanted him taken down because it was obvious that he was running things better than anyone else could. I feel like you have set Orochimaru up in much the same way- he is a bit more blatant about his disregard for morality, but only when it actually serves a purpose for advancing his manipulations. His is obviously a capable leader, working to further the better of his people, and graced with the lack of qualms that such betterment calls for. Both are men of exceptional skill and intellect, both attempting to run a society and doing it better than their peers, and both playing a very, very long game. As such, they are very wonderful for propelling the plot- if they ask someone to do something, they always have the upper hand to ensure that it is done, and eventually the person usually discovers that what they were asked to do actually forwards their own goals as well- just because you use your tools, that doesn't mean you mistreat them, a well maintained tool will last ever so much longer.

  More fun with Orochimaru.

    Yes.

    *Fun...*

  four and a half hours of sleep

  Shino's mouth still

  My, I didn't expect Orochimaru to do what he did when it came to recruiting Hinata. He has quite the plans laid out, I see, and comes off as a lot more intelligent and overall likable than his canon counterpart in my eyes. Why'd he take Naruto with him to repair the gas lines or stop the fires, though? The clones the boy can make being used as firemen?

    No matter how much I proofread, there's always something.  Thanks; fixed.

    > My, I didn't expect Orochimaru to do what he did when it came to recruiting Hinata. He has quite the plans laid out, I see, and comes off as a lot more intelligent and overall likable than his canon counterpart in my eyes. 

    Thanks.  He's still psychotic, of course.  He just killed a lot of Konoha nin and his own agents for the sole purpose of adding verisimilitude to Hinata's dead clone.

    > Why'd he take Naruto with him to repair the gas lines or stop the fires, though? The clones the boy can make being used as firemen?

    Nope.  In fact, he's going to tell Naruto not to make any clones.

      It felt more like the higher-level plan here was to kill Hiashi, and Hinata was just a justification for prioritizing the execution of one of his prepared gambits toward that goal.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        True, but he wouldn't have been activating that set of plans right now if it weren't for her.

  ```
  > your father used the Kaiten jutsu to block the actual balls

  I'm assuming balls is supposed to be blast?

  I liked this chapter a lot. Orochimaru again shines through in an awesomely sociopathic manner. His dismissal of Naruto's usual attitude was also fairly priceless. I would've laughed super hard if I didn't think Naruto was about to get beaten brutally for disrespect, mostly due to how Anko reacted.
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    No, it is balls. A claymore mine fires dozens of steel balls as projectiles. The concussion blast wave still got through and plastered Hiashi against a wall.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Goddammit! You mean it's not some formless explosion? Call of Duty has been lying to me for years!!!

  ```
  Biological cloning seems a bit overpowered. Where are Orochimarus secret elite troops with both Byakugan and Sharingan? Anko's skill can not be cloned, same with Shino and the Nine Tail. But what does he really need Hinata for?

  - u/Mraedis:
    ```
    Clone. steal eyes?

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Yep.

    > Biological cloning seems a bit overpowered.

    Yep. And yet, it's canon.

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  Okay, I finally read the chapter, and I have to say. Orochimaru probably blew that gas line up himself. I doubt anything he said to Naruto in that last part was true; he knew perfectly well that Naruto wouldn't agree.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Blowing up a gas line in his own city and killing his own people?!  I'm shocked that you think that's something the Snake Sannin would do!  Shocked!  Shocked, I tell you!
