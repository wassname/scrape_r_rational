  I'm not a mod, but it sounds like something that would get positive votes in the wednesday worldbuilding thread if you are just talking about a setting you want to write.  If you have a story I'd just say post a link and a brief description. If you are looking to extrapolate what a SIAI might deduce I'd say be very very careful and look up the advice, I think it's from Iceman the original author of Friendship is Optimal, on writing CelestAI for the greater Optimalverse setting.

  What's the context? If it's for a story then the Wednesday worldbuilding thread would be best. Maybe start the discussion here, and someone can direct you to the best location for it if that location isn't here? "Would this be a good place for that discussion?" is kind of vague and not much to work from.
