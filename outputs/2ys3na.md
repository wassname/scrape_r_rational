  Teleportation. Nanoswarms that reform in various locations.

  Fantasy races. Uplifted animals that speak.

  Necromancy. Implants in the brain and body to make corpses move.

  Resurrection. Reformation of damaged brains.

  Prophesies. Predictions by AI oracles.

  Good vs Evil. A internet rating system where people can rate people good/ evil lawful/chaotic and bar certain items, artifacts, and locations to them.

  Paladin equipment. Items such as weapons of light (lasers) that are set to only hurt or heal people of a particular alignment.

  Ents. Sentient, engineered plants.

  The Mahou Shoujo could have their brains uploaded into computers so that damage to their body isn't debilitating.
  Utility fog
  Rapid prototyping
  Super strong and light materials, although if the main character isn't a material scientist, he might not notice.

  Can you give us an idea of exactly how advanced the technology is?

  well this really really reminds me of the tabletop rpg [Numenera](http://www.numenera.com/what-is-numenera/) only it's not 80yrs after singularity but a couple decades after the 8th!! singularity. its great to play and though it feels like a typical medieval setting the wizards are called nanos and get their power by interfacing (either by genetic luck or careful study) to the pervasive machinery that lies dormant in the planet, many enemies are clearly the result of biotech or something more esoteric, and fighters can get armor and weapons from iron, steel or impossible to duplicate ceramic and plastics (not that they know those terms)  if you want to read some of it (i'd recomend the magic item list) here's the corebook https://www.dropbox.com/s/4hvcbl27eyfisw3/Numenera%20Corebook.pdf?dl=0

  There are no stars in the night sky. [They're actually still there, just hidden behind a nearly-opaque wall of solar collectors. Optional ring of satellites around the Earth's equator - rings might be a bit of a sci-fi hint.]

  There's a known afterlife, you can talk to the people there, and sometimes bring them back. [Automatic uploading of the dead, any who don't choose true death and can't cope with leaving Earth get a virtual afterlife to enjoy.]

  Medicinal plants that are far more potent than anything existing today. A properly mixed magic potion can regrow lost limbs. [Genetic engineering and/or nanomagic.]

  Sentient animals and humanoids.

  Telepathic communication and thought-controlled magic items. Remote viewing.

  The aftermath of various poorly-phrased "wishes" or favours granted by powerful entities - unageing children who wished for eternal youth, monsters that will first interrogate you to determine if you could be an enemy of their master, whatever the hell the result is of someone saying "I wish the events of the last three days had never happened!", things like that.

    Nah.  The Powers That Be don't allow that kind of thing.  They actually quite fully understand what you're asking for when you pray to them, but they really don't like being called-on as gods, so they'll tend to answer prayers in a way that *does* fulfill anything genuinely good in the prayer/request/wish, while also seriously trolling the person who thought to just *ask for stuff* instead of accomplishing things for themselves.

    >* When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.

  Have you looked into nanotechnology? Eric drexlers "machines of creation" or if you want a really good fictional account thats still absolutely physically possible in a high tech scenario look at neal stephensons "diamond age". 

  Basically, if you have mature nanotech, ... a lot goes. A book of nanostuff, contains an entire interactive wikipedia/learning programms, freefloating nanites in the air can have an area-denying effect (think fog of death), enormous energy density and low weight/high strenght materials allow for all manners of small, intelligent drones. That same level on nanotech if used on the body allows telepathy, vampire-like immunity to damage etc etc. 
  Normal looking swords that are nano-chainsaws and go trough everything- the limit imposed by physics is sky-high. 
  To give an analogy: right now in computer/chip-manufacturing we are in the range of double-digit (10-99) nanometre tech; and you could blow ANYONES mind with what you can do with that level computer technology. The processor in any PC or smartphone is the smallest tiny thing! Take your average smartphone. Most of the space in it is battery+frame+display.  Now take it ten, twenty steps further; you have single digit nanometre tech, and not just for CPUs, but also for all the accompanying electronics, capacitors, resistors, the battery itself, the display, the frame- you have a tiny razor, light as a feather, running time in terms of weeks, hundreds of times more power than the laptop you or I am writing on right now, dozens, hundreds of sensors...

    It's fun to read through the D&D spell list for everything that mentions "undead", and think "how are nanites being used to accomplish this." It actually makes some thematic bits make more sense, too; the ability of undead to be universally "turned" only really makes sense if the nanites used are all a sort of lost tech that can't be upgraded, and has known backdoors for other magic-users to crack.

    It also makes "lich" just another word for "transhuman." :)
