  Neither one has used an aspect, and Akua hasn't even tried mucking with Cat's soul yet. I smell shenanigans.

    Akua follows through the gate. No way she doesn't. She might even **Claim** it.
    ```

  - u/BlitzBasic:
    ```
    Didn't Cat already use two aspects? **Fall** in Chapter 63 to get through the army and **Break** in Chapter 65 (okay, that one was during an illusion, so she probably still has it).
    ```

  General thoughts in chronological order of reading: 

  * The point about Akua being lonely as a result of the insane competitiveness of her upbringing was interesting. You can almost treat her as a tragic figure, emotionally stunted and grasping for the only way she knows of to get approval, power and respect. Makes me a think of those kids who are trained from five to be athletes, dancers or piano prodigies. They end up kinda messed up in the head. It seems like her mother raised her a similar way but with power and magic as the focus. Even her father who seems to have an almost normal relationship of love and affection with her mainly related to her by teaching magic. 


  *	The idea of the “Fourfold Crossing” test as being cleansing also gives us a hint of how she thinks. Seems like a lot of her ideology is a kind of refined self interest. Where being true to yourself means not having contradictions, even if that means being 100% evil its still being true to who you are. Cat regardless of her circumstances made the same choice in all the scenarios. Seemingly black didn’t in his? 

  *	““That’s your first mistake,” I said. “Thinking I’m only now beginning.”” Reminds me of a certain famous moment in Watchmen. 


  *	Nice to see Cat actually having prepared for a fight by thinking about tactics and benefitting from that. Makes a nice contrast to what was alluded to earlier about her habit of recklessness. Only really works because Akua is so predictable though. Against a smarter enemy it wouldn’t. Akua always thinks of herself as the only clever one.

    I think one of the most interesting point of the "Fourfold Crossing" is the contrary of what you think. You may say Cat acts in a kind of self interest, but the three other "what if" show something really important. No matter the way she could have choose (General/hero/underground lady), Callow DOES end very very badly. Her current path was as she said, the best way for the country. When she said things about how the things would go with Praes kicked out, one could say "yeah, but it's all theorical, it's not sure".

    Now, she IS sure. She saw the other possibilities. Sure that her way is definitely the best way she could have done things, and thus, she will even more believe she is doing the right thing. It can be good, or it can be bad. But she will even less hesitate, now.

      That depends entirely on how the crossing works. It has be based in something and it seems like it using the target's mind as a basis to generate hypothetical scenarios instead of literally being able to traverse time in multiple directions seems much more likely. And if it is based off the target's mind then biases could play a pretty big role in determining how the pathways flow and ultimately converge.

Cat regardless of her circumstances made the same choice in all the scenarios. Seemingly black didn’t in his? 

    option A, Black just didn't know, and if Cat hadn't known, she wouldn't have stabbed either. Stabbing seems logical for at least 2 out 4, Cat herself and White Knight, General was also in it for Callow, but what about the Toltaker, seems out of character for her?

    option B. Black's 4 lives are vastly more different than Cat's, if they diverge at a similar point (So black doesn't become the Black Knight) then presumably in one life he lead the life of a farmer or something in that vein. 

    option C. Blacks pragmatic nature lead him to bargain or cut his losses in several worlds.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      In every challenge, she lost some part of her body to another foe's attempt on her life.

      Out of character for the Tolltaker?

      No, Akua had not paid for her power the same way.  The Tolltaker was just collecting her due, with interest.
      ```

- u/M3mentoMori:

  Waiting until Wednesday is gonna kill me.

  EDIT: So, the Fourfold Crossing was the trial, and Akua herself is the monster. Interesting. It's pretty likely that this tenth exchange will be the pivot.

  My theory, here, is that Akua will attempt to usurp Cat's Winter powers (like in the Crossing-vision), but the fact that Cat is in Arcadia will fuck with that. Cat herself mused within the last few chapters that fey were weaker (for lack of a better term) in Creation because they need to fit into reality.

  Edit2: Found the passage I was thinking of.
  > I should have understood it properly then, because what were even the most powerful of the fae but Named with the weight of millennia behind them? It was why they’d lost. Because when they’d come down to Creation, to this messy battlefield of ours, they’d been forced to fashion themselves into people. In Arcadia, they were perfect: not in the sense of flawlessness, no, but in the way that a cog in a machine fit exactly the form and purpose it was meant for. A god made to masquerade as a mortal had the fatal flaw of perfection removed from the perfect.

  While Cat isn't truly fey, she is closer than a regular person, so I don't think she'll get a huge power boost (though she effectively has 2 Names right now) from this, but she should get some benefit from it.
  ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  At this point Cat is pretty much the living embodiment of the saying, 'If violence doesn't solve your problems, you didn't use enough.'

  Or in this case, goblinfire.
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    "Violence is not the answer.  Violence is the *question*.  The answer is 'yes'."
    ```

- u/Flamesmcgee:
  ```
  So errr... Cat, all things said, remains a villain. It is widely accepted that villains who leave their enemies to certain death will find them coming back at the least opportune moment, having impossibly escaped the perfect trap.

  In order words, what the heck is she thinking?
  ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    This isn't about killing her, it's about breaking her seat of power (see chapter 62 Verse) so that fight 2 will go much more smoothly.
    ```

  - u/leakycauldron:
    ```
    Akua follows her through the gate.
    ```

  - u/Oaden:
    ```
    Presumably its a trap to bait Akua into arcadia, where Cat is stronger? Like, lead her from her own domain to Cat's

    An interesting tidbit is that stories are stronger for fae, and stronger in arcadia. And now we go into arcadia, with Cat being part fae. That should probably come into play at some point
    ```

  - u/Kachajal:
    ```
    >  It is widely accepted that villains who leave their enemies to certain death will find them coming back at the least opportune moment, having impossibly escaped the perfect trap.

    Not exactly. It's widely accepted that *heroes* left to certain death will come back at the least opportune moment. Hell, the current White Knight explicitly calls on this at one point (saying "We couldn't possibly survive this! Let's do it!").

    Akua definitely isn't playing a hero role here, and she definitely doesn't have the providence that heroes do. 

    This is not to say that Akua is definitely dead and gone (someone guessed her **claim**ing the portal to Arcadia, and I find that likely - if she even needs to). Just that Cat isn't insane for doing this against another villain.
    ```

- u/aerocarbon:
  ```
  > “Is this the sum of you, Catherine Foundling?” Akua said. “Were you so disbelieving of victory you decided to burn us both?”

  > “Do you ever get tired?” I smiled rudely. “You know, of being wrong all the time.”

  Brilliant.

  Cat was dominating from the very beginning. Diabolist never stood a chance.

  Nice use of the villainous monologue. I was actually shaking my head at the beginning, because you'd think that Cat would know better than to launch into a monologue -  Akua even hangs a lampshade on it, pointing it out - but, evidently, Cat was playing chess while Akua was playing checkers.

  She should have killed Black as soon as he failed the trial. Classic blunder, and a massive mistake from someone who was thus far admirably avoiding the idiot ball. I wonder why she didn't, actually.

  Akua's as good as dead now. Neither of them have used an aspect, but I have a feeling that Cat's prepared for that eventuality. The only question is, what is Cat's endgame with stepping into Arcadia?
  ```

  - u/M3mentoMori:
    ```
    I don't think Black fell victim to the trial here, but earlier, before/during the Conquest. She refers to him being under for months, and Apprentice pulling him out. Masego has been the Hierophant for a while, and is outside of the city anyway.
    ```

    - u/nick012000:
      ```
      It might have been during the Praesi Civil War that saw Malicia rise to power, actually, before Warlock killed his mentor.

      Alternately, it might have been the work of one of the Callowan heroes that Black's spent 20 years stomping into the ground.
      ```

      - u/M3mentoMori:
        ```
        Since Diabolist referred to Wekesa as 'the Apprentice', it'd have to be before the fight that gave Warlock his epithet.

        The fact that Akua knows about and uses it points to it being Praesi (she seems the type to disdain using non-praesi workings), so probably during the civil war. I just said 'before/during' to give a general time period.
        ```

    - u/aerocarbon:
      ```
      Oh, that makes loads more sense.
      ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  Ah, goblinfire. It's been too long :D

  I suspect Akua going to Arcadia is part of Cat's plan. First, it's where Cat's power is at its strongest and, more importantly, stories and narratives hold more weight there. Since Squire is much more adept at manipulating the story being in Arcadia would be a huge benefit to her.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    and also removing akua from her seat of power.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Akua has another escape option, into the Hells. Although she may not be able to use that for the villainous drawback of being undone by your own creations.
    ```

- u/TheEngineer923:
  ```
  The Queen of Summer promised safe passage for Squire and all she commands. Diabolist would be stupid to follow Squire into Arcadia. There's a non zero possibility that the Fae make take the field as well since Summer still has a bone to pick with the Diabolist. However, the alternative is burning to death so  she might not have a choice in the matter. 

  See kids? This is why we put always have a means of a quick exit in our evil lairs, a teleport array to Taipei of something. So suicidally insane pyromaniac Squires don't succeed in burning us to death.
  ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    If not Arcadia, she should be able to open one into a hell.
    ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  Gods Below and Everburning, that was the perfect insult to leave on

  edit: and I want credit for totally fucking calling how she was going to escape.  Not that I told anyone this or recorded it in any form that could be verified, but I want credit nonetheless.

    Mega multipost you got there.

    Also, remember that torching his arcane sanctum with Goblinfire was how the Wandering Bard's band was planning on dealing with Warlock.

      Got a huge internet bug when I posted, and I couldn't check it out until now. Sorry.

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  Or, 
  "Akua is telling a story of grand villainy; cosmic usurpation, the complete and despairing victory over all."
  while
  "Cat is killing people who need to be dead."
  ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  You know, for a chapter that starts the direct phase of confrontation between Squire and Diabolist, it's surprisingly self-contained. No references to next parts of their respective plans, exact number of turns proclaimed at the outset of the fight and all of them carried out by the end of it, even the beginning of the next chapter (Akua having to follow to Arcadia, where Cat has more power, story not limited by the laws of Creation and fairies that can't touch her) is relatively clear.

  The only loose thread remaining is, well, Black. Who's still stuck in Liesse, with whatever Akua's monster is, most of her mages and wight. And Thief with about a company of sappers freshly out of goblinfire.

  I gingerly hope for another interlude, now from PoV of the remains of Diabolist's staff, in style of what TVTropes would call Mook Horror Show.
  ```

- u/sharikak54:
  ```
  I'm guessing Cat's plan is to escape into Arcadia and (hopefully) leave behind Ubua's body to burn.  

  In that case, how is she planning to keep Black alive?  My guess would be that he is also in Liesse (or at least accessible from there, hmm, he might not be in Liesse, but still, there's a chance that he is there); meaning the goblinfire would engulf him as well, correct?  

  Also, although it is somewhat likely that Ubua's phylactery is hidden somewhere in her city of power, it's not _that_ likely and so I don't think I can hope for it getting destroyed here :(  Any thoughts on how Ubua is going to come back if she doesn't get in on Cat's gate?
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    That can't be her plan, everyone knows that if you leave a villain to burn they just come back disfigured and more powerful. Someone else suggested that the point is to destroy her seat of power. If Akua has to fight her in Arcadia instead of in her meticulously prepared throne room, she'll be at a disadvantage.
    ```
