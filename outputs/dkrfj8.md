## Pyrebound 9.2

A look in the inner sanctum, such as it is ...

Pyrebound is a fantasy serial set in a Mesopotamian-flavored world where everything goes wrong on a regular basis.  Our hero is one of the many little people who takes the brunt of it all.  A better blurb may be found [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/) and the story starts [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thanks for checking it out!

  I've seen this posted a few times. Can anyone who's read it give me their opinion?

    I'd say it's pretty good and fairly interesting. It feels very unique, worldbuilding wise. None of the characters are rationalists or anything like that, but everyone acts according to their own wants and needs, even those are sometimes opaque. 

    The main character is a young man thrown in over his head, so he doesn't always make optimal choices, but they do feel like authentic choices. I'd say read it, maybe the first 3-4 chapters, and see how you like it.

    The world is pretty neat.  The protagonist is sympathetic, disciplined, and smart.  There's a lot of potential in this story.  I look forward to seeing where it goes.

    The worldbuilding is extremely unique, fun, and generally high quality. 

    The writing is good, not literary fiction but it doesn't hold the book back. The characters are interesting, the dialogue is pretty solid, and the description is too. 

    The plot is also very fun, jetting us across the map as the readers get to explore the varied and lush setting.

    I don't think the story is likely to rival PGTE or MoL quite yet but I am definitely a regular reader and very interested in any other work the author does. I find it very promising and hope the author continues his work.

    The author Brayton Cole has independently published a book called "The Curse of Life". 

    > In my case, it took me ten years and two thousand pages before I had a novel I was satisfied with.

    >The setting came from C.S. Lewis's "Out of the Silent Planet." I liked the bizarre topography of his Mars, but by populating it with sinless beings he missed out on all the weird geopolitical implications.

    >The curse of life itself came from a meditation on the way fantasy tropes get repackaged as sci-fi--orcs to Klingons, distant realms to exotic planets, et cetera. It occurred to me that magic is always . . . still just magic, basically, but renamed as "ESP" or "psionics" or some such. I challenged myself to come up with a sciencey-sounding form of magic, then chased the implications. It went from there.

    I might pick it up. /u/RedSheepCole do you have any other fiction I can read?

      Oops, I've been outed!  Not that I was trying to hide it, exactly.  TCoL is something I feel conflicted about.  I don't think it's bad, per se, but I kinda rushed it because I was impatient to finally get something published.  I'd made up my mind to write it in epistolary format, even though that format is stunningly ill-suited for exposition (which a fantasy/sci-fi author has to do a lot of).  I discovered halfway through that I was having to make a lot of suboptimal storytelling choices to accommodate the format, but I was too proud and stubborn to go back and rewrite it.

      What came out was a story set in a world every bit as inventive as Pyrebound's, and with a certain charm (it's told from three perspectives, each of which brings something different to the table), but extremely hard to follow.  Some people enjoy it anyway, and I won't unpublish it, but I don't think it's my best work so I don't go out of my way to flog it. 

      There's more story to tell there, and I'd like to go back and do it right someday (with a less corny title, to boot).  Maybe as a serial.  I'll have to wait until I've got a better feel for how I want to tell it.  It'll be a very different story when I do.  For now, the e-book is free to read for anybody with Amazon Prime, so feel free to check it out that way.

      To finally answer your question: not really.  TCOL came out in 2017, and every prior project was a bit of a fizzle.

        If you are ever thinking of rewriting it or something, I would love to beta read for you or something. Have you ever thought about setting up a patreon?
        ```

        - u/RedSheepCole:
          ```
          I feel weird about Patreon for various reasons.  If I did rewrite it, I'd do it after finishing Pyrebound sometime next year (and then publishing the edited version of PB as a print book with supplements).  I am not a very productive writer, in terms of word count per day, and I have a lot of stuff going on in my non-author life.
          ```

    The plot suffers from a bad case of everyone but the main character being selfish callous assholes with arbitrary grudges against him.

    Otherwise, the writing and worldbuilding is solid. The pacing is okay, the main character is interesting enough, especially in those rare moments he gets some agency.
