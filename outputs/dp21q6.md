  I may be missing something, but Cat now has:

  Persian horse archers, Roman Imperial heavy armored legions, Medieval French heavy horse with magic resistance, and mage lines trained by the most skilled living mage bar none (whether Masego is the most powerful is up for debate, but with Warlock dead the text seems pretty confident that Masego and Akua are the most skilled/knowledgeable).

  And that's just her conventional military!

  She has the patronage of goddesses of theft and destruction, close relationships with the two foremost living heroes of the age, a close relationship with the longtime companion of the greatest mortal evil, and the worshipful service of an entire race of magic stealthkill boogeymen. 

  And a reputation as a breaker, that leads people to just not even bother to fight when it's JUST HER.

    she also have fierce loyalty from the engineer & skullduggery crew, due to being the "Matron in human flesh"
    ```

      ```
      You're right, I totally forgot that she has the foremost living siege engineer...

    ```
    WOG says that Masego (before, you know) and the Witch both having valid claim to the title of 3rd best sorcerer on Calernia, behind the Dead King and the Forever King (the elven ruler). So not quite the best, but close.
    ```

    - u/bubby_cat2:
      ```
      best mortal sorceror, I guess. 
      Thanks for the WoG, I hadn't heard that
      ```

        ```
        We don't actually know for sure, as the WOG states they are only fourth place and the third place, right after the elven king, has never appeared in the series so far.

        So we don't know if this third placed is mortal or not.
        ```

    - u/Razorhead:
      ```
      They're fourth place, actually. WOG said the third strongest has never appeared on screen so far.

        I stand corrected. Huh. I wonder who it is.
        ```

        - u/Iconochasm:
          ```
          My guess?  One of the Titans.

  Ah Tyrant even from beyond the grave still messing with people's plans, and showing peeps the platinum rule of villainy, always look out for your own good.
  ```

- u/TrebarTilonai:
  ```
  Cat now has:  


  The Order of the Arsonist Assholes (Robber + Sappers)  
  The Order of the Broken Bells (Callowan Knights)  
  The Order of the Cracked Carpels (Helikean Kataphraktoi)  
  The Order of the Darkest Drow (Drow, obviously)  
  The Order of the Elemental Evocators (Magelines with fireball/lightning rituals)
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    Prior to their exits from the story, she also used to have:

    The Order of the Fickle Fae (Larat and the Wild Hunt)    
    The Order of the Gallowborne Guard (Gallowborne)
    ```

    - u/TrebarTilonai:
      ```
      Yeah. I thought about including them but they are no longer part of the story.  


      ... but now I wish I'd just gone with it.

  ```
  Can someone remind me what the 'hats' for Nicae and Penthes are again?
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Nicae seems to have a dichotomy in the highest office of power between a Basileus from its royal line and a Strategos (more prominent and independent than a normal general, since Nicae is stuck between Ashur strangling their trade in the Samite gulf and Helike being Helike). Considering the origins of both those titles, Nicae is basically a mostly irrelevant Constantinople to Helike's early imperial Rome.

    Penthes is a trade city on the eastern branch of Wasaliti. Between the first Hierarch hailing from there and their rulers calling themselves Exarchs (literally the greek word for a province's governor under the Byzanthine empire), either their legitimacy is the one closest tied to the power structures of the League as a whole, or the Exarch is just a leftover title from the occupation of Malificent II that the nobles of the city now fight over. The city itself, however, seems to be removed from the others culturally: they ostensibly worship Gods Above, and Myrmidon was born there, but the Exarch was said to have chased her away; their language is obscure enough that between the heroes only Myrmidon and Rogue Sorcerer speak it. Overall, it seems that Anaxares was right to call Penthes "a knock-off Mercantis".

      I love you. Can I bother you with summaries of things that occasionally slip my mind?  


      P.S. I'm not being sarcastic. Just in case it needs clarifying xD
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        Sure: the whole reason I don't participate in the discussions as much anymore is that the other people on the Guide subreddit usually pick most of the details up anyway, I'm glad to be of help.
