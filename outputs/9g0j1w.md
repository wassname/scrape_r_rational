## Any stories where a superior decision theorist decommits some precommitments?

I just saw this meme and tried to think of good examples and none sprang to mind. I'll keep thinking and edit this post if I think of any.  


My mind kinda got stuck on Significant Digits, but that's more a case where HJPEV uses magic to heavily augment his precommitment powers to awesome effect.

  [A Modern Myth](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/) by Scott Alexander is what immediately sprang to mind. >!In this example, Prometheus is decommitting Hermes' precommitment.!<

    ```
    yeah, this scene is one of my favorites

      As an aside, f*** eagles.

  I don't really understand how you can decommit someone else's precommitments, I just read this as a joke?
  ```

  - u/chlorinecrown:

    I do think decommiting is generally harder than precommiting, such that a C rank precommiter would need an S rank decommiter to defeat them. (Gwern only has to hash his precommitment, EY would need to come up with some kind of novel backdoor in the hash function to win)

    In the classic example, imagine a game of chicken. Players speed towards each other in cars, and the first one to swerve loses. Obviously, if no one swerves, you both lose really hard.

    &#x200B;

    You can win by being the first one to throw your steering wheel out the window, credibly precommiting to not swerving, forcing your opponent to do so or die.

    &#x200B;

    Your opponent, the superior decision theorist, might predict this and reinforce your steering wheel somehow to make it so you don't have that option available to you.

    As far as I can tell the general cases of decommiting someone's precommitment are

    1. Take away their ability to signal precommitment (reinforce their steering wheel)
    2. Make it too expensive for them to uphold their precommitment (place their favorite person in the way of the car before they have a chance to throw away their steering wheel)
    3. Make it very cheap for them to defect from their commitment (fill their car with free steering wheels that snap right on and work perfectly)

    But I'm no decision theorist and I haven't spent that much time on this.

      When I saw the comment, my mind jumped to trying to play the inferior opponents' precommitments against each other such that they're forced to choose between them. For examples, we might look to fantasy stories involving Fae who must keep to the letter of their word. Something along these lines has probably happened in some tale before.
      ```

      - u/akaatnene:
        ```
        CÃº Chulainn comes to mind. His downfall was being forced to pick between violating his geas against eating dog meat or violating the taboo of refusing hospitality.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Damn, that's a good one.
          ```

- u/eroticas:
  ```
  Almost any broken promise would count. 

  Even mentioning it in this thread is a spoiler if you haven't read all of Yudkowsky's short stories already, but I think (title) >!three world's collide!< has pretty much this exact scene (of one character making a pre-commitment (bigger spoiler)>!on behalf of his spaceship crew and humanity as a whole!<, and a character which could reasonably be considered a superior decision theorist forcing him to break that pre-commitment (biggest spoiler) >!via mutiny!<

  ```
  In the meme, I think decommiter EY would have to have previously credibly convinced Gwern that that hash protocol does anything when it secretly just outputs a random sequence.
  ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    Just find a different interesting string that hashes to the same value.
    ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      The entire point of hash functions is that this is Not Easy.
      ```

      - u/Charlie___:
        ```
        Just need to do hashes 10^55 times faster than the bitcoin mining community :) Maybe being a superior decision theorist starts with building a Dyson sphere.
        ```

        - u/CCC_037:
          ```
          [](/rarityreally) If you can do hashes 10^55 times faster than the bitcoin mining community, then you probably have better things to do than invalidating a single precommitment hash.
          ```

- u/None:
  ```
  What does it mean to "decommit your precommitment"?
  ```

- u/TWOA1998:
  ```
  The waves arisen has an example of precommitment in the final fight of the series.
  ```

- u/akaltyn:
  ```
  I think EY is just shitposting
  ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  (Does it count as a precommitment if you can choose whether or not to reveal at all? What about having two keys which give oppisite messages when used on the same thing, or two opposite messages with the same hash..?)
  ```

  - u/imyourfoot:
    ```
    The main problem with obfuscated precommitments is that the predictor can simply reveal correct predictions and pretend incorrect ones haven't come to pass yet.  Unless the predictor provides a concrete deadline for their prediction to come true, I think the best policy is to simply treat obfuscated predictions as falsified until proven otherwise.

    Hash/encryption functions are designed to make finding collisions effectively impossible.  If you were able to find a collision like you describe, that would be proof that the function in question was insecure.
    ```

- u/tjhance:
  ```
  *Dr. Strangelove* is a good example about a group of people trying to decommit a precommitment, and more generally, of precommitments gone awry.
