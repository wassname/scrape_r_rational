  I just caught up and it seems solid. I am a little worried about whether it can manage to keep a good pace given the web serial format and the many main characters. But we'll see

    Cool!

    It's a fair concern, given the format. My main technique to address it is fairly copious outlining to ensure the story doesn't get sidetracked or drag. Basically everything from now until the end of Book 1 is planned out, and Books 2 through whatever will receive similar levels of planning as they go. Hopefully that will prove sufficient.

      Great! I'm excited to see where you take it!
