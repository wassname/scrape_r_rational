  One chapter in, suspect this is going to be another Thing That I Read.

  I'm not so sure about Pact. I expect it to be a good story, but perhaps not a story that fits this sub. Blake tends to trust on his instincts a lot ([which isn't necessarily bad](http://rationality.org/faq/#intuition)), but he does it in situations where he lacks the experience to have a solid intuition. 

  For instance, [Pact 1.7](#s " Checking on Barbatorem without properly reading up on what he was capable of was unnecessarily dangerous.") But maybe that's a route for character development. Wildbow is a good writer, he could pull it off.
