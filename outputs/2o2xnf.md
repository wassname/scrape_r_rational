  I think this gets at a lot of what I was thinking about when talking about *Star Trek* yesterday. If you see a replicator, and ask "Why doesn't the Federation replicate people?", or see a transporter and ask "Why doesn't the Federation just use transporter spoofing to make a second person?" the answer has to be something like:

  * It can't, because the Federation would have tried to do that as soon as the technology was in prototype stage.
  * It can, but it's so strongly taboo that no one does it.
  * It can, but the technology is tightly controlled by some entity.
  * It can, but there are technological problems that prevent it from being worthwhile (like single-bit errors).

  The answer *cannot* be "No one thought of it," at least, not if you want people to read and enjoy your fanfic. And in the Trekverse, where there are trillions of people with access to near infinite knowledge and resources, along with dozens of *other* cultures with divergent values, any munchkin attempt immediately raises the question of why it wasn't done before.

  [Here's](http://squid314.livejournal.com/275614.html) a blog post about how reality would be seen as unrealistic if judged to the same standard some people hold sci-fi to.  Seemed relevant.

    Also, check out this [related thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/2jq3zq/suppose_planet_earth_and_its_history_was_just/) in /r/worldbuilding about the "unrealistic" parts of Earth.

  Every time Eliezer goes on about how obvious the Dementors=Death thing is, I want to grab him and shake him and yell "They _suck the joy out of things_ you idiot how much more literal can Rowling get--"

  ^they ^can't ^even ^kill ^you

    They can Kiss you, rendering you braindead and therefore dead for all important purposes.
    ```

    - u/FeepingCreature:

      There is that. Though it's mechanically different enough from death that I don't think it could credibly be taken as an analogy for it either.
      ```

  - u/Bobertus:
    ```
    I think of the dementors as representing loss-of-value, of which death and depression would both be instances. Depression because you stop caring and because of anhedonia. Death, well, because without sentient beings to enjoy the world, the world doesn't have much value. Also, most humans value life very much.

    When HPMOR!Harry became demented, he didn't fall dead, he became a being with a utility function that assigns zero or less utility to everything.

    Oh. And you can heal from contact with dementors through chocolate. That's another point for depression.

    Yeah, I think Eliezer is just dead wrong about this one, and seems to get more caught up on their appearance than what they actually do. Why do happy thoughts fight off death? Why does death make your worse memories play out again and again? Why are there more of them when everything is gloomy and sad? Why does chocolate make you feel better? 

    [Also, my own head canon is that they absolutely can be destroyed by a concerted patronus charm, I know word of god is that they cannot be destroyed, but that's absolutely silly: in story its not actually clear if they can be destroyed or not]

    EDIT: it's worth noting that I have no real problem of them being death in hpmor, just in Eliezer claiming that they are obviously death.

  That is a pretty neat explanation of what rational fiction is all about I do have to say. And apparently writing it is the closest you can get to simulating the actual practice of science. One day rational fanfiction will be assigned by professors in place of term papers.

    That literally cannot happen soon enough

      It would stop being fun then.  As it is now, I am almost to the point of diminishing returns on the amount of fanfiction I read.  Imagine having to do reports and essays on the cultural implications of My Immortal and 30Hs.

    ```
    EMH is about markets; priced securities.  We're generalizing here to whether the European Central Bank is going to be sane and what kind of magic someone chooses to use in a fictional universe, and we probably need a new term for that.

      ```
      I would argue that there's a long tradition of using economic terms to describe social structures. Opportunity cost, specialization and demand are all economic terms, but there's no better terms to describe those things when they occur outside of economics. Maybe I just spend too much time with libertarians.
