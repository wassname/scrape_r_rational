## [META] Since this sub revolves around rationality, is it actually that smart to spend so much time reading and writing rational fiction?

### Post:

Disclaimer: I too spend a lot of time reading rational fiction (this is a throwaway account, I've been here since the beginning but I don't dare to post this with my main account)

I mean, some of these works are really, really long and even reading them takes a lot of time, and even more if you are writing them. I see these works more as a form of escapism, and not so much as something that would improve your rationality. This same question could be asked on any subreddit focused on fiction, but since this sub is about rationality, it's kinda ironic to adore rationality, and spend so much time on something which is kinda useless.

I get it that you can't act optimally 24/7, but I think there's a middle road somewhere.

How do you deal with this problem?

  Part of acting rationally (for me) is maximizing happiness. So on that front, I think creating and consuming rational fiction is a win. I could probably make some other arguments in favor of rational fiction, but they're tantamount to post facto justifications. I think that simply, "because I enjoy it" is enough. (I also think that in comparison to my other hobbies, writing is probably the most productive, given that something of at least marginal worth is created in the process.)

  Edit: I also receive money through Patreon, but that's the lesser reason for writing (for me). If I *really* wanted to make money from writing, I would probably work on polishing up my superhero erotica novel, since that's where the money is at. (I am aware that saying "money isn't really a motivating factor" is a really terrible way to get people to voluntarily give me money, but it's the truth. I *like* having patrons, and I smile when I see an e-mail come in, but that's much more for status/ego reasons than utility-of-money reasons.)

      I actually don't even know what rational erotica would look like. "Safe, sane, consensual" is a starting point, I guess. Experimentation? Optimization? I don't know. Perhaps by those standards it would be rational erotica.

      But if you have a bunch of teenagers getting superpowers and primary using them for sexual purposes instead of ... I don't know, saving the world or something, I think you're missing something of the "rational".

        Rational, not rationalist. The characters don't have to be TRYING to be consciously rational. I mean, I know I'm just parroting the sidebar, but having things happen for rational reasons instead of because of the force of plot, having conflicts and partnerships defined by beliefs and values instead of "good" and "evil", having the characters behave intelligently according to what they're aware of (or at least having narrative defense for their behaviors if it's something the reader would see is foolish), and having a consistent world are the defining characteristics of rational fiction.

        And honestly, these values applied to erotica could work VERY well.

                Quite the opposite. "They have sex because they're teenagers" is exactly the kind of rationalization that would be out of place.

                Being teenagers might be a valid reason for intimacy to escalate into sex more rapidly than other characters might, but getting into the scenario where that's a reasonable escalation definitely requires better writing than that.

        As soon as I read that question, I immediately thought of a candidate for an existing set of stories, [The Journal Entries](http://pendorwright.com/journals/) by Elf Sternberg (admittedly more rational than rationalist, and while science-fiction, extremely soft SF); plus the start of the background for an original story. 

        (... Okay, fine: Lowered robot costs and better conversational software leads to increased automation in many jobs, a not-very-successful job-protection measure mandates robots in human-replacing jobs must be 'clearly distinguishable' from humans, 'think of the children' morals leads most such robots to be sexless, one company experiments with a line of humanoid-animal chassis that include more anatomy, the protagonist manages to get hold of one that would otherwise be destroyed, and gets to work on jailbreaking the OS... and contrary to many other similar stories, this would /not/ a story about 'conscious' AI, but more about pareidolia and various of the basic drives that humans have evolved to have. ... If anyone wants to pick up this idea and run with it, go ahead, I'm still wrestling with my writing block.)

  In my case it's been pretty effective.  My progress went something like this:

  1. Be professional programmer in job that I hated
  1. Write for amusement
  1. Have someone link to me from /r/rational and tell me they had done so
  1. Discover and explore sub
  1. Start posting my stuff here
  1. Find that people actually enjoy reading my stuff
  1. Go full-time writer.  This has been enormously negative financially and so emotionally/creatively satisfying that I don't care.
  1. Try various creating-oriented websites, discover something that might be a market niche.  Am currently exploring, might start software business if it turns out to be so.

  So, yeah.  This sub has (indirectly) drastically improved the quality of my life and could possibly end up with me having a job that I enjoy and is financially worth it.

      Patreon is a successful business, meaning that it's a viable market.  The interface isn't great and things that I consider basic functionality are missing.  Customer service is also not all that it could be -- I've submitted multiple tickets and never gotten a human response in less than 24 hours.  It's also not complicated, so a replacement would be relatively straightforward to build.

      Right now I'm working out a requirements doc and evaluating whether I want to put in the effort to build it.  Given that I'm a Patreon creator, I could dogfood the product.  The real question is "can I build something that that Patreon couldn't incorporate quickly, and could I build it better enough to overcome first-mover advantage?"

        You know what I think internet REALLY needs?
        Universal and convenient micropayment system.
        There should be a universal way to pay for an article/video in one click(embeddable button on any page).
        It could be a paywall that gives you access to the article, or a tip-jar kind of donations. Imagine there could be a system that everybody uses, like patreon, and a person has to enter his credit card info only once, and he can pay/donate to his favorite articles all over the web. These could even be microdonations, like 50 cents, and function similar to a like button.

        Now that a lot of the people use adblock, ads are less and less viable, and this kind of system could be a solution. And it could totally compete with patreon, without straight up copying it's functionality. What do you think about that idea?

        I am working on a fiction hosting website, and I'm thinking about a perfect way to monetize the content for writers(that would be benefitial and convenient for both writers and readers). So far I figured that an ebook store and an Apple-music kind of subscriptions are the best way to go, but I am very curious about the alternatives. If you have some clever ideas on how to monetize writing or how to improve patreon - I will probably be an early adopter.

          No argument there. Unfortunately, it's *really hard*.  Lots of big names have taken a swing at it, and it hasn't caught on.  If you want to kick ideas around on Skype I'm glad to, but this isn't an easy fix.

    Peter Singer or someone else from the effective altruism group might say that you could have saved dozens of lives with your earlier job if you had given something like 10% of your salary to charity. Then he might say, is your personal well-being really more important than the lives of those people? What would you say to him?

    (Personally I don't care.)

    edit. If you're interested about Peter Singer's opinion on this, [this is a good article to start.](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/magazine/the-singer-solution-to-world-poverty.html) His views have gotten milder and more pragmatic on this issue, but at some point he said that if you want to be maximally ethical person you should work so hard, and give so much to charity that you're suffering at least as much as those you're trying to help.

      Not if he burns out, loses the job for underperforming, and then has to try to put his writer career in a bad financial situation.

      Resigning a job isn't actually destroying money, it just goes to someone else. Don't think you're morally obligated to optimize your life around other people refusing to be charitable.

        Not necessarily- It depends on how much value you create in that job.

        A programmer who drops out and becomes a monk, for instance, stops producing economic value and becomes a drain on the economy.

          Well, the monk still has to do business with the economy.  If the monk is completely self-sufficient (growing own food, etc) then he's not a drain on the economy.  If he's not self-sufficient then he somehow has to be putting enough value back into the system to support himself.  The one exception to this would be if he was on welfare, being supported at state expense, but typically you're only eligible for welfare if you're actively looking for work.

          - u/Empiricist_or_not:

            A lot of these arguments seem to be coming from the zero sum assumption that entertainers and monks do not contribute to economic output.  Conversely if you understand that people who generate recreational activities for others, be they authors, monks, amusement park attendants or actors, have a positive impact on the productivity of their serviced audience.  Arguably a zen Abbott or the author of a book, of any subject, that leaves many people more motivated could contribute more to society's productivity than an assembly line worker crafting screwdrivers or websites.

    This same type of critique was given about LW many years ago, and I think the same critique applies to this subreddit. If you read it, you might better understand what the problem is about:

    http://lesswrong.com/lw/2po/selfimprovement_or_shiny_distraction_why_less/

    I'm gonna quote the relevant sections, you might as well replace "Less Wrong" with "/r/rational" in the text and it would still apply relatively well:

    >Less Wrong is explicitly intended is to help people become more rational. -- Unfortunately, I think Less Wrong is a failure at instilling abilities-in-practice, and designed in a way that detracts from people's real-world performance.

    >Work: time spent acting in an instrumentally rational manner, ie forcing your attention towards the tasks you have consciously determined will be the most effective at achieving your consciously chosen goals, rather than allowing your mind to drift to what is shiny and fun.

    >What is the enemy of consciously directed attention?  It is shiny distraction.  And what is Less Wrong?  It is a blog, a succession of short fun posts with comments, most likely read when people wish to distract or entertain themselves, and tuned for producing shiny ideas which successfully distract and entertain people.  As Merlin Mann says: "Joining a Facebook group about creative productivity is like buying a chair about jogging".  Well, reading a blog to overcome akrasia IS joining a Facebook group about creative productivity.  It's the opposite of this classic piece of advice.

    >Unfortunately, in this framework, Less Wrong is probably of negative value to those who really want to become more rational.  I see it as a low-ROI activity whose shininess is tuned to attract the rationality community, and thus serves as the perfect distraction (rationality porn, rationality opium).  Many (most?) participants are allowing LW to grab their attention because it is fun and easy, and thus simultaneously distracting themselves from Work (reducing their overall Work time) while convincing themselves that this distraction is helping them to become more rational.  This reduces the chance that they will consciously Work towards rationality, since they feel they are already working towards that goal with their LW reading time.

    The writers here are ridiculously good, and consuming this type of fiction is about as close to wireheading as possible with current methods. Although since this sub is about fiction, and we all know that fiction is supposed to be fun, the problem might not be that big.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I can definitely agree with there being a system of perverse incentives, if you consider the "goal" of rational fiction to be education. The most upvoted stuff in /r/rational is going to be the stuff that's the most entertaining, not the stuff that tries its hardest to teach or instill rational values (or which is the best at doing so, especially since people are very bad at evaluating whether they've learned something useful).

      So with that said ... no, it's not rational to spend time reading here if you're trying to optimize for becoming more rational. It's probably the best place to be if you were going to read *anyway*, and want to optimize that reading for thoughtfulness and science.
      ```

    - u/LunarTulip:
      ```
      Your last paragraph pretty much sums up my viewpoint. I don't actually read rational fiction for the sake of becoming more rational; if it happens anyway (which it sometimes does), it's a nice side effect, but the main reason I'm in it is just for the good stories.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      That's a rather different criticism, though. This forum exists to help people find and disseminate fiction for enjoyment. LessWrong exists for people to discuss rationality and become more rational.

      I've found LessWrong to be something of a shithole. When I've discussed certain topics, specifically related to feminism, people started regurgitating stereotypes at me. I did the research. I responded with that research. I got more regurgitated stereotypes. I got annoyed at it and suggested that people should maybe do some research on their own. The consensus was that I didn't have enough karma to make suggestions and I was just being a whiny brat trying to shut down opposition, and that half a second of someone else's thought (if you can call it that) can be worth more than an hour of my research.
      ```

- u/raymestalez:
  ```
  I agree with other commenters in the thread that rational fiction is mostly about entertainment.

  "Rationality" part makes it more fun and enjoyable, but the goal here is to have fun, not to learn. Of course real textbooks in your field will always be better at teaching you things than fiction.

  But besides rationality, I also value new interesting ideas and creativity. And this is where rtf wins.

  Here's a post with some relevance to this topic: http://dogearedanddogtagged.com/2015/07/27/harry-potter-and-the-unwritten-epic-of-tomorrow/

  Short answer: rational fiction can be used to set up a self-sustaining reaction of motivation and energy that can THEN be turned toward actual, real progress in the larger world.  Like all things, you can go too far with it, and it can turn into navel-gazing, masturbation, and lotus eating.  But done in moderation, it can make you a better and more effective person than you would've been without it entirely.

- u/kairisika:

  It's only irrational if you believe that a person should, let alone is capable of, being engaged in actively productive things at every waking moment.  

  Most people believe that there is room for leisure time in life - to do something solely because you find it enjoyable to do, whether or not it does anything at all to benefit you or expand your mind.  If leisure time is an accepted thing, it is no better or worse to read enjoyable fiction, rational or otherwise, than to do any other form of enjoyable leisure.

  ```
  Having one's brain primed to take advantage of "munchkinable" opportunities in real life seems like something that is arguably high-value (provided those munchkinries are likely to be used for altruism, which rational fiction usually primes you for as well).

  That said, I haven't convinced myself of this being the most-optimal use of time. My reason for spending time on reading seems to be addiction/enjoyment/escapism, which seems to be time that would probably go to other less productive activities if I didn't spend it here. At the margin, I should probably cut my Netflix watching time first.

        I have. Even if you think you can't afford it, talk to [Rudi Hoffman](http://www.rudihoffman.com/). He'll discuss options with you, and at the very least you'll have an estimate on how much it would cost you.

        I'm currently spending between $3000 and $4000 for two people, but we could be spending a third of that. (I preferred Alcor over the Cryonics Institute for various reasons, but they're appreciably more expensive, plus I'm paying for more life insurance than needed.)

          $3000 per year?

          - u/None:
            ```
            Last I checked, the Cryonics Institute had a $120/year fee, plus you get life insurance worth $120k. My life insurance for $300,000 costs maybe $120/month. So you can probably pay less than $800 per year and get yourself covered with the Cryonics Institute. But again, talk to Rudi Hoffman.

    Look, judging by lifespans, I have a reasonable probability of living until around 2070.  If we've made no progress towards anything by then, and additionally found out nothing about *why* we couldn't make progress, I'll be *very* disappointed and just as *surprised*.

    But seriously, let's take over the world already.  I'm too mortal to waste my time on the world's shit.

      In 1979 many people including Robert Anton Wilson were making the same prediction about 2012..2018. I thought it optimistic but in 1979 I expected that we'd have a good lock on the problem by now. We don't. I am disappointed but by now no longer surprised.

        We don't?  The passage from symbolic logic to statistical learning theory is a *big deal*.

        >I am disappointed but by now no longer surprised.

        Fair enough.  I guess I just don't actually care enough to despair over eventually dying?  Sorry, I tend to feel that I should show other people a stronger will to live than I actually have most of the time.  Sometimes I worry I'm more like Kamina with his false bluster than Shimon with his genuine determination.
