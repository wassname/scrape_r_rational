## A rational story about a universe that runs on literary tropes? Is it possible?

### Post:

Would it be possible for a sufficiently intelligent AI to be able to create a continuous anime franchise so complex that it "takes on a life of its own"? What would that look like? Thoughts?

  Discworld runs on literary tropes, and it's pretty rational-ish.

  It's certainly possible, but so far I think the closest thing we've got is the anime crossover fanfic Sleeping With the Girls. It comes in two volumes:

  It's on hiatus, but I found it highly entertaining. Part of the premise is that each of the worlds runs on its own narrative logic, and interlopers from other worlds have the outside perspective needed to notice this. For instance, any plan you make in the Love Hina universe will blow up in your face in amusing ways -- so a smart character will lay plans that will advance his goals even if they go hilariously wrong.

    It's not on hiatus anymore. The author has started it back up over on Spacebattles.

      You get one million points. It is a great thing indeed to receive one million points! You have received one million points.

      I found the thread you're referring to, and *hooray:*

  Not just by making anime. It could simulate an anime universe perhaps, but a simulation like that could take any form.
