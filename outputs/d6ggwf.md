## [RT][C][HF][DC][TH][FF] Time Braid: "Sakura thought she was a capable kunoichi until she died in the Chuunin Exam. Now she's stuck in a loop, dying again and again while she struggles to understand her strange predicament. How hard can it be to pass one stupid test? Sakura/Naruto/Hinata"

  I like this story, even though I haven’t read the manga or watched the anime. Great fight scenes, and the story *goes places*. 

  I must make the Obligatory Sex Warning. So, so much sex, with basically every tag and trigger you can imagine. (Some may consider this a bonus.)

        is how it's meant to be parsed.

        This gets reposted in r/rational a fair bit. There's a lot of discussion of some things that seem to make it one of the subs guilty pleasures, but can often be summed up as "I like this lots, and a stack  of trigger warnings. ". A lot of the discussion beyond that about what's wrong with the story looks like outgroup vs outgroup discussions if you've seen it a few times.

  I have profoundly mixed feelings on this story. On the plus side, it’s completed, it hits a lot of my buttons (non naruto MC, timeloop, challenging plot, proactive protagonist), and it is a genuinely pretty good fusion of the settings.


  On the other hand, the story (and the narration, too, it’s not just unreliable narrator) is skeevy as hell, it is very much not rational, and it devolves into mindless power fantasy for quite frankly too long in between the good bits; I can appreciate some power fantasy, but it really ends up getting in the way of the story. There’s also an annoying amount of bashing, but at least some of that *is* unreliable narrator.

  Overall, a decent enough story but not one I’ve ever been able to get myself to reread.

  Interesting story, I really enjoyed it when I read it a year ago. Would recommend, as long as you're alright with a bit of _EDGY_.

  I think this is closer to munchkin fiction than rational fiction.  

  It's fun, though, and I also recommend [Perilous Waif](https://www.amazon.com/Perilous-Waif-Alice-Long-Book-ebook/dp/B01NBWXMP9) which I believe is by the same author.
  ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Yup. He also did the *Fimbulwinter* series.

    *Fimbulwinter* has a lot more power-up munchkinry. It's not *actually* litRPG but it's written like one. It's also an unabashed red-pill harem fantasy, which I found grating. I still enjoyed it enough to read the whole thing, but I suspect the average /r/rational reader wouldn't like it.

    &nbsp;

    *Perilous Waif* has some pretty good sci-fi worldbuilding. The premise is that AI only reaches human levels (+ there's some FTL stuff) but the rest of technology progresses at a good pace. So everything is made of 3D-printed nanomaterials and everyone can afford a half-dozen catgirl android slaves, but it's still a relatable pre-singularity society. 

    The story is essentially *Alita*, so if you liked that manga/movie and you're not bothered by some background sex slaves, I recommend it.

  I read it twice but it's magical realmy as stuff recommended here ever gets. Calling it a "sex warning" sort of hides all of the mindslave (is that the right term?) business.
  ```

  - u/redrach:
    ```
    For what it's worth, to my recollection all the sex in it is consensual and not due to any sort of coercion. There is brainwashing, but it isn't done for sexual purposes, and did not feel like it included for fetishistic reasons but to advance the plot instead.

      >!I smiled as I pulled away. "That's what I thought. Hinata, if you actually wanted me to let you go I would, because I love you and I want you to be happy. But unless you change your mind someday our bargain stands. You're mine, and whenever I want to I'm going to carry you off to do terrible… twisted… wicked things to you, and make you love every second of it."!<

      >!"Oh!" She shuddered delicately, her breasts pressing into mine. "Yes," she breathed. "That's what I want!"!<

      >!I chuckled. "That's my girl. How can you be such a ruthless killer, and still be such a sub?"!<

      are you... sure? about that?

      Personally I find this stuff very tolerable, practically didn't notice it first time, but I think people understate it way more than appropriate.
      ```

      - u/redrach:
        ```
        Eh, that's a consensual dom/sub relationship. I was referring to the magically-induced brainwashing that's in it.

    - u/Roxolan:
      ```
      > all the sex in it is consensual

      Though note that it's only consensual as in "nobody said no". There are a number of occurrences of "sex magic" used as a weapon (where the victim would have refused consent if they had a clear enough head to do so), and a couple of instances of rape by false identity.

      (Like /u/Putnam3145, I found this very tolerable. It's all minor events in a kick-ass story of rival ninjas. It's just when checking for trigger warnings that I realise how much there is.)
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        Yeah, I'd say there's a lot of dubcon in it, and that's if I'm being charitable.

        > >!Just don't use Sexy Victim Technique on her, and she won't go nuts with the chains and clamps and stuff this time. Remember how she apologized when it wore off?!<

        ... That doesn't exactly sound like the MC particularly wanted what was done to her, much less that she consented to it.
        ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Preeeetty sure that some of the characters were not of sufficient age to consent.

  Called ["the greatest of all Naruto fanfictions"](https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/originality) by Eliezer Yudkowsky, _Time Braid_ is the story of Sakura, an ordinary genin (novice ninja) who is killed partway through her promotion exam and wakes up in her bed the next morning. Now stuck in a time loop, Sakura must solve the mystery behind her situation and find a way to pass an exam she was barely prepared for, even if she has to die over and over again to do so.

  _Time Braid's_ minimalist writing style is fascinating to study from a writer's perspective, and makes the story incredibly fast paced -- _Time Braid_ goes through more plot in four chapters than most book series do in forty. Part of this is that SharperV is writing fanfiction, so he can assume we are familiar with the story of Naruto and show us only the diffs between his novel and way things went in the original anime/manga -- but note that there are many, many fanfic authors who would make us sit through their tedious novelization of stuff we already saw in canon instead.

  _Time Braid_ is also notable for [being the inspiration](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2xapv9/d_so_im_up_to_ch27_of_mother_of_learning_spoilers/) for [_Mother of Learning_](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning) (along with maybe [_Chuning Exam Day_](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411/1/Chunin-Exam-Day), but it's hard to tell because _Time Braid_ was itself inspired by _Chunin Exam Day_). Zorian is Sakura, Zach is Naruto with Sasuke's backstory, QI is Orochimaru, they're all stuck in a one-month loop that ends with an invasion, etc.

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    nowhere in the thread you linked does the author of Mother of Learning actually say that his story was inspired by Time Braid. Where are you getting this information? Is it so implausible that two different authors would independently think of an intelligent fantasy time loop story? Time Braid being the inspiration for Mother of Learning is \*speculation\*, so please don't just state it as a fact.

      ```
      [nobody102's FanFiction.Net account](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1980911/nobody102) lists _Time Braid_ as one of his favorite stories. I think the conclusion is obvious.
      ```

      - u/causalchain:
        ```
        I don't think it's an especially egregious error,  but Sailor\_Vulcan is right - Share what you know for a fact and let the reader come to their own conclusions. If people typically get their information 2nd or 3rd or 4th hand and every person along the line adds in their conclusions without making it clear that it's just a conclusion, chances are someone says something misleading, which the next person turns into something that's wrong.
        ```

        - u/GeneralExtension:
          ```
          Or just ask the author.

        - u/CreationBlues:
          ```
          I mean- abusing time loops to be taught more than anyone else, city destroying invasion at the end of the loop, the mc dealing with multiple personality fuckery, dealing with looping civilians personalities, approximately a month long free period to power up, figuring out how to wiggle their way out of divine restrictions, a powerful resurrecting enemy leading the invasion, careful management of the real loop so they don't fuck up their civilian identities, and probably a couple other similarities.
          ```

        ah never mind I stand corrected
