>In honor of Earth Day and the future of the planet, The Future of Life Institute is co-sponsoring a [short fiction writing contest](http://futureoflifeinstitute.acemlnb.com/lt.php?s=666437b73e0e0dba690d8ac12efdd365&i=230A474A1A27553) with Sapiens Plurum. We love the Handmaid's Tale and Black Mirror as much as anyone, but we think the world needs more [utopian fiction](http://futureoflifeinstitute.acemlnb.com/lt.php?s=666437b73e0e0dba690d8ac12efdd365&i=230A474A1A27554) right now. So we're asking you to write down your vision for the future and share it with us.

>Each of us contributes to the future, through our work, our creations, our children, even our DNA.Imagine a being or entity that exists in the future because of your existence on Earth today. Is this entity your descendant in a traditional sense? Have beings evolved? Is your "descendant" still biological? Is your "descendant" a grandchild or a clone? Have we merged with technology or uploaded DNA to create new cyber-beings? Is your "descendant" something completely different?

>Things to consider as you write your story: Let the reader see this future world through your eyes. Let us see how people — whatever that means — try to live in harmony with the natural world and society, how they maintain their own health and happiness, how they overcome challenges.  But most of all, tell a good story, with characters we care about, setting, conflict, and resolution.

>Your story should be consonant with the Future of Life Institute mission: *Technology is giving life the potential to flourish like never before, or to self-destruct. Let's make a difference;* and with theSapiens Plurum mission: *to inspire us — the first species that can intentionally impact its own evolution — to aspire beyond what was humanly possible*.

  For those curious:

  >Submissions should include 1500-3000 words, in English.   

  This is the flashiest of flash fiction.

    1500-3000 words is still short story territory, albeit on the short end of "short story."  [The flash fiction designation is usually reserved for stories that are under 1,500 words](https://www.writersdigest.com/writing-articles/by-writing-goal/improve-my-writing/flash-fiction-faqs), and it's rare to find flash fiction contests with a with a word limit of more than 1,000 words, with most flash fiction being closer to 100 words than 1,000. If you want to talk about "the flashiest of flash fiction," I'd reserve that for the kind of [stories that can fit into tweets](https://twitter.com/ASmallFiction).

      Yeah, I thought someone would bring up "For sale: baby shoes. Never worn" or similar. I didn't know there was an actual industry standard, to me something under 1500 words isn't really a "work of fiction" in any way but the loosest sense of the word. Like "Yesterday I went to the store and they were out of milk. I was devastated." Story? Yes. Flash fiction? Meh. Guess I'm just being ornery or pedantic or something.

        Wanted: iron chains, live goat.

          Wanted: iron chains, live goat.

          Update: goat feed, new couch.

    No, *this* is the flashiest of \[utopian\] flash fiction.

    >We all lived happily ever after.

      ```
      Shit, 1494 words short of the requested limit.
      ```

        I guess I should market my story as dystopian instead of utopian fiction now!
        ```

- u/onestojan:
  ```
  BTW, can anyone recommend any rational utopia stories/books?

  At first, I thought it's an oxymoron. But I guess The Player of Games by Iain M. Banks counts.
  ```

    The only one I can think of that really qualifies as an utopia is this:

    I found Diaspora by Greg Egan (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_(novel)) pretty good utopian fiction. The existence of humanity is a pretty good struggle. (Although I'm not sure if I've missed a /s in your comment)
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    > In the bright utopian future, what struggle could there possibly be other than being bored? 

    Relationship drama. Sports. Writers block. Trying to understand a difficult math paper. Trying to get your art noticed. Planning a party.
    ```

    ```
    Star Trek is kind of utopian: Earth finally has its act together. Countries no longer make war at each other, poverty is obsolete, etc. And freed of those conflicts, humanity explores outer space and gets into trouble there.

    Solutions to a current problem often create new problems. Think of modern medicine. On the up side, an infection that used to kill people can be wiped away by a few pills of antibiotics. On the down side, an injury that used to kill someone might become a lifelong coma with a ventilator and feeding tube. "Right to life" wasn't an issue for our ancestors.

    ```
    Conflicts external to the society, I would guess, like alien invasions, or following the conflicts that do happen and how the utopian society resolves them in a satisfying manner.

    Like angry assholish people having a kid and abusing it, and the kid getting help.

  an Utopia where we don't need to feel disturbed when asked to make fiction about utopia of the future
