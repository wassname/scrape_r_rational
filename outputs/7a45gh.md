## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I think the life of uploads in a simulation provides great potential for storytelling, but I have yet to find a justification for why everyone wouldn’t have the ability to teleport anywhere, conjure items, and contact anyone the majority of the time. Is there a way to place this restriction on the setting without making it take place in a school or prison of some kind?

  EDIT: I finally figured out how to explain it after posting the same question on r/eclipsephase as an example of what could happen in the setting: https://www.reddit.com/r/eclipsephase/comments/7akt8t/advice_for_simulspace_habitat/dpbl1iqhttps://www.reddit.com/r/eclipsephase/comments/7akt8t/advice_for_simulspace_habitat/dpbl1iq

    Maybe they've bought into the idea of artificial scarcity as a way of making things and places more meaningful. Take a look at the variety of Minecraft servers to maybe get some ideas about what people find fun or worthwhile. Maybe this is a reaction against insane levels of interconnectedness and a glut of content.

      This is the best suggestion I’ve heard, but I have trouble buying into the idea of artificial scarcity. I guess having the characters live in an unjust social order makes for good stories, but it’s hard not to view this society as one that explicitly believes that an economic underclass should exist or people should be denied access to information when resources are not actually limited. As much as I fear living in Brave New World, this scenario makes me think of a Objectivist-flavored 1984 where people revere “hard work” for its own sake and that’s used to rationalize power over others.

        Well, I've sucked the joy out of more than a few games by cheating at them. Single player web games especially are generally very easy to cheat at, and in my experience, that robs them of their entertainment value faster than anything else. It's not so much about valuing hard work by itself, it's that hard work brings meaning to acquisition, relationships, and experiences, in a way that just typing in a console command does not (and I say this as someone who has typed in a lot of console commands in my time).

        That's not to say that scarcity within the simulation has to be like scarcity in real life. You could, for example, establish a baseline of living (and/or information) that people would get for "free". Things can be "scarce" without being zero-sum, and you could structure rewards such that they're *only* valuable because they were worked for, meaning that if I gave you a diamond that I trawled through a cave and fought off zombies for, you would just be getting a worthless chunk of carbon, while I still had the bragging rights and lived experience.

        My guess is that without any restrictions on the simulation, a fair number of people would do this on their own, because people *like* the meaning that effort brings to things. People playing videogames will often set restrictions for themselves like "no fast travel" or "no magic" *even in the absence of the game acknowledging that*.

          This does make sense. When people have their needs taken care of they often create work for themselves to stave off boredom, though I have trouble seeing the benefits of restricting local teleportation and telepathy when that means people can physically restrain others and couldn’t call for help.

          My original motive with this idea is to rationalize visually surreal adventures like anime from Studio Trigger. Space is a malleable construct and the right code can do anything so things get weird fast. Criminals use illegal code to break the rules and the police can warp reality to stop them. 

          The problem is that there seem to be logical safety features for users that altruistic admins would include that make it difficult to create narrative tension in traditional ways. I dislike the trope of characters having their fantastic abilities taken away, so I need to explain why people wouldn’t have them to begin with.

          I could put this idea into Eclipse Phase, which has interesting potential conflicts in a setting where everyone’s brain is always connected to the internet, but it treats simulations as if they’re just like reality with customizable physics without going into detail about how specific rules can work or why they are put into place.

    How about etiquette?

    Let's assume the world is broken up into realms.  Each realm has some curators who are responsible for the look-and-feel of the place. 

    This week, /s/rational is set up like a fantasy pub.  There's heavy wood tables, a surly bartender, and NPCs glowering at us from corners.  We decide to drop in.

    > Teleport Anywhere

    We teleport into /s/rational.  When we do, we end up in an "entryway" / "cloakroom."  The door has a "parchment" with the sim's rules tacked on it.   One of the standard rules is that we're supposed to wear theme-appropriate costumes.  

    You point out that my Zardoz outfit, while extremely accurate, doesn't quite meet the theme.  So, we summon appropriate costumes and go in to look for the normal Wednesday group.

    The /s/rational mods are pretty chill, so the code doesn't actually prevent teleportation within the simulation.  In practice, teleportation is seen as pretty obnoxious.  It's similar to slipping into a friend's house without knocking.  You might be welcome, but no one wants someone appearing behind them when they're watching the TV.  

    Other simulations are stricter.  Using teleportation in /s/EarthPorn is like using a bike in the Chicago Marathon.  You could probably do it.  But anyone who notices is going to be pissed.  And you're going to get banned.

    > Conjure Items

    You're welcome to conjure anything you want when you're in your personal sandbox.  But these private sandboxes look like eclectic piles of junk.  We picked /s/rational because we like theme.  And so we're not supposed to summon things unless they're thematically appropriate.

    Again, some sims are stricter than others.  You could summon a Chevrolet Camaro in the middle of someone's Renaissance sim.  But it would be about as popular as bringing your own boombox to a jazz bar.  You might get away with it for a couple minutes.  But everyone's going to be annoyed, and you'll get kicked.

    Some curators probably use an AutoMod variant to manage bans.  So, being obnoxious in one sim might get you kicked from a bunch of others, too.

    > Contact Anything

    This is the easiest one.  You can send anyone a message.  But they might not see it for a while.

    It's extremely rude to check "invisible" messages when you're near people.  Doing that conveys that they're so boring that you'd rather play minesweeper than talk to them.  And, it makes them suspect that you're not really paying attention in any future interaction.  

    The easiest thing is to just turn off all messages until I'm ready to read them in bulk.

    Try thinking about the physical constraints of the simulation environment. Suppose the environment is a matryoshka brain of some sort. Communication from one side to another could take quite some time (dependent on radius). If uploads experience an accelerated existence relative to meat-forms, the delay could be significant. One might actually have to "travel" to get to interesting places.

    Or you might think beyond the simulation environment. Instead of sending meat-people to distant stars, they might send uploads. Someone has to go, right?

    > teleport anywhere

    You probably aren't welcome on every random server you might find.

    > conjure items

    You'd have to imagine it, and define it first. Then again, what is an item to a sim? A subroutine that does something?

    > contact anyone

    Try getting past the spam filter.

    It's an inefficient use of computing resources.

    Imagine a specific supercomputer, built of a array of 1m^3 cubes.  Each cube has enough processing capacity to simulate a 1 km cube of virtual space at 1 000 000x speed, and can communicate with its (physical) neighbors with a ping time of ~6e-9 seconds, or 1% of the speed of light.  

    The raw physical constraints of such a system means that at least 99.9999999999999% of physical detail is lost (which is fine, nobody cares about a specific iron atom in one dust speck), but also that the speed of long-range causality in the simulation can't be higher than 3 km/s, because neighboring realms can only communicate so quickly.  Much like not simulating a specific iron atom in one dust speck, not simulating an accurate speed of light is a worthwhile tradeoff that allows for literally thousands of times as much utility as the alternatives.

    At that speed, it would take over an hour to reach the other side of the Earth traveling straight through the core.  It's likely that all of the useless empty space would be filled, but that's still a hard limit on travel.
