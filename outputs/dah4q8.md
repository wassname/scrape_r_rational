## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  In general, there's an Earthfic/real-world munchkinry question of what a protagonist should do once rich.  Surprisingly few stories focus on this question for how large it would loom in reality; "Jumper" (the novel) is the main case that springs to my mind.  I have at least two old story ideas on the backboiler that imply wealth acquisition by the protagonist.

  Suppose a protagonist wants to spend an average of $1000/week on having fun.  How could they spend that intelligently?

    I'm not even sure $48,000 of frivolous spending is the kind of rich most people think of. Looks like $100,000+ annual income's have an average of $66,451 a year of discretionary income (https://www.marketingcharts.com/industries/financial-services-2340) and this gets even higher as you get to higher incomes. Here's my suggestions though:

    Short term fun:
    Eat at fancy places, party, and travel.

    Longer term fun:

    Find a sport or hobby you love and spend on that. It's probably the best cost/benefit I know of. Wealthy people tend to do this naturally.

    Hire a weekly: personal financial manager, personal trainer and/or physical therapist, chef, massage therapist, fashion manager, maid. I'm sure there's some kind of professional home manager, get one of those. Essentially remove all the thinking and maintenance work for everything you don't love, and let professionals handle that for you. I believe this is currently highly undervalued as evidenced by the large number of professionals who struggle with many of these topics when they should just put professionals in charge of them. Doctor's struggling with food and exercise springs to mind.

    Buy: very nice quality versions of whatever you use daily. 1k a week you can get one or two super nice smaller items a week and get the entertainment of researching them if you want to.

    Lease a fun car.

      I'm not sure the discretionary income they mean is actually discretionary.  $100k is going to mean that 66k is just after taxes, if even that much.  Someone with 66k after taxes can't spend it all on having fun, unless they neither need  a place to live, have kids,  eat, or save for retirement.  And that's just federal taxes only.

    It depends on what you're optimizing for:

    Most cost-effectively? Buy and play video games. With games like Stormworks, Kerbal Space Program, ArmA 3, Skyrim, Minecraft, Terraria, Space Engineers, Factorio, Stellaris, and Civilization (choose from IV, V, IV, or Beyond Earth), you could easily have an amazingly fun time playing for over two years as if it was your full-time job and spend no more than $1,500 on the games, expansions, computer and accessories combined over the entire timespan. Additionally, if you need to lose weight, some of these games are addictive enough that (for me at least), it is possible to be so immersed in the game as to neglect meals, making it trivially easy to perform intermittent fasting. Some of these games can also teach you skills that are useful in real-life, like programming in C# with Space Engineers or with Lua in Stormworks.

    Most enjoyably? That depends on personal preferences, so there's a wide range of potential answers. It could encompass movies, games, music, books, hiking, painting, hang gliding, skydiving, surfing, dancing, drinking, fucking, partying, traveling, or even just talking with friends, among many other possibilities.

    Most productively? Creative hobbies and exercise. For example, building and programming a robot can be a lot of fun, plus it has useful applications. Writing a book or designing a game which revolves around some technical subjects could be fun and drive you to do some fairly in-depth research on the topic. On the other side, exercise will keep you healthy so you don't end up spending the last few decades of your life with a body crippled by obesity, atrophied muscles, and frail bones. A healthy balance of exercise and creative hobbies seems like the most productive approach.

    Of course, there's also a strong argument in favor of variety. Everything gets boring eventually. It's obviously reasonable to pick some of these choices (depending on what you're optimizing for) until you get bored of it and then switch over to something else that you enjoy, and then come back to old hobbies when they strike your interest again.

    On having fun? Well, it's a kinda obvious answer, but it seems like drugs should probably be part of that money. WHICH drugs is a highly important question, since some would lead to lower fun in the long run and thus would not be an intelligent use of the money, but it's also fairly personal to the protagonist and their drug preferences, as well as their level of risk tolerance. Certainly there are those who just don't enjoy mind altering substances whatsoever, but I think safe and fun use of mind altering substances is an area that's been underexplored in rational fiction.

    If it were me, I'd spend part of that money on custom syntheses (or the equipment to do it myself) of various structurally novel psychedelics that have never been explored before. But that's a pretty personal goal, and my wish to do so is more out of a desire to explore than belief that those novel drugs would, in a manner entirely separate from that desire, also happen to provide more fun/$ and a better ratio of fun to risk (the risk is, I believe, lower than most would assume, but it's certainly higher than an already proven very safe drug like LSD).

    That said, not ALL the money should be used on drugs, certainly. Drugs are, IMO, usually best used to make a fun experience way more fun, not as the only fun thing you're doing (some exceptions being drugs that offer fully immersive experiences, like DMT or salvia).

      I don't think 48k a year gets you anywhere close to safely testing novel drugs. Even if you mean new designer drugs (known mechanism of action, new molecule to target it) I think you'd need far more to safely test them. I'd highly recommend not doing this, chemistry on a large scale still often fails at making known products using known methods even without the drugs possibly having harmful effects alone. 

      With 48k a year you could do a hell of a lot of drug tourism though! It's not illegal if you go to places where the laws a different! Much safer too, stick to the drugs we have historic experience with even though there still isn't nearly enough research. LSD and THC appear to be the highest fun/risk in my opinion.
      ```

        >I don't think 48k a year gets you anywhere close to safely testing novel drugs.

        Assuming we're talking about 48k a year PLUS everything needed to survive (Eliezer's post seemed to me to imply that that budget is only for fun), it depends on where you put the bar at "safely" at. I'd need to look up custom synth and identity+purity testing prices, but I'd expect it to be feasible. But if you're talking the kind of extensive testing we perform on animals for each new drug, then obviously yeah, 48k a year is nowhere NEAR enough. But I honestly don't believe that that kind of testing is likely to be necessary when we're only talking about small modifications to existing structures.

        As I said, I personally think the risks are somewhat lower than you're imagining, but they're certainly higher than something proven safe like LSD. For me personally, I believe that's a risk I'd consider worthwhile for the sake of exploration if I had the money to do so. For others who don't share that desire to explore the frontiers of alterations to subjective experience, LSD will do just fine and is much safer. And there are steps in between exploring truly novel structures like Shulgin did and like I wish I could do and just using the mainstays like LSD; for example just exploring the commercially available "RCs". The various dialkyltryptamines (at least the ones that have appeared so far, and likely all the others with relatively simple alkyl substituents), for example, almost all appear to be around the safety level of DMT itself (with a few key exceptions, of course, so caution is warranted), and the same is true for their 4-hydroxy counterparts with regards to psilocin. But their effects can vary greatly compared to the parent compound. For those with lower risk tolerance than me in this regard but who still wish to explore, that appears to be a very safe and fruitful area to explore, and one that (last I checked) is in a pretty good period in terms of commercial availability (but also still has some easy areas left virtually completely unexplored, like PiPT).

        Reckless exploration would be, well, reckless. But it is very possible to mitigate risk by various methods, including starting at very low doses and working upwards, picking modifications that seem likely to be safe (this gets easier as the SAR of a category becomes better understood), and ideally testing at least LD50 on animals. There will be some risk, but I value exploration even at the cost of personal risk, and this is the kind of research that can only be DONE with some degree of personal risk, at least ethically. Animal research can maybe tell us if a compound is a psychedelic (with some degree of accuracy), but the exact nature of the experience could not be learned that way.

  I have an absurdly rich fashion designer ex-Big Bad, whose wife, a damsel in distress who has recently woken up from a six-year coma, is being hunted down by his personal assistant, who can create homicidal Eldrich abominations. He has built the standard array of booby traps, but they were not enough to stop the personal assistant the last time (she probably helped), and he wants to improve them before she comes back to finish the job.

  Also, I need a panic room for the wife that’s as impenetrable as possible but will keep her completely in the dark to the shenanigans going on outside as much as possible.

  The husband has no superpowers any more, nor mechanical or electrical engineering degrees, but has functionally unlimited money and an “ends justify the means” approach to morality. Keep in mind that any contractors he hires he also has to silence.

  The married couple cannot disappear from town because Plot Reasons. The husband is reasonably sure that if he can call for help, his son the fluttery butterfly from last week can call for more heroes to save them (even if the fluttery butterfly himself is kinda useless in combat, especially in tight spaces)
  ```

  - u/AndHisHorse:
    ```
    Rather than focusing on creating surroundings which will prevent the wife from realizing what's going on, why not just alter her brain? I am by no means an expert on recreational drugs, but surely there is some useful substance which would allow the husband to keep her in the dark under the pretense of "I thought it would be really fun to do X together, let's go into this quiet room that you won't really remember with any degree of reliability and I'll be right back, just start without me"?

      Oh absolutely chloroform at the very least is understood, but that’s not going to keep her alive during the fight

      ```

      - u/AndHisHorse:
        ```
        Oh yes, mine is only a partial solution; it removes the constraint that the panic room must be able to keep her oblivious to the chaos outside it, but does not do anything else.

    Does the horror creator need to be anywhere near the horrors to keep using them? If yes, put your bunker deep inside a mountain with a single, straight tunnel leading in. Put all kinds of impressive doors and traps in, then when they enter to keep the horrors in range, dump hundreds of gallons of a saturated LSD solution into the tunnel. Your assistant will trip forever.

    If no, invest in assassins. If you still have connections in the criminal world,  have them spread the word that your assistant's head on a platter is worth a billion dollars to you. That should get anyone who isn't personally loyal to her to turn on her, and even personal loyalty may falter for that much money.

    Better yet, your assistant *makes Eldrich Horrors.* She's a threat to humanity if left unchecked. Have a kill order placed on her, then make your bounty public.

  You have somehow invented a small multiverse teleporter and connected it to the second universe.

  It turns out that you are exacly the same in the second universe, both universes are 100% equal (well, except the fact that one of them has initiated the connection).

  So, basically there are **two universes** \- universe A and universe B, and you are in both of them, and you have this between-universe-teleporter, and you can teleport small things (let's say not larger than 1 cubic inch).

  You can use this teleporter for whatever you want, you can send paper to your other self, you can receive back paper from your other self, you can send money (as long as it fits in one cubic inch limit), small flash drive, etc.

  **You can not:**  
  \- create more teleporters  
  \- connect to third universe, etc  
  \- create bigger teleporter  
  \- duplicate things  
  \- travel trough time, etc, the time in both universes is consistent....

  How would you munchkin that? I won't specify your exact goal, but it can be world domination or just world optimization, helping science progress, etc.

  - u/RetardedWabbit:

    Hilariously enough, if it was a 100% copy both ways you'd never be able to tell it worked. Every time you teleport your twin would be mirroring your actions and teleporting into your universe, leaving the same notes and travelling at the exact same time farce style.
    ```

    - u/phylogenik:
      ```
      Maybe the second universe is instantiated when the teleporter first activates to be identical to the first, but wave function collapse or whatever quickly causes them to diverge?

      Anyway, once they’ve been sufficiently butterflied it seems the easy solution would be to exploit asymmetrical intellectual labor. Find some successful, original animated film that exists in one universe and not the other, and then either publish it on YouTube yourself for the ad revenue or sell it to whatever big animation house is willing to pay the most. Rinse and repeat a few times and found a deep learning startup through which you can funnel live-action movies. Once the courts settle down, expand into other software & theory development and ~double your company’s productivity. Then expand into other fields of inquiry, also poaching sufficiently divergent results from other companies & journals.

      Once you’ve made a few trillion and sufficiently secured your position, consider revealing your device to the general public. Those born before the butterflies would probably be curious to exchange letters, videoed, etc. with their alternate selves, speak to deceased loved ones, etc. You could also more publicly explore what other divergences have occurred as a result of your ‘natural experiment’.

      (other media could also work in the first stage — original books would probably be easiest and least traceable — but maybe also higher variance wrt their success. But easier to keep above board, since you could quicker contact your univers’s ‘author’ and confirm they’ve nothing similar in the works vs. doing he same with Pixar or w/e)

    One problem would be everything you try to push through just gets blocked by your alternate pushing the same thing through. Addressing the resulting questions of free will would be interesting.

    I finished Ted Chiang's collection of short stories last week, and this is the second time one of its stories has come up here on r/rational. Anyway, check out "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom" which looks at a similar question. In that world, there's one quantum change and then the two resulting timelines can communicate for a limited amount of bits (but no more matter moves).

    Also the Starz series Counterpart is an interesting look at this.

    Can the teleport be in space as well as timelines? Put a drain from the Pacific onto the surface of Mars?

  You wakeup one day with two clones. Memory syncs during sleep.

  So divergence can only be as long as you can stay awake, and no three brains one consciousness.

  How can you use this? You'd need to sleep to beat that 1 million challenge of knowing what your sibling knows with no communication

  People you know don't freak out about the clones and they get a duplicate of all your possessions including birth certificate and bank accounts. You get to choose the name during your sleep before they appear

  I have a sort of anti-munchkinry question. There's an absurdly powerful device, and I want to find mundane uses for it.

  You have a device that teleports you to any fictional universe that has some physical presence on Earth (more specifically defined as the planet where you first got this device). It can be a bunch of text documents on a hard drive, an artwork, a song recorded on a cassette, anything like that. Being physically present as neurons and synapses in someone's mind doesn't count.

  The rules are the follows:

  1. You can choose at what point in the history of the world do you arrive. You also have control over the exact place of arrival, down to a centimeter.

  2. If you choose so, the device can make up a backstory for you, so you can more or less naturally blend into the story. Of course, if you look and/or act nothing like the native inhabitants of the world, your presence will still raise questions.

  3. The device makes logic of the world consistent, creating explanations that make the existence of such a universe possible. For example, even you go to a world that's described as "everything's the same as Earth, but all forms of cancer are cured," not literally *everything* will stay identical since there was an event that made the cure possible.

  4. You can't bring anyone with you when teleporting. When going back, you are going to be restored to the state before the teleportation (the same body, the same clothes, etc). The device tries its best to prevent you from bringing any object from one universe to another. You keep all the memories though.

  5. While you are away, the time passes on Earth (and other worlds, all relative to you); it will seem like you disappeared without a trace.

  6. This device is literally one of a kind. There's no such object in any of the universes, and any attempt to replicate it will inevitably fail.

  So, of course, you can hire a ghostwriter to write about a universe where everything is perfectly aligned with your hopes and dreams, and move here. You can create/choose a world that is one hundred percent like Earth, move to interesting points in time and learn the true history.

  These are cool and all, but **what are simple, outright swatting-flies-with-a-sledgehammer ways to use such a device?** You can escape danger by teleporting somewhere and then popping back after a few hours, for example. What else?

  Thanks in advance for answers!
