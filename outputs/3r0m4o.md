## Trust in God, or, The Riddle of Kyon kinetic novel [RT][WIP?][FF]

### Post:

I made this a couple year's back based on Eliezer Yudkoski's Haruhi fanfic [Trust in God, or, The Riddle of Kyon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5588986/1/Trust-in-God-or-The-Riddle-of-Kyon). I made it using the [Kyon, Big Damn Hero visual novel](https://github.com/alethiophile/KBDH-VN), which is based on [Kyon, Big Damn Hero](http://www.soulriders.net/brian/fanfic/kbdh/) (unfinished due to author existence failure).

It's not exactly complete. It goes to the end of the story, and I think it's pretty good as it is, but it's lacking a few backgrounds, and more music would be good. If anyone wants to help, that would be great. But if you just want to read it, you don't have to wait until I post a complete version.

  ```
  I really liked Trust in God, this is an interesting way of using the material.
  ```

- u/NotAHeroYet:
  ```
  I'd ask if there's a more frazzled koizumi avatar out there. this one isn't all that frazzled looking. Still, maybe it's justifiable.

  Good work, otherwise, though.

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    There isn't one. There are 53 sprites of Yuki, who is known for her complete lack of facial expressions, but there's not a single frazzled Koizumi.
    ```
