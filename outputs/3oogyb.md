  Good writing and I was pleasantly surprised and lol'ing at the Midichlorians explanation - I would not have expected such a lovely excuse to be findable.  But I really hope the horribly wrong invocations of Vinge's principle and Graham's Number were meant as humor.

  Wow, this is really interesting. I enjoyed everything about the story.

  My only issue is that I just wish it wasn't posted on space battles. That place can be so shit to navigate and follow stories.I understand its appeal, but it's not a format that's suited to what is being used for.

  Edit: space battles-> forum format site

    There's the threadmarking system now, which basically provides an instant index. And if you make an account you can fiddle with the preferences to only get story posts in your notifications.

  Hasn't advanced all that much yet, but is quite a good read.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    It is a factor, although there's a section of readership which gets off on the history as much as the characterization. Being able to balance it is the mark of a great author. And you could even say that Tolkien, for instance, was more about the world-building than telling a story which showed it off.

      And yet The Lord of the Rings barely brushes on the mythology of the world - most of that is in the supplemental texts. Instead, it's an epic story about the end of an age and a very English hobbit thrust into adventure and misadventure.

  I'll second this. Good stuff.

  Excellent stuff! Thanks for this gem!

  EDIT: the brain-healing ring sounds suspiciously like an automated version of the super-praxis in Anathem.

  Not bad as far as rationality in MC goes. Would be better if the emotion descriptions were cut back a little bit, maybe a quarter of what they are now. 

  Sensible goal behavior by Jedi, and what I assume is a Sith Lord (no confirmation on that). Culture seems a little outdated for people who can live a long time, why no mind drugs and VR? Great use of future sensing by everyone so far.

  The lore bits would be better as a in story clue than what they are now, but I like the rationale behind the scientific lack of progress, as well as scientifically accurate methods(or at least the ones I know are accurate)

  Would benefit from more character descriptions, so far only the boss and Twielk man get some semblance of appearance (I could be wrong on this, i can sometimes forget or misread the details)

  Bonus point: aliens that come from vastly different eco systems need vastly different arrangements for living.
