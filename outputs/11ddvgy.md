## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  Over the past week I devoured 750 chapters of [Shadow Slave](https://www.panda-novel.com/details/shadow-slave(ZN\)-1413). It's the best thing I've read in months. Here the pitch:

  > Sunny is a homeless 16yo kid who gets infected by something called a Nightmare Spell, which we find out is a series of life or death trials that randomly afflicts teenagers between 16-19yo and which has decimated the human population in the 30 years since it's arisen. 

  > If you pass the first trial you get powers and an even harder trial at the next solstice. If you fail, you die and your body turns into a mindless rampaging Nightmare Creature that will kill everyone around you. Don't fail. 

  There's 2 things I find exceptional about this story, the depth and detail of the worldbuilding and the complexity and cleverness of the plot. The logic through which the world is constructed is very high and consistent and extremely impressive in hindsight. Additionally, both are insanely intertwined, with the setting and worldbuilding being integral to the development of the plot. 

  Each arc so far has been like a puzzle that the characters have to figure out in order to pass the trial. I was very impressed at the level of careful planning and forethought by the author. If you pay attention you can reason out the puzzles alongside the characters because you have the same information as them, it's all foreshadowed(heh)! It's not the level of rationality you would expect from a random web novel, I was blown away. 

  It makes every time a character is clever actually impressive because they're not just pulling shit out of their ass so the author can have their moment of cool.  When I realized this was the case and actually started paying close attention and thinking things out, I managed to partially predict several developments and twists in the plot. 

  Which isn't to say it's perfect or anything. The author is Russian I believe and he has some problems with confusing and needlessly obtuse nomenclature. Example: humans have 7 levels of soul ranks and nightmare creatures have 7 levels of both soul ranks and classes. Each level of both has a separate name, and humans and creatures have distinct names for each. So a human's level is expressed as "[human rank]",  while that of creatures is "[creature rank] + [class]". On top of that, there are both official names and colloquial names for each level of rank for humans. So a fourth rank human is a "Transcendent" but interchangeably referred to as a "Saint", while a creature of the same rank is a "Corrupted + [Class 1-7]". As you can see, it can get really confusing until you get a hang of it. The [wiki](https://shadowslave.fandom.com/wiki/Hierarchy_of_Nightmare_Creatures_and_Awakened_Humans) can help, but with the trade-off of being filled with spoilers, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it until the end of the Forbidden Shore arc. 

  I've heard he's aiming for 3000 chapters total, which initially gave me pause, but at his current pace that would would only be 2 or so years until its finished. That's right, in the ~year since the story began it's been updated almost *every single day*, and usually ***twice a day***. That's... insane.

    42 chapters in, I'll give it a solid Azarinth Healer/20.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      So 1/20, since azarith healer is objectively terrible?
      ```

      - u/FireCire7:
        ```
        Yes, it’s not high quality literature. 

        Azarinth is not objectively terrible - it’s decent at something fairly specific (progression fantasy with consistent updates) and meh in lots of other ways (plot, characters). 

        Shadow slave is kinda similar but with more of an under-the radar kind of character. It reminds me a bit of Super Gene. 

        I don’t see anything explicitly irrational in it as far as characters go, but the MC is way more lucky instead of smart (one of his abilities is to be “fated” aka have plot armour and he leans into it). He’s called treacherous and selfish repeatedly even though he’s actually a pretty good team player who backstabbed people like twice literally moments before they were going to backstab him. 

        It’s not bad for a Chinese/Russian Webnovel, but it doesn’t even come close to something like WTC in quality.
        ```

  - u/hoja_nasredin:
    ```
    You link says it is China not Russia as origin. 

    I was always afraid of reading Chinese webnovels as nothing is happening for most of the page. Is this true here?
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      It's wrong or purposely misleading. I know because the author has an unused twitter that says he's russian, and he has an active discord and he's done an AMA. 

      As to the "chinese webnovel are shite" thing, I tend to agree. I've tried all the one's that are put forward as the best of the best and so far I've only really liked two, *Lord of Mysteries* and *Forty Millenniums of Cultivation*. And even then I don't consider them great or anything. 

      My theory is that, just like with light novels, the competition is so great you have to write your story very cynically in order to get popular. On top of that, there's an absolutely insane amount of output that's expected of chinese webnovel writers, which does no favors for quality.
      ```

  - u/ValuableBuffalo:
    ```
    Best thing I've read in a while. I specifically love the worldbuilding; it actually feels like a 'quest' in the D&D sense. You also get to see the characters (slowly) grow, which is nice (not so much for the auxiliary characters though, although I suspect that's principally because it's not evident from the main character's POV).

    Are there any other novels which do cool worldbuilding and have lore like this? I'm having a hard time putting the exact quality in words; I think...just something with large, expansive lore-based puzzles. The best thing I can compare this to is a good Anime.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      The closest I can think of to Shadow Slave is Worth the Candle, in that they both have a setting which is intensely relevant to the unveiling of the plot, and vice versa. WtC is less a deductive puzzle and more a character study though, so I don't know if it will match tastes 1:1. Still, highly recommended. 

      Some other recs that have strong worldbuilding and deduction are the Masters and Mages trilogy and the Covenant of Steel trilogy.

      If you want more recs you can look through my comment history for my past recommendations here. All favorite fiction tend to have great worldbuilding, though Shadow Slave's is pretty unique.
      ```

      - u/ValuableBuffalo:
        ```
        I used to follow Worth the Candle, but didn't finish it. Should be worth a reread, especially now that it's complete.

        Your other two recommendations seem too 'fantasy', in terms of them sounding fairly standard (but that's just me looking at the summaries). I did go through your comment history, though, and your recommendations are generally pretty cool, so might try Masters and Mages, too.

        But yeah. Not sure if I'll find anything like Shadow Slave. Now to wait for another year for a bunch of chapters to build up...
        ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      I think you'd like Dungeon Crawler Carl, if you haven't read it already. The story is extremely impressive in how it weaves together its own lore and mechanics to allow for big payoffs.
      ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Have you read Ar'Kendrythist? It doesn't have lore based puzzles, but I am continually surprised at how the author is able to foreshadow things very well in advance, and how things from even the beginning chapters are relevant much much later. The world is very large and feels lived in, and the effects of magic and monsters on society are well considered. It's about a middle aged dad and his daughter getting isekaid into a world with a system very similar to D&D (or was it Pathfinder?). The daughter takes to magic like a fish to water, while the dad undergoes a much more difficult transition. It's about 50/50 on slice of life and action, although I feel that the slice of life moments are still pretty plot relevant.

    I second this recommendation.
    Also I find posting the link to pirated content distasteful.

        To be fair, the linked site *also* sucks. Are there any easy ways to scrape a book as an epub from webnovel?
        ```

        - u/GlueBoy:
          ```
          I linked it cause it's the site that updates the quickest, and it's not bad at all with ublock(use firefox mobile!). But if you look around you can find epubs of the first 600 chapters.
          ```

      - u/valeskas:
        ```
        While I understand the hate towards webnovel, between providing a link to it and providing a link to pirates is providing no link at all.

        Not caring about the hard work that it takes to do 2 chapters of original (Shadow Slave is not a translation) novel per day is very disappointing.
        ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I would normally agree, but it's webnovel. Their monetization is so unconscionable normal rules don't apply. If the author starts a patreon or equivalent I will be first one there, but until that happens he's collateral damage in the "fuck webnovel" campaign.
      ```

    - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
      ```
      Eh, normally I'd agree, but I tried reading this on webnovel, and good god is it a steaming pile of shit. In a just world, there kind of needs to be real cost associated with providing content in such a poor way.

- u/Missing_Minus:
  ```
  Any good/decent 'utopian grimdark' stories? I don't have a better term for this, but I think I'll just use an example:  
  Ex: Warhammer 40k, but using the tech they have available to improve the lives of everyone and make society run smoothly. They're still facing Chaos Gods and the Warp - the grimdark part - which are still extremely dangerous, but the Imperium is deliberately keeping themselves together quite well.  
  So, a competent reasonably-high capability-level civilization in a dangerous dark/grimdark setting. Note that this precludes some stories where they have a significantly easy time dealing with their enemy (which is what a lot of the 'high tech civ appears in WH40k' stories are).  
  I don't really have any actual stories, since I'm unsure I've even read any like this.
  ```

  - u/Noumero:
    ```
    * [*To the Stars*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984) definitely fits, I think. Humanity is a post-scarcity transhuman utopia facing a technologically overwhelming alien invasion.

    * [*Aeon Entelechy Evangelion*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5834947/1/Aeon-Entelechy-Evangelion), sort of? *Evangelion*/Lovecraft mythos cross-over, humanity is very technologically advanced but it's fighting a war on multiple fronts against alien invaders *and* eldritch gods that are trying to immanentize the eschaton. I've read it a while ago, though, and don't recall how the government is on the utopia-to-dystopia scale; IIRC it's not fully benevolent but mostly okay. Closer to utopia than WH40k, at least. This story's also tragically unfinished. You might try [the "first draft" of it](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4716493/1/Aeon-Natum-Engel), which is finished but which I haven't read.

    * [*BAHHSCQ*](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/). Ignore the title, the story's much more serious than it suggests. Similar to *TtS* for your purposes: an overwhelming alien invasion, except from another universe. Humanity was decimated in its opening stages, but has since recovered, lives in fairly utopian strongholds, and is trying to turn the tide of the war.

    * [*The Flower That Bloomed Nowhere*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28806/the-flower-that-bloomed-nowhere) has some of this vibe as well. It's a post-post-apocalyptic sci-fi/fantasy setting, where a cosmological catastrophe destroyed the universe, but humanity survived its end, reconstructed reality as well as it could, and built a post-scarcity civilization in it. It's more of a "Man vs Nature" than "Man vs Beast" take on the premise, though — there *is* an enemy despite whose efforts humanity thrives, but it's the structure of reality, not some concrete agent. >!Or is it?!<

    * Maaaybe [*Nowhere Stars*](https://nowherestars.net/). The standards of living seem to be on the real-life XXI-century levels, not utopian, but given the level of adversity humanity is facing (regular incursions of eldritch supernatural entities with bullshit esoteric abilities and inscrutable motivations), that's still an achievement.

    On a separate note, I'd like to commiserate: I also think "utopian grimdark" is a fantastic trope, and I wish there were more stories like this. [SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/) also seems like an excellent seedbed for them, but I can't recall any off the top of my head, beyond some tidbits like [the quote below](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-hymn-for-pandora). Tragic.

    > When the whole of the anomalous catalog lays open to you — or at least as much as a Site Director can view — a conclusion stands out starkly from the screaming chaos: that if there is a supreme divinity, he is crueler than any of us can imagine, or has been placed in charge of a universe created by the Evil itself. That evil is propagating at a rate faster than we could ever feasibly contain. Our best projections have asserted that the probability of us escaping the twenty-first century without a massive anomalous event exposing the supernatural to the general public is next to zero. Faced with the knowledge that a malevolent god rules our universe and has beset us with his agents of famine, plague, and terror, it is easy to despair. It is easy to forget who we are. It is easy to forget what we must do. [...]

    > We have chained the indestructible lizard. We have kept at bay cosmic horrors for centuries, ten at a time and all eager to cleave our world in twain. We have cheated Time, we have defeated Death, we have protected the world from the unknown, and we have not failed in all this time. We have not merely stared into an abyss but plunged headlong into it, armed to the teeth to fight whatever lies at the bottom. Do you think a god can stop us? Do you think that anyone can stop us?

    > We are the Foundation. We will secure, we will contain, and we will protect above all else; we are the Foundation, and our mission is unstoppable.

      How many of these do I need to know the background material for? all of these seem pretty interesting (picked up Flower from your recommendation right now, actually), am really tempted to read others as well. Just am not sure how much knowledge of the original sources I need.

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        Honestly, I'd say none.

        *Aeon Entelechy Evangelion* is divergent enough that I think it just ends up expositing on everything from scratch. It's still confusing, but not in a way that penalizes for lacking canon knowledge (e. g., you're not in fact meant to have any idea what's happening in the prologue, none of that is from canon).

        *To the Stars*... you *might* want to read the show's synopsis beforehand, but I don't think even that is necessary if you really don't want to, it should be possible to pick everything from context. You won't know about one particular character's whole deal, but it might be even better this way, since no-one in-universe does either and they all treat it like a mystery.

        Glad to hear you liked *Flower*!

    Wouldn't such a world be extremely boring to set stories in? Where all the conflict is happening from external purely evil forces and there is nothing more to the story than slaughtering the opposition/finding better ways to slaughter the opposition.

    I suppose a story about how that society came to be might be interesting but that might not be what you are looking for.

    EDIT: Hmm... there could also be a story set where it's only one faction that's a utopian and everything outside is varying shades of terrible, like >!Khelt from The Wandering Inn!<.

  Hey everyone! I’m looking for works of fiction (On the web or on RoyalRoad preferred though not necessary) that deal with truly alien perspectives (either with an alien main character or as a significant part of the story) or are experimental (in style, setting, etc.) in nature.

    Not particularly rational, but [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) is about an escaped shapeshifting bioweapon pretending to be human. It's set in a near-futuristic megapolis (although the poor and decayed parts of it) surrounded on all sides by inhospitable wilderness, in a setting filled with superheroes and villains. It's kinda goofy,  though the protagonist's complete lack of human morality and social skills can result in that tone seemingly pingponging back and forth between alien brutality and subtle absurdity.

    Was on hiatus for over two years before suddenly updating out of the blue earlier this month.

    Also, semi-related, but [Thundamoo's](https://www.royalroad.com/profile/78901/fictions) stories are about a (mostly) human protagonist becoming increasingly inhuman over time. They pop up in weekly recommendation threads here from time to time, so you can do some quick searches here if you want any more detail on them first.

    It's not a totally alien perspective, but the protagonist of [Shade Touched](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473) starts out as an unusually smart and inquisitive monster in a fantasy universe. The struggle between its hyper-intelligence and its instincts as it becomes more than a monster is a big part of the early chapters.

    Later on, as the protagonist learns and adapts, its mentality becomes closer to that of a human child and the alien-ess is downplayed, but it never fully goes away.

    It's a cute story, which is, unfortunately, on indefinite hiatus due to RL problems.

  (I'm not 100% sure that self-advertising is OK in this thread, so mods, just give me the word or take it down yourself if that's the case!)

  I've been a longtime reader of r/rational, though till date, all of my writings have been restricted to my Google Keep (the self-respecting author's word processor of choice!), since I always lacked the confidence to pack them up for public perusal. I've had a few people reach out to me in the past, asking if I have anything else they could read, and although this has absolutely nothing to do with my opus magnum on r/medicine, if any of you still follow me, kudos to you. 

  A few weeks ago, I finally got around to reading Worm (and was inundated with fanfics recommendations here when I asked for them), and a few days ago, I developed a sudden craving for a superhero series set in a hard scifi setting with transhumanist elements.

  As far as I could tell, that simply didn't exist, so I sighed, settled down and decided to write it myself with blackjack and hookers to taste.

  Introducing *Ex Nihilo, Nihil Supernum*, currently 24k words and 7 chapters in, being posted over at Space Battles and Sufficient Velocity!

  Here's the link on [Space Battles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ex-nihilo-nihil-supernum-superpowers-cyberpunk-hard-scifi.1075620/ ).

  I'll share the current cover blurb below:

  >Dr. Adat Sen has been having a bad week.

  >Not only was his teleporter wife drafted to Alpha Centauri to fight a K2 offshoot of a K3 civilization, his promised pay raise hasn't come through, and it turns out that someone has it out for him to the extent of trying to kill him with a Basilisk hack.

  >Then there's the matter of publish or perish, handling nasty cognitohazards on a daily basis, convincing suicidally depressed superhumans not to take everyone else with them, and living under the shadow of hostile advanced aliens building a Nicoll-Dyson laser in the solar system next door. Oh, and the one Superhuman AGI that humanity produced might be out to get them.

  >Welcome to the world of ENNS, where superheros have actual jobs and don't run around in costumes fighting muggers, humanity faces existential threats around every corner, and Adat has the bad luck of finding himself fighting threats way out of his pay grade.

  How rational is it? At least rational-adjacent, even if I'm not aspiring to the standards set by Yudkowsky et al.

  I try to write characters who are self-aware, intelligent, and attempt to leverage their environment to their benefit, and the setting itself ~~steals~~ *riffs* off the best hard scifi I've had the pleasure of reading, with plenty of ideas of my own.

  Expect AGI, Dyson Swarms, Nicoll Dyson beams, Alcubierre drives, cognitive and physical enhancements, all set in a world that diverged from our own about ten years into the future, with the birth of the first truly Superhuman AGI.

  And *superpowers*. Can't forget those. As inspired by our local munchkinry threads, they end up getting minmaxed to hell and back.

  Teleporters and precogs are routinely used to tell the speed of light to go fuck itself, matter duplicators sit around making tons of antimatter, and clairvoyants have their hands full trying to deal with a pissed off K2 civilization out to get us all.

  I can only hope that interests you, because it certainly interests *me*, seeing that I set out to write the kind of fiction I want to read.

  Feedback, positive or otherwise, is greatly appreciated, since I'm going to do an editing pass this week and start posting over on Royal Road for an even larger audience that isn't just massive space nerds like me.

  I look forward to hearing what you guys think! 👀

    Neat so far. I'm gonna dump my thoughts and a few (questionable) copyedit suggestions.

    Some nitpicks: I don't know how general the terms are, but usage of tinker/thinker/parahuman makes me immediately think of Worm. I know you recently read the story, but it's a bit on the nose.

    In the second chapter, there's an assumption the reader knows of acronyms that you're using, like GPT/SOTA/RKV/OTA. I know most due to hyper-nerdism, but had to look up SOTA. Given you're aiming for hard sci-fi, it's probably okay to assume the reader knows stuff, but it can be a bit confusing.

    >I would settle for co-op, I really couldn't keep up anymore and getting reflex augments would just kick me up to another league.

    This is a mood.

    >It was an active structure, a space fountain to be precise. 

    I find it a personal peeve to see "to be precise", "that is", "as it were", "to say the least" in prose. Maybe from so much overuse in fanfiction?

    >I don't think I'd pissed off any of the local probability manipulators,

    Is this a nod to the Fall of Doc Future? Neat, if so. If not, you should [read it](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents).

    >"Jesus, you ok Adat?",

    Another personal nitpick: I prefer spelling out "okay", or writing it in caps as "OK". For whatever reason, "ok" seems wrong.

    >"I've got a clairvoyant and telepath here, you'll get through this Adat, just sit tight."  

    >"Mild severity. There's a 2% chance of irreversible personality loss in a purge, do you consent to continue?"

    These two lines seem like comma splices.

    >because there was a pretty high chance that by the time they a parahuman healer could regenerate my damaged neurons,

    Typo: "they a parahuman"

    >"I don't bite kid."

    This is a sentence where you're missing a comma instead.

    >He'd ended up submerged for a few seconds, but not only enough to decide 

    Typo?: "only" doesn't fit

    > *1) Memetic engineering of trigger events, and their relationship to the beliefs, adjustment and mental state of affected individuals. Status: Simulation running, provisional report available.*

    Hello Mr. Cauldron man.

    Now to chapter 3...

    > Sorry, I keep having my proposals for installing a gigantic golden throne with a ESPer on life support rejected, so I need to express my nerd instincts in some other way.

    For the emprah!

    >A Grade 4 Ex Nihilist, name withheld for privacy, caused a furore in Canberra today.

    >Simon Wells, an autistic 12 year old boy, 

    Name withheld, immediately name culprit. Is this an error, or the information gathering capability of Adat's group?

    >power classification system that McKinsey and Manton 

    Now I'm wondering if this worm fanfic in disguise?

    >For example, that newly discovered hydrokinetic could easily charge millions in USDC

    US dollar credits? There was a reference to USDE earlier. Are there two currencies? A typo? It wasn't explained.

    >I knew that Euclid, the world's best teleporter, could early as much as a billion per trip to AC, 

    There's a superhero named Euclid, but also Euclid-class heroes? I know this could easily happen IRL, but Doylistically it's unneeded confusion imo.

    >Sadly, dear reader, 

    Odd choice to break the fourth wall in chapter four, until now the story's been the usual first-person limited. If this has a purpose later, neat, otherwise it seems unnecessary.

    > There was Novikov, an acquaintance from our sister agency UNHEARD, my lace informed me that he'd been working on some interesting work on overcoming the interference between standard transhumanist augmentation and Parahuman powers. I pinged him, asking for a copy. 

    This strikes me as odd, considering our protagonist uses amnestics while he works.

    >I think they'd gotten to like a hundred kilometers so far

    "gotten to like"--doesn't seem like the language a doctor would use. "built approximately" would be more hoity-toity wording instead of "gotten to like".

    >I only had to spend a couple hours being probed by the TSA on arrival before they cleared me to proceed further.

    tfw the future still has such a useless organisation

    >They were aspects of a super I wasn't familiar with, all I knew was that their creator was military, Korean if I remembered correctly. 

    This sentence structure is the same peeve above of ending a sentence on something like "to be precise". I don't know if there's a term for this kind of phrasing, but it rubs me the wrong way.

    > She nodded, and let me over to the seemingly featureless wall. Close up, it turned to have some texture to it, almost like a glass barrier holding back a choppy sea. Ripples ran up and down, and it seemed slightly moist. Nanite barriers then. 

    This is written oddly. It's as if this is the first time he's seeing this barrier, but I'm assuming he's gone through this entry rigmarole before. I'd give it a pass due to amnestics, but he later states he's not using them for his visit.

    >concerned about enemies teleporting into a casually disconnected pocket universe,

    Do you mean causally disconnected? Not much casual about pocket universes.

    >"We also have a ingrained cultural component that informs us regarding what might be acceptable for consumption. Human tastebuds are miscalibrated for the modern environment, and we have issued with superstimuli foods that taste amazing but aren't good for your health. Less of an issue today with modern medicine, but I grew up during the obesity epidemic myself.

    >And just because something smells good and tastes palatable doesn't mean you should eat it. This applies for both the things you ate last time, namely art supplies and your cleaning products."

    This may be a typo, but if not: If you're continuing dialogue from one paragraph to the next, you should begin subsequent paragraphs with opening quotes. [See also](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/96608/why-does-the-multi-paragraph-quotation-rule-exist).

    >You have to understand, as species go, we're in our infancy, we've barely made it out of our solar system, when I was growing up, we hadn't even been to Mars. I can only hope we don't disappoint you."

    This sentence is super comma splicey. There's a bunch of comma splices along the fic, but this one was especially egregious. I can't say there's an easy fix other than restructuring how certain sections are written. I haven't used it myself, but I've heard something like Grammarly might be useful.

    >No, even with the latest from Nvidia, 

    Hello, yes, I'd like some product placement. Thank you.

    >I rubbed my eyes, taking a minute to get my bearings in my devastated room.

    I don't understand. He's a (seemingly) high ranked government employee. (Who else gets fucking VTOL pickups lmao.) Why is he stuck in a home ruined by a tsunami?

    >"We need to get out to sea, I yelled at a rep from Flotsam,

    Typo, missing end quote. Also, you (an unpowered psychologist) wanna go out on the water into a hurricane? Interesting tactic.

    >This was something I'd come up with, inspired by another binge of those old Terminator films. Alan's teleportation worked through his skin, with the sensitivity of mechanoreceptors being directly proportional to his ability to TP things with him. Since he'd been deprived of his arms, quite violently I might add, his new bionics had been hampering his ability to manipulate things.

    I dunno if I missed some offscreen time passing, but from first seeing Alan with his prosthetics, our protag hasn't had any time to experiment. Maybe I skimmed a passage.

    >Alan flickered, becoming intangible just in time for the missile impact to do little more than tickle him, and he was gone before he could hit the ground. 

    Given how you earlier explained he "lost both his arms at the elbow before he could dematerialize", this is a bit wacky. If he can twitch-dodge a *missile*, I would think his pain reflex would trigger his power when encountering a "Class 3 metallokinetic specializing in blades".

    >On cue, Alan grabbed the ruined arm, and apparated away, tossing it safely into the sea well outside the danger zone.

    Again, his limitation was stated to take several seconds before jumping / returning from a jump, *plus* line-of-sight restrictions within a few hundred meters.

    ...The whole situation seems odd. If Jupiter doesn't want to deal with aliens or drafts, why is he cavorting with terrorists? Was he mind controlled?

    ---

    I'll watch the thread for more. Premise seems interesting, but it's a bit all over the place. Sometimes he's hanging out with a superhero team, other times he's a shrink? General SPAG is good, but comma splices and an excessive love of acronyms could be something to fix.

      Hey there. I've read a couple of chapters before losing interest. The main irritant for me was your tendency to use commas where there should have been periods. It makes the story feel rushed and breathless, as if it was being told by an overstimulated 5-year-old.

      I love the world-building, though.

      😥 Someone actually caught the continuity errors I was too lazy to fix.

      Jokes aside, I'm incredibly grateful for you taking the time to really get into the weeds!

      Excuse the lack of formatting, I'll be replying to your points in the order you made them:

      1) Yes, my enjoyment of Worm is leaking. Funnily enough, I haven't read to the point where all the grand reveals are presumably made, so if anything but absolute broad strokes and some terminology leaks through, it's entirely unintentional.

      I've had some people tell me to scrub out the Worm-isms before publishing on RR, and I'll probably do so, just to reduce the number of people who end up thinking is a fanfic without reading further.

      2) Noted, I personally find it more incongruous than not that a narrator explains such acronyms when they're presumably common knowledge, but I understand that outside nerdy parts like SV, the number of people confused by them may make it a concession I have to make.

      3) I haven't read any fanfiction that turned me off that phrase, but if this isn't mostly idiosyncratic on your part, I'm not opposed to changing it.

      4) I read like two chapters and bounced off it, maybe I'll try and give it another shot! I was mostly imagining just what a nuisance you could be if you had the power to subtly alter probabilities.

      5) I consider that intentionally formal and stilted, the character is going off a script. Also being brief to save time in an urgent context, you'll hear it more often if you watch military fiction.

      6, 7 and 8)Will fix!

      9) I suspected Cauldron was up to shenanigans, but I haven't yet read that part. Too busy with writing my own work haha.

      10) Initially just an error, but I was thinking of incorporating it into the story, with say [name] to show that his UN credentials were de-redacting the story.

      11) Typo being saved for a proper edit pass.

      12) Continuity error, but I could pass it off as the class being named after *him*. He's the strongest teleporter around after all!

      13) I wouldn't call it a wall break, assume that he's talking to an in-universe audience, such as the narration of Blindsight by Peter Watts.

      14) Not everything requires amnestics, and once it's been cleared for publication he would be aware of it. 

      15) You're a sheikh in Dubai, and mere *skyscrapers* are old hat. You sigh, looking at how squat and uninspired the Burj Khalifa looks, and then throw a few hundred billion at the most photogenic western architect you can find. He presents to you something that clearly screams compensation, but you prefer to think of it as a middle finger for that woman who dumped you in Saudi Arabia. 

      Aight, they're just the next logical leap in construction, buildings easily double digit kilometers tall are trivial with future construction techniques and advances in material sciences. 

      16) I don't quite agree here, it's just me being descriptive for the sake of the reader. He is under amnestics while in the security lobby, and *used* to be while in Xibalba. 

      17) Another typo I was too lazy to fix, it's a nuisance to double edit on both websites haha. It'll be fixed before RR! 

      18) Hmm, I'll look into it! 

      19) Given that it's set only 20 years in the future, the current incumbents are largely around. 

      20) He just got home, I'm sure he *could* stay at a hotel, but he's more concerned with picking up the pieces of what remains for now. 

      As you'll see in the next chapter, he spends so much time away from it that he's not too fussed about slumming one night and also dissuading anyone stupid enough to try and steal in the midst of a disaster. 

      While he has an important job, he's not paid *that* much, his wife always made the big bucks. VTOL pickup and such is reserved for the most important emergencies, in normal scenarios he catches a shuttle. You'll see him taking slower means of transport in the following chapters. 

      21) While he hasn't had reasons to flex his augments quite yet, Adat is hardly just a baseline human. He can handle himself. 

      22) Offscreen magic at its finest! Keep in mind that's it a temporary fix, Alan is extremely uncomfortable. He'll have to regrow his limbs the old-fashioned way once they're done with the emergency. 

      Alan didn't *dodge* the missile, in the time it took to track and acquire a very non-standard target in a hurricane, he was already turning intangible. By the time the explosion occurred, he was so out of sync with normal reality that it was more like being hit by a stiff breeze. 

      He can't teleport instantly, but he can dodge damage to a degree. No special reflexes needed. 

      In terms of line of sight, Jupiter tore the wall out, so it wasn't too hard for him to just jump away into the sea. 

      I'll go into further detail in the future, but being a superpowered individual without working under the auspices of a government or some such is *difficult*. Powers are strictly regulated, unaffiliated supes are usually heavily monitored, and have no say in the draft. They're treated akin to a walking nuclear weapon more than a free human, barring the ones who have absolutely inconsequential powers. 

      He can't just mind his own business, his time out in the sun without some kind of protection would be exceedingly short. 

      Keep in mind that, while I haven't delved into details so far, the planet is a *heavy* surveillance state. There's facial recognition and random gene sampling occurring, and other  more esoteric means. He doesn't have the option of just living life out of costume and having nobody notice. 

      Our protagonist is an agent of the UN, which, while hardly as powerful as world governments are often portrayed, is still heavily involved in such activities. 

      >gotten to like"--doesn't seem like the language a doctor would use. "built approximately" would be more hoity-toity wording instead of "gotten to like". 

      Well, I actually *am* a doctor IRL, and I happen to talk like that ;) 

      Thank you for taking the time to pore over the details, I'll fix some of the continuity issues and odd grammar you mentioned, and I'll try and work-in more natural explanations for the myriad acronyms I have a habit of throwing about. I hope the story continues to engage you in the future!

      - u/degenerate__weeb:
        ```
        >2) Noted, I personally find it more incongruous than not that a narrator explains such acronyms when they're presumably common knowledge, 

        Yeah, it can definitely feel like you're talking down to the reader if you explain *too much*, but you've got acronyms for your acronyms (I'm hyperbolising) so it can be overwhelming.

        >5) I consider that intentionally formal and stilted, the character is going off a script. Also being brief to save time in an urgent context, you'll hear it more often if you watch military fiction.

        Is this in reference to ok/OK/okay? I don't quite understand that one.

        >12) Continuity error, but I could pass it off as the class being named after him. He's the strongest teleporter around after all!

        Euclid as a teleporter classification would be okay, but then you'd need to rename: "Alia was Class 2 Euclid, but her powers didn't fall into any neat category." I'm assuming you're pulling the term from SCP. Unless Alia's powers are just so uncommon they put their hands up and went "ugh, it can go *there*." If you stick to Worm classifiers, she's a type of Breaker, probably.

        >15) You're a sheikh in Dubai, and mere skyscrapers are old hat.

        Yeah, I like the term. I like your imagery there. However, you wrote *starscapers*, not *starscRapers*. ;)

        >16) I don't quite agree here, it's just me being descriptive for the sake of the reader. He is under amnestics while in the security lobby, and used to be while in Xibalba.

        I get it. Maybe rewording the last sentence from "Nanite barriers then." to "A Nanite barrier." or something similar would be better. When I read it, the "then" in the sentence implies unfamiliarity, which doesn't make sense considering Adat's job. ...It's really nitpicky, tbh.

        >22) Offscreen magic at its finest! Keep in mind that's it a temporary fix, Alan is extremely uncomfortable. He'll have to regrow his limbs the old-fashioned way once they're done with the emergency. 

        You may want to imply time passing somewhere (again, I may have skimmed past it), as I assumed we're following Adat's day-to-day, so other stuff just going *blam we got solutions* felt a little out of left field. A sentence or paragraph of downtime going over things, I dunno. Having the external skin tied to his CNS is a good solution, but coming *ex nihilo* (heh) feels odd.

        >Well, I actually am a doctor IRL, and I happen to talk like that ;) 

        You're not a near-superhuman neural-lace enhanced doctor in a literary work, though. :\^)

  I've been looking for a good Tower-Climbing/Dungeon-Delving story, with an interesting Tower/Dungeon(s). Would anyone be able to offer a recommendation?

  I've liked the Dungeon/Tower(s) in

  **[I Woke Up As a Dungeon, Now What?](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/#post-44695393)**: I appreciated that the dungeons in this setting have a lot of design space. Each floor of a given dungeon is specialized, giving discounts for using certain types of rooms/minions and maluses to using others. However, the minions of each floor can enter neighboring floors, and floor specialties bleed into the floors immediately neighboring them. For example, a shadow floor will cause unnatural darkness not only in itself, but also in the floors above and below it. It’s a system with a lot of room to experiment, and the author has been using it well so far.

  **[The Sins of Cinnamon](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/)**: The story is dead and maybe a bit obscure nowadays, but each level of the dungeon in the story is unique, and evolves thematically from the level above it. Different levels have different rules that must be followed, and require different strategies to be developed to safely complete them.

  **[Delve](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve/chapter/368012/001-woodland)**: The dungeons in Delve are few and far between, but they also fit the bill for what I’m interested in.  They’re hellishly dangerous, unique, and require extreme care to be explored safely.

It's been a while since I read it, and I didn't end up finishing it, but I remember liking what I'd read. It's pretty well-written and characters are usually pretty smart.

    Dungeon Heart: The Singing Mountain on Kindle has some unique dungeon building. I remember it being better written than most with some good delving. I lost track of it when it moved from RR to Kindle a few years back.

    [The Concubine's Tomb](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20846/the-concubines-tomb-a-dungeon-core-novel), has a nice dungeon feel and a unique setup.

    [This dungeon Calls for a Sage](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/16679/the-dungeon-calls-for-a-sage) ,slow updates, the core is making a puzzle dungeon in order to find someone smart enough to answer it's questions.

    Are you only looking for progression stories? Because if not you could take a look at Senlin Ascends, which has the protagonist exploring a tower where every floor has a different theme. The premise is that a school teacher and his wife are out to explore the tower on their honeymoon, but the wife gets lost, and the husband has to go and find her by ascending the tower.

    > Goblin Cave is a relatively new dungeon core story, but it's the most rational take on the genre I've read so far.

    >This story starts with a core that's "made it" - it's sixty years old, fifty one floors deep, and so boring that adventurers rarely bother going past its fifth floor. As far as dungeon cores go, it's set for life.

    >And yet that's all so unfulfilling. All it does is make the numbers go up. There must be more to life - to reality - than just grinding away at the boring part of a logistical curve.

    >The System's descriptions of its monsters imply things at odds with it's experiences. Why? Is the System just lying? Or is it missing something?

    >Where do adventurers come from? Where do they go? Why are adventurers seemingly self-directed, while it's own goblins are little more than puppets made of mana?

    >What does it mean to be a dungeon? Even more, what does it feel to be a dungeon? It doesn't feel like a series of dank caves filled with goblins lacking even the most basic survival instincts. Though it is quite fond of goblins.

    >And how can it explore all of that, while still keeping itself safe from adventurers?

  Roy becomes a Witcher a few years before the main plot begins, and he has a litrpg based system to assist him. It’s very well written, and the worldbuilding actually goes quite nicely, as they draw upon plot points and lore from the games/novels, and flesh out background characters.

    Dawn of Wonder is probably the best fantasy book on Kindle Unlimited if you haven't read it already. I feel like this book is massively overlooked, and for me personally it's on the same tier as all time-top fantasy books like kkc, asoiaf, and lotr.

    well, there's always the Malazan book of the fallen, if you're looking to go all in

    Cradle, if you haven't read it already.

      Cradle, while it is written by a western author, is still cultivation, so not quite what I'm looking for
