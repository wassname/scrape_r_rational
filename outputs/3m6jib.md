  This was my favourite chapter yet. Please tell me you're doing a follow-up to this after the epilogue.

  Is anybody else annoyed that for thousands of generations of breeding swine they only have dog-intelligent swine? 

  Breeding works much faster than that.

    Well, we've been breeding dogs for thousands of generations, and they are only as smart as dogs.  Swine started from a lower point.

    Not trying to be snarky here.  Pigs really aren't that smart.  They are fantastically successful survivors though, and if a trainer knows what they are doing, they can certainly use hardwired pig instincts to train.

    Pigs have big heads, but their brains are really tiny, and a lot of the brain is devoted to sense of smell.  Their heads are so big because they use their noses as shovels and prybars.

    One of the most important sources of my information about pigs was the [Sugar Mountain Farm blog](http://sugarmtnfarm.com/).  Walter and his family are a pasture-raised pig farming operation.  No crating.  The pigs eat almost exclusively grass and whey.  They aren't castrated or fed antibiotics, or any supplements unless they are actually required for the health of the animals in the case of injury or poor health.

    If you want to see a rational pig farmer in operation, check out Sugar Mountain Farm. It's well worth the time to go there and poke through over ten years of blogs to see the frankly incredible journey that the family has gone through, and if you're interested, you can learn a huge amount about pigs while you're at it.

    This has morphed into a pretty big shout-out to Sugar Mountain Farm.  I'll say that I have no commercial relationship with them, other than a link directing people to their website, in exchange for the incredible wealth of information about pigs that I've found there.
