## [QUESTION] A Practical Guide To Evil - Extra Chapters?

### Post:

Hello everyone! 

So I want to start reading the story "A Practical Guide to Evil" but I found that there was "Extra Chapters" that aren't included in the chronological order of the book releases. Where do these fit? And when should I read each? 

Thanks in advance!

  Typically they fit into the same order as published, so just going forward with the "Next" button works.

  The vast majority of them happen before the events of the book, expanding on the backstory for the various characters.  For instance, the current extra chapters are showing the Grey Pilgrim's backstory; before that was the White Knight.

  Since they're independent of the timeline of the story, you can pretty much read them at any time, but I agree that it's probably best to read them at the point in the main story where they were published, as the events explored in the past often focus on the characters currently prominent in the main story, and offer context to their current actions.

    I disagree about reading them at any time. They don't just offer context to their current actions, but that context was explicitly missing for previous actions. Reading a prequel first is almost never a good idea; it ruins a lot of exposition and development in the earlier/original chronologically-later stories.

      There are competing philosophies: it's the L.E. Modesitt vs. Steven Brust argument.  The latter writes books to be read in any order, while the former insists that publishing order is the only way his books should be read.

      A well-written story should be able to be re-read, and improve on the second (and third and fourth) reading, as you pick up on foreshadowing and subtle character developments that you've missed.  If that's the case, reading a prequel first shouldn't spoil anything.

      That said, I don't see why you'd want to read, say, the Hanno chapters before actually meeting Hanno, or the same for Tariq, because you have no idea who that person is in context to the story yet.
