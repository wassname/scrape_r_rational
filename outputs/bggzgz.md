  I mean...it would definitely be one of the most ridiculous things I've read in the paper. I'm fairly sure there is no way in hell that they would write that and that the coroner would assume they were strangled by someone using their arms and wouldn't jump to the assumption that someone used their thighs.

  In 2013 in Oklahoma, a man and his adult stepson were doing some drinking when the son got the idea in his head that he should give his dad an atomic wedgie. The underwear became wrapped around his stepfather's throat, and he strangled to death before anything could be done. The stepson was sent to jail for manslaughter, even though he claims the whole thing was an accident. 

  The lesson here is that there is no death so stupid or implausible that someone hasn't died of it. 

  In short, yes, I'd believe it if I read that on the paper.

    While I agree that it is a possible way for someone to die I'm not sure that there is a realistic way for a coroner to identify it as a cause of death
