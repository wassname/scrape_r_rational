  I am utterly crushed by the disappointment that I need to wait another chapter before reading about Seti taking the exam. I was so hyped for it! Seti is pretty good at thinking ahead and taking advantage of the reactions people will have to the news about him being the disciple of the wind dragon.

  Really enjoying this story so far. You've chosen a lot of good hooks, and have executed them pretty well.

  Hell, I get the impression that you consciously constructed this story to be as appealing to a certain type of reader as possible. There's:

  - The incredibly underdog protagonist
  - The well-defined but still mysterious magic system
  - A promise of nearly infinite growth for our protagonist due to the existence of grit (which is extremely reminiscent of chakra exercises from Naruto or shaping exercises from MoL)

  And all of this brought together with some good characterization and conflict (both of which are often executed poorly in stories like this).

  My guess is he won't take the torch, because, well, he doesn't need it.  That'll get him some points. 
  Maybe even the golems are reliant on sight, so him being able to travel in total darkness would provide him some advantage.

  Also, it's kind of suspicious that Faulkner managed to weave into their farewell the basic information about golems. From a storytelling point it's understandable (introducing the concept just before he first meets them), but I kind of think he knew what the test would be and wanted Seti to know the basics.
