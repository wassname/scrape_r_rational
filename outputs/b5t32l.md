Does the story ever explain how fenn got all 6 loyalty points while Joon was high on unicorn blood?

  If I had to guess, I'd say that Joon more-or-less told her that [the end of this chapter](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/28298427#workskin) was going to happen.

  After all, she *didn't* get any Loyalty boosts from that, but *did* from >!such things as affectionate gestures after their relationship became more formal.  So, my guess is that (at least one or two of) the Loyalty boosts came about from letting her know ahead-of-time that he was going to ask her on a date as soon as he felt comfortable doing so.!<

  Edit:
  Other options:
  Amaryllis said that >!she would kill Fenn if she needed to.  We don't know how Joon reacted to that statement; that reaction might have been worth something!<

  The other thing Amaryllis *probably* said under the influence was that >!she would "endure" sex with Joon if she wanted him to, and Joon more than likely made it clear, as he did when she discussed it with him later, that he "would never have done anything if [he] thought that there was any chance [she] didn’t want it."!<  That itself might have been worth something as well.

    >!didn't they only talk about her ears and said there was something else that was worth 4 points but her and grak said they wouldn't talk about the rest!<

  On https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/27992157, search for "Fenn, I'm serious". The conversation following therein is what you're looking for.

    >!Well, you also said that was probably worth only a point or two, not six, so I’m left wondering where the other four or five came from,” I said. That assumed that she was right at all, but there wasn’t really a point in second-guessing her own internal sense of loyalty, not if I didn’t actually have numbers to compare it against.
    “I’ve already said too much,” replied Fenn. “I joke, but Grak and I really did decide that it was for the best that we keep our silence. He’d be awful disappointed in me.”!< I'm talking about what her and grak decided they shouldn't tell him.
