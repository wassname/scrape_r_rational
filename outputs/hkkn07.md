## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I've noticed that as I get older I'm starting to be dismissive of new games. My thinking usually goes something like: 'New game X is out, it looks cool but Y older game does all the same things and more with more content, so why should I bother with the new game..'

  &#x200B;

  It seems to me from reading some of the game recs on this thread that this happened to people older than me with older games than the ones that are a reference to me. Which is somewhat interesting enough a thought to share.

  &#x200B;

  In case you're curious the games I was thinking of were Rimworld and some other newer colony management games which just seem like worst versions of rimworld to me.

    Rimworld seems like a worse version of Dwarf Fortress to me ;-).

    I assume some of this musing is based on me mentioning that MOO1 is my favorite 4X game, as it came out in 1993. Something that you might find surprising though is that I started playing it in 2014, after having played a lot of more modern games in the genre.

    Genres also tend to have a natural trajectory to them. 4X games have gotten bigger and more complicated over time. Platformers are harder with more checkpoints. AAA shooters went from action games to story-driven to squad-based with cover mechanics and now have a pile of open world mechanics they're expected to have. Sometimes that drift is in a direction you like, sometimes it's not. As you get older, the chances that genre drift has left you behind get higher. But that also happens if you go back and play old classics, as happened to me.

    Though I think getting older makes learning complex details of new games/genres less appealing. For example I have no particular desire to learn the massive pile of rules and characters behind a modern MOBA, even though that's less than the effort it took me to learn Dwarf Fortress a dozen years ago.

      > Rimworld seems like a worse version of Dwarf Fortress to me ;-)

      Yes and no. Rimworld has a scifi setting and is open to all kinds of things you'd see in one like spaceship bases, crazy technology, evil AI enemies, space traders, genetic manipulation, human leather memes.. Also modding and all that entails.

      I'm exited for Dwarf fortress when it comes out on steam this year, until then all it does for me is to be content for somewhat interesting youtube videos.. But yes I don't doubt it's better or just as good, but with the settings differing there's room for both to coexist somewhat filling different niches.

      > Genres also tend to have a natural trajectory to them. 4X games have gotten bigger and more complicated over time.

      I think you are likely overestimating how complex the new 4x games are. It's just a higher learning curve but the gameplay is basically the same. i.e read a few more paragraphs of in game descriptions of tech and units before playing.

      Personally I find Civ 6 to be good, not better than Civ 5 vox populi but still fairly good.

      PS. Mods make a big difference, and should not be overlooked. It matters very little if one game is technically worst than another without mods. We are playing on PC, mods are a given.
      ```

      - u/jtolmar:
        ```
        I'm actually pretty interested in Civ 6, but last I heard the AI was pretty weak, and I haven't heard of any mods that fix it.

        The reason I don't care for complexity in 4X games isn't the learning curve (I already know the genre, so it's not that big of a deal). Rather, it's that the complexity so often adds extra decisions between the ones that actually matter.  Like in Civ to get a city to full productivity you have to build all the available hammer-boosting and food-boosting buildings, and in MOO to get a planet to full productivity you just max the industrialize slider. There's the same decision ("get node to full productivity"), but in one version you also have to click a bunch and maybe solve some trivially easy math puzzle on the way.
        ```

        - u/fassina2:
          ```
          That's because nodes in civ are more complex and serve different purposes over time. There's times when you want to build a wander or pop out a settler then you optimize production, most of the time you want growth so you optimize for that. Instead of this node's optimal state is X so it should always do X and when it's optimized I don't want to bother with it again.

          But yes you need to build the infrastructure, it's one of the most fun parts of the game for some people. There are also more victory types, like culture, religion, science etc. Sure the optimal strategy tends to be cripple everybody else with war and diplomacy then win by default but there are interesting ways to challenge yourself you can set up.

          Search Martin Fenka, he does Civ V vox populi playthroughs, the difference is he does them on deity and generally with some big limitation like avoiding war at all costs, or winning with only one city. 

          There's a large number of people that can play on deity but most just do the cripple everyone through war then win strategy, he's the only one I'm aware of that actually does things in a more interesting way, granted it involves optimization to an immense degree but it's more interesting than most.

      > 4X games have gotten bigger and more complicated over time.

      In my experience as a fanatic paradox fan, 4X games have gotten bigger, but less complicated. I love Victoria 2 and its janky economy to death, but as much as EU4's mana system irritates me it is simply a much cleaner game. Compare also CIV 5 to CIV 6, with the district system replacing the old tile/city improvements system.

  There are multiple problems with the US systems of government (*r/rational rules reminder: No discussion whatsoever of US politics.*). I've been considering an alternative to the "elected representatives versus direct democracy" false choice (while retaining democratic principles).

  **With elected representatives**, there is the ideal that society selects some of its best and brightest, and allows them to dedicate their full attention to the needs of society, and who could in principle even save society from its own misguided opinions. That of course ignores complications such as needing to campaign, needing funding for campaigning, needing to apply spin, needing to form a tribal-minded base of support, how rhetoric can be unduly enticing to voters, and how voters can be mislead, particularly with regards to topics they are not experts in, and have no time nor funding (nor perhaps will) to pursue expertise in, particularly given the broad range of important topics that come up. The voter must decide their vote, considering each candidate as an atomic bundle of positions, moralities, philosophies, and diplomatic baggage.

  **With direct democracy**, policy questions are posed directly to the people. Such events are by necessity relatively rare: the average voter does not have the time, funding, and/or will to perform an in-depth review of many policy questions, and in many cases, the voter may not care. The votes cast by a single voter are unlikely to change a policy decision; the likely outcome from great personal investment in educating oneself on the breadth and nuance of a policy issue is nothing, at least in terms of the voter's own single vote. In principle, voters could amicably discuss such matters and thereby disseminate any insights gained; in practice, many (including this subreddit) actively avoid discussing political matters due to the emotion, pride, and identity-entanglement that too often characterizes such discussion. Attempts to influence the outcome of direct democracy may target the average voter, who has reduced means (e.g., limited time and lacking proactive education on the matter) to defend themselves (and their society) from bad-faith arguments.

  **Apart from direct democracy and political representatives**, our society does use at least one other mechanism: the [filtered] random selection of peers, such as to fill a jury. In the case of a jury, the government establishes at least minimal concern to avoid undue hardship placed upon the jury, and in return asks the jury to represent their society to perform an in-depth analysis of a specific question and return a verdict. I suggest that such a mechanism could be applied to questions of policy, where each policy question can be posed to a sufficient sample of citizens. Perhaps an expert arguer is assigned to each relevant position to be decided, and a rudimentary grounding in the general principles of this 'policy jury' is provided, with standardized rules and guidelines, and an oversight official such as a judge. Such a scheme does still rely upon elected or appointed officials, but does at least place the power of the final decision in the hands of 'the people', and does so in a way that promotes and supports at least hearing genuine and competent counterarguments.

  **One variant derived from the above** official jury is the informal organization of collectives of individuals, within which people volunteer their time to dig into policy questions, sharing the burden of self-education, and relying upon mutual respect within the group, as well as perhaps the participation of competing viewpoints to help provide balance. This is a way to mitigate the onerous burden of self-education on every question of policy while retaining a measure of rational consideration on the whole.

    This sounds great but is full of massive holes.  

    1. The biggest problem is who decides what the issues are and how to frame them.  That takes expertise, and without representation there is no check on their power.  You wave away framing issues even though a massive amount of our political computing power goes to this and exactly this problem.
    2. Who appoints the issue judge?  Who assigns the "expert arguer?"  Is the effectiveness of these experts measured?  By who?  If your answer is "by computers," that just gives enormous power to the people who write the algorithms.
    3. You're assuming jury selection is fair.  Juries lay both harsher criminal penalties than judges, and generally less concerned with issues of rights.
    4. Random selection means that inevitably some issues will wind up with vastly irregular views on issues.  For instance, it's entirely possible that a group tasked with overseeing our nations infrastructure could fill with train fanatics who decided to end highways.
    5. Who safeguards the system to prevent from tampering?
    6. Some issues are impossible for the vast majority of non-specialists to research.  How many people understand the difference between Neo-Keynesian Economics, MMT, and Supply Side?

    Even if all the mechanisms worked out right, without people seizing power (which it wouldn't) all the money and influence would just move to the fourth estate.

    &#x200B;

    Variant: Having voluntary issue selection means that only fanatics and people with a financial stake in each issue will engage with the issue.  Think the SLS rocket.  (This is how congressional committees work.)
    ```

  - u/ExiledQuixoticMage:
    ```
    I don't actually think any of the issues in the current system are solved through the adoption of a policy jury.  Either the jury is truly random, in which case you end up with roughly the same result as you would have in a direct democracy, or the filtering ends up becoming a political question that dominates the eventual outcome.  I think the latter is most likely.  You'd simply see a new version of the concept of [regulatory capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture) occur with these juries.

    Additionally, I would argue that our current system is fairly close to a jury system in some regards, and that that is the reason for some of it's flaws.  Essentially, members of congress often don't have the time or inclination to become experts themselves, so they are instead governed by the position relevant stakeholders bring to them.  Naturally, corporations and other organized entities have an outsized capacity to bring coherent ideas to congresspeople in format that they can easily implement (up to corporations literally writing the legislation that will be implemented to regulate them).  A policy jury would fall afoul of the same problem, where the corporations with the biggest stake in the issue would exercise significant control over the outcome by consulting for the people ostensibly making the decisions.
    ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    An optimal government system would heavily weigh long term optimization over short term gains. I don't think most people are capable of thinking in that manner. 

    &#x200B;

    What we'd likely see is something akin to what we already have, with policy heavily focusing on short term gains, but instead of it being caused by the need for re election it'd be caused by the natural human tendencies to focus on the short term at the cost of the long term.

    &#x200B;

    There are humans capable of this kind of thinking, but they are not the majority or even a significant percentage of the population. Which means most democratic systems will tend to be sub optimal. 

    &#x200B;

    What we need is something better, probably AI and algorithms with heavy human oversight rather than relying on our flawed brains.

      The random selection from a pool of those who respond to invitations does risk self-selection bias.

    I was actually playing with some similar ideas a few years ago! Specifically I was thinking about the difference between polls and direct democracy after the Brexit vote. If a poll can predict the result within an acceptable degree of accuracy, why not just do the poll? And what actually is the percent error on a referendum (would the extremely close Brexit vote have been different if it happened a day earlier or later)?

    Decision by randomly sampled poll is quite similar to decision by jury. I didn't think of actually electing that jury into a working group and having them research until they could come up with policy, though (which is a very interesting idea btw). My thoughts at the time were more based on using permanent organizations of experts. I think I like your version better.

    In case it's interesting to folks, the toy model I was thinking of four years ago was to divide political questions into two categories - values judgements and policy questions. Values judgements (how much inequality is allowable? retribution vs crime reduction? whose rights get protected?) are determined by routine random poll (conducting and communicating the results of polls is one of the branches of government). The goal of policy is to produce outcomes according to these values. The policy branch of the government produces pilot programs with measurable impacts, tries them, and expands the ones that succeed. Both are kept in check by the possibility of a vote of no confidence leading to a replacement of the leadership.

    We have the resources now to use a hybrid system. For instance, we could do direct democracy through blockchain voting (starting up a new blockchain architecture every so often to prevent the calculation lag BTC now faces) for big picture direction questions like, "Do we go to war" or, "Do we invest heavily in anti-aging medical research." Then, we could have people with degrees in relevant fields be making decisions about how resources are distributed within their fields. Ideally, this means only experts are ever deciding important things like how best to handle climate change, and everyone else handles things which they are actually qualified to.

      I would not trust people at large to abstain from votes that they have not sufficiently studied. On the contrary, I would expect to find encouragement for laypeople to vote, with some bad-faith or simply confused argumentation be made to "rile up the base".

      That is part of why I suggest conscripting some people at random onto the jury, and forcing the 'case' upon them for consideration, as a civic duty.

  Sort of rational but definitely unpopular, so, putting it here: I've completely given up on WtC. And it's because it's too rational.

  What I mean is, it is too *self aware* in it's rationality. My breaking point was a while back, some speech of Amaryllis's, after the clones thing, where... I don't even remember right now what she was talking about but it felt like the author was slapping me in the face with How Fucking Rational everything is.

  I just *couldn't* anymore.

  I like rational just fine. I finished HPMOR. I like it when things make sense and people act like people and make sensible decisions and the progression of events is logical. I can't even put into words what it was with that scene or that story, and I know disliking WtC is like heresy here, so, sorry, I just really needed to get this off my chest.

   I had a bad time and kind of snapped on something that has all the hallmarks of something I should be able to enjoy but can't anymore.

        * In chapter 6 McGonagall says it's unusual and unhealthy for Harry to be as paranoid as he is. Harry's rejoinder about the planning fallacy includes several hypothetical catastrophes that actually happened in canon, including: death eaters attacking the school, students getting bitten, and Sirius Black escaping Azkaban. It's a joke about how none of the responsible adults in canon effectively prepared for or protected against those events.

        * Chapter 7 makes a joke at canon!Harry's expense, since canon!Harry was nearly late due to not knowing where to find Platform 9^3/4 : *Maybe this was the equivalent of an IQ test and the stupid kids couldn't become wizards. (And the amount of extra time you gave yourself would determine your Conscientiousness, which was the second most important factor in scholarly success.)*

        * In chapter 14 Harry has a rational response to learning about the existence of the Chamber of Secrets which directly pokes fun at the kids' actions in canon: *"It's obvious if you're not a Gryffindor," Harry said kindly.*

        * Same scene in chapter 14, Harry casts shade on the illogical way house points are awarded in canon: *Harry shook his head again. "It's not fair to the other children if I earn lots of points for grownup things that I can be part of and they can't."*

        * In chapter 39 Harry makes fun of canon Dumbledore's 'wise' talks: *Well, sounding wise wasn’t difficult. It was a lot easier than being intelligent, actually, since you didn’t have to say anything surprising or come up with any new insights. You just let your brain’s pattern-matching software complete the cliche, using whatever Deep Wisdom you’d stored previously.* (I've seen people interpret that whole discussion of deathism as insulting canon.)

        * In chapter 63 an unnamed character points out the absurdity of the Molly/Bellatrix duel in canon: *Ron Weasley said loudly, “Get in line, you lot, I got an owl from Mum this morning, she says to tell everyone she’s called dibs” and someone said “ Molly Weasley against Bellatrix Black? Who does she even think she’s kidding -”*

        * In chapter 74 Harry insults the intelligence of canon!Harry for trying to steal from the restricted section of the library: *He had decided some time ago against trying to sneak into the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library, for much the same reason he’d decided a year earlier not to look up how to make explosives out of common household materials. Harry prided himself on at least having more sense than people thought he did.*

        * Chapter 84 casts shade on canon!Dumbledore's claim that talking about trauma in the immediate aftermath is therapeutically beneficial.

        * Chapter 100 makes fun of canon!Harry's response to learning about the 'side effects' of drinking unicorn blood:
        Canon: *“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re going to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”*
        HPMOR:*“Side effects? Side effects? What kind of side effect is medically worse than DEATH?”*

        * Also in chapter 100, Harry points out the absurdity of hiring Hagrid to teach Care of Magical Creatures.

        * Chapter 107-109 >!makes fun of the canon obstacles protecting the Philosopher's Stone. For example: *"Nope," Harry said after skimming the parchment.

  OKAY SO this is one of those anecdotes that requires a lot of setup and has very little payoff, which is great becuase it's basically how i communicate, so it'll not come as a surprise to anyone who has seen me around.

  the scene: The Christmas Market, La Defense, Paris, France, late November 2019. 

  the background that got me here: I have just seen my now-LDR partner Mathieu for the last time before I return to Australia to live in the Real World. I spent about 45 minutes on the metro to get from central Paris to La Defense, crying quite a bit because it was a sad situation. I'd arranged to meet my other-now-LDR partner Jacques for lunch in La Defense, which is where he works. We had lunch at Chipotle, because vegan food + france is a non-starter. His lunch break was over and I decided to check out the aforementioned Christmas Market. 

  the story:

  I was looking through the stalls trying to see if there was anything appropriately tacky for me to buy (there wasn't), when I found a stall selling vegan food (what!). It was a small and kind of crummy stall, the sort of thing you might find at markets here, but they were selling a sort of chickpea on bread concoction (which they called raclettes, in the traditional vegan style of naming something after something non-vegan which only serves to disappoint vegans and make non-vegans think vegans are delusional as to what non-vegan food tastes like). I want to impress upon you how much a vegan stall in a French market is an aberration. I wanted to buy their "raclettes", even if I knew they would taste like some sort of hummus analogue rather than the melted cheese they were implying. But I was full and they were expensive. But, like most of the other stalls, they sold mulled wine!

  I don't drink alcohol. Ever. It's just not my thing. But I'm texting Jacques about this, and he's responding to me regularly. I had also texted Mathieu but he was in a meeting at work or something so he hadn't responded.

  Jacques said to me, "mulled wine isn't alcoholic! we give it to children!" 

  So I bought the mulled wine, thinking I'd have a nice warm beverage treat and support the vegan stall with my money (four euro, IIRC). Plus I described it to Jacques so he could try it out for lunch one day (he hates cheese in all forms, once again proving that the Alsace region his genetic heritage hails from is actually rightfully German), but I was convinced that their attempt at replicating it would fall flat enough that he could eat it (plus, he was a fan of hummus, so a warm hummus sandwich was the sort of thing that would go down well). Aside: he said it tasted terrible, but not because it tasted like cheese, but just because it was bad in general. 

  I start drinking the mulled wine. It's nice and warm and spicy, but I can tell it's alcoholic because it has that sharp, alcohol taste. I can feel it start to go to my head. I text Jacques and ask him if he's sure it's non alcoholic. I text my polycule group chat and explain that I'm drinking mulled wine and Jacques told me it wasn't alcoholic. I text Mathieu, who is a fellow vegan teetoler and will thus completely understand my drive to support a vegan business while not drinking alcohol, and tell him I bought the mulled wine but I'm worried it's alcoholic, but it can't be because Jacques said they give it to children.

  I get a text message from Kaylee, my husband's girlfriend, saying "yeah nah mulled wine is alcoholic", and her partner Bradley chimes in, "yes, definitely alcoholic". 

  Mathieu texts me back, his meeting over, and says "yeah, it's alcoholic. we do give it to children but it's alcoholic"

  Jacques texts me back, "I've talked to my coworkers and yes it's alcoholic"

  The stubborn stingy person I am, I keep drinking it. It's warm and I'm cold. I paid four euro for it and I'm not going to waste it. 

  So that is how I end up tipsy as fuck wandering around the La Defense train station, which actually worked out well because it completely distracted me from the fact that I was miserable about saying goodbye to Mathieu.

      I think the vegan-teetotaller crossover is not as big as you think, in dating it's really hard to find vegan men who don't drink and/or don't use marijuana (I avoid the devil's lettuce for the same reasons as alcohol). Like, in fact, I liked Mathieu on OKC because he was marked as vegan and non-drinker and I liked Jacques partly because his profile was a "greatest hits" of /r/rational and partly because he'd marked himself as a non-drinker  (turns out much like cheese he just doesn't enjoy  the taste of alcohol). 

      But it's probably all borne from the same "healthy living" effect that causes the crossover with gluten free.

  In the story I'm currently writing, I have an odd urge to try to crowbar in some mention of how the numbers 1.41378245 and -0.897371411 have something in common; and how they inexorably lead to the number 0.943635485+0.218233871i. ... Assuming I got the math right. (My initial estimates were that they were somewhere around 1.4, -0.9, and 0.9+0.2i, so I'm reasonably confident I haven't gone *too* far wrong.)


  >!If you look at a [picture](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Binet-Fibonacci-Curve_fig6_318785379) of the Binet-Fibonacci curve, it's where the loop crosses the spiral; the 1.413th and -8.987th Fibonacci numbers are both 0.943+0.218i. I have absolutely no idea what use these numbers are, but I haven't been able to find anyone else on the internet who's ever mentioned it. !<

    If the numbers are suitably irrational it might make a good seed for a encryption key useful between copies and put on a sticker to point out what math is being used.  I'll have to read up on the Binet-Fibonacci curve I'm not familiar with it.

    Are you sure it's not 1.41421 = sqrt(2) and -0.894427 = -2/sqrt(5)?  Your decimal values are only different by 0.1%, and those are some pretty simple and common values.
    ```

    - u/DataPacRat:
      ```
      Quite sure; I actually expected them to be that simple myself. :)

      I just doublechecked with WolframAlpha's Mathematica, and sqrt(2) would lead to 0.943510+0.218270i ; while -2/sqrt(5) would lead to 0.941078+0.223949i. They just don't quite match up.

      (Mind you, for story-plot purposes, they might make for a dandy pair of false leads, if I can drop some initial hints of only two digits of accuracy...)

  Does anyone here play 4X strategy games? I'm looking for a new one. My favorite is the original Master Of Orion for how streamlined it is - I tried going back to Civ after and the whole game feels like dull micromanagement by comparison. But I'm finally wearing MOO out after a couple hundred hours played, so something new would be nice.

  ---

  Bit of a stretch to ask here, but if anyone has any recommendations for far-left humor forums, I could use a new one. I didn't realize just how much of my ability to cope with the state of US politics was based on having CTH around, but they're gone now so a lot of things are catching up to me that used to slide off my back.

  ---

  Finally, I'd like to recommend [A Collection Of Unmitigated Pedantry](https://acoup.blog/), a historian's look at media depictions of medieval and ancient Europe. He has a "resources for worldbuilders" index that would be of interest to a lot of folks here, but it's also just a really comfortable introduction to some concepts in the study of history that a lot of pop-history misses out on. Tons of fascinating stuff in there.

  (I'll repost in the main rec thread but I forgot last week.)

        Hmmm. I'm not a fan of Civ V & VI, tbh, so I won't recommend those. Endless Legend (fantasy) and Endless Space 2 aren't perfect, but they, along with Civ IV, is what I usually install when I get an itch to play a 4X game. They are definitely more complicated than MOO1, though.

        On the lighter 4X end, I really like Civ Revolution, but it's only available on mobile and Nintendo DS (which is what I play it on.) Other 4X-lite-ish games that I like are Space Tyrant and Antihero.

        > Is breadnroses invite/pay only? I don't see any threads.

        Yeah, I think. It went free a few ago because SomethingAwful almost imploded. I guess find someone who'll invite you? :)

        But there will probably be a standalone forum set up for CTH refugees in a week or two.

          I'll give Endless Legend a try! Apparently I already own it and never got around to it. Thanks!

          If you like lighter 4X games (really more of a 3X game), I recommend [Slipways](https://krajzeg.itch.io/slipways). And if you like that I recommend my own [Space Trains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRJP0tie-30).

          > I guess find someone who'll invite you? :)

          I'd appreciate it. I'm curious, but it's hard to say whether I'd gel with a forum without being able to read any of their posts.

          > But there will probably be a standalone forum set up for CTH refugees in a week or two.

          Yeah, I'm following along on that effort on their discord.

    An interesting 4x game that is often overlooked is [Distant Worlds: Universe](https://store.steampowered.com/app/261470/Distant_Worlds_Universe/). Looks like it's on sale right now, so it's totally worth it; I think part of the reason why it's not particularly well known is because it was almost never on sale when it came out. 

    What makes the game interesting is that it's a 4x game, but not turn-based; it's real-time with pause. 

    Also, your government will basically run itself (poorly) if left alone, so you can totally just run off and go explore the galaxy while directly controlling a single ship if you want to.

    Edit: it's apparently been like six years since I played the game, and from looking at the recent reviews ~~there's a decent chance it won't run on Windows 10~~ it may or may not run on Win10. It worked for me, but there's plenty of unhappy people in the reviews complaining that it doesn't work - so be ready to refund it if you buy it.

    Double edit: since I have both Windows 10 and the game, I figured I might as well install it and see if it really doesn't work. Seems fine to me?
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      Shame about it not working on Windows 10. Would be a pretty annoying hurdle if it also ran on Linux, but it doesn't, so I'm not sure how you're even supposed to play the game.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        It does work for sample size 1 (me), but there's angry people in the reviews. Just buy it thru Steam and refund if it doesn't work for you.

    I've been hooked on Dominions 5 for 9 month now, recently started playing online multiplayer. 

    Cons:   very high learning curve, bad graphics, bad UI 

    Pros: Very deep gameplay, counters+counter-counters etc, active community, deep strategic decisions even before the game (pretender design)

    Lucid tactics, Attica, Generalconfusion are youtubers who have videos on the game.

    I used to frequent /r/Dankleft, but a maoist mod banned me for having rented out a room in my house in the past. I am not quite sure if the people there actually advocate killing all landlords or if that's a meme to them.

    I love /r/ShermanPosting, and you will too if Unionist, anti-slaver Civil War shitposting is something you enjoy.

    /r/coolamericafacts features super niche leftist memes meant to trick people into learning about American atrocities. Amusing for sure, but doesn't scratch the same itch.

    /r/therightcantmeme is pretty good, as is the slightly more niche /r/toiletpaperusa. Neither are really leftist communities, they just make fun of righties.

    /r/SelfAwarewolves and /r/leopardsatemyface are also quite good.

    Have you tried MOO2? That's usually been my go-to for space 4X. (I also have a fondness for Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, but that's got roughly the same complexity as the Civs.)
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:

      I played MOO2 briefly and sort of bounced off it. Have you played MOO1? If so, what makes you like MOO2 more?

      I actually haven't played SMAC yet, maybe I should try it.

      - u/DataPacRat:

        > If so, what makes you like MOO2 more?

        Well, for one, back in the day, it was a lot easier to cheat at. >;)

        More seriously - it's just about the epitome of a good sequel; it takes just about everything that was fun in MOO1, and adds further choices and game-level interactions around them. You can play a simple, MOO1-like game - or get deep into the weeds customizing your species, the galaxy, which parts of the tech-tree to focus on, ship-design, tactics, and so forth.

        > I actually haven't played SMAC yet, maybe I should try it.

        I like SMAC at least as much for the setting as the gameplay; you might want to watch some of the [secret-project videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8407FAE1DDDA0A31), read the Paean to SMAC (starting [here](https://paeantosmac.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/introduction/)), go over some of the [strategy guides](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/96102-sid-meiers-alpha-centauri/faqs), and find copies of the GURPS supplement, comic, and novel trilogy...

        ... or go old-style, and just dive right in and learn as you go, the way we all used to have to learn video games. :)
        ```

        - u/jtolmar:
          ```
          I think my ideal MOO1 sequel might actually take stuff away from it ;-).

          Paean to SMAC certainly looks interesting, thanks!
          ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    There's an entire genre of MOO-inspired 4X out there: Galactic Civilizations, StarDrive, Stellaris, Star Traders... though tbh I'd be hard pressed to pick one out that's got less micromanagement than MOO1, so YMMV I guess.

    For the record I'll note that [Caster Of Magic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250690/Master_of_Magic_Caster_of_Magic/), a huge collection of fixes and rebalancings for Master of Magic, is now on Steam ;)

    There's an emerging genre of FTLlikes that might be more up your street - these tend to focus more on exploration that the other Xs, but the best are a mix of both, and by and large are much more streamlined than the MOO-heritage lot. Maybe try Halcyon 6 to see if that scratches an itch.
