  Political messes, past and present.  And Jumping Spider makes her first appearance in person.

  Fun to revisit the verse, although I wish it had been a bit longer. Not much happened, and I didn't feel like there was any advancement to plot or significant character impact.

    I sympathize--pacing is a tradeoff when a novel is serialized a chapter at a time.  When it's complete, readers won't have to wait two weeks to turn the page and find out what happens next 8-)
