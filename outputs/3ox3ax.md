  Dammit Scott, I've been working on a story based on that logic puzzle for months now, and I'm about two days into this short and it's already 10x better. *shakes fist at ~~heaven~~ volcano*

    I'm interested in seeing it if you want to share.

        Wait, you are!?

        Holy crap, everyone is here.  Creepy.

        THE CABAL IS HERE.

  I wonder if the only reason that no-one has induced a self-improvement loop by consuming more and more sparkroot is because everyone concludes, past a certain amount of sparkroot, that if it were possible to induce a self-improvement loop by consuming more and more sparkroot, someone would have already, which has clearly not happened, and therefore the risk of death-by-overdose infinitely outweighs the potential for a self-improvement loop.

  Clearly we need to force-feed someone indefinite amounts of sparkroot to see what happens.  If the answer is "they die", then we add an entry to the Tablets Of Enku that says "don't eat too much sparkroot" and then never speak of it again.

    that line about terrible sickness afterwards seem to be specifically included for this very purpose. Short overdose is possible, but at cost.
    ```

    - u/satanistgoblin:
      ```
      One would eat enough sparkroot to find a cure for symptoms of overdose?
      ```

        Not necessarily, sparkroot makes you think a bit faster/clearer but it doesn't allow you to magically acquire information from nowhere.
        ```

          Well it looks like it does kinda? "Upon my first taste of sparkroot I knew volcanoes are upswellings of magma in the crust" - 

          either sparkroot allows you to integrate all of the sensory data you have ever acquired to coherent models upon models - with the implication that normal human sensors are good enough to get plate tectonics, which I highly doubt - or you get extrasensory data.

            You can get Newtonian gravity from the motion of visible planets and the sun. You can get a rough idea of phase transitions and thermodynamics by watching cookery. Matter appears to be preserved in all understood cases.

            Volcanoes physically grow during an eruption. Magma cools into rock, and appears in the caldera. Since matter can't just be created, it makes sense that it came from below. Since rock and magma are the same, and the Earth is huge, and the caldera narrow, the layer of solid rock has to be thin compared to the size of the Earth, since a column of magma below the volcano can remain molten for centuries. So it makes sense that the solid rock is but a crust, and the magma came up from below for some reason.
            ```

            - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
              ```
              Yeah no, I'm not buying it. Sure, molten rock comes out of the earth -  but "upswelling of magma in the earths mantle" - nah, thats too big of a leap. 

              >the layer of solid rock has to be thin compared to the size of the Earth
              Privileging the hypothesis. 

              How do you infer a layer of solid rock at all? 

              Equally possible is a fully solid earth with a single spot where unknown processes create lots of heat

      Gonna come clean - I read the story very quickly and forgot that line.

  Beautiful, but the simplest solution would have been to cut everyone's (E: left) eyes out on the first day.
  ```

  - u/avret:
    ```
    I guess that is the...

    *Sunglasses*

    optical solution.

    *Brief pause*

    Oh god why did I put sunglasses on over empty eye sockets it burns why

  - u/adad64:
    ```
    Didn't the law say eyes? You realy only need to remove one.
    ```

  - u/diraniola:
    ```
    But would that have been the *optimal* solution?
    ```

  - u/lvwolb:
    ```
    How would that have solved anything? They already knew each other's eye colors.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Do they have sufficient medical care so as not to die from gouging out their eyes?
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:

      Ask Scott.

- u/notmy2ndopinion:
  ```
  I feel like there is an allegory on introspective self-awareness, touching the edges of this...

  >“Who even decides these things!” she asked. “Why is it wrong to know your own eye color?”

  >“The eye is the organ that sees,” said Calkas. “It’s how we know what things look like. If the eye knew what it itself looked like, it would be an infinite cycle, the eye seeing the eye seeing the eye seeing the eye and so on. Like dividing by zero. It’s an abomination. That’s why the Volcano God, in his infinite wisdom, said that it must not be.”

  Also, somewhere on the island, there HAS to be a child with a canoe, a bag of corn, a duck and a fox.

  I can't escape the association of a certain other intellectually gifted tribe that also denies mixing with Europeans, sacrifices body parts and worships a volcano demon.

  So... everyone seems pretty chill about killing the Spanish guy, even though they killed him due to a law they no longer believe in, and the fact that he ended up making their lives better.

    They live in a very un-empathetic society, and to some extent practice orange/blue morality.

    They haven't really internalized the change in morals yet.

  I'm thinking the blue-eyed islander problem out and I'm thinking that the following things are true:

  * If you, as an outsider, convince the islanders collectively of any *true* statement that implies that there's at least one blue-eyed islander, all the blue-eyed islanders will leave the island.
  * If you, as an outsider, convince the islanders collectively of any *false* statement that implies that there's at least one blue-eyed islander, they will collectively correct themselves, realizing that it's false.  Probably no one will leave the island.  (EDIT: Or maybe everyone leaves the island?!  IDK, I think my original conclusion was false now that I'm thinking about it more.)
