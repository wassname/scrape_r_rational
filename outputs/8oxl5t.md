  I think a lot of readers (including myself) got really excited for a flashy final showdown without realizing the consequences of it: if Cat had stayed and fought 10 heroes by herself, she would have lost and Callow would have been broken. While we all enjoyed the 'heroics' of Akua, it's nice to Cat robbing the Heroes of their narrative momentum once again. 

  It's even hinted at in the last chapter, when one of the heroes talked about the eyes of the Gods being upon them. It's a familiar climax to a familiar pattern: a final showdown to end all final showdowns, and the heroes would arise victorious after slaying the Black Queen.

  Now, Cat gets to win practically. It's pretty clear by now that the only way for Evil to effect lasting change is by winning in small ways. This is Black's education in practice—Cat needs to impact the institutions (i.e. Rozala) and not the Named.

    This - Cat isn't playing by their rules. She's looking more so at the meta level (ie. narrative, plot, literary flow) in order to act. She saw that the heroes were starting to have narrative weight behind their actions and swiftly moved to cut it off. 

    In truth, I doubt that Pilgrim even understands that he's part of a story - he certainly doesn't act like it. This meta-level (near fourth-wall breaking) knowledge puts Cat 5 steps in front of the competition in terms of tactics and success.

    I'd say that Black has a pretty good choice in successors if Cat is able to maintain this lead.

    It also sets up a really nice contrast with Akua. Akua might have been able to force a win, but Ca realised that even having the fight was a mistake.
    ```

    - u/werafdsaew:
      ```
      I don't think Akua could have won, as victory in the face of overwhelming odds is how Heroes triumph over Villains.

  Here I've been refreshing, do you have it scripted?

  Edit:
  As to the chapter, well . . . I think Cat just trumped her past actions for pure audacity, and cemented her Role as a sane monarch who cares for ~~her~~ all people

    many of us have tried but failed, I think the script theory is possible

      I just come to both r/rational and r/PGtE and start refreshing the EE's wordpress at about 4:00 UTC. It's kind of like trying to leave home without checking the stove: I *do* try to visit other webpages, but every few seconds I'm hit with a wave of doubt about whether I refreshed it *really recently*, until I read the chapter and my brain acknowledges that. Well, that, or I've fallen asleep too late the day before and sleep until 11 AM.

  This was ballsy as all hell, and shows that Catherine is really *desperately* trying to outgrow her old mentor's teachings. There were sooo many number of ways this could have gone badly. The heroes could have just ignored the truce banner and heaven wouldn't give them any flak for it. Cat could've fallen deeper into winter at Malanza claiming to be the *victim*. Malanza could have seen too much red to even contemplate a retreat. *All* of this stuff *almost* happened. 

  It's like threading the needle of fate through a keyhole you can't even see...

      Gods we're the readers and we can *feel* the sheer scathing fury at these kind of remarks... can you imagine what Cat, who herself has *been through* these events and is currently seeing her people get killed by these invaders and then hearing them *justify* it, all the while just in the back of her head an eldrich entity screams for their blood, has to go through? She just showed some of the best self control I've seen from a character period.

    > desperately trying to outgrow her old mentor's teachings

    Black's tactics worked great when he was an unamiguous capital V Villain going up against capital H Heroes. But Cat has more flexibility because due to both her position as queen of callow and her fae mantle instead of a name she has a kind of flexibility where she can place herself in different roles in the narrative
    ```

- u/ForgottenToupee:
  ```
  It’s kinda disappointing that we as the readers know that any peace talks either won’t work or won’t last.  Cat owes Larat crowns, and that oath coupled with the existence of the Princes Graveyard means that Procer has a smack down coming. 

  BUT, that means we get to (hopefully) guess where things go from here. I think this battle is probably over, but the Crusade likely won’t end just yet. 

  Events that are being juggled right now: 

  1) Black’s battle in the Vales with Pappenheim (also Warlock vs Witch)
  2) The Dead King is in communication with someone (likely Malicia, or possibly Tyrant)
  3) The Free Cities are getting ready to pick a fight (probably Procer)
  4) The Watch  is on the march, and with Cat up they’re ready to be ported 

  And I think that’s it? The demon of Absence is probably dealt with, in-universe the last time one broke it no one realized for a century or two, so I doubt will see anything come of that

  - u/TaltosDreamer:
    ```
    I think we potentially have a battle with the rat monsters if the crusaders weaken themselves.  Catherine isnt likely to stand by while people are slaughtered.  A potential civil war in Procer would do the trick.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    If this is the Battle of the Camps then the Peace talks could work for this specific battle.
    ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  This is now the third time that Cat has shown the heroes her heels. It makes sense given her goals, but damned if I'm not looking forward to Catherine finding an enemy that she can kill with a clean conscience.

    If Saint picks the stupid fight, I think we got a winner.

    Saint be forced to make a desperate gamble, because if this Northern expedition fails, so does the Tenth Crusade. And its been established that this is her last one.
    ```

    - u/akaltyn:
      ```
      > if this Northern expedition fails, so does the Tenth Crusade.

      Does it? There are other ways they can reach Praes, albeit probably in smaller numbers, especially if Cat is willing to allow them passage
      ```

      - u/IDKWhoitis:
        ```
        The Northern passage was one of  Hasenbachs trump cards. If the army is turned back, and sealed off, then the Vales are the only option. Short of White Knight and Iron Prince breaking Black, the crusade is pretty screwed.

        Black may "lose" to White (thus gaining narrative weight to do something downright brutal later on). But White vs Cat, its more likely that White dies rather than Cat in that confrontation.

        This is excluding Dead King opening up a 3rd front, which will end this crusade rather brutally. I can totally see Black and Cat teaming up with Crusaders to shut him down, since even Black fears that particular abomination.
        ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Is there any way the Procer army can do anything but surrender?

  Heroes aside, they're absolutely screwed. They're in the middle of nowhere, with no food left, and the nearest city is... a week of march away, I think? That's leaving aside that Cat can make a series of fortification on the crusaders' path to force them to stay in battle formation and slow them down, without ever engaging them, thanks to the Arcadia gates. And even if they reach Hedges, they have to siege the city (which they clearly don't have the manpower or time to do) before they can claim any supplies.

  They're super duper done.
  ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    Heroic last charge to try and defeat the evil Queen? Noble sacrifice is a big story beat.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, but it's not like they can sacrifice hard enough to solve the food problem. Or even stop the Army of Callow from retreating to Hedges.
      ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        No food problem if everyone's dead!
        ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  A leftover thought from the last chapter: what if all the redemption talk from Akua is the set-up for her plan to escape her bindings?

  Diabolist seemed to genuinely consider her actions heroic, so the obvious thought is that she's trying to make herself look like a champion for the Callowan side of the conflict, either as Catherine's "follower" or as a narrative leverage to be unleashed at some point. What if she's aware of the greater scope of the coming conflict, and now aims for a redemption story and a common enemy to bring her into the resulting band of five Named? Akua has no way to know about the Witch of the Forest, since she had no previous connection to White Knight's band (or the outside world in general), and the other major practitioner Named all have their respective bands. Even if she suspects the Heavens might have propped up a mage to match Warlock at Red Flower Vales, she might have banked on them dying anyway.

  That way, if Catherine ends up maing a truce with Procer (and tries to unseat the Empress, as Akua suspects), she can either return to Praes with a conquering army, putting herself back into prominence (maybe even as a new Chancellor, given her political connections), or fight whatever new opponents emerge, making herself indisposable.

  I'm not saying that's a good plan, but it might look feasible from Akua's perspective. Why do you think would she make an attempt at a redemption story?
  ```

  - u/TaltosDreamer:
    ```
    I think her time as a broken n tortured soul has affected her.  After all, she comes from a very long line of Might Makes Right, and few are mightier than Catherine these days.
    ```

- u/over_who:
  ```
  Okay, where's the story going? We have Hierophant probably being resuscitated by Cat, and the enemies regrouping. Saint and Pilgrim clearly do not want to play ball with surrender, and may break with Malanza's truce. If they go part way, why not go the whole way - start calling upon angelic powers, break their word with Cat. At that point, they are truly the villains in the story, and I expect nothing good from there on out. But what form does that take?

   Do Saint and Pilgrim find themselves abandoned by the heavens? Unlikely, they're the big boys, and even Black, who's the antithesis of his role, has a measure of power. Heroes cheat, and I can't imagine their power failing them at a critical moment, that's far more a villain trope.

  Do the other heroes turn on Saint and Pilgrim? Maybe part of them - I wouldn't be surprised if the younger heroes started fighting each other, or at least leaving, if Saint and Pilgrim break truce. 

  Does Pilgrim disagree with Saint, who decides to try the reverse decapitation strike? If so, she almost certainly dies, probably to Cat + Archer.

  Malanza will almost certainly negotiate a retreat if Saint or Pilgrim dies breaking the truce, or a sizable enough group of the younger heroes depart. The real trick will be negotiating without a failing on the other side, what's the carrot? Does Cat take them back by faerie gate? Drop them somewhere they can ravage Black's forces? Or, playing to Malanza, give her strategic information about the First Prince?

  The real problem with all the "Saint screws up" plots is that she literally cannot fail to notice the narrative as we learned earlier, so I doubt she will be the trigger for that. But, who knows? Everybody makes mistakes.
  ```

  - u/rumblestiltsken:
    ```
    No, the pilgrim is going to make Malanza attack. 

    We already have the oath:

    “Chosen,” the princess said. “I am in your debt for your toil. Any boon in my power to grant is yours to claim.”

    He is going full villain and taking the principate with him. This is how we end up with the Prince's graveyard.

      They see that in the long term, it will cause less "suffering" if Cat is dead and Callow reverts back to good. Never mind that the Crusade itself will cause thousands of deaths and return Callow to the endless cycle of war and struggle. As long as Callow is "good" again, balance is restored, and will cause less suffering over the long term.


      The pilgrim isnt so much blind, as just as willing to burn callow to save it from a (subjectively) worse state. Maybe he knows something we dont. 

      Maybe he's just another heroic dick.
      ```

      - u/akaltyn:
        ```
        To think about it from their point of view, if in 1945 the nazis had agreed to cease hostilities provided they were left alone to do whatever they liked within their borders, should the allies have agreed? From the perspective of the Heroes the Evil side as the literal physical embodiment of all that is wrong with the world, and their continued presence would allow that horror to deepen and spread. We as semiobjective leaders might think they are wrong in that assessment, but from their perspective it makes perfect sense
        ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        The third option is he isn't seeing the the new narrative forming behind Black's actions. Which is entirely reasonable as Black is basically trying to shatter the entire Narrativum of the world.

        Perhaps this is the beginning edges of Black's goal of "World of Grey"
