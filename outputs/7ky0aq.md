  *Don't pay too much attention to the nonsense about souls-they're deeply confused minds flailing for some semblance of order in an orderless world.*

  I like that Luna was possibly sorted into Ravenclaw.

    ```
    I have to agree, it's way too convenient that the second syllable got cut off like that.
    ```

    - u/ArisKatsaris:
      ```
      Not only that but the proclamation doesn't follow this world's standard "This girl is in ..." and seemingly consists of just the shouted house name like in the Rowling universe.
      ```

      - u/JJReeve:
        ```
        I didn't actually notice that. Good spot. 

        I wonder if Luna is in the same sort of position here that Hermione was in HPMOR. If I recall correctly Elizer said for that story everyone got an intelligence boost except Hermione, who didn't need one.

        Here everything got a weirdness boost, except Luna so she's now on the same level as the rest of the universe. Though I'd need to see a bit more of Luna's character to be sure.
        ```

        - u/Chosen_Pun:
          ```
          I felt like the implication might be that the original Luna was weird *because*, maybe, she exists in/experiences both timelines simultaneously, or something, and that all the weird stuff she talks about in canon is, possibly, totally normal stuff from this new universe.
          ```

          - u/Frommerman:
            ```
            Luna=Deadpool confirmed.

            That said, if we think this situation was caused by time travel somehow, Luna being totally normal might indicate that she's one of the time travellers. We already know large-distance time travel is possible because Horry has met a far older version of himself, so I'm thinking Luna somehow got pulled along for the ride.

            That said, I've just had an insane tinfoil moment. What if this universe is the result of HJPEV successfully casting *Becomus Goddus* and then immediately screwing everything up? Say he accidentally bumped the machine operating magic, rewriting something small but significant, and in his haste to stabilize the universe before it was too late, snapped his fingers and created The Library.

            This would stabilize time for him, but leave a messy universe where everything ran on Fate. Obviously, Harry *hates* fate, so he wants to fix it, but he didn't get to see enough of the magic machine before he changed it to know what he changed and how to change it back. His safest route is to sort of...nudge everything back into alignment over the course of numerous overlapping time loops, each person steadily becoming more like they should be over time. We're just in one of the universes after Magick has a stable set of rules, but before those rules have returned to normal.

            Or maybe this is the end state. These rules do seem like they would appeal to HJPEV.
            ```

      The author seems the sort who might leave red herrings, although I think this would be the first.

    *searched
    ```

- u/rjpfonseca:
  ```
  > "C'mon Horry, everyone got all turned around for a second, but searchin's about to start!"

  Did something special happened here? Like, for example, did they pass by the Slyverin common room but then everyone (except the future Slyverins) forgot about it?
  ```

  - u/Gaboncio:
    ```
    They miss any announcements about the Slyverin common room because Luna approaches Horry as they’re walking past, no? 

    Edit: You’re right there might be something fishy going on there.
    ```

    - u/rjpfonseca:
      ```
      My understanding was that Horry did not hear about the Slyverin common room because of Luna and the others appear to not remembering it because of something else.
      ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    It's the chamber of secrets and they all heard the sound.
    ```

    - u/rjpfonseca:
      ```
      The sound?
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        The voice.
        ```

        - u/rjpfonseca:
          ```
          The chamber of secrets being the Slyverin common room is plausible.

          But I have no idea what voice you speak of. Am I forgetting something referenced before? Or, more likely, are you making a reference to something else entirely like an [SCP](http://www.scp-wiki.net) maybe?
          ```

          - u/kaukamieli:
            ```
            I mean the voice that tells the heir about the chamber. But ofc I'm only joking about the whole chamber thing, but who knows?
            ```

                ```
                That's only in HPMOR, not in canon. We don't know if this follows more from canon or HPMOR, though.
                ```

                - u/rjpfonseca:
                  ```
                  You mean HPMOR is not canon? j/k
                  ```

- u/MaddoScientisto:
  ```
  Thank you for making a thread about the new chapter, I just can't do without story anymore.
  It's simply amazing
  ```

- u/farsan13:
  ```
  Sad about Luna being another victim of time shenanigans. She probably has memories from the future.
  ```

  - u/Gaboncio:
    ```
    I’m still not convinced that she doesn’t have memories from Rowling’s universe.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      That seems the most likely to me, given the cover image for the story.
      ```

      - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
        ```
        is the cover image of the story meant to represent a point of divergence? because i cant see at what point they could have possibly diverged. magic seems to *work differently* in the Horry Patter universe than in canon. And yet even though they would have diverged so long ago, both branches seem to have remarkable similarities.

        Maybe the reason has something to do with information travelling backwards in time as well as forwards. Actually Im not sure where that thought came from. Not sure what I was thinking.

        Or wait, maybe someone figured out the secrets of time and divination, and used that to transmit any info they wanted from future to past. But the information that gets sent back is a bit garbled, so the prophecies fulfill themselves in different ways? So Horry's parents name Horry instead of Harry because they misunderstand the message sent back from the future about his name. And messages about magical discoveries get sent back in time as well, so Hogwarts ends up being much more magically advanced than it was at the time in canon.

        And maybe overtime their understanding and control over time and divination advanced to the point where they could get their messages sent back through time much clearer and much less garbled.

        And then when people were abusing these prophecies too much they started locking them away, making them unreadable until they actually happened.

        It seems like a really big coincidence that Luna would be transported from canon to this particular everett branch.

        Also, the first name Horry is an italian first name which means "timekeeper". This is certainly not a coincidence.
        ```

        Also, Luna's listed as the main character in the FF.net summary.

  I was kind of expecting some gender, potentially a nilbog or whatever, neither boy nor girl, to be slid into the quotes of boys and girls.

  None the less my first thought is to put people with abnormal chromosomes under the hat

      - u/traverseda:
        ```
        They might have edited it in. Your comment existed when I started reading. But looks like.
        ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          I'd rather believe it was edited than believe I could make such a mistake but I'm afraid the reality of not being an AI is that I don't have that confidence that I didn't just somehow miss it.

            The author is on this subreddit, so it's pretty plausible.
            ```

  - u/Gaboncio:
    ```
    The hat probably uses self-assignment just like for the houses. I wonder what the incidence of transgender children in Magickal Britain is...
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      Also interesting to imagine non human or mixed species, rather than a boy or girl it'll be this stallion or mare or whatever the male an female terms for the other races are.

      At the very least with polyjuice potion transgender is much easier to treat and perhaps everyone decides to switch genders for a day or two to try it out. Certainly if everything else is free it's something that might actually be valuable, selling the right to your hair for a day in your body
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Oh no, poor Horry! It must be awful not to have a soul. :(
  ```

  - u/JJReeve:
    ```
    It shouldn't be.
    If souls are what causes subjective experience then not having one isn't anything, or like anything. Of course we have enogh first person narration from Horry to conclude he does have subjective experience, so I guess the warning not pay attention to the nonsense about souls is on the mark.
    ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      Well obviously he's a P-zombie.  He only *acts* like he has subjective experience.
      ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    My guess is Horry just isn't a warizard, and the wand is the actual magic user, which is why it can talk.
    ```

    - u/rjpfonseca:
      ```
      Right. But now the question is: how would the wand (or Alvin if the wand is his conduit) benefit from having Horry exposed as a non-warizard?
      ```

  - u/abcd_z:
    ```
    Eh.  It's not bad.
    ```

  - u/Jiro_T:
    ```
    In Harry Potter. Harry is a horcrux, which means that he has a piece of Voldemort's soul stuck in him.  It is possible, then, that in this story it is reversed and Horry has his soul stuck inside not-Voldemort instead.  Trying to detect a soul inside him would then find nothing.
    ```

- u/MaxDougwell:
  ```
  More and more this looks to be in the same vein as *cool and new webcomic*. So excited to see where this story goes.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Possible plot relevance of title I noticed this morning (forgive if it's been remarked upon already): in the same way that philosopher comes from Philo + Sophos and means "lover of knowledge", philologer comes from Philo + Logos and means "lover of words"

      Oh huh. I thought that it was just another garbled word. New vocab I guess haha
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I wonder if the Hat is about to give away that Horry is a Horcrux (or in-universe equivalent). It didn't say he had *no* soul, it said he didn't have *a* soul. Is it picking up that he has one and a little bit more?
  ```

- u/nolrai:
  ```
  What is this story trying to do/be.

  I feel like i am missing the point.
  ```

  - u/Gaboncio:
    ```
    I think there are two parallel goals:

    1. Write a story in a world that vaguely resembles J.K. Rowling’s wizarding world, but with an internally consistent magickal system *and* in which realistic (and by this I mean realistically rational and irrational) people have lived in. 

    1. Write an existential mystery where *something* is wrong with the world as presented and we, along with the protagonist, will have to figure out what that *something* is. 

    I’m not convinced yet that Horry will actually ever learn what’s up with his reality; there’s still a good chance only us (and Luna) will ever recognize this world as not!Rowlingverse.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Me too, but I'm loving it. It's like... It manages to be fun and entertaining as popcorn reading, while still having a ton of meat on the bone. I've chosen to read it pretty passively, but I feel like I could dive in and pick at it and it would hold up well. Maybe it wouldn't, but from my perspective it's all the same anyway, and it's a rollicking great laugh besides.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      It feels like UNSONG all over again.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Yeah, exactly. That's the exact itch it scratches.
        ```

- u/SkyTroupe:
  ```
  Future Horry tried to off himself?

  >Horry takes his wand out of his pocket, "I guess I'm confused why you're confused. Don't you guys have wands?"

  >"Of course, but you said it talked?"

  >"Yeah?"

  >"Horry, wands don't talk."


  I'm so confused but I love it
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Future Horry removed present Horry's soul? Or masked it somehow?
    ```
