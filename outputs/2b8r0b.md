  Level I Intelligent Characters---not so much on the cunning plots, just people reacting in moderately-sane ways to Evangelion's premises. I am currently 93% of the way through.  Probable deadfic.

    The author *has* picked up other fics after a years-long gap though - one which I found after it 'died' in 2008 recently got a 60K word update!

  ```
  Half chapter in, not bad so far, moderately accurate explanation as to why nukes are bad weapons for the job, Also thread themesong https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NTfCbfvwM8
