  I know it's sort of been hinted at before, but that meeting with "his mom" really drove home for me the fact that June had a *shitty* childhood. It really shouldn't be a surprise that he turned out like he did. Also, this definitely means he'll be meeting "his dad" too at some point, even if he doesn't interact with the entire cast of doppelgangers.

  Also, is it just me, or was that last June/Amaryllis conversation unusually... jovial? Like, there was a lot more joking and smiling going on than there usually is when the two of them talk. I really liked it, especially coming off the Bethel thing. June feels like he's slowly getting himself into a healthier place, in part because he keeps being forced to confront and work through issues from his past (like with his mom, here) and in part because he's got a lot of people who care about him and are looking out for him now.

        i agree that that's probably \*part\* of it, but I don't think that's the whole story. If the non-juniper characters turn out to be philosophical zombies and this was \*just\* an extended therapy simulation, then that would invalidate all of these experiences that Juniper is having \*because none of it is real\*.

        My suspicion is that this is an Earth that got a kinda sorta benevolent ASI a bit early, and that ASI decided to create Aerb as a real simulated world in order to help Juniper overcome his past, by providing him with a community of people with cultural and psychological baggage in common with him. As Juniper overcomes his own traumas and steps into the light of a better future, so will the people of Aerb. Also, the Dungeon Master is obviously just future Juniper with some wacky simulated time travel shenanigans, made possible by a \*probably\* friendly ASI. The Arthur who became Uther probably isn't the original one from Juniper's Earth per se, but a simulated copy that the ASI created by predicting what kind of person Arthur was with a high degree of fidelity, based on how he impacted Juniper while he was alive.

        Also, the part where Palida said that too much power corrupts everyone including herself, probably is foreshadowing. The DM at one point promised Juniper that he could become the Dungeon Master, the new god of Aerb, or something along those lines. I'm guessing that if one goes back and looks over the chapter where that was said it's probably worded very carefully. Probably the Dungeon Master just said that Juniper would become Dungeon Master and would become a God, but did not say that he would become the ONLY god of Aerb--because maybe all the mortals of Aerb ascend to godhood rather than just Juniper. I don't remember which chapter I'd have to look back at to verify this though.

    >  June had a shitty childhood

    He taught himself to stop processing language in order to filter out his parents arguing. That was a pretty big holy shit moment. 


    The terribleness of his home life does shed some light on how attached he was to his small group of friends, and devastated when Arthur died. With his family being so awful Arthur was his main support system, and he didn't have any way to process his death. 

    Random thought, he used to escape into fantasy to escape his parents in the form of worldbuilding, now he has literally escaped his parents and problems by moving into a fantasy world.

  I have or had this deeply misplaced hope that for some reason the Draconic Confederacy would decide to be merciful. Now that I think of it, I bet the Second Empire also had little success using soul magic on dragons. *That* would be too easy. On the same note: Would the good relations between the dragons and the hells curtail Valencia's influence?

  My understanding of relative power is that Bethel could probably win in combat with one or two dragons, especially because she has a few wishes daily, but the political implications are probably untenable.

  This latest chapter explores the original meaning of its title: the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. First the tabletop party, and now the kharass.

  I can't help but think a manic water mage is literally a disaster waiting to happen. Maybe this incarnation of his mother has (occasional?) depression but not mania.

  Water as depression checks out, unifying the chapter nicely.

    > deeply misplaced hope that for some reason the Draconic Confederacy would decide to be merciful

    The Draconic Confederacy is so depressingly irrational for a bunch of uber-immortals. Reading about their strained relations with the rest of the mortal species just makes me wonder if they're fundamentally incapable of fighting their genetic predispositions or if their alliance at large is ruled by the bell curve and the tragedy of the commons. Their desire to control airspace is probably an innate territoriality or tied to their pride, but it still feels like such a horrible waste of political capital given this fresh example of overwhelming strongarm negotiation. For all their longevity, it seems like the majority of dragons are blind to their self-destructive trend. So now they're endangered. Screw Violations Officers, they're desperately in need of a public relations officer. And maybe the narratively-savvy Perisev should ring up the DM for some quick therapy / gene-editing.

    In other news, why does the Confederacy want Cpt. Blue Bottle dead? (There's a smallish chance Perisev is pushing her own agenda as the Confederacy's will and never intended to honor their agreement but seems unlikely) Besides the obvious follow-up of why the hundreds of dragons can't do it themselves, what did the Captain do to offend them? Or possibly related: like Joon asked, what's Perisev's game (not sorry) revealing the dracicide? Her implication was that it was a move to array the D.C. against any possible return of Uther / new Uther-like figure. But then some way through the negotiations, she just happens to give Joon a 'quest'? Full well knowing how the quest features in Uther's oeuvre. Joon gave away a lot of confirmations during their chat but maybe this is just bait to *prove* Joon is the new Uther. Casually agreeing to end exclusions *cue eyeroll* 

    Plus, why is her title 'the Wretched'?
    ```

    - u/Noumero:
      ```
      >what's Perisev's game

      Well, what did she accomplish? She's arranged for Juniper to reveal himself to the world at large, and she's arranged for the dragons to oppose him. She also believes that opposing him is suicidal.

      It was stated that dragons don't really care about each other. Perisev seems to care even less than is usual for them — if Tommul had some respect for "the dragonkind" as a concept and was offended on its behalf by Uther's slaughter, Perisev seemed entirely unperturbed.

      I'm guessing she wants to kill off the majority of the remaining dragons (herself excluded) using Juniper as a tool (possibly because she sees them as a threat to herself). The Wretched indeed.
      ```

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        Organizing a proxy genocide of her own race would put herself in even more danger, without the power bloc offered by their numbers. She doesn't seem shy about bringing Tommul along for extra insurance in numbers, so I don't think that's her plan, unless she has some trump card to ensure her perpetual safety. She's not strong enough as a single actor on the world stage. It'd only take one murder-happy DND poaching party to end the line.
        ```

        - u/Noumero:
          ```
          Well, yes, presumably she also has some sort of plan to put herself in the Empire's/Juniper's good graces once the other dragons are dead.

          Even if she'll be the only dragon left, killing her will probably require the cooperation of hundreds of people. In comparison, the number of dragons necessary to kill her is probably *two*. If she has some ways to ensure mortals wouldn't want to kill her, and if she has reason to believe other dragons may want her gone ("the Wretched" is a pretty telling title)...
          ```

    - u/Kecha_Wacha:
      ```
      Perisev, anagram for Seviper, poison-type snake Pokemon. And black dragons are the poisonous ones in DnD, right? So that's one half of why she's the Wretched. Other half being that she's a dick.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        In D&D, black dragons are acidic.
        ```

    - u/Watchful1:
      ```
      Isn't that an understandable viewpoint of an immortal or long lived species? They don't care much about the opinions of the short lived people and discount their ability to substantially change the state of the world.

      Dragons are also solitary by nature and don't tend to combine their political power unless pressed.
      ```

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        Dragons are (indefinitely) long lived, not immortal, and that's my point. They're slowly dying off and they live long enough to see long term patterns: they're sapient, so they can put 2 and 2 together. And if dragons like Perisev have intelligence networks, some surely know the public perception of them, but they aren't putting the pieces together here.

        > Dragons are also solitary by nature 

        Which is why I'm thinking they can't exceed their base instincts.

        > and don't tend to combine their political power unless pressed.

        Why even bother with a Confederacy if they're going to half-ass it and ignore major existential crises. They definitely don't discount their ability to force polities to play ball (they don't seem to want to change the world, just be on top of it).
        ```

        - u/Watchful1:
          ```
          Proponents of isolationist policies usually see the failure of interacting with the wider world as being due to abandoning of the isolationism, rather than a failure in the interaction. If long lived dragons start banding together to talk to people, after centuries of not banding together, and then they start dying, they will draw back, not rush forward.

          The trope can be seen all over the place in fantasy, dragons, elves, even dwarves in the worlds they are long lived. Long lived beings are notoriously slow to adapt to a quickly changing world. Tommul is listed as 2000 years old, Uther's time and all the changes it brought were recent for him.

          The confederacy was likely a massive, centuries long effort for them. That it doesn't do more is expected.

      - u/nytelios:
        ```
        Great analogy, feels like an inspiration for Aerb's dragons. Though the sad part is dragons don't *have to* have low time preferences and seek only to maximize wealth in a fleeting decades-long lifetime. They're not just going to die of natural causes and leave a shitty situation for future generations: if they have to live through the long-term consequences, single-minded greed and antagonistic elitism aren't too wise for self-proclaimed "Wise" creatures.

      - u/CouteauBleu:

        - u/PHalfpipe:
          ```
          Not for fun, for profit, or as a hand out to the arms industry. Look at the trillions in profits generated by the invasion of Iraq, or the ongoing genocide in Yemen , or look at the fortunes made when the US dropped more bombs on Cambodia than they did on Japan in all of world war 2. They literally bombed every city flat, wrecked every bit of infrastructure, killed nearly a million people in a population of 8 million, and finally caused civilization to collapse, and allowed a full blown death cult to rise from the ruins.
          ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            Yeah, that's still a massive stretch.

            That's the leftist equivalent of a hardcore libertarian pointing at the mass starvation in China and Soviet Ukraine, or the current riots in Hong Kong, or basically anything in North Korea, and saying "See? See? This is where your socialist policies are leading us!"
            ```

            - u/PHalfpipe:
              ```
              Starvation in China and the Soviet Union was the result of crash industrialization programs, and the disruption in land use and labor starved about as many people as were killed by the western powers during their own industrialization , and a fraction of the number of people killed during the slave trade, which is what provided the original rush of resources and free labor to kick start capitalism.

              But your comment was that billionaires don't annihilate villages in developing counties, and my response is that the remains of tens of thousands of annihilated villages can be found all throughout Asia , Africa , central and south America and the middle east. Hell, one of the worlds first billionaires , Leopold II of Belgium, acquired his wealth by enslaving and slaughtering fifteen million people in the Congo.

Some tattoos will affect your physical functioning and skills, others affect mental and emotional. Sometimes it's obvious person A is a tattoo mage, sometimes it's more under the radar. Being a tattoo mage changes your life path because of what you display, what you can hide or cover up. And how much stimuli you can tolerate.

      I'm assuming since it's explicitly macro-scale you can't do any of the fun micro-scale stuff. It's probably built so your control gets less 'focused' the less water you're trying to control. Although, that raises my own question. What about crowds? If you go to a major city or a concert, could you use water magic to push the entire crowd of people as if they were one body of water?

        It's explicitly mentioned that a really high skill water mage could probably do something that looks like waterbending. Though I have a feeling that the way water magic works is similar to how you construct brillouin zones(visually speaking), you have a plane or area of force, and a high skill water mage can just overlap so many of them that he can create finer structures.

    That Joon mentioned boosting his skill via essentialism made me wonder if that was something that would become useful later. Several magics have really powerful applications at the highest levels, maybe water mages never got that high so people don't realise.

    It could either be just large scale movement (moving around a mile long blob of water would take care of plenty of problems, if they didn't teleport), or that you get sufficiently precise movement that you can influence things on an individual person level.

    > (((This is probably the part where you’re wondering to yourself, ‘but I thought Juniper was our narrator, how does he know, and why is he talking in the third person?’, and here, safely hidden within triple parentheticals, I can tell you: some of this might not actually have happened in precisely these ways. We’re operating under really loose definitions of ‘actually happened’ already, but I don’t just mean that it ‘might not have happened’ in the sense that people might just disappear as soon as I stop looking at them, only to have an interstitial history written for them in accordance with the demands of the narrative as dictated by the Dungeon Master as soon as they become relevant to me again. Here, I mean ‘might not have actually happened’ in the sense that this is a recreation of sorts, me working backwards from information that I didn’t have at the end of the last chapter, and won’t have at the end of this one. The thing is, if you learned it like I learned it, it would be a drawn out, incomprehensible mess, so this is a little bit of poetic license and extrapolation on my part in order to present something coherent. I hope you don’t mind.)))

    Triple parentheses are Juniper's safe-space. I think we've had a couple of other wall-breaks during the D&D flashbacks but don't recall well enough to quote any.

      ```
      Thank you. So it is not the first time the fourth wall has been broken, but it perhaps is the first time without triple parentheses :P
      ```

  - u/LupoCani:
    ```
    It's slightly complicated. The suggestion of /u/Gr_Cheese that Juniper breaks the fourth wall in triple parentheses isn't exactly accurate, either.

    Juniper narrates with a lot of asides and comments, some of which break the fourth wall. The first example is way back in chapter two, when describing Amaryllis.

    >I’m not really sure what protocol is here, in terms of prose. I mean, I don’t want to sound like a creep, so maybe I should stay as generic as possible and tell you [...] And if that analogy sounds a little bit frightening to you, then I think it did its job, because [...]

    WtC is narrated with knowledge of future events, but not unlimited knowledge. In Amaryllis' first POV chapter, she references the Cannibal implicitly in her thoughts as narrated by Juniper. When Juniper himself learns of the Cannibal, he notes how he didn't understand that reference until that moment. Then, there are a few more examples of Juniper referencing future events, such as Amaryllis planning to alter her soul in the chamber.

    >Looking back, that might have been when she’d started making plans.

    The DM appears with a time titled "Worth the Candle" by "Juniper Smith" in a recent chapter, causing Juniper to muse - 
    > (It did occur to me to ask about the book, especially given the supposed author. The byline could have just been metaphorical, or it could have been a joke, or it could have been literal in some fashion, written by me after it was all over, or when I was asleep, or simply by yanking me out of time to write a chapter whenever anything important happened then scrubbing my mind afterward. But the number of possibilities, and the untrustworthiness of the Dungeon Master, made it sort of pointless to ask about. Besides, I didn’t really care about the poor schlub who was writing that book, even if it was, in some way, me.)

    Finally, triple parentheses aren't a general safe space for breaking the fourth wall, they're specifically for interjecting in third-person narration. These comments (of which there have been four, three in Amaryllis first POV chapter, and another in her most recent POV half-chapter) are generally _sort of_ fourth wall breaking (since anything readily apparent could be communicated through third-person narration) but not inherently so.
    ```

      ```
      There's even more than a fourth wall when you take into account that the story is a self-insert written for an audience who are told that it's a self-insert. [On ch. 73, I noted](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vxian/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_7274/dtxq5ax/) that quote as the first time the nature of the fourth wall changed for me, with the line "I hope you don't mind." The narrator [meta-comments on their own narration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-reference ) and expresses a desire to tell a good *story*, which raises all kinds of wild theories about the frame and phenomenon of Joon's existence within the game. Since then, my leading theory has become >!that the game is *not* a simulation being run post-Singularity but rather a literal fictional story written live in the vein of D&D, as a form of soft therapy. [I've been a big fan of the therapy theory](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zbyej/wiprt_worth_the_candle_ch_79_rule_zero/duohhko/) and the author himself (as /u/cthuluraejepsen) [lightly implied this in retrospect](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7h4qqb/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_63_the_chemical_history/dqoct4t/), but it never clicked why the DM or creator would bother with such indistinguishably magical technology and resources just to fork a brain simulation of (presumably) his 2017 self for such a relatively mundane purpose. Rather than explaining away the gross jump in tech between 2017 and the current game timeline, it makes more sense if Joon and the game is a "simulation" *within the author's mind/universe*. That's why the book is already written (up to the point we get to see), that's why the DM is a kindred spirit - because the DM is AW at one remove is Joon at two removes, except on actual Earth. Joon is the what-if split: he is literally the **self-insert** into AW's cumulative, conglomerated D&D worlds. Time is a flat circle for poor sim!Joon...!<

    Captain Bluebottle is, if I’m remembering correctly, a person who can reanimate corpses into classic zombie types and has total control over them. (In a seemingly unrelated way to the zombies in the Risen Lands) He/She (do we know their gender?) used these zombies to become an economic powerhouse using them in factories and such, until it was discovered by everyone else that the zombies are conscious and experience everything just like when they were alive. 

    After that I think he/she just chills in his/her exclusion zone (can’t remember when the zombie magic got excluded in this chain of events).

  Sounds like someone has personal experience trying to cope with a parent having bipolar disorder, because that did an entirely too accurate job at pulling from my childhood memories of my mother. And chillingly close to home most of all, due to my own even-less-fun-version-than-june's-mom's bipolar disorder.
  Honestly even though it was only a page or so, that has been one of the most accurate descriptions of the more common variety of BP1, that I have encountered in fiction writing.  

  You even spelled Lamictal right. I've been taking it for about 3 years and I still have trouble spelling the generic name.

  I emphasize with both June and his mom for so many reasons.  Her psychiatrist failed her so hard for not doing a better job with medication management. And her husband absolutely failed her regarding her mental health ( even offering basic empathy and trying to understand at all!) and all the impact it had on everything that her life touched.

  What sucks even more regarding  the frequent and  hellishly under-treated full blown episodes , is that they literally cause brain damage and memory loss in a couple different ways.  The higher the severity of symptoms,  the more cognitive functionality declines, with executive functioning being hit the worst. Which just makes it all worse.

  On a non-related note: Something I just realized while typing; it took me 14 years to understand the fruit flies like a banana pun. It was on my biology teacher's wall.   I have always just had the wrong internal cadence and tones when saying in my mind.

    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      The phrase is "Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana". It's only technically a pun, in that it takes advantage of the ambiguity of the word "like" in English, which can mean either "in the same way as" or "appreciate".

      The first half is meant to be read as "Time flies in the same way as an arrow", while the second half is read as "fruit flies appreciate a banana". But because the first half is there, your brain will tend to parse the second half completely wrong, with fruit being the object noun, flies being the verb, like meaning "in the same way as", which is incorrect. (One of the brilliant parts of the phrase is that "fruit flies" is a noun, while "time flies" is a noun and a verb together, which makes the parsing even more difficult.)

      The term for this is usually "garden-path sentence". Others include:

      * The old man the boat.
      * The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.
      * Fat people eat accumulates.

  Between the dragons in this and the fledgling Dragon Conclave in [The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.net), I'm beginning to really like the idea of Dragons as a group that operates as a small group of individuals but represents itself to the outside world as a single party to a treaty made with governments.

Not to mention the fact the 100x multiplier would have to be really pick and choose to make sense; some biological processes can be 100x slower and explained away with magic, but not others. She ages, heals, produces blood and digests food slower, but her reaction speed and and thinking can't be that much slower. 

  And then there's the mood. People get over things relatively quickly, we have the hedonic treadmill, but hers is a hundred times slower. Imagine getting upset and staying that way for decades or having a panic attack that lasts weeks. Ever get randomly horny? Well too bad, your erection is going to last days now. If any of her kind ever got caught in a depressive episode, they'd almost certainly kill themselves cuz no way they last decades like that.

  When I heard about water magic right after dragons, fire-breathing dragons, I thought, "Great. Might be useful". But Juniper did not seem to have a single thought about using water magic against dragons. Hmmmm.

  I wonder why Juniper did not explore the relationship of the dragons to Hyacinth when he was talking to Perisev. At least he could try to find out how Hyacinth manipulated the dragons. He might even have been able to get Perisev mad at Hyacinth by telling her how Hyacinth had manipulated her as a tool to accomplish her own ends. It might not work, but it seems like it could have been worth a try.

    Regarding water magic, what's he going to do? Make it rain on top of the Dragons? Maybe they'll get depressed and leave. It's possible that at higher levels he'll be able to summon storms and maybe even a hurricane, but I'm still doubtful they'd be inconvenienced by it. The way dragonfire is stated to just burn cities off the map, I get the impression that large amounts of water would barely even slow it. 

    On the other matter, Perisev was already aware of Hyacinth's game, the two dragons being there had nothing to do with her. What Hyacinth did was basically tattle to the Draconic Confederacy that they had violated the rules (it seems like she did something more, especially where Dianthus is concerned, but it's not really clear what). Regardless, Perisev makes it clear she's aware of it and doesn't care.

  I find myself increasingly disliking Juniper as a person. On one hand it's a fantastic presentation of someone in a less than ideal headspace - which I can relate. On the other hand he needs a slap in the face and a talk about how the world owes you nothing but harsh lessons.

  I believe the team did a disservice to themselves by sending Bethel away solely for Juniper's mental wellbeing ( which while I sympathize, it's small potatoes considering the sheer number of threats they opened themselves sans the house.) But then again, this world is about Juniper and his feelings, after all.

  I also feel we're being robbed of tension a little bit - if this world is built for him (as the encounters with the Dungeon Master have led us to believe, as well as the insertion of the facsimile of the family and friends in his path) then he won't fail.

  Still, the human moments were touching. I liked the interaction with Raven and Juniper. The remark about power over Maddie is... eyeroll-worthy, but I'll chalk it up to cultural differences.

    I mean, she raped him. You can make the argument that he should have toughened it out and kept living with/near her for the greater good (though it would probably have led to other incidents on the long term), but there's a big gap between "the team didn't ask him to live with his attacker" and "the team coddles him".
    ```

    - u/Paxona:
      ```
      I said I sympathize, but the problem is he placed the team and all his friends in direct danger by sending her away. It is a bad situation, but honestly? He could have altered his spirit because I'd place the group of friends physical well being (and the possibility of hellish eternal torture)over whatever moral qualms I'd have.

          And all you had to add was an appeal to emotions, while I've explained why the decision was ultimately selfish and short sighted. I can understand the thought process, I just think while it follows a certain logic, it places his best friend in a relly bad situation. It places his companions in danger. I opens Bethel and Val to danger as well. It places his island and goals in jeopardy. It places all the millions of soula being tortured constantly in risk of losing the best weapon they had in ages.  All because Juniper refuses to insta-therapy. Nevermind Bethel arguably  not knowing what she did wrong, because she is barely a person.

          If you want to  reply to this post with little  more than 'he feels really bad' we have nothing to discuss.
          ```

          - u/i6i:
            ```
            You don't have a better argument. Getting rid of the house is a purely pragmatic decision. 

            Bethel is at best a sadistic serial killer who likes to watch people as they sleep and remind the that there is nothing stopping her any moment she decides to stop holding back and whose inclusion into the group was predicated entirely on the belief that Junipers reality warping powers would be able to handle that somehow. 

            At worst Bethel has avoided being catalogued in the same list of existential threats as Fel Seed mostly by luck and DM fiat. She is objectively a bigger threat to the party and the fate of the universe than the dragons are and the long term psychological damage she inflicted with her presence is every bit as real as the worst they've had to deal with coming from their enemies. If Juniper winds up altering his values and basically reprogrammed into a robot by the time he gets to level 100 then that outweighs any short term benefit of Bethel's presence. 

            You're counter argument from what I'm seeing is that it isn't fair to Bethel who isn't human and therefore not culpable (who cares?) but still humanizing it by saying it's pushing people away (surely you meant to say that the UI is busted if you want to keep the former argument going?)  how it's selfish and irrational not to live within a dangerously malfunctioning magical artefact (???) and how you understand the logic and sympathize but both feelings and logic are wrong because reasons this margin is too narrow to contain.
            ```
