## New chapter of A Voice Across the Void [rational!star wars][WIP]

### Post:

The new chapter is [here](http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/134448479197/ch-7-always-in-motion). Previous chapters are [here](http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/133818575647/a-voice-across-the-void). If for some reason you prefer to read on ff.net, the link is [here](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10740793/1/A-Voice-Across-the-Void). 

The next chapter will be quite short (~1000 words) and I should be able to produce it much quicker.

    Thank you! I know I am pretty slow in writing updates, but I promise this story will be finished.

  Well, that escalated quickly.

  MOAR!

  Seriously, that was awesome. Quite the cliffhanger there.

  Somehow I didn't figure out what the solution to the chapter 5 puzzle was. Since I didn't realize that the place the "peace negotiations" would be taking place was the jedi temple. Did it say that somewhere earlier in the story?

    Thank you! Its not the Jedi temple though, just a temple on the planet where the Ulth & Plessians live. It was stated earlier (chapters 4 and 5) that Nimbo and the rest of his padawans are living there (presumably for the duration of the negotiations).
