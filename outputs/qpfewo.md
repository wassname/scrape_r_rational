## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Arcane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ps6nV4wiCE) on netflix continues the streak of excellent animated adaptations of PC games. It has great pacing, worldbuilding, and especially characterization. I highly recommend it. 

  I never thought they would be able to write SPOILERS: >!Jinx's--a homicidal maniac!--!< origin story to have so much pathos and relatability. It's very, very impressive storytelling that's only slightly disturbed by knowing the lore and the ultimate arc of several of the characters. Hopefully they keep up that level of quality with the remaining 6 episodes. 

  In order of quality(imo):

  1. Castlevania s1-4
  2. Arcane ep1-3
  3. The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf(technically a book adaptation I guess)
  4. Dota: Dragon's Blood

  All are recommended for fans of the respective IPs and total newbies alike.

    I enjoyed it when it came out. I stopped reading at chapter 100

    At first, the MC was forced >!to be creative to get around the fact that his mark "can't be used for combat or magic. As time went on he basically was handed perfect counters to its shortcomings!<. This was around the school part, where the mark >!made him a genius without peer and literally everything he tried (except for this one class) he succeeded at.!< It just got tiring.

    I also felt the same for *This Quest is Bullshit*; it started interesting, the MC had an interesting class she had to use unconventionally, >!then she got an super rare, totally tailored class that was essentially the result of a lab accident that should have, by all rights, killed her.!<

    As someone who really enjoys the story it's quite interesting to hear your perspective. Definitely think it's not a rational story. I guess I get a slice of life feel rather than any sort of actual drama /danger

  This week I watched all the Thunderbolt Fantasy episodes and movies. It's a Taiwanese puppet show written by Japanese anime dude, Gen Urobuchi, the same guy who wrote Madoka Magica. That may sound crazy, but I cannot recommend it enough. It's amazing.

  [A few weeks ago,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/qan96x/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/hh8f9v9/) I asked if anyone had come across any particularly notable Deltarune fanfiction. Unfortunately, it seemed that no-one had found any to scratch that itch. So I took it upon myself to begin writing one, instead, with an attempt to make it somewhat rational, or at least relevant to the interests of this sub. If anyone was in my position (or still is), then I can at least say, confidently, that writing this has been fulfilling my need for more content. So maybe it will help with anyone else that had my problem :D

  [Link.](https://archiveofourown.org/works/34531036/chapters/85950535) Blurb: Kris is more determined than normal; but with every advantage a vessel gains, their opposition must gain one greater than that. A more outgoing and charismatic Kris can tackle some of their problems head on, but they very quickly find that they’re not the only one with agency they lacked before. And while they can finally reach for what they truly desire, sometimes that’s in contrast to what they think they want.

  With a soul that whispers prescient instructions, and friends that seem very worried about the Dark World they find themselves in, Kris can only hope that, in the end, they can make things work out in their favour.

  I just finished listening to the Vorkosigan Saga and related novels on Audible, and I'm looking for my next fix. Anyone got any recommendations? As far as published works, I've recently enjoyed the Gentlemen Bastards series and the Baru Cormorant series.

    - u/Ilverin:
      ```
      On Arkady duology:

      I know this thread isn't about "what is most rational", but this is /r/rational so I thought I'd mention it: I'm about half-way through the second book. Since the primary problem facing the protagonist is >!"first contact with aliens"!< I've been thinking about it. So I was annoyed when:

      >! A) humans and aliens send each other audio in space

      >! B) "they [the aliens] can see images that we transmit on the same channels". 

      >! Complaining: The phrase "same channels" implies a reduced range of frequency (e.g. if there are 2 channels, each gets at most half of the range). Additionally, human vocal sound occurs at frequencies below that of radio waves, and sound doesn't propagate in most regions of space (no medium like air or water). Each of these implies a coding to take specific frequencies and turn them into other frequencies outside the range (such as audio or visual distinctions). So you would need to agree with the aliens: what are the lowest and highest frequencies of this "channel" we are both using, and what are the lowest and highest frequencies we should "transform" to, and then you would have to have someone do the transforming (or instead of analog you could use digital, but then you also need a coding).

  A [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/qkelpe/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/hj2b9pq/) in last week's recommendation thread asked for LGBTQA or other non-standard/non-human relationship/love-interest works (I'm lumping monsterfucking under that banner), but didn't get proper replies since the other recommendation being asked for was villainous protagonists and that took the focus (including my own, I decided to bring up the topic in this thread rather than reply a few days late when I remembered).

  Off the top of my head:

  [Marriage and Monsters](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24751/marriage-and-monsters-an-eschatological-romance) - an eschatological romance is about a rather bizarre fantasy world getting mushed into earth, and a married couple gets caught in the middle, with the husband getting a bodyhopping mind entity that's sounds like a grizzled southern (American) detective, but an alien, and the wife gets turned into a dragon. It stopped at the end of "book 1" but was a comfortable stopping point. 

  [Katelpsis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28023/katalepsis) is some sort of eldritch horror work with a lesbian protagonist. It didn't grab me with the first arc, felt like there was too much blind fumbling in the dark for my tastes, but it crops up in these threads every few months.

    I missed it too! /u/NTaya , in addition to the recommendations in the parent comment, I wrote a gay vampire romance novel - it's finished and 140,000 words. 

    It's called Vampire Flower Language and I posted a bit of an intro/FAQ for it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/p4j8ll/rthfcrom_vampire_flower_language_epilogue_all/h8z1olx/?context=3

    Regarding the protagonist: >!the love interest/plot is a pretty standard reforming the bad boy type trope, so it's not full villain, but maybe adjacent enough to interest you!< - that said, stuff happens offscreen that in my opinion means that >!the love interest is the antagonist of a minor character's story!<. If I ever get around to writing a sequel, this will be addressed directly. But that's at least 5 years away, realistically.

    I'm hoping to make a series of stories/novels in the universe with an ensemble cast featuring various queer characters: my next project is a novella starring an aromantic werewolf, a transgender werewolf (unsure if/how that detail will get screen time but Word of God), and a gay demon.

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      Hey! I am aware about this work, and while I really *really* want to read it, I am rather averse to vampires, even if they are done very well. I gave it a chance, enjoyed the writing a lot, but just couldn't bring myself to continue reading. Still, I would recommend this story wholeheartedly to anyone asking the same thing I did.

    The [*Tale of the Five*](https://ebooks.direct/collections/customer-favorites/products/the-tale-of-the-five-omnibus-reissue) features the titular five-person polycule, split over three species and somewhere between four and very very many bodies (depending on how you count).  Highly recommended.

    [*The Erogamer*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36676220-the-erogamer) is, uh, certainly not a story about *standard* human relationships or romance tropes.  It does include porn, plot, philosophy, math, manga, and maddening revelations about our place in the uni(multi?)verse though!  [*A Darker Timeline*](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/imqrjv/ffrst_the_erogamer_a_darker_timeline_sfw/) is an SFW spinoff which I don't think constitutes spoilers ahead of time.

    From Fate fandom, there's [fate first order derivative](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12814598/1/fate-first-order-derivative), where an OC got time-looped into the Fifth Holy Grail War and have to figure out what the heck is going on. There's also [Fate/Noble Shade](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/fate-noble-shade-fate-friend-insert-ft-bakasmurf-complete.538342/), where instead the author inserting himself, he instead insert his friend who doesn't know about F/SN. Neither of the two fanfics have the protagonist knowing canon knowledge tho. [Fate:Zero Sense](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8240891/1/Fate_Zero_Sense) neither features author insert nor OCs, but save for Saber the Servants are all replaced by heroes from other fictions, one of which is Deadpool, which automatically have canon knowledge as part of him breaking the fourth wall.

    Then there's [Agents of Light](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13049548/1/Agents-of-Light), where three friends suddenly got transported into Yugioh GX by the big bad of the series, and forced to derail the plot by having the hero expelled from the school. All three have canon knowledge, and uses them actively.

    *Then* there's [Cinder and Ashes: The Chronicle of Kamen Rider Dante](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12567389/1/Cinders-and-Ashes-The-Chronicle-of-Kamen-Rider-Dante), which is about a fanfic author in the Re:CREATORS universe, where characters from stories are reverse-isekaied into the real world. Protagonist doesn't actually have canon knowledge, but due to the premise of the story all characters kinda toy around with canon knowledge of in-universe stories.

  The fanfic [But Doctor, I am Pagliacci](https://archiveofourown.org/works/21716713/chapters/51801295) was mentioned a couple weeks ago.  It is about a suddenly sane-ish Joker (who now prefers to just be called Jack Napier), in a DC universe with some significant differences.  Most notably, there is no Batman.  It is not that Batman is dead or otherwise indisposed, but that The Bat has never existed.  No one remembers him or Bruce Wayne.  Jack then discovers some other disconcerting changes to the world he knew when still in the throes of madness.

  It is incomplete, and apparently abandoned, but what's there is quite enjoyable.
  ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    I had fun reading it, but it really is just a pile of confused DC Comics "what if"s. The Joker gets less and less "screentime" overtime, which kind of defeats the purpose of the fic, but he's 250% gary stu so it's hard to really care about him, or his plans based on near omniscient knowledge of the status of every single character in the setting.

    The story would've probably only benefitted from his head getting punched off after he got the secret out. Then the story would have a real excuse to focus so deeply on Green Arrow, Black Adam and Booster Gold.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      You seem to be projecting your own idea of what the "purpose of the fic" is.

      I saw the "purpose" as fun sandboxing in the DC extended universe if the one-off villains were actually as smart as their backstories made them out to be and used their gadgets to their fullest potential rather than as forgettable gimmicks.

      The Joker gets "less screentime" because of the worldbuilding necessary to introduce the other characters and their strengths. If the author hadn't fleshed out their vital work as allies and opponents, then maybe it would have been a stereotypical Gary Stu plot of the male protagonist single-handedly winning at everything against a backdrop of flat side-characters. But not even then, really, because the author's portrayal of sane!Joker's personality is far from the way a typical Gary Stu would act.

      Further, I wouldn't describe the Joker's knowledge as 'omniscient'. He has the level of knowledge that I would expect from a guy who rose to be a top villain in a world of superpowers while only being a 'baddass normal'. If we actually take his DC rap sheet seriously (as the author of this fic did) then over the course of his career the Joker must have accumulated a huge portfolio of criminal connections and knowledge that he can leverage for his schemes.
      ```

      - u/Revlar:
        ```
        It's fine to have buy-in on a fic, I won't fault you for it. The story was never bad enough to push me to stop suspending disbelief, but the sticking points are there.

        The "purpose of the story" is, presumably, to marry DC sandboxing (confused what ifs, in my comment) with Joker as Pagliacci. Joker is supposed to be struggling in a world without Batman, but instead he flourishes because the sandboxing takes over. There's a reason Batman doesn't have 5 rings of power, telekinetic ballistic armor and inertron plot armor in the stories this is fanfiction of: Because that is lame. If The Joker was dead, the sandboxing could stand on its own and it'd be a better fic for it.

        Instead, a lot of the worldbuilding elements set up by the story are made irrelevant by the fact they're only set up to be knocked down by our clownish Gary Stu, or to make the big bad look bad (and stupid). It's fun, and it doesn't fail to be interesting, most of the time, but it's flawed. Joker has the power of a thousand omniscient nerds studying the canon (and extra-canon) material, while the bad guy tries to swim in his wake with a death star-sized idiot ball chained to his ankle.
        ```

        - u/chiruochiba:
          ```
          >Joker is supposed to be struggling in a world without Batman, but instead he flourishes because the sandboxing takes over.

          Why do you assume that the Joker is "supposed" to be struggling? From what I can tell, the story is supposed to be a fun romp as the Joker uses everything at his disposal (blackmail, bribery, allies of convenience, gadgets, etc.) to take on a stronger adversary.

          >There's a reason Batman doesn't have 5 rings of power, telekinetic armor and inertron plot armor in the stories this is fanfiction of: Because that is lame.

          The fic author picked a comic universe that is full of wacky plot objects that would be ridiculously OP if they were actually used to their full potential. I found it refreshing that the author used those existing canon gadgets that most readers probably have never heard of. It's kind of ironic that you say it would be lame for Batman to have powerful gadgets, when it fact all of the gadgets in the fic were used by canon DC characters.

          >A lot of the worldbuilding elements set up by the story are made irrelevant by the fact they're only set up to be knocked down by our clownish Gary Stu, or to make the big bad look bad (and stupid).

          You seem to be making it out that the Joker handily crushes all opposition with no setbacks, but to me it looks more like his victories are always tenuous and very nearly pyrrhic. Both sides are burning through their resources trying to outmaneuver each other. That's one reason I don't consider sane!Joker to be a Gary Stu.
          ```

          - u/Revlar:
            ```
            > Why do you assume that the Joker is "supposed" to be struggling?

            Because of the name of the fic? Because of the summary right under it? Because of the setup of the story, and the ideas it presents even early on? The fact that Joker's primary motivation is to get him back because not having him around is (supposed to) suck. Come on now.



            > The fic author picked a comic universe that is full of wacky plot objects that would be ridiculously OP if they were actually used to their full potential.

            Yeah.



            > It's kind of ironic that you say it would be lame for Batman to have powerful gadgets, when it fact all of the gadgets in the fic were used by canon DC characters.

            The point was the excess. Green Lantern has a ring of power? Cool. Batman with 5 rings of power, plus 20 other magic items and it all works (or more than works) and there's no consequence or setback, and it's not even halfway through the story? Lame.



            > You seem to be making it out that the Joker handily crushes all opposition with no setbacks

            Yeah.



            > but to me it looks more like his victories are always tenuous and very nearly pyrrhic.

            How so? The only "meaningful" death was Ubu's and Joker didn't give a shit. Sivana has infinite resources. The only side being ground down in the conflict are the bad guys because they (and especially their leader) have too many idiot balls to live. The latest chapter basically sets up the reveal that Joker's side now has essentially infinite clones to throw around.

            I won't fault you for your buy-in, but if you really can see no flaw with the story, maybe post your own glowing review instead of trying to argue against mine. I didn't even say the story's not worth reading. I read over a hundred chapters of it and it entertained me. I'm just aware enough to know when I'm reading wank

              You can't see it, but I'm rolling my eyes here. The top level comment was someone giving the fic a positive review, you tack your negative review on to theirs, but then you complain when I add my contrasting opinion to the stack you started?

  I've been quite enjoying *The Tower of Somnus*, a classic litRPG of the "aliens drop game tech on Earth" variety. Mainly I like it for the system aspects (I'm a sucker for Numbers Go Up), but the setting is also pretty cool--arcology-cities and corporate espionage, very Snow Crash. 

  I was pointed towards it by the comments on *Dreamshards*, a more rational-aspiring take on an essentially identical setting & system--so much so that I basically think of them as sister novels. So far I think the writing of *Dreamshards* is a bit better, but the system for *ToS* is more fleshed out. This is likely because the protag in *Dreamshards* chooses a character option that leaves him systemless, which takes some of the fun out of it for me. 

  I know litRPGs are a dime a dozen, but *ToS* is quite long (1,200+ pages and counting), so if anyone needs a new popcorn read to keep them going, check it out.

    I'm kind of out of it today and not in the best state to give 100% coherent recommendations, but [Switchblade](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27750934) is adjacent to all this. It's BNHA fic with a focus on the original Meta Liberation Army and how things turned out. The tl:dr; is that Midoriya (at the point canon started, pre All Might encounter) disappears for a week, comes back without realising anything happened or remembering anything and everyone rightfully freaks out, and it turns out he got bodyjacked and left with a bunch of residual high level combat skills from the bodyjacker (who from dreams left from the bodyjacker's intrusion and Midoriya's own investigations, is revealed to have been a part of the original MLA). The original MLA was much more of a sane organisation than was touched on in canon, and the current-day beliefs were a case of "history is written by the victors" and heavy propaganda and cover ups (which the current BNHA MLA with Re-Destro bought in to), which starts to get revealed to the public as the fic is progressing.

    It's interesting, and touches on many of similar ideas in regards to revolutions, conflict, change, and politics as It Starts With One, but from a very different angle as Midoriya basically inherited the memories of the leaders of a failed revolution and has to work out his path forward (and how much he wants to follow his original path versus the one he has uncovered). The contrast between Midoriya being quirkless in a world of quirks, and Taylor with powers in a world of normals, could either interest you or turn you off this.

    I don't remember exactly how rational the whole thing is, but it does do the thing common to fics that crop up here of expanding the world in interesting directions that really should exist in canon (ie. everything with heroes that go undercover that is added, rather than only public facing heroes and heroes that are just sort of public facing because they work at night)
    ```

      It's not the worst Boku no Hero fic I've read (not even close), but it's married to the stations of canon and follows Midoriya too closely. The mind numbing repetition of school things stands in the way of any kind of interesting development. It also creates this strange shift in Midoriya's perspective where he's completely okay with the idea of going into underground/undercover hero work with pretty much 0 internal struggle, which feels too much like "Naruto buys black clothes at the start of the fic" to me. His priorities shift completely, and while the 'excuse' is not bad, it's executed poorly.

  It's not rational, but if you're looking for some junky litRPG, I found Jake'[s Magical Market](https://www.amazon.com/Jakes-Magical-Market-J-R-Mathews-ebook/dp/B09HWX11N9) pretty tolerable by the standards of the genre. That means the characters only sometimes do things that make you scratch your head, and that the system is at least somewhat interesting.

  The downsides here are that it's a compiled serial, and there are a couple of abrupt shifts in the direction of the story. I was kind of on board with the shifts, but if you were really liking the pre-shift section that might be an issue. For example, the eponymous magical market only factors in for a portion of the beginning. The upside is that there's a lot here, it's a very long ebook for the price.

  The system here is card-based, the MC (and others) make a little deck and can swap out builds. Pretty decent, I do play some card-based RPGs like Slay the Spire and Monster Train (highly recommended) and it didn't get deep into it, but it feels a bit fresh. It later shifts to more of a cultivation system, though the card stuff doesn't totally go away. Check out if you're looking for some popcorn and you like the genre.

        There's a similar story set in the Twig universe, [Graduation Project](https://archiveofourown.org/works/19080127). Turns out even when you're using Frankenstein bioscience, those capstone projects are still a PITA.

        It doesn't spoil or require knowledge of Twig.

  Rec: [A Journey of Black and Red](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26675/a-journey-of-black-and-red)

  "A conversation with a handsome stranger leaves Ariane chained in a cellar with a strange affliction. She soon discovers that the darkness of the nineteenth century’s Deep South hides many dangers. Mages, wolf shifters and the humans who hunt them play a risky game where to stumble is to die, all under the amused gaze of the apex predators of the supernatural world: vampires.  
  It is never healthy to attract the gaze of the aristocracy of the night. It takes much to survive in this merciless world, but Ariane will not let that deter her. The southern belle has a bite, and she is willing to learn and to grow in this hostile new world. She will use whatever means necessary to reclaim her freedom, be it guile, charm, or those intriguing new instincts that make blood so delectable. "

  Is there a website to read Worm on that has comments that aren't spoilers? Reading from parahumans.wordpress is infuriating, and it makes me hate everyone.
  ```

  - u/Dufaer:
    ```
    The other comments you got here are ridiculous. You can just write your own solution in JavaScript.

    Just load the comments for the chapter, open the console (F12) and run this:

        (allowedDelayInDays => {
          const day = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
          const allowedDelay = allowedDelayInDays * day;

          const published = new Date((
    	      document.querySelector('time.entry-date') ||
    		  document.querySelector('time.published') // for Ward
    		).getAttribute('datetime'));
          const updated = document.querySelector('time.updated') && new Date(document.querySelector('time.updated').getAttribute('datetime')); // exists for Ward

          const comments = document.querySelectorAll('.comment');
          comments.forEach(comment => {
              const commentTime = new Date(comment.querySelector('time').getAttribute('datetime'));
              const commentDisplay = (commentTime - published) <= allowedDelay ? '' : 'none';
              comment.querySelector('.comment-content').style.display = commentDisplay;
            });
          })(7) // how many days older than the chapter the comment contents you see may be

    You can improve the solution to make it arbitrarily fancy - add UI elements for control, turn it into an add-on, whatever.

      I can't remember the last time I copy and pasted code from the internet and it worked the first time. Thank you.

      EDIT: Future readers, in devtools go to Sources and add this as a snippet. That way you can rerun this all the time without constantly copy and pasting the above code like I've been doing.

        Unfortunately probably not. Maybe read it on wayback machine, and find the earliest copy that doesn't include any recent comments? But even then, it's a losing game.
