## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I'm still plotting out that story where the main character has the ability to passively gain beneficial traits from anything organic that he eats. At some point, I might be making this story a multicross, with many new settings introduced.

  What is some interesting biology from other fictional settings that you think is interesting? 

  Also, you all gave some really good advice for real adaptations, so if you've got more of that I'd love to hear it!
  ```

    The obvious low-hanging fruit here would be DC, Marvel, Worm, and other superhero settings. Chock-full of absurd and absurdly overpowered biologically-based superpowers: Kryptonians, Asgardians, Bonesaw's experiments, and so on. You could even consider some funky synergies with Crawler from Worm, whose power is *also* focused on biological adaptation (and there are probably dozens of characters similar to him in other franchises). 

    But if I had to talk about fictional biology I found most *interesting*, and not overpowered specifically, then it would probably be >!the main character and other shapeshifter species!< from Everybody Loves Large Chests. Pretty cool overall.

    My Hero Academia. All superpowers are baced of biology and 80% of the population has them. Powers tend to place some sort of burden on the user so you could use that as a limit on gaining too many to avoid becoming overpowered.

      I mean, that doesn't really seem to apply for AFO

        IIRC he can activate and deactivate as he wishes, so even if he uses mutant-type quirks (which I think he generally doesn't) then it wouldn't be an issue. Plus, his quirk specifically negates too-many-quirks induced insanity.
        ```

        - u/TrekkiMonstr:
          ```
          > his quirk specifically negates too-many-quirks induced insanity

          How so?
          ```

    - u/dinoseen:
      ```
      Ha! Funny thing, I'm actually thinking this fic would *start off* in MHA. The way I'm likely to have it, is that they can't gain the quirks themselves, only products of them. 

      For example, he could gain a strength boost by eating the hyper-efficient muscles of someone with biologically based super strength, but eating someone who had super strength based on their quirk magically directly applying force wouldn't result in any gain. TBH, I think this is the only way it could work without being OP, since the MC's quirk *already* optimises things to avoid accruing negative traits. Otherwise he could just go grave robbing for an absurd power boost. 

      Other superhero settings are likely to function the same way. Basically, if it's biologically plausible it's fair game, but if it's too weird then it's not gonna happen.
      ```

      - u/Palmolive3x90g:
        ```
        That is a pretty good way of doing it. Has the power still be strong but not 'I can solo the world with my eyes closed' strong.

        Also while reading your comment I just rememberd that the [Toriko manga](https://myanimelist.net/manga/7887/Toriko) was a thing and it is mostly biological baced shonnen super powers with some food baced mysticism thrown in there. It's like the author took a look at what biology can do in the real world and cranked that shit up to 11 ... out of a possible 5.

        You got trees that grow so fast their branches can chase and hunt people down, animals who's survival instinct are so good they can predict and react to threats years before they happen while on the other side of the planet, a character who's 'hair' is actually a set of hyper thin prehensile tentacles that can bind opponents up and intimidation and social combat being a thing with Toriko being able to make a grown man piss himself in the first chapter and being able to avoid fights with animals stronger than him by being so threatening they don't want to mess with him. The manga has a few problems, the ending being rushed the main one, but I adore the power system and 'natural world x100,000,000' flavoring behind it.

          That sounds wonderful, thanks for the rec!

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Most of the D&D Monster Manual

    It's even sorted out for you! Your character should be able to gain any ability tagged Ex, which means it comes from the monster being simply exceptional. The other categories of special abilities are Su or Sp, which boil down to "magic" and thus probably don't count. 

    For example, if your character ate some [vampire steaks](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/vampire.htm), they could get the ability to drain blood, fast healing, resistance to electricity and cold, the ability to climb like a spider, and a bit of resistance to priests - but not the ability to dominate folks with a glance.


    Also, arguably, eating bits of an entity with higher stats should grant the character stat points.

    I would want two things out of such a story.

    Firstlly, I want to see an exploration of the social stigma surrounding cannibalism and the disgust/selfloath that could come from eating people, ideally in some kind of analogy to veganism. I feel that there needs to be a good, and preferably utilitarian, excuse for why someone need to use that power. 

    Possible themes to explore includes rules such as 'only eat non-sentient beings' however in most universes the truly powerful beings as sentient so it's a severe limitation. If I were in this case I might make a rule that I would never eat a sentient being that I myself killed in order to avoid becoming someone who makes up flimsy excuses to hunt down people. Or have a very strict rule about what people have to have done for me to hunt them down. You could possibly do it in a humane way(i.e. drug someone, slice a piece of delicious meat from them, and use a restorative power to restore said meat).

    Secondly, I want to see someone be smart about this strong a power. In the few stories I know of with a protagonist with this kind of metapower, the power accumulation always start out with an accident and the protagonist just gains powers as story appropriate. I want the protagonist to gather information and find the best approach to gaining a well rounded power set. At minimum you want some kind of offensive power, some kind of all purpose defence(forcefield, dragonscales, being able to turn into mist, possibly mental defence as well.) and some kind of fast movement(teleportation is ideal but fast running or flying can work), information gathering power and anti information powers, as well as any power that aids in power accumulation(such as a way of generating money so you can buy people's redundant organs, temporarily neutralize powers, generating people's muscles, restoring muscles to long deseased powerusers etc.)

    In terms of actually answering your questions, other have already done a good job of covering most things. I'll add that there's a good chunk of biopunk universes(e.g. twig), the parasytes in the Parasyte anime are biological, in the naturo verse chakra is stored and controlled biologically(I think?), and in a good chunk of magical universes the magic is stored physically somewhere. Though I would stay the heck away from the naruto verse until I had mental defences and the heck away from Parasyte until I had a lot of physical powers going for me.

      Sorry for the wall of text!

      > I feel that there needs to be a good, and preferably utilitarian, excuse for why someone need to use that power.

      Yeah, at some points there are going to be situations where it's arguably the right move to eat a person's body. Whether or not the character would go for it is another matter entirely that relies on the specifics of it all. Your note about settings rules for hunting down and killing people and the justifying thereof is a good one, and though I've thought of it before you've definitely expanded on it.

      Eating only non-sapients is going to be the main rule they abide by. While it's true that the best powers are usually reserved for the people of a given setting rather than the animals, there are still many powerful creatures that you don't need to feel guilty about killing to eat. 

      And, it's not just fictional organisms on the menu. The story is going to start out in My Hero Academia, which is basically Earth with superpowers and a bit in the future. There are loads of awesome powers you could gain just from real organisms, plus I think I can easily justify unexpected synergies. What the power actually does is optimise his body based and input and criteria, with the input being the food that it can select from, and the criteria being how it makes those selections. These criteria include, to some degree, the wishes of the user, but it's still a passive power rather than active so it's never going to be full controllable. 

      In regards to the MC being smart about his power, that's definitely going to happen, but I think you're overestimating the gains he can make. Pretty much any power that is basically just magic isn't going to be acquirable. Generally only macro scale physical features will be available, and while there will be some exceptions (special cells that lack senescence etc) gaining whole powers isn't a direction I want to go.

      For example, if someone has the power to fly through generation of reactionless thrust, he's not going to be able to gain that by eating it. Same thing goes for powers like telekinesis, teleportation etc. But he can totally gain things like acid spit, hyperefficient biology, radio eyes etc. 

      I'm inclined to stick with this limitation when it comes to other settings, too. Some magic abilities will be on the menu, many will not. He could still gain and learn some forms of magic that are available through other methods, but that'll be limited too. 

      Looking at what I've written, I feel like maybe I've dialled down the MC's power too low, but maybe not. I honestly do think staying on the lower level of possible power for this idea is beneficial, since even with all these restrictions he's going to be maybe still a bit OP.

      Due to the unreliable nature of when and how powers manifest in My Hero Academia, the first use of it will definitely be an accident. But you can rest assured that afterwards he'll be doing his best to gain the most from it. He's not going to be some hypercompetent genius about it, but he IS going to be realistically smart about it. There is going to be a bit of the story mirroring real life in that he's obviously going to use the internet and other resources to look up interesting things to eat, just like I am doing to find interesting bits for the story.

      Now we're finally up to the reply to your final paragraph, sorry about that. Twig, Parasyte, and Naruto are all most likely going to make an appearance. Still good suggestions though. I think next time I post about this story I should include a list of what I've already thought of or had suggested to me. Your mention of other biopunk universes intrigues me, could you name some? Twig is the only real one that I could think of. 

      IIRC you could justify that having no chakra at all would protect against mental attacks in Naruto, and even without it he may be able to stay out of sight for long enough to remedy this weakness. Physical toughness is likely to be one of our MC's highest stats, right behind perception (note: this isn't a litrpg ;P), so parasytes aren't likely to be too much of a problem, especially since they're typically alone - and once you've eaten one the others aren't near as much of a threat. It's partly for this reason that I'm actually thinking of just transplanting the parasytes into some other setting as some bio-experiment, like Star Wars or something(their psychic sense would slot well into force sensitivity). They're the only real interesting thing about their setting, so I feel like not much would be lost here anyway. 

      Phew! That was a long one! Thanks for giving me so much to think about though, I relish the opportunity to dive into these things.

    Sounds like the main character of [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion).

  I'll apologize in advance for any mistakes I make regarding community guidelines. This is my first time commenting or posting here, and while I have read them, I may accidentally slip up.

  So, I am trying to build a superhero setting from an alternate history where a meteorite containing a special serum was able to give a select few U.S. soldiers superpowers in World War 2. Essentially, they replaced the development of nuclear weapons as it happened in real life.

  This leads to the U.S. being a much more powerful superpower and throwing their weight around because they have the superpowered muscle to back it up.

  EDIT: I should have added more.

  Everyone gets a different superpower from the serum, and their children have a chance of having superpowers. The powers are not exactly the same though, and are not even guaranteed to be similar.

  About ~5 years after the war ends is when superheroes become government sanctioned crime fighters.

  - What pieces of world history should I absolutely not forget when constructing how things went down up through to the present day? 

  - Are there any easy mistakes that one can make when going off of this kind of divergence point?

    >a meteorite containing a special serum 

    Huh?  I mean, I think I know where you're going with this, but that's a distinctly strange mental image.

    >What pieces of world history should I absolutely not forget when constructing how things went down up through to the present day?

    For some less obvious ones (i.e. not directly part of the Cold War or the Civil Rights Movement)...

    * The rebuilding of Japan, and their innovations in the field of quality control
    * The Chinese Civil War
    * The relentless expansion of the American  military-industrial complex
    * The Catholic reforms of Vatican II
    * The establishment of Israel and the resulting wars in the area

    >Are there any easy mistakes that one can make when going off of this kind of divergence point?

    The two things that I would caution are flip side of the same coin.  If an event is due to a long-term trend, then a small deviation in surrounding events are unlikely to change it much.  On the other hand, if something only happened because the right sequence of events happened at the right time, then a small deviation in that sequence of events will absolutely chance things.

    As an example, Kennedy probably would have passed some kind of expansion of civil rights, even if he hadn't been assassinated and LBJ did so in his name.  On the other hand, the terrific expense of the moon missions may have caused them to be scrapped if Kennedy hadn't been shot, because a lot of that impetus came from his death.

    And the US probably would have ended up in another Middle East war if 9/11 hadn't happened.  And Congress may even have found a way to pass the Patriot Act, or something like it.  But the Department of Homeland Security probably wouldn't have been created if a profound attack hadn't shown Americans just how bad their federal agencies were at communicating with each other.

      Thank you! This is all very helpful, especially the examples. And I appreciate the lesser known historical events.

    How strong are the supersoldiers? I can't imagine Captain America-level superhumans having that kind of impact on geopolitics, especially if they are replacing nukes.
