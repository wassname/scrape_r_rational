## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have the ability to travel back in time, but you can't keep your memories. The only thing you gain is a feeling of deja vu every time you think of an idea that you thought of in the previous timeline. Is there a way to munchkin this?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Even without the deja vu feeling, you have a manual outcome pump, and could spend many bits of anonymity to double your money by going to a casino and putting all on black.

    Depending on what counts as an idea, you could establish communication between timelines. To write "Hello" to variable "welcome", you would consider the idea "Use Captain's Log Protocol v1.0 to set the first bit under the welcome heading to 0", and corresponding ideas for the remaining 39 bits of Hello. To read the contents of "welcome", you would consider all ideas one might use to write things under the welcome heading. If you receive a message from this, proceed to rewrite the message under headings welcome_l and welcome_r. If all ideas were previously considered, use a trusted random number generator to choose from welcome_l and welcome_r and recurse.

    This would be the point where I go into messages from the distant future and AI boxing but we've been through that.

    Well lots of people have mentioned lotteries, however due to being extremely susceptible to butterfly effects I don't think that would work so you would just end up repeating the lottery until you had tried every number or you won by sheer luck.

    Instead I would invest in high risk stocks, if I fail I would revert back. So I would invest in a high risk stock extremely briefly, if I got deja vu I would change stocks if not I would keep invested. If at any point the stock stopped profiting (they may not be profitable indefinitely) then I would go back to exactly when they stopped giving returns and the sense of deja-vu I got from everything I did would be a signal to me to change which stock I was invested in.                  
    I would also revert back if something bad happened to me, so my more general goal strategy would be to basically not do any action that triggered deja-vu.

    Eventually as others have already pointed out I could bootstrap this into an extremely slow binary anti-telephone, at which point I would progress from becoming a billionaire to using my power to send information like science back in time. I would also use my power as a probability pump in order to impact global events significantly (for instance replaying extremely close elections or other events until the desired candidate won).

      Winning by sheer luck from this process is not distinguishable from winning using a successful algorithm, so I don't see what the problem is. It's not even like it would take longer.
      ```

    - u/NoNotCar:
      ```
      A big problem with using this ability as a probability pump is that you have no idea how many times you have looped. If the target event is sufficiently unlikely you run the risk of being randomly suddenly killed (car crash, meteor to head) before you have the chance to use your power again.

  Suppose you had the ability of gaining a supers power(gaining, not replacing) in a world with classic hero-villains. Villains control various gangs, there's both vigilantee and organized heroes and such. You need to touch a super 6 times before getting the full power although the gains are incremental.

  There's a single hero in town whose power is to gain innate understanding of other's powers, and a few who can learn about your power in a roundabout way(reading your past but only he's watching you, getting extra knowledge when watching an event, temporarily making copies of you).

  How would you go about accumulating as much power as possible while staying off the grid for as long as possible?
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    If I'm reading this right, you're not stealing the power from someone, just copying it? Then you should try to become a staff member at wherever the largest super team is, and get in the habit of patting people on the back, shaking hands, and things like that. So long as the powers don't have an obvious physical component, you could fairly quickly get the power of everyone who works there and anyone who comes in often enough. If you worked in handling the super prisoners or entrance security, a quick weapons check would give enough contact to copy that person's power.

    If possible, you could also request to move to different locations so that you can copy the powers of other teams. It would be a long term thing though.

    Avoiding the guy who can tell at a glance that you have ulterior motives would be a matter of gathering good intel, but if you don't act as anything other than a regular employee then no one should have cause to turn their attention/information gathering powers on you.

    1. Start or join a superhero fanclub.

    2. Incite the members to ask for superhero fan events, like giving out handshakes or signing autographs.

    3. Superheroes, being the nice guys that they are, will likely agree to the requests of their fans and start holding these events.

    4. Join the events, shake hands with the heroes.

    ```
    Stand on the street, with a free hugs sign. 

    Not quite literal, but something silly like being a clown and while giving free balloons slightly touching the skin of people.

    Join a gang, pretend you're blind and profit? The argumentation for joining a gang is no one would suspect a blind person of being a drug dealer.

    It also depends on the power, does it have to be the act of touching a live, conscious being or just having access to a part of their body? In that case hire someone to get you a sample of their DNA (hair, spit, skin follicle) touch it and profit.

  You have the ability to change the spectrum that your eyes are sensitive to. The new spectrum must be contiguous, so you can't view UV and infra-red without visible as well. As part of this ability you can also change the sensitivity of your eyes to photons, which stops you getting blinded with large spectra and allows you to see single photons at high sensitivities. What interesting uses are there of this ability?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    I'm not sure there are. I mean, we can already do most of this with technology. There's already technology to see infrared, ultraviolet, X-rays, etc. Unless your ability is ridiculously precise, the only advantage is that you can view for free what other people need technology to view.
    ```

    I couldn't come up with anything interesting, but I did have a few stunningly boring ideas.

    * Help the FCC track down pirate radio stations.  Watch for radio frequency light that is brighter than it should be.

    * Work at a dock, scanning shipping containers for radioactive material.  By narrowing the sensitivity of your eyes to particular gamma-ray transitions, you could identify radioactive material being smuggled.

  Rule of three: You have magic. More or less wicca - you can do a great many things, all of them via rituals in prepared spaces.

  Rule: Anything that can be done and that you know how to do in sufficient detail can be done with magic. You could, for example, make gpus out of sand if you have the full mask of the chip and understand how it works. 

  Rule 2: Anything which cannot be done without magic cannot be done with it. 

  Rule 3: Becoming magic makes you subject to forces "muggles" are not. The rule of three is in full force - For you, karma is not an abstract idea, but a very rapid and vindictive law of nature. And it does not cancel out - if you punch one person and heal another, you will first get hurt three times as badly as person a was, and then rapidly heal even in the absence of further action on your part. This will kill you if you are ever responsible for sufficient harm coming to someone. 

  What do you do with this?
  ```

  - u/Peewee223:
    ```
    The obvious answer is to maximize your own karma. A pair of mages should be able to boost eachothers' karma massively by granting eachother healing, buffs (you can get stronger/smarter by exercising/studying, so you should be able to do that with magic right?), donating the positive results of one's work to eachother, etc.
    ```
