## A Proposed Algorithm for Generating Ratfic Settings

### Post:

1. Walk into/browse to an occult/"new age"/"magickal" bookseller/subreddit of your choice.
2. With as little regard to title, author, or subject as possible, pick up the first book that catches your eye.
3. Open to a random page, and read the approximately 300 words immediately following your initial focus as you open the book.
4. \[optional\] Keep reading until some combination of rage, boredom, amusement, disdain, or inability-to-even reach an arbitrarily chosen critical threshold.
5. Your new ratfic setting is a world where the phenomenon you've just read about is empirically verifiable and documented in multiple reputably-peer-reviewed journals, has observable upstream causes in the laws of physics, and supports downstream phenomena (e.g. [electromagnetism results from special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_electromagnetism)), all also empirically verified. Incoherent phenomena (oh yes you will find internally inconsistent in the space of 300 words phenomena doing this) are still in-bounds--an incoherent territory just produces an incoherent map, and sad positivists.
6. EDIT: for hard mode, the phenomena is \_theoretically\_ verifiable, but hasn't been, yet, and/or exhibits experimental weirdness such as strong anthropic effects or nonlocal interactions that are difficult to control for.
7. Munchkin to taste.

Content warning: compared to most of this stuff, canon Harry Potter is already a ratfic.

This isn't a troll post, I promise. Ha Ha Only Serious--I'm actually very curious what this method would produce.

  This would be a fun forum game. Top level comments describe a simple new age/occult belief, and replies describe either the underlying rules of the world where that phenomenon is real, or how that world's history and societies turned out differently.

  I'll start: [Phrenology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology)
  ```

    If the skull maintains a mostly consistent thickness as it wraps around the brain, its bumps on the outside correspond to small pockets of additional space on the inside - space which the growing infant brain expands to use. In this way, the causal arrow goes from minor variations in skull formation to brain capability and personality, not the other way around. The first experiments done to prove this involved intentionally adding volume by deforming young childrens' soft skulls, specializing their future brain development. Increasingly capable phrenologist surgeons can create hyperspecialized infants or apply desired personality modifications to entire groups. Some mental traits (those that correspond to regions not on the easily guided exterior of the brain) have remained impossible to manipulate for most of recorded history, but new surgical techniques allow for early brain growth to be guided to give more or less room to specific internal regions. Other new surgical techniques may have found a way to trick the brain into expanding to fill an artificially constructed cavity four or five times its original volume. The hope is that such an augmented brain will be able to create techniques to create a further augmented brain, and so on, and this will definitely go very well and nothing will go catastrophically wrong.

      >Increasingly capable phrenologist surgeons can create hyperspecialized infants or apply desired personality modifications to entire groups.

      The starting point was reached when the Flathead tribe of Native Americans was encountered by European explorers. Though genetically identical to surrounding tribes, and no less similar to the European explorers, their society exhibited a unification unseen in the rest of the world. European scientists immediately began exploring the concept in new directions and Phrenology was born.

      But the tradition of using a headboard to control the growth of the forehead produced a people whose capacity and propensity for certain thought patterns was shockingly uniform. Though they'd not experienced the inventive upheaval of the European enlightenment that was leading to accelerating rates of technological discovery, their unity allowed them to conquer their continent, and successfully repel the settlers from across the Atlantic. While European technologists were creating new generations of specialized people to fit the new industrial revolution concept of a division of labor, the Flatheads had created a society so dedicated to the same mindset that they saw similar gains in productivity and societal power through their induced harmony. Keeping up in technology often by stealing the inventions of the artificially more inventive Europeans, they remained a formidable world power.

      Naturally this massive divide in philosophy between two sides of the world led to a world conflict. Those who were unified valued their unity and demanded others unite with them. Those who were specialized valued their specialization and demanded that others specialize. Both saw the other as a disgusting affront to morality. How could you force children to all become the same person? How could you force children to all be alien to each other? 

      The twist came as both sides petitioned the Asian countries to ally with them, and to everyone's surprise this created a third side in the conflict. How, they replied, can you force children to be anything they aren't already? Conformity and specialization are both abhorrent. They're both a moral affront to personhood. And so the conflict became truly global as each of three idealists failed to accept the value of the others.

  I've always liked this idea; I actually had a very, very similar one back in the day, when I was getting into world-building. Only instead of going through occult/new age stuff, mine was more about looking through the history of science, picking certain key, fairly logical but ultimately discredited, and trying to imagine what a sci-fi world would look like if those theories had been true.

  What would modern technology look like, if phlogiston, as it was first conceptualized, was actually a thing? How would the ecology of a world develop and operate, if Lamarckism had turned out to be the true theory of evolution? Stuff like that.

  A common argument I've seen about homeopathy and "memory of water" is that if it was true, then drinking any random glass of water would mean feeling the homeopathically-amplified effects of every poison and every excrement that was ever dumped in its source. I'd say "imagine how that would go" except I think life would literally be impossible in such a world.
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Actual homeopathic practices care about the intent and mindset of the person mixing the water, which means the universe where homeopathy works doesn't actually diverge from the universe we live in until minds exist.

    It also breaks reductionism, hard: there are physical laws that specifically care about human minds and seem to act on human terms. But it's still a well-defined universe; it's not immediately self-contradictory, just absurdly unlikely.

    So: water, specifically, has an extra property of memory^(*), which is a weighted reference to a specific chemical structure. Diluting a substance in water produces a tiny amount of memory-weight for that substance. Diluting water in more water normally averages out the memory, (so natural water has basically no memory,) but when this happens it checks the chain of causality backwards for somewhere between five and thirty minutes (this has been surprisingly hard to experimentally nail down), and if it was caused by human intention, it instead spreads the intended compound's weight to the other water with *higher* weight, up to 10x the volume and 10x the weight. Returns drop off dramatically if you try to dilute more than 10x, so of course chemists do this in multiple stages.

    I'd like to point out that, since I haven't actually introduced a way to interact with memory-weight yet, we could be living in the universe I just described and there's no way you can disprove it. The next line will change that.

    Water inside a human body, specifically, acts as a reverse-catalyst of any chemical it remembers, but only if that person knows what the chemical is. That is, chemical reactions that would be triggered by the remembered chemical but not use atoms from it will happen in reverse at a rate proportionate to the memory-weight.

    When this was first discovered, people naturally tried chain-diluting various toxic substances. Some of these worked, notably most antivenoms, though until the correct dilution ratios were discovered, homeopathic antivenoms were frequently more dangerous than the venoms they treated. Many but by no means all medicines work on homeopathic principles, and these days few of them still work on "like cures like" even though this is still taught in grade school level texts. One notable drug is the miracle diet-drug homeopathic amylase, which can (but shouldn't) be mixed in your home using spit, and will let you eat sugary foods without gaining weight, but which also has dangerous side effects when administered in the wrong dose. There have also been terrorist attacks using homeopathic poisons (just about any homeopathic substance can be brewed to a lethal dose), but their effectiveness has been limited by the 10x volume rule and the need to inform would-be victims of what the poison is.

    (Now feel free to find amusing ways to break this.)

    ^(*) This also breaks reductionism but by nowhere near the same magnitude.

    Noo... obviously it has to be shaken the right way, and it only causes positive things.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Shaking clockwise enhances positive effects, shaking counterclockwise enhances negative ones. Most natural water flows move with turbulence that causes high vorticity, thus in water that's not specifically treated for homeopathic purposes the total outcome averages out to zero. Seems legit.
      ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    To be fair the principle of like cures like would probably mean that any poisons dumped into the general water supply would become harmless as anyone drinking the water juts got a powerful inoculation against their detrimental effects.

    &#x200B;

    Though that is an intersting point for world building. As it's unlikely that the practice of diluting waste in water to dispose of it would not exist if it in fact made toxins more potent, and that probably has some far reaching consequences.

    Wouldn’t people just drink concetrated sewage so as to minimize the effects?

  I love this idea. New age bullshit is some of my favorite bullshit.

  If you don't feel like tracking down your own new age woo, try picking a random video from [Spirit Science](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSpiritScience/videos) for this exercise. They make excellent, well-produced videos about the author's world views, which include seemingly every new age belief and new age themed conspiracy theory. I usually recommend the crystals movie since it's mostly nonsense supported by casual asides to even more outlandish nonsense, or the human history movie since it's an hour straight of the most gonzo D&D setting ever except it's supposed to be real world history. But those are actually so dense with this stuff that you probably shouldn't try this challenge with those specific videos (or at least do as OP suggests and stop early).

  Makes sense. Pact by Wildbow is basically a 'What if /x/ was all true?', while Unsong is also that, except for Abrahamic religions.
  ```

  - u/Evan_Th:
    ```
    Uh, no.  Unsong is "What if Jewish Kabbalah and a few other things were literally true?"  Christianity wouldn't be anything like that, and I don't think Islam or most other Jewish sects would be ether.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      UNSONG is a self-similar reflection of god, in the same sense that all things are fractally identically to god. Also, whale puns.

      Oh, yeah. I haven't got that far into the story and I admit about not being really knowledgeable about religion, so I tried to compensate by being more vague/general.
