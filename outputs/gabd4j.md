  If I were a suspicious sort, I'd wonder if this was yet another alexander wales alt account, drawing attention to the fact that early bird patreon chapters are available...

    Ha! At this point I'm apparently supposed to neither confirm nor deny that I'm AW.

    I have rules for alt accounts, one of which is that no two online identities can talk about each other, participate in the same conversation, or do any cross-promotion. For what that's worth, anyway.

  Check the Paetron for an easy answer, but yes early birds for a batch has gone out, likely with more on the way.

  I don’t think worth the candle sticks to a set schedule it comes out when it’s ready
