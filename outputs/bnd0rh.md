## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  There's a special location where you can't knowingly speak an untruth or you die on the spot. You can, however, say something you believe is true and be wrong, or state your intentions and then change your mind, but at the moment you speak, it must not be a deliberate untruth.

  Obviously that's quite useful for trials and business deals and alliances and all that jazz. *However*, it's also possible in this world to delete memories perfectly and irreversibly, as well as to temporarily suppress them or change them, or fabricate them entirely. Other than the permanent deletion, these gradually return to normal in about two years (Because souls heal brain damage because magic).

  How much does the presence of memory magic take away from the power of this special location? Anyone rich and powerful has relatively easy access to the memory magic, although it is, of course, illegal, and could come back to bite you in the ass if you were locked up for the two years and then taken to the location.

    Would you necessarily know if you'd had this memory magic performed on your memories?

      Nope. Entirely up to whoever modifies your memories.

        If you are planning on writing about this magic, an interesting novice mistake to make is to delete the memories of an incident in question, but not to delete the memories of deleting the memories of the incident.

        This one of the ideas which should be obvious if such mind magic is real, but makes the author look really smart for thinking of.

        I think I read about a villain in a *Harry Potter* fanfic who was caught because while he couldn't be Veritaserumed about something he Obliviated from his mind, he was caught anyway when he was asked if he remembered Obliviating himself of something at the same time as the crime. I don't remember where I read this though.
        ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    How this magic works and interacts with the truth-location is very strongly affected by what type of memories you allow to be affected.

    Can the magic affect:

    * Implicit Memory - Anything you remember unconsciously by rote or don't remember knowing. For example, if you went back to your old high school, if you can find your old math classroom even though you don't recall anything about the location, this is implicit memory.
    * Procedural Memory - How to perform a task such as riding a bike, make a sandwich, or singing a song. This is considered to be a type of implicit memory.
    * Explicit Memory - Information you have to work to recall such as phone numbers or addresses. The following three types all fall under explicit memory.
    * Declarative Memory - Anything factual such as dates, words, faces, events, and concepts. They can be rules of a sport, capitals of the states, or someone's appearance.
    * Semantic Memory - A subset of declarative memory concerning general facts such as rules of baseballs or someone's birthday.
    * Episodic Memory - A subset of declarative memory concerning events such as a baseball game or birthday party.

    These are all types of long term memory. Can the magic also affect short term memories (they last about one minute), working memory (information about what one is currently focusing on), or sensory memories (what you receive from your senses lasting fractions of a second)?
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      You can affect all of these, although messing with the subject's working and sensory memory is a bit overkill, and whatever you are trying to accomplish is probably easier done through other magic. Hard to make them remember the house as an elephant when they can actively see the house.

      Implicit memory is probably the hardest to make sure you delete/alter fully, and if there is reason to think someone has been messed with, here might be where it's easiest to detect that different memories don't line up. Episodic memories are the fastest to wipe - for everything else you have to spend a little time getting into the mindspace of the target. Which you can, since anyone who can alter memories can also read them, but it will take more time.

      Thank you for your input!
      ```

  - u/HarryPotter5777:
    ```
    Intention can still be credibly stated in this location regardless of memory, so you still have the very valuable service of things like 

    * only electing politicians who can truthfully attest every month that they intend to act in service of what they believe to be the best possible world for the good of the populace
    * Everyone sufficiently rich and powerful has to attest that they see no plausible futures in which they would use the memory magic short of directly protecting specific people from harm, and that in any such case they would report their usage to a given trusted authority.
    * Honestly given promises

    Of course all of the above can still be tainted by being based on incorrect past memories, but in the short term it's still accurate. 

    Other things that come to mind:

    * Every single citizen of a country/employee of a corporation/etc is forced to visit this place and say a series of statements like "I harbor no intentions to commit murder", "I will never disobey the will of the Grand Emperor", etc., and everyone for whom that isn't true conveniently dies. 


    What are the logistics of the memory magic? How much is required for someone to use it? Some progressively more restrictive conditions:

    * You can apply it to "everyone meeting condition X" without knowing who exactly that applies to
    * You need only know their name
    * You need visual contact
    * You need physical contact
    * You need prolonged access to their body for a period of several hours

    Also, how much can memories be read? Like, can Powerful Person Paul delete my memories of the password to the vault even if Paul doesn't know what the password he needs to delete is? Can he delete every conversation I've had with Eve even if he doesn't know when or where I met her? Can he delete my memories of "entering a 1 on the keypad initially", see if that worked, then try deleting my memories of "entering a 2 on the keypad initially", etc., until he's extracted the password?
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      > What are the logistics of the memory magic?

      You need physical contact. A few seconds will do if you're good at it and know exactly what you are looking for, but magic can be felt by other magic users nearby while it is being used. It can't be felt after the fact, but during the actual memory tinkering, anyone nearby is likely to sense exactly what you are doing.

      Anyone who can delete or alter memories can read them as well. They can't automatically or easily detect *other* memory altering magic, but if they can change memories, they can also read them. The more extensively you want to alter things, and the more precise and exhaustive you want to be about it, the longer it takes. Want to delete all memories of a childhood friend, now we're likely looking at hours of work if you don't want to leave conflicting memories and little moments where you mentioned them briefly while talking to someone else.

      You can delete memories as specific as passwords, but it wouldn't be by trial and error, you would just seek the memory out, watch it, confirm it's the right one, and then wipe it.
      ```

      - u/HarryPotter5777:
        ```
        The obvious strategy here then seems to be nighttime reads - break into someone’s house while they’re sleeping, read all their memories, wipe any recollection of that night, and all they’ll notice the next morning (or ever) is not sleeping well. Since the default state of sleep memories is nonexistent, there’s nothing to alter once you scrub their memories, so they won’t know what happened two years later.
        ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Since memories return to normal in about two years, can't you just hold the suspect in jail for two years then test them? As for permanent deletion, that's easy enough to detect. Ask the suspect what they were doing at every moment in time that's relevant to the case. If their memories of that moment have been deleted, they wouldn't be able to say what they were doing.

    But before all those issues though, I would outlaw any use of that special location. It is way way too dangerous. If you speak your intent and change your mind partway through the sentence, you die. If you misspeak and end up saying something you know is untrue, you die. If a lawyer confuses you into saying something you don't believe with double double negations, you die. It is just far too easy to die in the special location even when you have no intention of speaking untruths. What kind of horrible lie detector kills you instead of just sending some harmless signal like glowing in red when a lie is spoken?
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Holding someone under constant supervision for two years is pretty disruptive, and it would almost exclusively be happening to the rich and powerful. As to mistakes - people treat it with a considerable amount of veneration and respect. They don't use it casually, and are aware that it is dangerous. I don't see people in my setting abandoning use of it.
      ```

    This is pretty dependent on more details of how memory magic is actually used. If it's the equivalent of "anyone can learn it's just really hard" then spreading memory magic is as easy as putting memories of how to do memory magic into someone's head. Bam, you've got a temporary memory mage who can make whatever they want true then delete their memory of being a memory mage.

    It'd probably see the most use as shuffling prisoners through it if they claim they'd been memory-magic'd into confessing to a crime, as a form of two year high risk parole.

      This is an excellent suggestion. Thank you.

      Inserting memories is quite different from inserting skills, however. You can show someone video footage of how to perform surgery, but without all the surrounding medical knowledge a surgeon needs, they would still make a pretty poor surgeon. Most people *can* learn to use it, in the same way that most people *can* learn calculus, it's just not going to happen. It's also slightly constrained by how personality impacts magic in my world, but we are still talking more than 50% of the population being able to learn it if they try really, really hard for a long time, and learn all the lesser magic leading up to it. It's not incantations and hand movements, more like magical surgery.

    Memory-altering makes it trickier to enforce the law in certain scenarios, but by no means impossible. Assuming it isn't so prohibitively expensive to change or delete memories that the state cannot afford to use it occasionally, all the memories of the suspect related to the investigation of the crime and the magical area itself could be deleted, thus preventing subsequent memory altering on the part of the suspect to cover his tracks 2 years down the line. Then, a subsequent trial could be staged in the special location 2 years after the crime, with the suspect now unaware of the magical phenomenon present, and a question posed as to some significant event in the original crime scene which law enforcement thought the memory of which might have been screwed with. If the suspect failed when attempting to lie and give his false alibi or what have you, he would be exposed as guilty. You could make this as complicated as you like, of course, from convincing the suspect he was answering to God himself to convincing him he was talking to a trusted friend. 

    Of course, I imagine this would cost quite a bit, so it would probably only be used on the rich or those who in some manner had the resources to alter their memories. Perhaps for the poor or middle class, it would be done on a lottery to help prevent the odd conspiracy or organized crime operation. And penalties for memory alteration would have to be excessive to work as an incentive against it. 

    There's always the odd chance that people might try to keep this process from working on them by spending large amounts of time, and thus generating many memories, thinking about the existence of the crime investigation and/or the special location. This could be prevented with some use of "meta-memories," however. It seems trivial enough to implant a memory in someone wherein they visit their psychiatrist who describes to them that they have an obsession with thinking about a fantasy of such nature.

  - u/Izeinwinter:

    Well, for one thing, everyone convicted of anything gets an automatic appeal after two years. 
    I would also expect memory magic to carry *heavier* penalties than murder and rape.

    Can you mess with your memories, or does it have to be someone else? Does other people messing with your memories require your permission? How are fabricated memories generated, and are they hard to tell apart from the real thing?
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      You can mess with your own memories, but it's harder, and so fewer people can do it. However, the way personality shapes magic in my world, the more secretive and scheming you are, the more likely you happen to have a talent for it.

      Others do not require your permission to mess with your memories, but they need to touch you, or at least be close, and you can't hide the fact that you are using magic from other magic users nearby. If you are both magic users, basically you need to be willing, asleep or otherwise helpless.

      Fabricated memories are created by you imagining yourself in the position of the target and simulating experiencing the memory, then shoving that experience into their brain, possibly in place of the original memory if there was one. So it's easier if you know them, and unless you know them *very* well it's going to take a while if you want it to seem realistic. If you are altering an existing memory, you would usually relive the real one by reading their mind, then playing it back with changes. If you want it seem as realistic as possible, you probably have to play it back and forth several times. If you want to change all memories on a topic, you have to do them all individually. Deleting is faster and easier, but fabricating and changing takes time. If you want it to be believable. If you wanted to you could just randomly fill all their memories with menacing pink elephants standing around in the background. That would be fast, just not very believable.

        Is one's ability in this art, also affected by their perspective/artistic ability? (Are the blind unable to create fake (visual) memories for those who can see?)
        ```

        Mind reading would also be very useful in this world, as it would make memory magic easier/more plausible.

    How many people can perform the memory magic?

    What tools or components does it take?

    How much do they know about the content of what they removed? 

    Could we license them and require them to each routinely affirm (at that spot) that they have not altered a memory to conceal a crime?

    Can we track the supply chain of tools & components?

  At the snap of your fingers, you can spontaneously change your velocity. You do not feel the sudden change in velocity, but you any consequences of a high velocity affect you normally (Supersonic speeds relative to air hurt, reentry speed can cause massive burns, a velocity straight down still breaks your legs, ect). Not that snapping is not instantaneous, and repeated quick snapping can be physically strenuous.

  &#x200B;

  Lets say the velocity does not have to be applied uniformly, so that you can use your snaps to change your rotational speed, and possibly even punch harder (as long as you avoid ripping your hand from your arm.)

  &#x200B;

   How useful is this power? Flying is difficult, requiring constant snapping, and landing is even harder. Trying to move something with can be dangerous if you accelerate to quickly while improperly holding the object.

  &#x200B;

  How would you use this power?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Is there no limit to how much velocity change you can apply? If so... well...

    There are fictional stories of people being so powerful that they are effectively walking nukes. Your power would put these people to shame, because you're a walking galaxy destroyer. Change your velocity to light-speed \* (1 - 1/infinity) in the direction of the earth. It would kill you, but the nigh infinite amount of kinetic energy you inject into the Earth would also destroy it, sending fragments of the Earth out in all directions at nigh light-speed. And by fragments I don't mean just solid matter, I mean subatomic particles as well, because nigh-infinite kinetic energy will overpower the strong nuclear force with ease. These fragments will then repeat the process on everything they hit, eventually destroying the galaxy.

    You may be a little short of a universe destroyer though, depending on whether the universe can expand faster than light forever.

    > Lets say the velocity does not have to be applied uniformly 

    Oh! A safe way to apply your power. Apply a massive amount of velocity to a tiny patch of skin or hair, and it will fire off like a bullet and leave you only with the minor injury of losing some skin or hair. Don't apply too much velocity though, otherwise the above scenario happens and its not so safe for you after all. This unfortunately means very low velocities while on Earth, since you don't want your skin or hair to undergo nuclear fusion with the air surrounding you. 

    On the other hand, you would be unstoppable in space, being able to fire off near-light-speed projectiles safely through the vacuum of space to hit far away targets. You still can't apply near infinite amount of kinetic force without destroying the galaxy, but what you can apply safely is more than enough to destroy pretty much anything you want.

    Consider using a tooth or a nail for extra lethality if this is somehow not enough.
    ```

    - u/hh26:
      ```
      Assuming you're in a version of our world in modern times (aside from this power existing), you will probably be using this power exclusively on earth.  Then, assuming you don't want to kill yourself, your biggest constraint will be limiting objects to speeds that don't vaporize you when you fire them (and also limited in range by the object vaporizing itself and dispersing all its momentum into the air before it reaches its destination?)

      Small objects like flecks of skin will probably vaporize really quickly and disperse their energy and momentum into a wider range of air, and act more like a beam cannon than a bullet, while larger objects like nails might maintain their structure more.  But I'm mostly speculating based on that one XKCD what-if with the baseball.

      Either way, the amount of energy you can impart is unbounded as you asymptotically approach lightspeed, the only question is how deadly can you get without killing yourself.  

      You can probably nuke a city (or anything smaller or larger) by getting a protective suit, launching yourself into the air, firing a fleck of skin at relativistic speeds towards the city through a small opening in the suit, then flinging yourself backwards at supersonic speeds to avoid the energy heat explosion, then slowing yourself down and landing once you reach a safe distance.
      ```

  - u/meterion:
    ```
    How much of what is "not you" does your power cover? If it doesn't cover you at all, then it would be very difficult to use this power wearing anything at all, since things like a watch or phone or even piercings, tooth fillings, medical devices, etc would fuck you up if you tried any fast shifts, and it'd be pretty difficult to make heavy use of.

    Beyond that, something like a modified recumbent bike you can harness yourself on for optimal momentum transfer would be pretty relaxing to ride in,
    ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    If you can change your momentum without being affecting by sudden changes in momentum, then you have a perpetual machine.

    One straight forward way to apply it, is to stand on a spoke of a water wheel or something similar that is standing still and snap your fingers to suddenly have a large velocity. Your body will forcibly push the water wheel into moving and thus harvest the kinetic energy into a usable form.

    Granted this would damage your body, but it's an example of how to extract work from your power.
    ```

  You have a limited mind control power. Specifically, you can persuade anyone of anything in the course of a five minute one-one-one conversation, as long as it's something that you believe and it's something that actually is true. (If you're not completely sure about something, you can't make someone else more certain than you yourself are.) If you want to get more technical, it only works on things that you have "knowledge" of, where "knowledge" has the traditional philosopher's definition of "justified true belief". Attempting to persuade someone of anything else works exactly as well as it would if you did not have this power.

      ```
      Err,  I don't think that would work. Just because you can convince anyone in a 5 minute one-on-one conversation doesn't mean that the exact same conversation would work for everyone. You might need to say things differently in response to different questions, and may need to say them at the right timing depending on the body language of the target, etc.

      - u/xamueljones:

        That may be true, but there are podcasts out there about two people arguing about an important topic which can convince viewers.

        Even if the viewers aren't exactly the same person as your 'partner', there is likely to be a significant fraction of the audience who identify with your partner. You could even make it your gimmick. For every important topic there is to argue about, you make a series of videos talking to various individuals and the viewers simply choose the character they identify the best with.

        For example, in the series 'Arguing Cryonics with...' there are videos such as 'Arguing Cryonics with a Democrat', 'Arguing Cryonics with a Republican', 'Arguing Cryonics with a Christian', 'Arguing Cryonics with a Preschooler', and so on for whatever section of the audience you want to reach.

        This is assuming that you magically know the best arguments to persuade someone rather than just having them agree with you without you coming up with any arguments.

        The audience won't be as well convinced, but I would assume some of the rhetorical impact would carry over.

No door will remain barred to me for long, not when I can persuade the people guarding it to open it for me...
