## [RT] [C] Not A Manga is now complete!

### Post:

The final chapter of volume 2 for my serial novel **My Life is not a Manga, or maybe...** is officially public as of today! You can read the whole thing on my site or Royal Road:

For those new to the story, the protagonist discovers he is the main character in a rom-com harem manga, and then spends a lot of time trying to get his normal life back. He's genre-savvy and tries to think before he acts (not always successfully), and fair warning there's a big ol' genre swap from Volume 1 to Volume 2. But if it sounds interesting, give it a shot! Whether I succeeded at the things I was trying to do is up for debate, but it's undeniably different than most stories about people getting stuck in manga plotlines.

I would love to talk shop about what worked and what didn't in Not A Manga if anyone is interested! If you finish it, please let me know what you loved (or hated)!

If you like my writing, I am now moving on to a new story called **Mr. Familiar**, which is currently available only through Royal Road: https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36645/mr-familiar

I'm not sure yet how rational it will be (so I may or may not post about it again here). The protagonist is another genre-savvy character out of his depth, but if you approached it wholly rationally the main character's situation is pretty horrific, and I'm trying to figure out how to gain broader appeal (at least with the Royal Road crowd, for now) while still breaking genre constraints so the story is likely to lean more on humor (at least initially).

  Read a few chapters, it seems pretty fun. So far the protag seems clever/genre-savvy enough to make him a good rational actor, but occasionally thoughtless enough that tropey developments can slip by him regardless. 

  I had some slight dissonance reading from every Japanese term being explained to me even though I already know them (I'm a bit of a weeb myself) while instead having to google american things I'd never heard of before (like what a "mudroom" is - I first thought it was a eupherism for toilet). EDIT: Store names as well, especially since they've been changed. I know some, like "Barnes and Noble" -> "Barnes and Novel" and "Victorias Secret" -> "Elizabeths Secret", but I'm not familiar enough with US shops to decipher "Big 6". Not that it matters to the plot at all, but the whole thing is similar to being new to manga and not getting the japanese cultural references.

  EDIT2: Finished the first volume and a bit into volume 2. The story seemed to be going somewhere interesting, but then then everything was quickly dropped in an anticlimax and the story just sort of ended with no feeling of having resolved the conflict. Volume 2 then completely drops just about everything from the previous volume, it might as well be a completely new story with a similar protagonist. Like a lot of webfiction unfortunately, interesting idea for a premise that sustains the beginning but seemingly no real plan for an actual story arc which makes for an unsatisfying end. I suppose everything could theoretically be tied together and neatly wrapped up by the end of volume 2, but it doesn't seem to be heading in that direction.

    Heh, you're not alone! A lot of people were unhappy with the transition to Volume 2 (including myself, to some extent). A jarring switch was actually my plan before I wrote a single word of volume 1 (because I wanted the reader to feel the disconnect that the protagonist feels when they're suddenly cut off from everything familiar, which is normally glossed over in isekai), but turns out there's a good reason for other books to avoid that! It's not a comfortable or fun thing to experience, even vicariously.

    The anticlimax of volume 1 is something that I struggled with. On the one hand, it's entirely appropriate because the protagonist is actively trying to escape his own story the whole time, so of course as soon as he finds a way it's going to collapse around my ears. On the other, I didn't quite accomplish what I was aiming for with all the heroines. Samantha and to a lesser extent Paula ended up about where I wanted them, but I totally botched Jill (her entire arc will be getting rewritten when I have a chance to revise), lost track of Ms. Carino, and I need to drop a few more hints for Rachel's behavior to make even marginal sense.

    In any case, thank you for your criticism!

    Big 6 is probably Big 5, a sporting goods store.

  So no Volume 3? I was hoping for a magical girl or urban fantasy genre next.That's disappointing but I'd rather you write what you want. Hopefully we can at least get an epilogue at some point?

  - u/EOTenkey:

    No plans for a volume 3 at the moment! I do have some ideas for where the story could go (and there's a missing Volume 1.5 novella that I planned, but ultimately skipped over), so I might return to this world eventually but short-term it just wasn't garnering very much interest (and I alienated a lot of people with the shift to Volume 2; whoops), so I'm going to let it lie fallow for a bit.

  Thank you for the heads up. I know these types of posts are much rarer but I definitely prefer them to chapter update posts even if I end up not liking the story.

  - u/EOTenkey:

    Same here. :-)

    On the other hand, my projects tend not to have many followers, so perhaps posting when I start, finish, or hit a major milestone isn't the best strategy.
    ```

- u/Tenoke:
  ```
  I just read the first 30 chapters and I can see why people like it but the protagonist manages to be just as frustrating as the normal protagonist in these type of stories. I kept expecting him to take some advantage of his genre saviness rather than go against everyrhing for reasons as contrived as in the source genre. Nonetheless, that kind of thing clearly works for many.

  I'd have much rather read about his dad, who acts and thinks closer to how I thought the protagonist would.
