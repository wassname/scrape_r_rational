  Suze uses AWESOME!!!  It's super effective!

  Death is confused...

  Death used bide!  It's not very effective...

  Death is unable to battle!

    I stared at this for several long seconds, trying to figure out what you were talking about.

    Then I completely cracked up; my eyes are watering from laughing so hard.  Thank you.

      No, no, no, thank YOU.  Your story is awesome.

        I just caught myself re-reading this [the original post] out loud in a WWE  / Battle of the Monster Trucks announcer voice ("It's the battle of the Monster Trucks, trucks, trucks!!!!") and snickering.

  Short chapter today.

  ```
  Great chapter, but somehow I feel like it would have flowed better as an epilogue to book 1, rather than being stuck in the midst of book 2.
  ```

  ```
  We should get someone from /r/science or /r/physics or something to ask them how this would actually play out.

  What's the [gravitational time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_time_dilation) factor?

  Let's assume he sat around inside the black hole for a few minutes (from his perspective). Let's assume he was around ten meters away. We know that it's ten billion solar masses.

  The equation I found on the internet breaks down inside of the Swartzchild radius (i.e. the event horizon). The logic is that if you measure the amount of time it appears to take for somebody to fall into a black hole, it take an infinite amount of time, because the photons heading in your direction are going slower and slower as they get closer to the black hole.

  I wonder if any of Death's followers tried to teleport into the room to save him. Where is this room, anyhow? Not on the Material Plane, I hope.

    [time dilation]

    I am treating the area inside the event horizon as also having infinite time dilation.  From the outside universe reference frame, Neklos is stuck inside a Temporal Stasis (except not magical).  From his own perspective he was only in there for one round -- 6 seconds.  When the black hole finished evaporating the time dilation fell apart and he returned to find a universe where all the protons had decayed into nothing.


    > Where is this room, anyhow? Not on the Material Plane, I hope.

    Nope.  Extradimensional space (aka demiplane) that Afi had created.
    ```

    - u/Zephyr1011:
      ```
      In a universe with magic, that can break the conservation of energy laws with ease, would the all protons in the universe necessarily ever decay into nothing?
      ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        Given how many things can go wrong someone would likely destroy civilization eventually.
        ```

        - u/Zephyr1011:
          ```
          In a universe where millions of random commoners are being given obscenely high class levels? Killing *all* of them sounds extremely implausible. They all have the capability to create their own demiplanes for one.
          ```

          - u/LordSwedish:
            ```
            Someone will figure out a way to cast "Polymorph Any Object: proton to tons of antimatter." on a universal scale eventually.
            ```

            - u/awesomeideas:
              ```
              Polymorph Any Object: Multivertse to nothing
              ```

- u/Chronophilia:
  ```
  I recall it being a fairly major plot point that Neklos' Portfolio Sense would give him some warning before he died. Shouldn't it get a mention here?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    His portfolio sense only applies for up to 20 weeks into the future.  His death was a lot farther out than that.  (I chose to have the '20 weeks' be in the reference frame of the Earth, not of Neklos himself.)
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      Absolutely. But once he exits the time dilation field, should he notice his impending death?
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        Once he exits the field, he has no godly powers anymore.
        ```
