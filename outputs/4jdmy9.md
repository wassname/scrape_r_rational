  When this was posted previously it was pointed out by a great many people, that you can't use the machine like that. 

  If you have enough bifurcated universes random chance will cause some to not follow protocol with entering numbers. Effectively you can't get complex information if you have too many universes.

    But if it's hooked up to a computer they can iterate small amounts of information until they add up. Anything a computer can check cheaply (passwords, etc) can be gotten.

      Yup. Achieving true happiness / world domination when your only power is the ability to guess any password you're allowed to enter twice is a much more difficult job though. Petty theft only gets you so far.

  As I mentioned last time this was posted, no one tell Coil about this machine.

  Also it would destroy the universe.

  I'm certain this story was posted previously.

      I see no results for the URL nor the title. You have a link?

      Edit: Iooks like it was deleted and so doesn't  appear in search. https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4chu76/all_paths_to_happiness/

        Huh, wonder why.

  The idea that after creating a set of universes across which you watch *literally every possible set of ~2 hour long moving images*, the device that enters the highest number would enter anything remotely close to 0 is absurd.

  Oh and one major thing that bothered me about the story was the fact that it wasn't explained or explored what happens if the button is pressed a different number of times before entering a number. Say for instance you decide to press it, then press it again if you see a 1 and not if you see a 0. You'd have a 0, a 11, and a 10 universe. If the 0 universe you enters the highest number, then everyone sees a 0? In the story it seemed taken for granted that every single result was exactly 2^n bits. What if in one universe, the computer went haywire and produced a subtree of a few googolplex extra universes? Just seems a bit odd not to at least mention.

  The lack of trust that this person has for zemself is astoundingly bizarre.

    ```
    You're talking about near the end? That's because they spent decades training themselves to not trust anyone until it became automatic.
    ```
