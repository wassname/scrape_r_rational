  Reading this I realized throughout the work there's a lot of hyphens (-) where I'd have used double hyphens (--) -- as when breaking up a sentence containing separate but related thoughts. Not a typo really, just a stylistic observation.

  >Eulogy’s gonna have all our asses”

  Missing comma.

  >*Yeah definitely video game slavers.*

  Maybe a stylistic choice, but I'd put a comma after 'Yeah.'

  >not killing any of them on principal.

  Principle\*

  >anyway. ”

  Extra space.

  >this world operates on but you

  Another possible stylistic choice, but I'd put a comma after 'on.'

  >“Ah, welcome back”

  Missing comma.

  >*Whatever that was I don’t*

  Possibly-stylistic missing comma after 'was.'

  >small arms

  I'm not that familiar with the IP, but I think it's Small Guns (with that capitalization.) 

  >place 3 shots

  This is nitpicky, but I think the style guides would call for 'three' rather than the numeral. 

  >the rest of the mad max gunmen

  *Mad Max* unless intentional style choice. 

  >Roy wasn’t in immediate danger.

  Oh, the irony.

  >“ Damn you, Emrys, 

  Extra space.

  >function of our utility . ”

  Extra spaces around the period.

  >knowing what you know.” he said

  Period instead of comma.

  >perhaps I can just show you” he said

  Missing comma.

  >impact me long-term, but short- term

  Space between short- and term.

  >we were just outside of town.

  Could be stylistic, but 'outside town' is correct.

  >“ God DAMN it,”

  Extra space.

  >“ OW. I don’t know.

  Extra space.

  >he killed… god,

  Usually capitalized, but that's between you and the big guy of your choice.

  >“Did you say Merlin ?”

  Extra space before question mark. 

  >who else does the Concept have.” 

  Period instead of question mark.

  >“I don’t know,” I told the little creature honestly. “I really don’t know.”

  Yes, Haley, Sauron *does* have the Death Star. At least you seem to have found some minty, party drug proton torpedoes! Now it's just a matter of finding the right thermal exhaust port to stick them in.

  Great chapter! A few more typos than usual, but I enjoyed it a lot.

  I wasn't expecting Haley to run into the Concept in the wasteland, but in retrospect it's a good thing; if she had no forewarning she'd have gotten stomped upon her return. I enjoyed Haley's reactions to Fallout physics.

    Thank you for the spellcheck. I don't know why this one reverted to the jankier spacing, I'll have to keep a closer eye on it.

  Oh. 

  Oh right. They have a lot of celebral characters and a race of genies. Shit.

  Well... it isn't so bad though. It's less "All your minds belong to the Concept" more of a crazy free-for-all, with pretty much every Concept-controlled character secretly working against it. Does help that they are geniuses.

  I wonder if that witch girl is [Maria Ushiromiya](https://umineko.fandom.com/wiki/Maria_Ushiromiya) from Umineko no Naku Koro ni. They'll have a theme going, then.

    ```
    Witch girl is ~~Hermione~~ Gretchen, who has meta knowledge of HP. And I don't think the Concept has gobbled up the efreets yet, has it? Pretty sure they just decided to make their play while Haley was out.
    ```

    - u/PurposefulZephyr:
      ```
      I don't think that was Hermione (that "Griffindor through and through" said more about Merlin than her). She's from real world, and a narrator to boot. She *could* be Sean's fanfic author (he did mention her being *no more than* 16 years old).

      Yes, Efreets are for sure their own faction here. However, I don't remember who was their narrator. Didn't it come from Haley's Pathfinder, so essentially our dragon lady?

      Also, that was my gut reaction to a known genius having possibility of an access to genies. Forgot to mention they would *at worst* have this odd, adversalial relationship, where Concept!Characters try to monkey paw on purpose.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Oh right, my mistake. I don't think she's Sean's fanfiction author--her name is Gretchen, and Sean's current narrator is Harriet. Regardless, she's explicitly using Harry Potter magic, not the system from the visual novel you linked. 

        Pathfinder seems to be the odd man out as far as the stories go--it's a ruleset, not a narrative. Even if Haley is the one bringing it into being, the efreets will still act according to their Lawful Evil nature. Haley made them a promise (the details of which I'm forgetting), and now they're taking their due.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          The fallout setting they've wandered into us also a ruleset without a specific narrator it seems
          ```
