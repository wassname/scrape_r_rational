  Hey everyone, this week we explore the differences between good description and bad description, and analyze examples of descriptions from novels.

  I think this might be one of my favorites so far, from a perspective of how focused the discussion is on (hopefully) useful aspects.  Curious to know if others feel the same way, so any feedback is welcome!

  Before we start, we'd like to thank [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) for sponsoring the show. Scrivener is a writing app that I've been using for about four years now. I've written four novels and two novellas with it, along with half a dozen works-in-progress. After a long time of trying various word processing and writing programs, Scrivener is the best that I've found.

  The organizing power of Scrivener makes it easy to wrangle a story with dozens of unique characters and multiple interwoven plots, which combines with a fast and intuitive interface that makes character dossiers and chapter outlines just a key command away. Adding to this is a powerful export suite that allows for a Scrivener file to be turned into a wide variety of digital formats with just a few clicks.

  If you want to try it out, they offer a free 30-day trial, and if you decide to buy it and help support the show, you can use the code RATIONALLY during the month of March to get 20% off. Hope you find it useful!

      You heard it here first, folks: EY uses Scrivener for *everything.*

      Yes, even that.

      (Thanks for the added endorsement!)

    I apologize for not being more proactive with my feedback, but I have felt for a while now that episodes more focussed on the writing techniques are vastly more interesting.  
    Sometimes there are all these different relevant examples you mention that I might not have read and/or not care about that fill up the majority of the time. I don't *mind* hearing your opinions on different works but personally I'm here for a discussion about writing and not about written works if that makes sense. I understand the use of examples obviously, but it feels like you lose track sometimes maybe?  
     Also while not always applicable I would prefer a more explicit mentioning of how rational works use the subject. For example do rational writers use more or less descriptions? Would there be more focus on thoughts and dialogue to express information? As rational writers your writing advice implies the context for rational works, but it can sound more as how things are done in general. And if what you are saying isn't about objectively good writing and only from a rational point of view, it would still be interesting to shortly mention other styles.  

    To more specifically answer the feedback question, I would say this episode was indeed one of the better ones and the next topic also sounds interesting.

  I liked Alex's brief segment on MRI scanning and imagination. That's what sets this podcast apart from most other writing advice.

    Yeah, I wanted to get into a bigger conversation about that, but restrained myself because it would be mostly off-topic and the episode was running long enough as is. It's something that really fascinates me though.

  There is one character introduction I read quite a while ago in a captivating book called *The Raw Shark Texts*. I can't speak about the book as a whole, since I didn't get very far into it before losing it while moving apartments, but here is the description of the main character's therapist:

  >Dr Randle was more like an electrical storm or some complicated particle reaction than a person. A large clashing event of a woman whose frizzy hack job of white-brown hair hummed against a big noisy blouse which, in turn, strobed in protest against her tartan skirt. She had strontium grey eyes which crackled away to themselves behind baggy lids. She made the air feel doomy, faintly radioactive. You half expected your ears to pop.

  I love it because it's essentially a rundown of physical appearance, but done in a way that is fun to read. It's also woven into descriptions of her and her actions that come later in the same passage:

  >"Right then." She thunderclapped her hands.

  and

  >She leaned forward, big blotchy forearms on big tartan knees.

  The description is a bit wacky, so I'm not sure how much place it has in rational fiction, but it grabbed my attention to the point that it's one of my strongest memories from that book. I loved how it weaves her personality and presence into more mundane descriptions of her physical appearance. I think most mediocre writers would find a way of saying "here's what she's wearing. By the way, she's also eccentric."
  ```

    That's definitely a unique character description, and I can easily see people either loving it for how evocative it is while/or hating it for how busy it is. If you want a character to make an impression though, doing so through a memorable description like that works either way :)
