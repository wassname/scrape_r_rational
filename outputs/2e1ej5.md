    Thanks for that. Probably wouldn't have cared or even remembered just the start of it.

  One of my favorites (but then, I'm a big fan of nearly everything that Vinge has done).

  Thanks for this. It reminds me of Yudkowsky's That Alien Message, but Vinge's work is better in many ways IMO. I really liked everything about this - a great story.
