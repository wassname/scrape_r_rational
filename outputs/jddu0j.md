## [RST][WIP][HF][FF] Seeking Power by Forthwith: "Archmage Twilight Sparkle barely sleeps between her duties, her research, and raising Spike. Now she also has to deal with an evil goddess's return. It would have been nice if Celestia had mentioned she has a sister a year ago…" Rewritten and updated!

  When _Seeking Power_ stopped updating in 2014, many though it was dead. Turns out, such was not the case. Forthwith has rewritten the fanfic and has updated it with 3 new chapters!

  [Here](https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/909012/seeking-power-revision-notes) are the revision notes, [here](http://forthwithfic.com/ow/sp/sp_index.php) is the original version of _Seeking Power_ for anybody who wants to read it, and [here](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/175016/across-the-boundary) is the side story collection _Across the Boundary_.

  For those of you who have read [_The Moon's Apprentice_](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice), this fic is by the same guy, so you have an idea of what to expect, (though this fanfic's Twilight is less of a social manipulator and more of a massive autist). For those who haven't, I think the chapter one scene where Twilight splits her mind into different personalities to solve a problem should set the tone nicely. For context, Twilight has just learned that Luna is coming back from her thousand-year banishment in in two months and that Celestia has no way to stop her.

  > “Uh-huh. Anyway, will you give me a few minutes to absorb everything so far?”
  > 
  > Getting a nod from Celestia, Twilight turned inward and divided her thoughts into the usual three strains to debate the matter before her: Advocate to suggest ideas, Opposition to tear them apart, and Overseer to keep order.
  > 
  > _So,_ Overseer began, _Celestia has had a thousand years to come up with solutions. Any new ones we generate either have to hinge on relatively recent information she wouldn’t have had time to dwell upon or depend on things we know or can do but not her. I leave the floor to you two._
  > 
  > _First, let’s identify the worst case scenario,_ said Opposition.
  > 
  > _Everypony dies._
  > 
  > _Yes, that’s real creative, Advocate. Now elaborate on that._
  > 
  > _Okay. Luna breaks free. Banishes or kills Celestia. Kills us. Subjects the world to eternal night. Freezes it._ And then _everypony dies. Obviously we have to intervene before the ‘kills us’ portion of that._
  > 
  > _What options do we have available?_
  > 
  > _The Elements of Harmony._
  > 
  > _We’re looking for alternative solutions here. If you’re not going to offer meaningful solutions we’ll replace you with a different personality._
  > 
  > Overseer stepped in. _No personal attacks, Opposition. We’re all the same pony here._
  > 
  > _My point still stands._
  > 
  > _Well…_ Advocate paused for a moment, hesitant to even put her idea up for debate. In the end, she decided that all paths to victory were worth at least some consideration. _We could always throw away our life’s ambition and use its power source to banish Luna ourselves._
  > 
  > Opposition immediately rallied the full force of Twilight’s unfettered enmity against the mere notion. _I fundamentally object to that unless we are, or are about to be, dead. Please come up with something we won’t regret until the end of a short, miserable life._
  > 
  > _While I agree with the sentiment,_ Advocate began, _couldn’t we just redevelop the power source? Solidified magic can be manufactured._
  > 
  > _Not at the rate we would need. If we lived to three hundred and shifted the_ entire _economy of Equestria over to producing solidified magic, we_ might _have enough to get by with two alicorns helping and whatever boost the elements provide. Needless to say, that’s a ridiculously bad plan._
  > 
  > _All right, point taken. The next option is we take out Luna ourselves._
  > 
  > _Celestia is our senior in combat by centuries and far more powerful. If she can’t do it, what hope do we have?_
  > 
  > _Ah, but we have one big advantage,_ Advocate said smugly. _We’re not her sister. If we earned Luna’s trust, we could catch her by surprise._
  > 
  > Opposition rolled her nonexistent eyes. _Do you realize how hard that would be to catch her at the level of vulnerability we’d need? We’d have to–_
  > 
  > The details of what exactly that would require filtered through Twilight’s mind.
  > 
  > _Absolutely not!_ Opposition slammed her imaginary hooves onto an equally imaginary desk. _We_ will not _marry, seduce, or otherwise engage in intimate relations with the mad moon goddess._
  > 
  > _It was only an idea,_ Advocate mumbled.
  > 
  > _The single worst idea I’ve ever heard you suggest! Why would you even–_
  > 
  > Overseer banged a gavel and called the other two to attention. _I’m ending this tangent here. Advocate, there’s a reason we outsource lipstick missions. Opposition, be nice._
  > 
  > With an exaggerated harrumph, Opposition nodded and turned the conversation back over to Advocate with a simple, _What else do you have?_
  > 
  > _Well, there’s always Celestia’s plan. Let Luna take over. Support her reign. Minimize the damage. Celestia considers it a viable option, and she doesn’t even know we can pose a credible threat to an alicorn. If Luna can be at all reasoned with, we can keep her in check with the threat of banishment._
  > 
  > _That’s not optimal, but it’s a decent fallback option. Other ideas?_
  > 
  > _I’m dry. Excepting getting the Elements working. We could try being…friendly._
  > 
  > All three imaginary personalities shuddered at once with the reaction creeping its way back into reality.
  > 
  > _I hate you so much, Advocate. Is that really the only plan you can come up with to work on?_
  > 
  > _If I randomly think of any at some later point, I’ll let you know. But for now, yes._
  > 
  > Opposition sighed. _All right, let’s work out the specifics._
  > 
  > _I request more information._
  >
  > Twilight broke out of her conversation with herself, merging back into one coherent pony without the illusion of multiple trains of thought. She shook off the momentary disorientation she experienced upon exiting the headspace and turned to Celestia to ask for more information about the Elements.

    Oooh, reminds me of Daystar Eld's treatment of tupples

  Excellent, Seeking Power was my favourite ponyfic. This version of Twilight is such a nerd.
