### Post:

Hey all,

I've just published my first fantasy novel, and I think it might interest some of the people here. 

I think I can fairly say that it falls into the characteristics of rational fiction in the sidebar, although there are some exceptions in terms of character behavior (some characters behave more intelligently than others).

It's a hard magic story, and I get into a lot of detail about the magic system, similar to a Sanderson novel or Mother of Learning.

*Here's a quick blurb:*
Some say that in the city of Orlyn, godhood is on sale to the highest bidder. Thousands flock to the city each year, hoping for a chance at immortality. 

Lydia Hastings is a knowledge sorcerer, capable of extracting information from anything she touches. When she travels to Orlyn to validate the claims of the local faith, she discovers a conspiracy that could lead to a war between the world's three greatest powers. At the focal point is a prisoner who bears a striking resemblance to the long-missing leader of the pantheon she worships. 

Rescuing the prisoner would require risking her carefully cultivated cover - but his execution could mean the end of everything Lydia holds dear.

You can find the paperback version [here](http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-War-Broken-Mirrors/dp/1505886554/) and the [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TKFFR36) version here.

Edit: For those of you who want a preview, click on the Kindle version, then click "Look Inside". You'll be able to read the beginning of the book.

  If she can extract information from anything she touches, could she potentially extract information about her ability by touching herself? It's the very first thing I thought of when I read the description. Just for that interesting ability alone, I think I'll give it a read.
  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    Great question. The line in the summary is an over simplification of how her abilities work, but I wanted to have a good hook line that illustrates the type of thing that she does.

    She doesn't really have a single "ability" to identify - she's proficient in utilizing the Dominion of Knowledge, and she uses it in a variety of different ways (not all of which are limited to touch) throughout the book.

    She absolutely could gather information about herself, or about active spell effects that are on herself, through using specific spells in her repertoire. 

    Similarly, she could determine the strength of her own connection to specific Dominions, including the Dominion of Knowledge, which might be the closest application to what you've asked.

    If you're thinking about this in terms of her attempting to identify the mechanics by which sorcery itself functions, that's explored within this book. Sorcery theory is a big part of my writing.
    ```

    - u/appropriate-username:
      ```
      So is she constantly gathering information on billions of bacteria? Or getting info on billions of bacteria (plus a lot of atoms) whenever she uses the skill on anything else?
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        I can see why you'd ask that, but no. =D 

        She has to actively cast a spell, and when she casts the spell, she specifies a target. It's not that she has a passive info-gathering ability that happens whenever she touches something. 

        There are certain types of spells that are tailored for gathering different types of information, as well as spells that are designed for use on different types of targets.

        If you're wondering *how* Lydia can target say, a "person", without getting other things (e.g. the bacteria you mentioned) in the process, that gets into deeper magical theory than I probably shouldn't be discussing on a thread like this, since it could involve delving into spoiler territory. Targeting methodologies are discussed within the book and will be elaborated on in future works.

        The simple answer is that Lydia does have some level of control over what she's choosing to try to gather information about.

        Does that answer your question?
        ```

        - u/appropriate-username:
          ```
          > and when she casts the spell, she specifies a target.

          So can she guess the composition of an object by seeing if the spell fails? I.e. get a bottle of water and use the spell on salt to see if it's fresh water or not, or touch a patient and target the spell for malformed DNA to scan for cancer? Or touch a scratch-off lottery ticket and do the locate spell on a variety of numbers to see which ones are not there? Or does she immediately know which numbers are there just by touching the ticket and doing the spell? Can she read minds by touching people? What happens if she tries to read her own mind?

          Can she touch (and thereby intercept) wireless communications?

          Also, and I guess this would tread on spoiler territory, but how does the ship of theseus work with this? Does she get all the places a rock has ever been by touching it? Can she get the entire, complete history of the earth by touching the pavement?

          Can she get the combination to a safe by touching it?
          ```

          - u/Salaris:
            ```
            Yes, if she cast a spell on an invalid target she would be able to use that to narrow down characteristics. 

            There are several methods by which she could try to determine the numbers on an unscratched lottery ticket. If she had a spell designed to search for a specific number, she could cast it several times to search for each number and record the results. She might have a spell that's designed to scan all text and return the results, which would be more taxing, but it would also give her all of the numbers immediately. 

            Doing this with something on the scale of a lottery ticket is plausible, but things that are longer would be very unreliable. Gaining "knowledge" from a spell does not guarantee that you can remember it, so it would be the equivalent of seeing a series of numbers once.

            Whether or not she can read minds is discussed in the early chapters and has some minor spoilers, so I won't go into that.

            Wireless communications do not exist at the technological level of this setting. It's roughly 1600s to early 1900s level technology, varying based on specific locations, and with certain types of technology developing at different rates from the real world because of the presence of sorcery, social and cultural differences, etc. Would it be possible if she was in a modern time period? Yes, but touching probably wouldn't be the appropriate targeting methodology.

            Getting the history of an object actually falls more into the territory of the Dominion of Memory. Knowledge is what's called a "Prime Dominion"; they tend to be very conceptually broad in scope. Memory is a "Deep Dominion", and they have narrower, more specific functions. 

            Even with the Dominion of Memory, spells would not give you the entire history of something all at once; your spell would need to have more specific search parameters. 

            The broad answer to the "Ship of Theseus" question is that people attempt to specify a target and a result when they cast a spell, and that the scale of the spell determines the cost. To make this a little clearer, I should probably give you a basic overview of the magic system as a whole.

            The broad system is called Dominion Sorcery, and practitioners are called sorcerers. Sorcerers cast spells by using a part of themselves to signal a Dominion to create an effect. The type of cost is dependent on the Dominion, and the scale of the cost depends on the intended effect. 

            To give you a simple example, the cost of casting a Dominion of Flame spell is body heat. So, if a flame sorcerer wants to cast a traditional fireball spell, they're going to need to expend body heat to do it. The amount of body heat expended for the spell is much lower than the amount of heat within the fireball; the Dominion of Flame is what is generating the actual result. More powerful sorcerers are more efficient at using their own bodies to create a connection with the Dominion; thus, a powerful flame sorcerer could throw a fireball for a relatively low cost in body heat, but a newbie sorcerer could drain him or herself to hypothermia with the cost of lighting a candle.

            One analogy I sometimes give is that the sorcerer is lighting a match to start the fire of a gas stove; the amount of flame created is much greater than the amount expended.

            As a sorcerer uses a particular Dominion, their body adapts to the use, developing a stronger connection - but using too much in a short period can cause permanent damage. Think of it like exercising a muscle. In some cases, overuse of sorcery can be fatal.

            "Spells" are a way of reliably reproducing a specific effect. Lydia uses incantations for most of her spells - this is not actually necessary, but it's used as a method of making certain the results are what she is looking for. It's a specific focusing methodology, and different schools of sorcerous training handle that differently. She discusses methodology with another sorcerer within the story.

            Once a sorcerer has a spell, different sorcerers have varying levels of ability to modify that spell "on the fly". This is a separate discipline, generally called "Core Sorcery" by scholars. A simple example would be that a spell might make a sphere of fire, but Core Sorcery is necessary to make that sphere move or detonate. A more experienced flame sorcerer might be able to split a sphere of fire into several smaller spheres, or control it to home in on a specific target, etc. 

            Learning how to conjure a particular type of energy from a Dominion (Dominion Sorcery) and how to control energy that's already been summoned (Core Sorcery) are separate from each other, and also must be learned on a Dominion-by-Dominion basis. 

            I'd rather not get into too much detail - a lot of this is explained within the book, and probably better than how I'm explaining it here, since you'd have more context.

            Lydia could probably make a spell for finding the combination to a safe if given time, but she doesn't have a spell for that specific function that she's already learned, nor would it be easy to modify her existing spells for that exact function. The Dominion of Memory would make this super easy, but you could make a knowledge spell for trying to determine the amount of wear on each of the numbers, for example.

  Any epub version I could buy? Sounds interesting
  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    The only epub version that's currently available is the Kindle version, which you can find [here](http://www.amazon.com/Forging-Divinity-Andrew-Rowe-ebook/dp/B00TKFFR36/). If you need another format, I'll try to look into options.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Amazon avoids epub like the plague. They have all their stuff in mobi.
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        Oh, the actual .epub format. That makes sense. I've considered putting the book up on sites that use other formats, like Smashwords or whatnot, but I need to evaluate if it's worthwhile to take advantage of being exclusive to Kindle first.
        ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Very interesting! I'm in the middle of a few projects right now, but it's definitely going on my to-buy-and-read list! Thanks!
  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    Awesome, thanks for the interest! I'll look forward to hearing what you think.
    ```

- u/traverseda:
  ```
  Does the kindle version even work with other ereaders? Is it DRM free?
  ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    It's an option to flag it DRM free, so I picked that option.

    That said, I'm not actually sure if it works with other e-readers. If it doesn't, I'll definitely consider Smashwords and other platforms more closely after my 90-day exclusive period with Kindle is up.
    ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    IIRC, it's pretty trivial to break Amazon's ebook DRM.

  You know I wonder if all those up votes means that people have bought the story and are praising it but to lazy to write a review, or they just like the idea that people should bring their paid stories to this reddit.

  I was waiting for a while for a review then Monday was off and I had free time to kill so I bought it. Normally I only review fanfiction so bear with me. Some spoilers for the first 3 chapters.

  World building seems solid, the book hits the ground running so history and current events are mixed together and dropped in a believable manner.

  3 main point of view characters are Taelien, metalbender fresh of the farm/forest hero looking answers to his mysterious past and his mysterious sword of the gods. His storybook hero is only missing a kindly old mentor to set him on the path and then be swiftly killed and some grand evil to face. A pawn that knows he is a pawn which causes some hilarious interactions with 2 players of the game.

  Lydia, chessmaster planner schemer, rpg tank, investigator, scientist, spy for one of the 2 major religions in the country/planet? She worships the gods that made Taelien’s sword. Personality tends towards straight laced, harsh but fair.

  Jonan, chessmaster planner schemer, rpg Crowd Control, surface persona is a loveable rogue, innards seem to be tired player of the game. Spy for the other major religion on the planet.

  So yeah 2 players and only 1 pawn between them. A highlight for me was Lydia and Jonan’s first interaction as the verbally jockey for position to steer the hero down the path most beneficial to their position. 

  Plot is good though I felt the summery was misleading. I thought I was going into some variant of Sanderson’s Warbreaker. Lydia shows up in some corrupt city to save some splintered shard of her god that the locals are harvesting for power. That’s not what happened and the author didn’t even mention Jonan. I think a better summary could be made in a similar style to Sanderson’s Elantris.

  So in the end this is a solid first entrance into the series, or at least it had better be a series since the main arc of 2 of the 3 main characters, the whole what is Taelien’s greater purpose, and why does he have Lydia’s god sword doesn’t go further than speculation and initial investigation, your answers are in another city. 

  That said the local arc is great, there’s a huge who done it( placing the city into the precarious position of fighting a holy war against Lydia’s religion) in the manor of ch 86 of HPMOR, but stronger since we don’t already know who is behind the current events.

  Spoilers:( in case I can’t use spoiler tags properly)


  [A](#s "Personally I thought the queen was instigating the events to put her impatient son on the throne, though Jonan’s handler could also have done it, because I think she’s and of his gods who all seem to be pretty nasty.")

    That's a really fantastic review, and I think you caught some of what I was attempting to do perfectly. If you want to do me a huge favor, I'd love it if you could repost that on Amazon and/or Goodreads. You can be honest with whatever number of stars you feel is appropriate, I just think it's a great assessment of the book.

    I struggled with what to do with the synopsis. I actually ended up cutting out the other two characters based on feedback, both from friends and from what I was hearing from posting my initial synopsis on /r/fantasywriters. From a /r/rational perspective, I definitely think putting Jonan and more details about the magic system would have been helpful. From a general marketing standpoint, that might have been overkill - I'm honestly not sure. I'm very new at this.

    If you're interested in seeing the iterations I went through when trying to figure out my synopsis text, you can see several versions of it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/197LUV_ZnMQcZoITei3umCUTZyOKjBmMEsXvK7zpORWI/edit). I tinkered with several styles, some of which you can see are closer to the Elantris style or even the Way of Kings style.

    I'm about 33,000 words into the sequel, and the game plan is to expand this into a significantly longer series. 

    You gave great character summaries - which one(s) did you like? Did you dislike any of them, and if so, what elements did you dislike?

    Thanks so much for taking the time to write the review. You've made my day.
