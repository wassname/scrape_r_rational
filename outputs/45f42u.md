## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

    You did it! How is everyone? Is sleep a possibility? Did you come to a sudden epiphany that your life is over and/or the long term prospects of mankind are more important than you had yet understood?

      He's had his first checkup with the pediatrician and is doing well (he's a week old today). He's passed all his tests and doesn't cry much. Sleep isn't too big of an issue, since my wife and I can tag-team it and he goes to bed quickly. Plus he's a newborn, so doesn't do much more than sleep and eat anyway, which means there's lots of downtime for me (some of which is being sucked up by XCOM 2, which I'm near the end of).

      I've had no grand epiphanies thus far, though I do feel some mental changes that are probably hormonal instead of grounded in practical reality, meaning mostly anxiety and love, though the former is fading somewhat now.

  Watched Deadpool. 6/10. Bought into the hype and expected snark, sex and violence. Got a normal Hollwood movie with a few extra broken limbs and sex jokes. The fourth wall jokes were mostly disappointing. Deadpool pointing out that the studio couldn't afford 'real' x-men as sidekicks was about as good as it got.

  Luke warm recommendation. If you wanna go to the movies, see something else or be drunk.

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
    ```
    I enjoyed the silly jokes because that's what I was expecting from the movie based on its trailers.

    What was disappointing though was Deadpool freaking out about how he *looks* and not getting back in touch with his girlfriend right after his escape. It's just that, their meeting scene made me evaluate both of them as people who wouldn't care about someone's looks that much and [would expect the same attitude from their partner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance) as well.

    But the scenarists made getting to that level of trust the whole point of the movie and the [credit-roll aesop,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop) reducing the film for many to a one-time watch thing â€” if even that.

    Similarly, for a character that's supposed to be both [genre savvy](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy) and [medium aware,](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness) the blundered nightclub protection scene was horrible as well.

  An experiment on myself to cut down on sleep to 5 hours a day ended with my experiencing sleep paralysis for about 90 seconds. Luckily enough there was no ['intruder'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis#Classification), so to speak. But the rest of the symptoms were there the main one being a mild feeling of terror that this is how paralytics feel all the time.  

  Needless to say, I'm back to my normal schedule of a healthy 6.5-7 hours of sleep a night.

          Yeah, I brought down my requirement from 8.5 to 6.5 and a couple Einstein naps. Those two hours are well worth the minor tiredness I sometimes feel.

            I have a German friend who just automagically doesn't need more than six hours of sleep. I wish I had that. I can make do with less sleep for one day if absolutely necessary, but in the long run my body seems to rebel if I go below eight hours a day. Do you do anything special to keep the hours down, or do you just Tell yourself that loud alarm will sound in 6.5 hours and deal with it?

    If you are desperate to cut down on your sleep and you can set your own work hours, then there is a well-supported method which allows you to only sleep for 2 hours out of a 24 hour period.

    It's called the [Uberman Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep). It involves sleeping for exactly 20 minutes every 4 hours on the dot. I know one person who did this for a year, but you **have** to keep to this sleep schedule. If you sleep at the wrong time or for too long, or even just skip a nap, you will find it impossibly difficult to get back on track. However, while transitioning may take a few weeks of exhaustion, you will be alert and focused during your waking hours.

    EDIT: I probably should be clear about the one person I know who did this. He claimed to have done so and sounded truthful, but he was only someone I met twice so I don't know how trustworthy he was. In addition, there is a lot of articles online that say how it doesn't work while others claim it's success. [Here's](https://www.supermemo.com/en/articles/polyphasic) an article which argues against it in a fair and calm manner.

  Trying to move off of Dropbox and onto local portable storage leaves me bewildered that there is no good cross-platform filesystem. [Windows and Mac OS X support a tiny fraction of what Linux supports out of the box,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_file_systems#OS_support) and overlapping cuts that down to just FAT ([UDF on Windows is fragile](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/44224), NTFS-3g is not on OS X by default and it's fucking *freezing Thunar*). FAT doesn't allow distinguishing Posix permissions, so either literally everything on the partition is executable (with a *hard binary patch* to udisks2d!) or *only files with Windows executable extensions. On LINUX.*

  I AM FUCKING PISSED.

  Is there an actual solution? Has no one invented some sort of ext permissions-mapping file that allows you to mount FAT through an ext pipe? Why are the proprietary platform devs so psychotically NIH that they can't stand to provide access to *literally anything else?*

  Platform market share is a goddamn nightmare. If everyone used Linux, there would be no problems in Linux left to say that everyone shouldn't use Linux.

  EDIT: I have decided to keep FAT and its stunted permissions (not that I had much of a choice). I can live with long stacks of green filenames.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    There are some software solutions that let you read, write, mount ext4 partitions on windows machines. In terms of a shared backup between multiple computers, you may be best off doing some kind of network backup. I've had success with a linux box acting as an FTP server sitting on the network. This won't give you the ability to back up when you're away from home (unless you have a static IP or something) but should be pretty straightforward. It won't be as functional as dropbox but all your docs will be saved. Some people use NAS for this, but I'm not familiar with it so I do not.

      Software solutions will not work; I don't have admin permissions on the Windows/Mac machines I actually do have access to.

      Why is the industry's solution to everything just to paper over real problems with yet more leaky abstractions? The entire idea of a software market breaks down when you have support requirements dependent on massive idiot duopolies like this.

      I wish making new platforms wasn't so hard, expensive, and goddamn pointless. But when you have new platforms that *necessitate* dependencies for new software, you get n:n, and n:n:n, and that's never good. That's what POSIX was for, but *nobody fucking uses it.* I hate technology.

      Is there some way to engender a market of new platforms that themselves engender markets of software without spiraling into combinatorial explosion? Lowering the cost of platform development is obviously necessary. But in a way that encourages or standardizes platform designs that minimize support complexity?
      ```

      - u/blazinghand:
        ```
        Hmm, not having admin permissions makes things pretty hard. The real moral of the story here might be to only use linux. This has never failed me, except all the times I run into problems. I just use linux machines and send info to a linux box with all the stuff. This means I have to do some funny contortions at times (like writing resumes; I have to do all mine in LaTeX) to make it work. Don't get me started on finagling a blu-ray drive to work properly with blu-ray DRM on a linux box!

        If you don't have admin permissions, you'll be stuck with FAT32 or Dropbox or something AFAIK. I feel like there should be a way to send backups over FTP Even without admin permission, maybe using time machine to aim at a remote drive, for example??? But hopefully someone with more know-how and experience with these things will come with a better suggestion than I have.

        Because industry is often built around enterprise clients, who are willing to maintain an office-wide monoculture, and wanted to move everything onto "the cloud" for safe-keeping anyway, since that was a massive improvement on paying their in-house IT departments to develop in-house solutions.

        We are not the end customers of most of the computing industry, not since a combination of open-source competition and cheap, effective piracy cut down on the profit margins from shrink-wrapped software.

  So I was wondering if anyone had educated knowledge related to that page.
  ```

  - u/gonight:
    ```
    That's a good link, and it's a great summary of stuff I've figured out over the years. I wholeheartedly commend that article's advice.

    (Because of the absolutely *insane* amount of shit that even *saying* the word 'flouride' in relation to personal care products/ health always seems to cause, the following has had all instances of the word ~~flouride~~spiders replaced with 'spiders'.)

    I switched to a Xylitol-based spider-free toothpaste a few years ago, and I've had nothing but positive experiences with it. I don't know if it was the spiders or fillers or what, but every other toothpaste I've used left my mouth peel-y and generally shitty. 

    Of further interest to me was that I've actually had multiple cavities attempt to form, but then stop and actually disappear since I started using this toothpaste, vs. the many many fillings I got while using spider-based toothpaste.

    **THE SPIDERS JUST GET WORSE FROM HERE**

    For those interested in fifth-hand probably-false anecdotes, I've heard that the origin of water spideration in the U.S. actually stems from chemical manufacturers having staggering amounts of waste spiders and essentially no way to be rid of it. Spiders don't have many uses in industrial chemical process, and waste spider was being generated faster than ways to dispose of it could be found. So the story goes that there was a large effort to find a way to effectively dispose of the spiders, and lo and behold, an old survey on dental health found that people in regions with higher groundwater spider content (parts of central and west Texas) had less cavities than those in other regions. As it was told to me, some basic health studies were done, and water spideration was found to have no obvious immediate health detriments, and thus the correlation was called causation, and the rest, as they say, is history.

    (muh bodily fluids, etc.)

    **Anyway**, [this is the toothpaste I'm using](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CMJNO7I). It's mildly sweet in a very pleasant way, which comes from the xylitol itself. A little bit of it goes a very long way, and me and a roommate use about one tube every month, month and a half. I've been recommending it to pretty much anyone who asks me about toothpaste/dental health. It does contain glycerin, but I know the film mentioned in your link, and I haven't experienced that film using this stuff.

    Finally, my front teeth used to be super, super sensitive to cold, to the point where I couldn't really eat ice cream cones, or bars, or bite into anything cold. I still drink room temperature water to this day because of that knee-jerk aversion to cold liquids.

    Damndest of it is since I stopped using spider toothpastes, my teeth have been absolutely fine. I can bite goddamn ice cubes with my front teeth now. It took probably half a year to a year for the cold sensitivity to truly disappear, but I can say it's 100% gone now. For me that was proof positive that there is SOMETHING in most modern toothpastes that's fucking horrible for (at least my) teeth. Probably all the industrial-waste spiders they pack it with.

    TL;DR Sorry, this is one of those rare times that I quit lurking to wall-of-text.

    Also don't underestimate how much high end infrastructure engineering goes into designing the 'path' of a theme park.

    The biggest complaints I actually have for theme parks is that they don't have as much lavish awesome attention to detail as they COULD have.

    *Shit* it is.  It's a nonstop sensory overload of duplicitous sell-you-stuff bullshit, and it drives me mad every time I expose myself.

    And I really, really love waterslides and rollercoasters and even those low-key rides where you get strapped into a chair that swings around an elliptical centrifugal arc *and it's like your flying*.  Oh, and the actual centrifuges where you defy gravity temporarily because you're pressed too hard against the walls.

    But seriously, I will march a horde of Orks at any attempt to tile the universe in the capitalist bullshit associated with current theme parks, and then I will rebuild them as glorious socialist theme parks, where you don't have to Adult so damn hard your whole time there and can actually relax and enjoy it.

    Won't it just be nicer when the only cosplayers are the people who *want* to cosplay, as whatever they like?  When you don't have to shlep a 5kg bag of sandwiches and water bottles around *all damn day* because there's actually affordable or free supplies for keeping yourself going *available* instead of having unhealthy, bad-tasting, overexpensive crap pushed on you?  When the games aren't rigged?  When cheap souvenirs aren't being pushed?

    But anyway, yeah, army of Orks.  WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!  Because that is how I react to being told that the future should be tiled in the lowest dreck of late-capitalism.

    Are you also interested in designs of the prediction market itself? I'm not really an expert but I have been searching about that recently. The best explanation about market makers I could find was from the Augur project. LMSR (Hansons Algorithm) and an adaption of that. Augur is also interesting in itself because it is decentralised. Harder to shut down for your protagonists enemies (if any).

    You know, if the end goal of the protagonist is to forecast well, perhaps there are more effective solutions than a prediction market. Tetlock covers one compelling alternative in Superforecasting. 

    The book's about this team that (strongly, consistently, with growing margins over time) won a 4-year long, rigorous forecasting tournament. Anyway, along the way, they ran many RCTs testing various hypotheses like 'do teams of forecasters perform better than individual forecasters', and 'does a specially curated team of forecasters beat out prediction markets'. Well, turns out such a team did outperform a prediction market. It was constructed by taking the top performers based on results of a pretty rigorous metric (Brier score, which measures forecasting accuracy) from a large sample and putting them together in a team. It raises important questions about the efficacy of prediction markets when this approach so handily beat out alternatives. Maybe the prediction market under test wasn't fully incorporating real costs/incentives, but I imagine some more RCTs can uncover that.

    I'm still uncertain but it did downshift my belief that prediction markets, if constructed well, are optimal at forecasting accuracy. I'm more like 60:40 in favor of this 'superforecasting team' technique, but just haven't read enough to gain more confidence.
    ```

    - u/DataPacRat:

      > if the end goal of the protagonist is to forecast well

      That is, indeed, the goal. And alternatives to prediction markets, such as the Delphi method ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method ), will be considered, and possibly even experimented with.

      > Superforecasting

      That's been on my to-read list for a while, but you've just convinced me to move it to the top of the pile. :)

      That said, my protagonist is going to have at least one major difficulty applying what you describe: The only people he has to draw on are himself, and copies of himself. I've already pencilled in a failure of the prediction market due to an overconfident consensus, and attempts to deliberately nudge the copies into different headspaces... and I'm considering more severe, arguably less ethical experimentation later on.
      ```

      - u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl:
        ```
        I have read the book and can recommend it. Solid advice on how to improve forecasts.

        The thing to keep in mind is I think that Tetlock tries to improve the accuracy of the US intelligence community and not accuracy in general. That probably involves a lot of politics. Prediction markets are still the best bet IMHO (pun intended).

        In case you haven't seen it yet here are two articles on slatestarcodex about this book.

      The prediction market that participated in this competition was DAGGRE by Robin Hanson.

      http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/12/at-loooooong-last.html

      The people behind the competition (IARPA) seem to be prejudiced against betting and crowds of forecasters in favor of experts.

      Only paying for participation and not for accuracy was allowed (which is the whole point of a prediction market).

      Also everything that can give you an edge in a prediction market (Delphi Method, Insider Knowledge, Superforecasters, etc ...) can be used to gain money by improving the accuracy of the market.
