## [WIP] Heart of Cultivation

### Post:

Hi, jacobk here. You might remember me from such fanfiction projects as *Applied Cultural Anthropology* or *A Young Woman's Political Record*.

I'm now working on an original story in the xianxia genre, [Heart of Cultivation](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32502/heart-of-cultivation). It is intended as a xianxia reconstruction: deploying the tropes from the genre that I like into a framework that makes sense as a whole.

Specific to r/rational's tastes, the protagonist is noticeably cagier than the average xianxia MC. He does not follow the dao of charging face first at every challenge. He makes plans. Sometimes they work. Sometimes he has to go back to the drawing board. I try to be fair about writing so that you can understand why the protagonist does what he does.

Also, the story has a [terrific map](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32502/heart-of-cultivation/chapter/507736/map-of-bianjing-town-and-surroundings). If I learned once thing from plowing through the fantasy/sci-fi section of the library when I was younger, it was that a map this good gives rise to a strong presumption that the story it's attached to is worth reading.

The Royal Road blurb is as follows:

Jian was a prodigy, at least until he discovered that his path of cultivation had hit a dead end almost as soon as it began. That was all years ago, though. He has long since resigned himself to his fate and prepared himself for a dull, ordinary, but happy life. Stunted cultivation or no, he's clever enough to carve out his own comfortable niche.

Unfortunately, not all of the matters from his past have been settled. When a reckless mistake threatens to cost him everything, Jian will have to prove that he's desperate enough to rise to the occasion. Or that he's clever enough to avoid the consequences.

  Will whole heartedly second this. Whilst the story is still in its early stages, the writing is conpetent and descriptive, and I love Jian as a protagonist so far. Jacobk also has a very compelling way of writing Jians inventions and a promise of more of that in the future.

  Enjoyed Applied Cultural Anthropology, and I'm not usually an HP fan. I'll definitely check this out.

  Would it make sense if I've not read xianxia?

  I enjoyed YWPR a lot, and watched the anime as a result having not seen it before

    It's basically ancient China-themed adventure fantasy. As steelong said, "cultivation" refers to the process by which one can get superpowers by properly focused meditation and exercise. At the lower levels it isn't that different from something like Naruto.

    I didn't do a full intro/exposition arc the way that Forge of Destiny did, but I tried to go easy on the jargon and introduce new terms a few times before I started casually throwing them in and expecting you to know what they meant.

    I read the first few chapters, and things are pretty easy to understand even though I'm not familiar with the genre.  As long as you know that the word 'cultivation' is used to mean something like 'cultivation of one's inner power', then you should be fine.

    Basically people can have the ability to become more powerful their special medication along with special items.  The more power you gain the closer you are to godhood.  The powers have two categories, 1 where your just more superhuman (stronger faster longer life) and 2, magic/superpowers were you can use your gained powers to shoot lightning and other cool stuff.  Most MC in these stories get a really good meditation ability early on (because not all medication makes you stronger at the same rate) and just meditate for insanely long periods.   They are pretty much power fantasies were the best trait of the MC is the discipline they have (not hard to write they meditated for 10 years straight).

    Sure. I'll give you the broad strokes. In the story I try to parcel the setting details out as they become relevant in order to avoid drowning the reader in exposition.

    The story takes place in an empire that resembles ancient China. Where it differs is that most of the feudal nobility has meditation-fueled superpowers. There are also a few sects that answer directly to the Emperor that are made up of people who have sworn loyalty to the sect and also have meditation-fueled superpowers. The sects were founded within living memory but aren't brand new.

    Generally speaking, advancing along the path of meditation-fueled superpowers causes social advancement. Positions of power give you better access to the shinies that can boost the speed of your progression, so there's something of a snowball effect at the top end of society.

    The story begins more specifically in a city near the northern border of the empire. It's on the border both because it is remote from the capital and because there is a supernatural phenomenon that makes conquering any further territory impractical. 

    The protagonist is a member of the dominant family in the border city. His position by birth is fairly high, but his constitution prevents him from cultivating beyond a very basic level. His overall social position is thus a mixed bag, and he has to rely on the protection of others to shield him from petty bullying.

    The same supernatural phenomenon that makes conquest impractical also provides lucrative if dangerous opportunities. Accordingly, there is a sort of wild west town north of the border, as illustrated in the map. Think of ancient China mashed up with Deadwood and you won't be too far off.

    Other areas of the empire have not yet become the focus of the narrative, and will be fleshed out as the story goes on.

    The most notable departure from the standard xianxia genre in the worldbuilding is probably that the world isn't fully populated by greedy assholes.

        > And why isn't it? Do institutions and culture exist independently of power relations? If you posit a cultivation-based system and a snowball effect to advancement, what does it mean for humanity to have extreme differences in personal strength and extreme "capital accumulation"?

        This would suggest tiered, caste-like societies but is mostly orthogonal to asshole factor. In fact if talent is not completely hereditary successful societies would likely involve a significant degree of charity from the strongest families to weaker ones; as having more population beholden to you increases the chance of striking gold in some extremely talented child, whom you can then take into the 'main' family.

  Liking xianxia and much fiction encountered here, I will begin reading!

  Immediate impression before opening the first chapter:  In the blurb, I would recommend(/prefer) a clear 'hook' to grab a casual blurb-skimmer's interest.  "Former genius turned waste but probably not going to be a waste forever, yes, you and *Battle Through The Heavens* and *Divine Throne Of Primordial Blood* and uncountable other stories that use this trope, plus all the ones where the person was a waste in the first place who got a fortuitous encounter, plus all the ones where the person was a waste in the first place and got their soul replaced by a transmigrator, plus the ones...".  What sets your story apart from the rest?  What's different about your protagonist, or your world, or your story, that someone will read the blurb and think "This sounds like a sort of story I haven't read before"?

  Xianxia isn't new.  Weak-to-strong isn't new.  Was-strong-and-is-now-weak-but-will-be-strong-again isn't new.  Resigned-for-the-moment isn't new, recklessness isn't new, desperation isn't new, cleverness isn't new, entanglements-from-the-past aren't new.  These things can be fun, but they can also be read elsewhere, and a blurb-reader who is building an internal model of your story before deciding whether to try it has only an impression of genericness.  What originality have you conceived, what is it about your story that you feel is worth telling?  If someone reading the blurb has a hint of that, it can raise their impression/interest and draw them in in search of it.

  Now to start the text proper...

  \[Impression after the first chapter:  Impression of the protagonist is neutral, neither high or low yet.  My main emotional movement is the sinking feeling that the promised 'mistake' is getting closer.  Continuing...\]

  \[Partway through the second chapter.  Interest not having yet been hooked, an internal groan at the follow-up trope of the >!genius fiance.  Whether it's the standard breaking-the-engagement line or the less-common still-devoted subversion, the skin crawls a little as the potential originality-to-genericness ratio drops!<.\]  


  \[>!' "Let us settle matters with a duel," he said, "in three years' time." '!<\--Even the length of the three year agreement is taken without change from *Battle Through The Heavens*?  Not because he's a transmigrator who has read BTTH, not because of some explained reason why he thinks three years is a particular good idea, just directly the same for no reason?  I fear this is my limit, but reading on long enough to see why it's described as a 'mistake' when he's so certain at the time.\]  


  \[Skipping ahead to chapter 10, to see whether the 'ambition' is of a form of interest.  --Hmm, I see now the form of his ambition.  Somewhat interested as to whether this will allow him to exceed the abilities of others, not just reach them.  Oh, and >!the title makes more sense to me now!<!\]  


  \[Skipping ahead to the last available chapter, chapter 16, to see if anything I find noteworthy/enthusiasm-kindling has happened by this point.  --Okay.  It seems that it will be some chapters yet before events I'm interested in observing take place.  I hope that these give some food-for-thought of use; good luck with writing!\]

  Jacobk is also the author of [A Young Womans Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/), which is hilarious and a great example of a protagonist with battleship sized holes in their rationality who nonetheless has consistent internal logic.

  I've read it, but it's hard to tell if it will be to my tastes. I felt the pacing a bit slow and there's been nothing really driving the plot or pushing the MC into doing anything interesting. Just things he'll do in the future, things he will try when he's got the time and what his goals and personality are.

  &#x200B;

  I feel there's been no real hook in the story yet. And we're 17 chapters in, most stories get one on the first episode, or soon after but this one still hasn't had one for me. Nothing happening, nothing pressing, nothing hooking me, just decent writing you can follow along if you want to. I'll give it a few more chapters but that's about it..

  I must say, it's refreshing to read a xianxia that *isn't* filled with heartless calculating sociopaths. Makes all the honour and etiquette stuff a lot more bearable, and also makes it possible to actually care what happens to anyone

  Hi Jacob!
  ```

- u/TofuRobber:

  I read up the the 13th chapter. My impression so far is similar to other's who posted here. The writing is decent the pacing feels a bit slow and I'm feeling pretty neutral on the protagonist. I don't think it's my kind of story but I can see the appeal.

  My nitpicks because stuff bothers me:

  Why hasn't Jian read Meirong's letters. How often were they writing to each other and how long has it been since he stopped responding? What was the last thing she wrote that made him decide he wouldn't write back let alone stop reading her letters? 

  I feel like this is important information that should have been explained to the readers especially considering how much the engagement affair has been bothering him.

  It's clear that his ego and pride was the initial reason he stopped responding to her but I have a hard time believing he wasn't curious about what she wrote especially after she publicly called him out on not writing her back.

  Jian isn't a stupid person. He seems to have actual feelings for Meirong. It's only been his speculation about his comparable worth that's been eating at him. It's clear that she's mad at him for ignoring her letters but wouldn't being called out raise some guilt and force him to confront his mistake that he has already acknowledged? Does he not feel like he owe her an apology for his shitty behavior? What exactly is stopping him from reading her letters?

  I don't understand Meirong's actions at the meeting. She either still likes Jian and doesn't actually want to annul the engagement or she's lost hope in Jian and want the annulment to go through.

  If she still likes Jian why did she speak out in support of the annulment? I get that she was mad because he was ignoring her but speaking in support of the annulment isn't getting her what she actually want. That is unless she wasn't thinking and just wanted to evoke a reaction from him out of anger, but again that's counter productive and if she was going to speak out anyway she might as well just addressed Jian directly to get the answer that she wanted.

  If Meirong did want to annul the engagement she shouldn't have accepted the duel. Sure one can argue that she just doesn't want to be bother with other suitors but after making a speech about having a say about the course of her life you'd think she'd fight back against any engagements she didn't want to partake in.

  Regardless of her feelings, it's not like she had any actual say on the matter in the first place since it's been established that it's up the the guardians of said people to decide who they get to marry, a point that is especially true for people in high status position (Meirong).

  To me the whole sequence of events doesn't feel like it should play out the way that it did if people were behaving in a way that was portrayed by the world building.

    ```
    About the letters: He feels guilty about them and decides to avoid rather than confront the object of his guilt. I find this a very believable reaction. If he repeatedly decided to rather ignore them in the past, it might even be some sort of avoidance behavior.
    ```
