## Searching for a rational isekai I read a long time ago

### Post:

A long time ago, I read a rational fic about a man who had died and was tasked by an orc god to lead the orcs to technological progress, but that's the barest details I can remember about it. Anyone heard of anything like that?

  I was vaguely aware of such a thing so I googled "orc self insert". Was it this:

      I wish it hadn't been abandoned. It was really well done.

  There are two sort of like that that I've read. The more relevant one (and the one I can remember) is https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/in-my-time-of-troubles-dnd-si-sorta.426130/
