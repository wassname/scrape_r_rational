## Inheritors - superhero horror in a world where emotions grant powers and create cosmic horrors

### Post:

Hi /r/rational, was encouraged to post about a reboot of my old serial that launched in the last month. You can either read it on [Wordpress](https://inheritorsserial.com/), [RoyalRoad](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35915/inheritors), or [Tapas](https://tapas.io/series/Inheritors), or listen to it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyFvYSft4IWVtbH7wOH8ACtKg7l1RgZB4). 

One paragraph synopsis: Follow Gabe, a clone of the greatest hero ever, as he struggles to survive a world where emotions grant fantastic powers and create cosmic horrors. When he stumbles on a senseless massacre, he sets out to clear his name and help the one survivor - the young Mateo - in finding justice. But as he fights for what he believes is right, he starts to unravel a mystery that could topple the capes forever. 

Some context: I originally wrote Inheritors from 2018 to 2019, but ended up shuttering it for a variety of reasons. This September, I launched a remake that I felt addressed criticisms of the original serial. I focused more on the worldbuilding and internal consistency of the setting, which resulted in a stranger, and imo, more intriguing world. I don't know if it's strictly rational fiction, but I have taken care for the characters to pursue their goals with all intellectual agency available to them, as well as explore how a world where emotions are tangible can impact their minds. 

We're currently up to Episode 5, with many more to come. If you end up enjoying it, I always appreciate a subscription to my channel, someone joining my discord, or a boost on TopWebFiction. Thanks :)

      I mean, that's kind of a major element of the setting, and it's classic comic horror.  Extra-dimensional beings go about their inhuman design, largely uninterested in the insignificant lives that crawl about the Earth.  When they take interest to further their designs, it is through the lens of madness and trauma, and their regard varies between indifference and malice, with rare exceptions.  Humanity is largely powerless to do anything about it except to try to use the scraps of power that fall of their table to turn against its origins.

      If people dressed up in robes instead of spandex and if more people than the Fallen had a worshipful attitude that was less "KKK faux-Christianity," it'd be more obvious, but the trappings of the superhero genre obscure it.

          It kind of depends on whether you think "us" can fall under the umbrella of a cosmic horror. I think it can: imagining humanity as its own mass that causes isolation, horror, and alienation is not very difficult.

        IMO cosmic horror is primarily aesthetic

      I admit I haven't read worm beyond arc 3, but I was aware it uses capes as a term. I just happen to like it better than "supes" or whatever other terms one can come up with

        I've always leaned towards "metas"...
        ```

          I dunno why, never really liked metas 

          Despite loving the Boys, I hate "supes" the most for some reason

              I use masks as well, lol. Capes are for the heroes in power, masks for anyone using their power outside of what the capes allow.

            ```
            The "Super Powered" series uses "Supers" which is infinitely less cringey than "Supes".

    ```
    i'm sure there are some superficial similarities

  Son your old written version of everything is no longer continuing?

    ```
    Dad yes that's the truth - you can still find an ebook copy on my discord server, though.

  How often does it update?
  ```

  - u/MarySails:
    ```
    Once a weekend iirc, but the author did a special double episode this weekend for a fight scene.

      Thank you
