## There is Nothing to Fear, pt. 13: Political Realities (Harry Potter AU - Gryffindor!Voldemort)

### Post:

The latest update, "Political Realities," can be found [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27264121). 

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

**This series is being posted in various places:** 

* Initial updates can be found on Sufficient Velocity [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.49249/) and on Spacebattles [here](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/there-is-nothing-to-fear-harry-potter-au-gryffindor-voldemort.667057/).
* The polished version can be found on Archive of Our Own [here](https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368), with a one-week delay. 
* I'm publishing a chapter to Fanfiction.net [here](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13715432/1/There-is-Nothing-to-Fear), every week. The first thirteen stories are getting published on FFnet as a single 23-chapter story, which some folks may appreciate. 

This also marks the end of the oneshots, at least for the next couple of years. Next up is *Hermione Granger and the Silent Country*, which will probably be between 17 and 23 chapters according to my current outline. 

**Updates every other week.**

  \>the venn diagram of “people reading this story” and “people who want to read  an entire fake letter by Margaret Thatcher” is probably two entirely  separate circles.

  Poppycock.  you are talking about /r/rational here.  Include it as an appendix =)

  This is fantastic. I'm getting the anthology vibe of Chili and the Chocolate factory from this, and it is very much appropriate. Getting a real sense of the scale of the Wizarding World, a good balance of character drama and realistic geopolitical consequences.

    Is Chili and the Chocolate Factory finished or still updating?

  Is this a standalone story, or the first of two chapters?

  All of the text above, as well as the author text at the end, and the fact that it ends when the description says it should (1993), seems to suggest to me that this is a complete update, and that the next update will be the first chapter of the Hermione story.

  The only thing weighing against that is:
  >Published: 2020-10-29 Updated: 2020-10-29 Words: 1854 **Chapters: 1/2**

  Is that a mistake, or is there a second chapter of "Political Realities" coming?

  Edit to add: looking more closely at the metadata, I love the "CW: Margaret Thatcher" tag.

    That's a mistake, sorry. Folks here and on Ao3 were asking for the unabridged Margaret Thatcher letter, so I was setting that up, and then I was called away for work stuff. I didn't realize that it would show up as 1/2 while the letter was still in draft. 

    I've fixed that. Thanks for bring it to my attention.

  Oh, wow, I didn't realize there was more to this story. I know I read the first one a couple years ago but I thought it was complete. :) Thanks for posting a compiled version on ffnet, that is my preferred platform.
