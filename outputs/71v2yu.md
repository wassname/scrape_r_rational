  Hugo Strange created several experimental beast men, five of which the public knew about. Man-bat, Killer Croc, King Shark, the Fourth, and Killer Moth. Selina Kyle was also experimented on.

  Is 4th an original character? I noticed that you didn't describe them at all, which seems intentional if you're trying to hide who they are from Batman-savvy readers.

  Still enjoying the story immensely by the way :)  I am a little confused by the 4th's actions here: his conversation with her seemed pointless if that's what he planned to do all along, but I don't see how what she said might have made him decide to do that instead of have her pass the message along. He might just be "crazy" of course, but that seems less interesting.

    I can't really say whether or not the 4th is supposed to be an OC yet. I'll admit that their arc is what I would write, were I penning the next film.

    You make a good point. I don't want the 4th to come off as "crazy," as in being an unpredictable wild card or something. I don't want any BvS-Lex Luther types making plans with no discernible motivation other than moving the plot along and acting unsavory for the sake of it.

    I was trying to convey that the 4th is the first main character who isn't a schemer or a thinker. Originally the scene was going to end by shifting to the 4th's perspective as they actually they themselves realized how talking to the DC was pointless. In the end you are right that it just didn't make much sense.

    Hopefully now the changed last line from the 4th fixes the scene's logic.

    Thanks for the critique!

      Hm. Maybe something more like "I've just thought of a better idea" instead of the "punctuate in blood" line?

      It's also strange in general for her to say Batman doesn't want people to kill, him seem to agree, and then kill her anyway.
