  The top post comes across a bit negative, which I want to counteract. Welcome to the subreddit, and we could always use more new & different recommendations, even if some of us are jaded by the number of serials that put up 20 chapters and languish unfinished indefinitely :)

  I read to Ch 4, and it hasn't shown any major red flags so far, and has managed to catch my interest to read further. However, I will be putting it aside until there's over 20 chapters out.

  What else has the author written? His patreon is new, with 0 subscribers.

  Regardless of whether you've read ahead, I think you're jumping the gun posting a recommendation for a story with only 17k words out. No one who reads webfiction regularly will get out of bed for anything less than >50k words. Maybe even >100k. It takes more than 20k words for frodo to sell bag's end, let alone leave the shire!

  Also, it's always kinda suspicious when someone's first post in a community is such a strong endorsement of a niche/unknown product. You say you read the sidebar but your story isn't tagged, and you made a new thread instead of posting it in the monday recommendation thread. Not a good look friend.

    It's a little suspicious, yeah, but at least it was an effort-post instead of "hey read this plsktnx". :D I'll give it a look just for the effort this took.

    The author is posting once a day in April, and I know people who like to check in daily to read each chapter as it is published.

    There's no rule in the sidebar that says your post needs tags, or that recommendations can't be their own post  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

    1k geyser of a review for a 17k story has me thinking alt account or plant.

    /u/nameless3002 what's the author's previous works? His account is new and has 1 story.

        I don't think anyone's pissed. Everyone here likes a good sincere recommendation. But your review doesn't pass the smell test because like a rational whodunit let's look at what we know:

        1. Your review is long and fervent for a story with only 17k words published

        2. This is your first post to r/rational

        3. New thread promoting a new story

        4. Sentences trying to build hype around a new product

        5. You mention the author's previous works but his RR account was made in February and has 1 story. For all we know, he could have 50 alts.

        6. Your own story was officially ended 2 months ago

        If someone had to bet, one explanation seems more probable than the other.

        If you're really just a fan, then the moral is to be more patient and sound less like a shill.

        Hi, I just wanted to let you know not to let trolls make you feel down (just in case it helps to hear this from a third party like me).

        This subreddit has been experiencing, in recent years, a slow increase in the proportion of subtly rude (without swearwords) and/or pro-hate-speech comments, which unfortunately remain unmoderated.

        Also, I clicked open the profile of the person you're responding to, and found that this sort of troll-like hostility seems to be a general pattern in their recent comments across subreddits (edit: specifically, I saw him accuse someone on a completely different subreddit of the same thing), so it really isn't anything you said.
        ```

  - u/Fluffy_data_doges:

    Yeah, I usually only try a story when it has at least 200 pages. Leaves enough time for authors to drop it, more reviews, and to see if it has a consistent release schedule.

    I read even stories with just the first chapter sometimes!

  Normally I would leave something like this on Read Later till it gave me a nice long archive binge, but I got bored last night and this caught me at the right time.

  So far, I'm taken with it. 

  The writing, mechanically, is solid. No obnoxious tense-switching, no glaring errors or nonsense word choices. That right there puts it a step above a lot of the unedited junk on RR.

  The characters are sound. Each of the three main characters has a goal of their own. Even the ten-year-old little sister has a goal: to get over her fear of fire. The female lead isn't a mindless cardboard love-interest; she's a wannabe adventurer still trying to decide if she wants a family or adventure more.

  So yeah, this post may or may not strike you as sus, but I certainly don't regret having binged seven chapters of this story. Go ahead and put it on your Read Later lists of nothing else.

  Thanks for the rec, sounds like something I might like!

  This is the third time I happened across this post, and I decided to try reading the story despite an issue that bothered me with the review: there is a clear lack of a plot summary or blurb to tell us what's it about. I suggest adding one of those in future reviews. Telling us various characteristics of a story is fine and all, but it is not particularly attractive in anything but a purely analytical way, one that is slightly attractive by the promise of a lack of problems, rather than the presence of features.

  I know both Nameless and the author of Mark of the Fool and just thought I'd quickly weigh in. They're definitely not the same person and this is a legitimate case of a fan and fellow author wanting to support great writing. 

  I haven't personally read MotF yet since I tend to binge stories all at once, but I \*have\* read the author's previous work, which in my opinion is some of the best on Royal Road. Based on the strength of their previous work I would be very surprised if this turns out to be anything less than stellar. It's on my read list for the near future. :)

      Curses, you got me. I'm secretly a stooge for Big Fool.

  seems not bad. certainly better than similar stories that came out recently like Blessed Time or Pen is Mightier (less interesting worldbuilding, better execution).

  bold choice to take the sister along. generally there are good reasons authors don't put little kids in adventuring parties. 8 chapters in and she's already been in significantly more danger than if she had just stayed with their adopted family.
  ```

- u/EsquilaxM:
  ```
  Yeah 7 chapters/17k is far too few. I'll leave it on my read later for a while.
