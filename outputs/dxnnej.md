## Pyrebound 10.1 (A Hunter on the Trail)

### Post:

En route to the Ensi, and hopefully answers.  Except, you know, it's never that simple.

PB is a fairly dark fantasy novel about power politics in a world dominated by war, magical dangers, and resource scarcity.  Our protagonist, naturally, is the little guy caught up in a scheme to make things better.  First installment is [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thanks to everyone, as always, for being great readers, voting, offering feedback, and everything else!

  The spirits want something.  What is the shape of the world they would make?

  I *like* this.  Very interesting, useful speculation.

  Excellent chapter! Finally getting some real info on magic and spirits, with some hints as to where this might be going.  


  Wild mass guessing: Bal definitely doesn't have something as simple as a dead resh, and it's going to come out at the worst possible time.

  Clearly the answer to Ram's problem is to keep sticking more spirits in his head. If they're all arguing with each other about what to do, none of them can take control.
