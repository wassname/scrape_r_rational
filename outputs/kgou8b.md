  You know, when I joked back in summer that we won’t see Rain level before the New Years, I didn’t think it would be a reality. 

  Like holy shit, there is this tantalizing fruit that has been hanging over the head for half a year and yet there is absolutely NO sign of it ever becoming reality. This is our Hell of Tantalus.

    What bothers ME more is the lack of additional worldbuilding. What's Val's class? Earlier we were told that we would learn it but that never happened. What are the cracks in reality that happened when the Warden and Fecht broke the damage limit? What's the deal with the Mystraals?

    You won't see him level before the story dies.

  So, I paid the patreon cost to read the advanced chapters, and... nothing worthwhile happens. I've been enjoying this story and defending it, even during the borings parts, but somehow it's really rubbing me wrong at this point. It has a lot of potential and I like the world building, but the mediocre writing and lack of compelling main character is just reaching a critical point for me. I think I might be done with it.

  I'm not among the people that begrudges the pace of *words*, I think it can be really hard to keep a serial going strong. But there are definitely ways to shore up the problem of it seeming slow without actually writing a lot more.

  I think the biggest issue is the constant perspective swaps. Ever since GoT on HBO, this has become really popular in all media, but it slows progression to a crawl and makes it harder to really get going. If you mix it with a serial pace, you get these munchkin 1000 word segments that leave you wanting more even if you get a couple of them at once. IMO you shouldn't be switching perspective if you don't plan to stay put for at least 10k words, but maybe I'm crazy.

    This approach of giving a lot of different alt character view points has become popular in web serials. It lets the author flush out the word count when they're still planning the main plot, and I think it can also keeps thing interesting for the writer if they're feeling burnt out. 

    The situations where this works well are those where the alt viewpoints are for bonus chapters, though. When given as patreon awards, or as bonus content for meeting funding milestones, these view like a fun extra that you get to read about a world you're interested it. It doesn't work so well when it just takes the place of normal, already slow, updates...

      Character POVs work well when they show a different aspect of the world, tell an interesting character arc that adds to the world or story, or is another viewpoint on progressing a certain plot in the story, which Worm excels in, with even interludes from Brutus, Sophia, and Blasto being interesting and meaningful, much less the plot-important ones like with Kevin Norton or Chevalier.

      The problem with Delve is that these perspective changes are damn pointless. Like, half of them are from random tag-alongs in Rain’s company and none of them are memorable or interesting or even unique, much less add anything meaningful through their perspective. Did we get anything meaningful through that Samson or whatever guy’s POV? Or from that archer dude? Even Kettel’s POV was meaningless, all it told us was another group of idiots being idiotic. Even the fucking dog interlude from Worm was more interesting, informative, and important than any of the Delve POVs we’ve seen.

      Delve, more than any other web novel, confuses me with its pace. And I’ve read some reaalll shitty Chinese web novels. In this chapter alone we spent a page or so detailing the pointless monsters Rain’s hunting, and there’s countless more examples throughout the story. It drags on and on with a lot of trivial and pointless details and on uninteresting characters. I generally like fluff and more lore and knowledge on things, but Delve even fails on that front by expounding on completely minor and boring things like all the minutiae of getting supplies, and then talking about the intricacies of said supplies.

      Thoroughly disappointing. But you know I’ll be back next week.

      Worm did a lot of it, but Worm interludes were long, usually (if not always to the 10k standard I mentioned.) Even then, there were certain notorious interlude arcs that sucked reader momentum out of Worm as it was being written.

  Another snoozer.

  By the way, are we supposed to know the names of those three local adventurers pretending to be famous?

    They are from the 1st 5 chapters, the ones who found Rain.

        You need to invest in clarity, obviously. That's the best way to remember plot relevant details.

  I don't see why everyone is complaining about Delve so much. The pacing slowed down, sure, it's slightly fillery, sure, the prose is mediocre, sure, but it was really only terrible around 115-123. The writing of the romance is fucking atrocious; that is definitely the worst thing. Rain being quirky is kind of annoying, but I don't find him to be out of character; he basically has severely magic-induced ADD due to having Clarity much higher than Focus.

  It doesn't bother me that Rain hasn't leveled in a while: it makes sense that the resource that bottlenecks the entire setting also bottlenecks the protagonist. They're going to recruit a few more high level people in Ascension later, go caving, then level. It might take 20 chapters but that is reasonable considering the in-universe difficulty of the task. I think the problem people are having is the lack of feeling of progression; SenescentSoul could probably fix it by focusing less on slice of life writing and more on the other ways Rain is progressing: growing Ascension, travelling, building up resistance to soulstrain from his ring, doing technology, etc. But yeah, if you want to desub from his patreon, you probably should. 5k words per week way too little considering his current profit.

      The thing he's using isn't democracy; it's collective pirate government. This is something the previous threads have mentioned. Rain's system is actually smart (especially the DKP system based on videogame raids) but his calling it "democracy" is misleading and makes him seem stupid.

      The problem isn't that the romance is awkward. It's supposed to be awkward, due to Rain's brain damage and social awkwardness as well as Amelia's commitment problems. It's just BADLY awkward; Amelia's thoughts are told instead of shown and the whole thing feels very trite. Amelia and Rain are both fairly competent characters; at this point, one of them could have just said, "Hey, the level difference and consequent power different is difficult, and we might die soon. Wanna date though?" and then we could watch them deal with INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS instead of shitty pre-relationship problems.

      I find this sort of dynamic very unrealistic; in my experience, romantic relationships are one of the easier domains in which to apply rationaly to change my own decision making in real life. However, this may different for other people who may easily use rationality on themselves to do chores (with which I struggle) but struggle to do it to overcome interpersonal fear, embarrassment, and status anxiety. YMMV.

        > Rain's system is actually smart (especially the DKP system based on videogame raids) but his calling it "democracy" is misleading and makes him seem stupid.

        Rain *seems* stupid because he *is* stupid. Most of the decisions he's made throughout the story are, objectively, bad. They ended up working out largely because he got lucky and persevered.
        ```

        - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
          ```
          Yup, this is the main issue, exacerbated because the story keeps trying to tell us that Rain is smart. At this point, he just seems arrogant and delusional, while somehow skating by through luck. 

          I think the author *thinks* Rain is being punished sufficient for his mistakes, but overall it's not that believable. The expected outcome at this point should be Rain dying. There's just been way too many close calls that resolved only due to plot armor and luck.

            >I think the author thinks Rain is being punished sufficient for his mistakes, but overall it's not that believable.

            I agree with this. There's a bit of a disconnect, because Rain is dealing with trauma and character growth from his mistakes. But it's not very meaningful to us because Rain doesn't lose out on any *resources* which would make more of an impact, so it feels like Rain has too much plot armor.
            ```

              > so it feels like Rain has too much plot armor.

              Yeah, this is a big part of it. Too many close calls with death with no actual meaningful cost coming of it just makes it seem like bad writing after a while. I think it's also that the author is writing in these close calls and cliffhangers to try and increase the stakes, but that again is just a tool of mediocre writing.

  I don't even care if Rain levels up but some actual content would be nice. He's just milking the patreon bucks now...

      Maybe I'm just getting tired of it but the I feel like the pacing has really slowed down to a crawl. It feels slower than the buried arc.

      Rain caught some shrews (barely relevant side quest that other members could have done off screen)

      Steam engine started (random character side quest)

      Amelia healed some npcs (irrelevant side quest)

    Same here! Every week, the Delve thread seems to get a solid 30-40 votes, despite the comments. I suspect a lot of us enjoy reading it, but don't bother with discussion due to the pervasive negativity.
