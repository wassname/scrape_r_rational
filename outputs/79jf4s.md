        ```
        I'd say Damien's forgetting his promise entirely was a critical blunder so far as his relationship with Fortov are concerned. Less so for Silverlake switching to combat, but again, there's a pivoting point in each case that could justify the title.
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          The critical blunder on Silverlake's part could be about telling them about the primordials when she didn't do so in the previous time loop. Last time, she didn't believe them but didn't even try the "very easy way to check if [they]'re telling the truth or not"?

          That implies the previous version of her kept back the information on the primordials for a reason that the current her doesn't know at all.

          Or Zach and Zorian are making a critical blunder with their assumptions/guesswork about Red Robe.
          ```

        - u/braiam:
          ```
          Mmm... interesting. I was thinking along the "Mistakes has been made" where Zorian was messed up by a web, so I was searching for where ZZ messed up this time.

  Feeling very stupid for not seeing that the temporary marker could be turned into a permanent one with a bit of clever magic.

  Anyone got any clever ideas as to why Veyers was soulkilled and wiped from Zach's mind?
  ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    Zach is the original looper and as he liked talking about the stuff, he invited Veyers into the loop.

    Then someone in the cult noticed Veyers was a bit too good and mindraped him, getting the marker and meddled with it until he got it permanent.

    Then Zach needed to be dealt with, and the best way would be to wipe the memory. It needs to be wiped from the stuff Zach used to get Veyers into the loop.

    The temporary loop clearly has to have been used, only one could have been the original looper, Zach. So Zach already has known about at least some of the artifacts.

    Zach kinda has to be the original, because if RR was original, there would be no need whatsoever to make Zach permanent. Only other reason of Zach being permanent would be if someone completely different was the original looper and he tested the thing with Zach, who they believed would not be a threat and RR stealing the loop from that different guy then.
    ```

    - u/MistahTimn:
      ```
      There's also the potential that Red Robes is someone with good enough soul sight to notice the existence of the marker. Through observing either Zach or someone with the temporary marker, the extremely powerful soul mage, or necromancer, replicates the full marker on their own soul thereby gaining access to the loop.
      ```

      - u/kaukamieli:
        ```
        Yes, the marker was seen from Veyers, though, or there would have been no reason to remove Zach's memory of him.

        Red was thinking there could be tons of loopers because Zorian happened even after he thought he deleted Veyers and mindraped Zach so that he can't make more loopers. If he could steal the marker, someone else could too and apparently has.
        ```

        > Through observing either Zach or someone with the temporary marker, the extremely powerful soul mage, or necromancer, replicates the full marker on their own soul thereby gaining access to the loop.

        *Very* unlikely. The Controller marker was apparently specifically designed to resist copying and tampering. I really don't think that we're going to find out a human mage just went ahead and did it anyway.

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Yeah, but it was a fluke. You could probably do a hundred soul merges on Zach and never get that result again. And it would be quite damaging to both Zach and the recipients. So, yeah, the Gate might not have passed a [thorough test suite](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335), but I don't think any process based on soul merging is a strong possibility for RR's marker.
            ```

          - u/jex5:
            ```
            I don't think he messed with the marker or even noticed it. He was smushing Zorian and Zach's souls together, then the reset ripped them apart, leaving each of them with chunks of the other's soul. Wasn't Zorian's best guess that the Controller "fixed" the marker fragments on both souls?
            ```

            - u/Cheese_Ninja:
              ```
              I've been thinking that the Marker duplication is due to an aspect of the Marker itself, and that the main thing QI did besides the attempted merge was temporarily suppressing the soul-protecting reset aspect of the Marker. If it wasn't for QI doing that, Zorian would not have gotten the 2nd flawed Controller Marker.

              As to why I think Marker duplication is an aspect of the Marker, it's because I think Zach's doubled mana capacity is because the Marker uses itself as the base to merge the Controller's original soul with their loop soul.

              Also, is anyone else besides me going to be annoyed if after everything, it turns out that Tesen was RR? As long as he was downplaying his abilities to let Zach beat him up occasionally, it makes a lot of sense, but feels unsatisfying. Tesen would have had a far easier time getting access to the Royal Treasury for the Dagger (for the presumptive soulkill), could have foreknowledge of the Sovereign's Gate, could easily use his status to forge alliances with the high ranks among the Dragon Cultists and the Ibasans. And access to the Ibasans means access to QI means access to the Crown, which is probably necessary for temp soul markers, and he definitely had access to Zach, who was also probably necessary. Also he could have kept Zach in a coma for the first 6 loops after Zorian's inclusion to the loops.
              ```

              - u/jex5:
                ```
                > the main thing QI did besides the attempted merge was temporarily suppressing the soul-protecting reset aspect of the Marker

                The impression I got was that the reset was working properly, which is why the reset happened as soon as the marker registered that it was taking damage. I guess the restart could have timed out normally, but having that happen right at the moment that Zach and Zorian needed it would have been a pretty big coincidence.

                > As to why I think Marker duplication is an aspect of the Marker, it's because I think Zach's doubled mana capacity is because the Marker uses itself as the base to merge the Controller's original soul with their loop soul.

                Could you explain this? Not sure I follow. Are you saying that the marker has some ability to merge souls because when Zach entered the loop, his marked real soul merged into a "templated Zach soul" inside the time loop?
                I actually have my own (completely unsubstantiated, probably wrong) theory on Zach's mana pool, which is that unlike most people he is a vanilla human with no soul modifications. I imagine at some point soul modifications were a fad and everyone was making shifters, empaths, etc., and along with that there were a bunch of inefficient trash mods like "slight boost to eyesight" that everyone and their mother had access to. These all spread throughout the population and, in their passive state, are soaking up the average person's mana reserves without them noticing. In this case, the unmodified humans are the ones that would have the largest mana pools. I can also see this playing into who gets to use the Sovereign Gate - the gods might not even consider people who were "tainted" with primordial essence, so the Noveda's (who possessed the gate for a long time) would try to keep their bloodline pure.

                > Also, is anyone else besides me going to be annoyed if after everything, it turns out that Tesen was RR? 

                I hope he's not, but I still hope they discover a reason to slap him around. I vaguely remember QI calling Red Robe a brat or something as he was about to soulkill the aranea, so I was kind of assuming that Red Robe would be a kid. I guess even Silverlake would be a punk kid to a thousand-year-old bag of bones though, so that probably doesn't mean anything.
                ```

                - u/Cheese_Ninja:
                  ```
                  The reset did happen properly, but I figure without QI there actively trying to mangle Zach's soul with a merge, it would have happened a few seconds faster and without Zorian getting a Marker. One of the Marker's stated functions is to trigger a reset before any major damage can happen to the Controller's soul, if QI was inhibiting the protection, it makes his contribution greater and the replication of such a feat much more difficult. If all QI did was smash Zach and Zorian's souls together then it makes it seem easier for people to get Markers, even if it probably has a low success rate.

                  Zach's mana capacity per chapter 62:
                  >I'm magnitude 50 in terms of mana reserves, but I can shape my mana as if I was magnitude 25 at most. That's too… convenient to be natural.

                  So, at some point before he was aware of his capacity it seems to have been doubled, and the mostly likely event was his entry into the Gate. Zorian didn't have any grasp of his initial reserves at the start of the story, and he was a much better student than Zach. Max reserves are roughly 4x initial reserves, which brings Zach to where he was at the start of the story.

                  And the most likely mechanism for merging the Controller's loop soul and original soul isn't the Guardian of the Threshold, but the Marker itself, which has several functions, many of which are still a mystery to Zach and Zorian. All the Guardian has to do is place the Controller's original soul with the Marker inside their initial loop body, and the Marker should take care of the rest, duplicating itself and then using itself to merge the two souls into one cohesive whole. Although as I write this I am wondering if I'm flawed in my reasoning since it doesn't assume the Controller's loop soul to have a Marker already, and the world inside the Gate should basically be a perfect copy of the world outside.
                  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    The theory I put forward (and it's not disproved; Zorian is still just speculating) is that RR didn't modify the temporary marker, but rather used compulsions to have Zach keep re-applying it to him every six months. Which could also neatly explain why he exited once Zach became aware of him and hostile to him: he couldn't 'recharge' any more without subduing Zach and performing further mind magic, which he failed to do.

    Either way, though, we don't have an answer as to why the Guardian treated it as a full Controller marker and let him out of the loop.
    ```

    - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
      ```
      This makes a lot of sense to me. Also, it would explain RR's unhinged anger with Zach (repeatedly bashing Zach's head into the ground); RR knew his time in the loop was running out.

      Here's another idea that builds off your theory, although even I don't find this idea likely: RR never found a way out of the loop. He was able to confuse the Guardian enough to bar the Gate, but finally could not exit the loop. From a dramatic prospective, this idea would be so anticlimactic that I find it totally unlikely.

      They'd still have a lot to deal with post-loop though, so it wouldn't be *that* anticlimactic. The threat of RR has given ZZ focus and they've both benefited tremendously.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Nah, I can't see the Guardian getting confused like that unless it was presented with something it believed to be a Controller marker. With a temporary marker, RR should have just hit an endless string of "I'm sorry, but you are not authorised for that function."
        ```

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          Possibly, however we know that modern mages have a more malleable approach to magic. Perhaps RR was able to modify his marker in such a way that indeed he could cool the Guardian. I mean, under this theory, RR potentially had Zach's real marker that he could study, which when compared with RR's temporary marker, might have given RR the information necessary to fool the Guardian.
          ```

      - u/Xtraordinaire:
        ```
        > They'd still have a lot to deal with post-loop though

        No, not really. They know how to stop the invasion dead in its tracks, so unless they want to overachieve and get all the gate keys in real world too, there is nothing for them to do, like *at all*. Alert Alanic, steal the gate, fin.
        ```

        - u/jex5:
          ```
          Mostly true, although once outside the loop you have to factor in summoned demons(granted, maybe also with angels). Also, I would expect the cautious Zorian especially to behave differently when faced with permanent death outside the loop, and the battle would be a lot different if he chickened out and didn't participate. If the fight at Cyoria or Iasku takes too long, you run the risk of one group reinforcing the other. If things go pear-shaped you risk fighting a lich, demon(s), a bone dragon, and maybe a fully transformed Sudomir all at once or close together. I'm fully expecting a brutal Final Month with Red Robe in the mix, but it could still be pretty bad without him.
          ```

          - u/Xtraordinaire:
            ```
            Consider that Zorian hasn't died in a long time, and the closest he came to dying was always when exploring something new.

            Without RR the loop works as intended: it lets the loopers to study mission critical scenarios and figure out the best points of attack. For example, the fight at Iasku is completely avoidable. You can assassinate Sudomir and raze the mansion with artillery spells. 

            That's why there has to be RR to make things interesting: he takes out a big chunk of information about mission critical events and makes this information unknowable within the loop. Without him even extra cowardly Zorian can prevent the primordial summoning. I don't think Zach would ever shy away from danger and he is the big gun. Now, if Zach doesn't get out of the loop, things get interesting, but that's unlikely. 

            tl;dr: there has to be RR in the final month for literary reasons.
            ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          You may be forgetting that in the real world, the cultists will be able to go with their original plan of summoning demons. The Ibasans might not call off the invasion after all, in that case.

          And due to the reset, Zorian never saw the long-term fallout of the cancelled invasion. In the short term, QI was focusing on getting his people safely home, but once that was done, he likely would have come back to investigate, and he would have been mad.
          ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I don't think the temporary marker can be re-applied to souls that already have it, though. So that would mean RR's soul and mind would have gotten reset every 6 months. I guess he could have stored his memories in Zach's mind using memory packets, but he couldn't have stored his soul's growth, so he would have repeatedly lost all his progress at mana shaping and capacity.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > I don't think the temporary marker can be re-applied to souls that already have it, though

        But there may be workarounds for that. Eg unlike the Controller marker, the temporary marker presumably does not embed itself into every part of the target soul; it's designed to be removed. So, presumably it's possible for RR to deliberately remove it during his last month, ready for the Controller to bestow a new one, thus maintaining continuity.
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          > it's designed to be removed

          er... no. 

          You are kinda forgetting that the gate recreates the whole world from the template *including creating new souls*. That's why the limitation was placed in the first place, these new souls are eventually destroyed. According to the guardian killing off one month deviation from the original is not considered morally wrong. I don't agree personally, but that's what the story says and we gotta roll with it. That's the whole reason this 6 month-limitation exists in the first place. Cheating it with something as *trivial* as simply overwriting is uncharacteristic of the guardian.

          With that in mind, here's what the loop does:

              take a snapshot of the world
              take the controller's soul out of their real body
              while the controller is inside:
                  recreate the physical world
                  populate the bodies with new souls that are not marked 'soul kill' # soul eject is a better term
                  insert controller's real soul into their body
                  iterate temporary markers
                  insert passengers' souls into their bodies
                  try:
                     run a month
                  except:
                     something goes really wrong with the controller's soul or some primordial shit shows up
                  finally:
                     pluck the controller's soul out of their in-loop body
                     if a passenger's marker has more time scheduled: 
                        pluck the passenger's soul out of their in-loop body
                     collapse current iteration # every soul not taken out is destroyed

          This means we never remove temporary markers, we only apply them. Instead we just discard expired passengers just like we discard any regular one-monthers

          Besides, it's just basic security. You do not mess with your Master branch! You only apply small patches to it. Should something go *really* wrong with the gate, worst case scenario the real controller does not return and becomes a meat puppet.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            > we just discard expired passengers

            That approach might work, but it's not what the Guardian described:

            > "And by temporary, I mean that the target of the lesser marker will retain their memories and abilities for up to six iterations before the marker dissolves."

            Theoretically, when such a marker is already close to dissolution, I would think a skilled soul mage could give it a good nudge to speed up the process.
            ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Well, the temp marker theory was discussed around the time we learned about it. 

    There is a theory that Veyers is Red Robe. My objection to that is that pre-loop Veyers has no skills whatsoever to manipulate something as complex as a marker, even if a temp one is less complex than the original. And he doesn't have the potential to learn anything that complex in the extra 6 months that the marker would give him. I mean, his specialization is fire magic, something completely different.

    My theory was that Zach in an attempt to stop the invasion alerted some top Cyorian official, that also happened to be a to cult member. Now *these* people are skillful mages, so potential to manipulate the marker is there. And they have a motive not only to unleash a primordial, but to do is as smoothly as possible. After all, their target is mind controlling it, so naturally they are seeking all the chances to raise probability of success and survival.  

    Now, Veyers being a spy for the cult offers another vector to Zach but that ultimately leads again to the very top cultists. Veyers is a link,  just as Zorian said.

    I guess something normal Veyers did in the original version of the month leads him to Zach. Maybe he confronted him, seeing Zach as the reason for his own failure and then something made Zach spill the beans. If this happened with any consistency, he had to be removed. 

    edit: you know... after reading this chapter I kinda start to think this very plausible! That remark Zach just made about the losers' solidarity. They had A LOT in common in that, Boranova was the biggest loser of his class, and not entirely his fault. The unruly bloodline talent kinda made things hard for him. I can see Veyers seeking to punch Zach in the face, similar how Fortov seeks Zorian albeit for a different purpose. Sure, Zach would enjoy being prepared and kicking Veyer's ass... once. Twice. Thrice, maaaaaybe? Somewhere down the line I see him trying to figure this out and then sympathizing for the guy.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      The main problem that I see with that theory is that Zach doesn't seem to have the ability to grant temporary markers in the first place. If the ability is granted by one of the Ikosian artifacts, then at some point Zach must have had that artifact. No easy feat, as we have seen, and Z&Z speculated that the artifact to grant temporary markers is the crown that Quatach Itchl keeps on his head. So, did he lend Zach the crown, when Quatach Itchl doesn't really trust the Cult of the Dragon Below? Seems unlikely.

      The other option is that the ability to grant temporary markers is inherent, Zach learned it, and RR made Zach forget it. Possible, and the more likely possibility, but given RR's displayed level of mind magic I'm still unsure.

      Thinking about it more, maybe Zach was taught spells by the person who gave him the marker intended for managing the loop. What if Z&Z are wrong about what the dagger and crown do, and the abilities are just spells that need to be taught? RR could have stolen those from Zach's mind, wiped them (because wiping memories seems to be about the extent of RR's memory manipulation), then left Zach to his own devices?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        its posible that in restart one  Zach was given information about the locations of the various artifacts, or some other way of getting them easily. No point having these control artifacts in the loop if your intended user is never going to find them

        - u/sicutumbo:
          ```
          The presumed relevant artifact for granting temporary markers is sitting on the head of the strongest lich in the story. Knowing the location doesn't help that much.

            Ch. 26: 

            > As for the lich, he was utterly unfair – nothing seemed to scratch those bones of his in the slightest. Zach actually managed to blow his shiny armor to bits with some kind of black bolts and even knocked the thing's crown off its skull, but nothing ever made a mark on the bones. What the hell was that thing made of?

            Seemed inconsequential at the time when the crown was basically just a part of the lich's costume, but may be relevant if they just have to get their hands on it.  Also, Zorian was quite successful against the lich shortly after this by touching him using Kael's coin of soul banishing.  And Zach has some black blades, and Alanic a golden orb, and Xvim the magical prowess to go toe-to-toe with the lich in Chapter 60.  

            Gettingthe crown would be difficult and risky, but seems doable, especially if they can get support from a large battle group again.  Finding the lich early would likely be an important step.
            ```

    - u/cthulhubert:
      ```
      I definitely used to assume that Zach started out with knowledge of the loop and the abilities to add temporary markers and excise people, and then Red Robe messed with his memory. But with connecting the orb to the gate, and finding out it had abilities tied to the loop, their theory that the dagger and crown are the excise and temporary marker abilities makes a lot of sense.

      I may or may not keep to my original theory that Zach knew things about the loop, but Red Robe was able to acquire the crown and dagger for him to give him those abilities.

      I definitely started assuming as of last chapter that Veyers and Zach got along (sympathy, doing badly in school and having your house legacy stolen by adults? It's a one-two punch), Zach told Veyers about the time loop, and Red Robe heard about the time loop via the lawyer, and then did whatever.

        I'm on board with the Veyers and Zach getting along theory.

        But that crown and dagger bit, it's a problem. How do you get the crown? Even the Master Cultist can't go and say 'hey mr Quatal-ichl can I borrow your crown for my project I won't tell you about?' Maybe they are wrong, the crown is responsible for something else entirely? I don't think *anyone* in the world has access to the crown. The lich just doesn't seem the sharing type and is also undefeated.
        ```

        - u/cthulhubert:
          ```
          That's a good point about the lich but honestly, I don't see it being that farfetched. Especially if Red invents a clever enough lie about it potentially being related to the summoning, or if he was a contributor to Quatach-Ichl's gate project. The lich's relative amiability when Zorian killed that vampire heiress, and his "tough but fair" reputation among the Ibasans makes him seem reasonable enough. I guess it depends on what kind of "mundane" divine magical ability the crown might have.

          But it's also true that we only have the barest guess that the crown is the temporary marker maker (or even that temporary marker making is conferred by an object at all, rather than a separate ability that must be taught by the Maker or one of His agents).
          ```

  - u/Cheese_Ninja:
    ```
    I've argued it as an altered temporary marker in the past, but without any certainty. Age of Gods magic was kinda shitty, the modern shaping skills and structured magic seemed like they might have the ability to alter a temporary marker in a way that was never actually intended to be possible.

    Still, even if they're right this chapter and it isn't Veyers, but rather someone else using an altered temp marker, that raises a few important questions.

    Applying temporary markers should be a privilege of the Controller, probably with the Crown. Unless QI somehow had a hack for the Crown that allowed him to apply a marker despite not being the Controller? And in that case, why wouldn't he just apply it to himself? They could be wrong about the Crown being necessary for temp markers, but then what?

    There's also the question of how anyone would know that they were inside the Loop to start experimenting, which still makes me think that someone intentionally activated the Gate a month early. Even if, as Silverlake implies here, that specific knowledge relating to the primordials would give easy, irrefutable evidence of the time loop, that still doesn't give whoever RR is much opportunity to set things in motion if they only found out while inside the loop.

    If the Dagger allows Soulkill to be used, maybe RR has links to the Eldemar royalty somehow? (The Dagger is in the royal treasury in the capital.) Alternatively, RR wasn't able to access the dagger at first or didn't know what it did.

    Soulkilling Veyers and wiping him from Zach's memory only makes sense if as either a red herring (which itself was nigh-indiscoverable) or to prevent Zach from determining RR by interacting with Veyers. It would kind of make sense if these things happened at two different times, first the memory wipe of Veyers from Zach's mind, and only doing the Soulkill of Veyers much later on when RR got the ability to do so.

    It's notable that while Veyers has indirect links to the Dragon Cultists, he still should not have had easy access to the signature "red robe" unless he was a mage of Zach or Zorian's skill, since as far as I can remember those are hidden under the defenses of high-ranking Cultists.
    ```

  - u/LancesAKing:
    ```
    One possibility I’m thinking of is that Zach was introduced to RR as a potential teacher, through Varys. 

    Earlier in the time loop, Zach told everyone he was a time traveler, tried to learn about every classmate, and was also trying to master combat magic. He must have needed powerful teachers but doesn’t mention specifically who taught him yet- just that being who he is, people are happy to work with him. It’s possible that while befriending or getting to know Varys, he meets RR. Zach lost his house, Varys is being usurped from his- there’s some common ground there. Varys maybe gets in better terms with Zach and they decide they can help each other’s house, so he introduces Zach to a powerful person... whom also turned out to be a high ranking member in the Cult.  

    RR is skilled in mind and soul magic, as long as you don’t compare to Zorian.  RR learns of the time loop because he reads Zach’s memories, and sees the potential of getting in and furthering his own ambitions- among which is a successful assault on the city during the planetary alignment. After RR sets up (whatever it is he does to get into the time loop), RR wipes Zach’s memories of him, his knowledge of how the loop works, and Varys. As extra measures, Varys is soul killed as well so there is no way Zach could coincidentally lead himself to RR again.

  Hey, here's a possible cause for concern: we've been told about RR attacking Zach at the very start of the restart, apparently having rushed over without doing much beyond putting on the robe, presumably to take Zach unaware.

  Except that we know from Kael's examination of the aranea that the restart doesn't begin at the moment Zorian wakes up. It begins at something like 2am. Wouldn't RR have tried to make use of that? If he could have attacked while Zach was asleep, his ambush would have actually succeeded.

  Is it possible that it didn't really happen the way Zach described? He's the only source for the event, and we *know* that his memory has been altered by RR before. And he hasn't let Zorian examine his mind since then.

  I think it's pretty clear that the guy still in the loop and working with Zorian *is* Zach. A disguise would slip eventually, over the years they've been working together, and the combat skill and mana reserves he's displayed make it pretty clear IMO that he's the real deal. But what we think we know from him about RR may not be true.

    This is actually something I'd considered. I wondered if their assumption that he had just woken up was a red herring against the idea of him being a very early waker with a couple hours on Zach and Zorian, which might come to bite them in the rear when they leave the loop.

    But after thinking about it on my second read through, I'm putting less weight on that idea. His concern about Aranea or others he missed at their colony, in the chapter Soulkill, seems fully genuine, which makes me think he rushed there almost as quickly as Zorian, and thus he must wake up pretty close to the same time as Zach and Zorian. It seems feasible they're in a kind of culture where there's a certain typical hour for waking up.

    It's pretty hilarious that Zorian only got up at that time because of Kirelle, since he likes to sleep in normally.
    ```

  - u/LucidityWaver:
    ```
    That's a good point. Something to keep in mind at least.

    If Zach's description is roughly accurate, it's possible RR has no way to wake up earlier than he normally would, which may not be close to the 2am start. I'd guess it would take some risky soul or mind magic for one of them to wake up early on the first day of a loop.

      > I'd guess it would take some risky soul or mind magic for one of them to wake up early on the first day of a loop.

        ```
        That's true, and I realised that myself. It does undermine one part of what I was saying. I think the risk involved may not make it worthwhile to attempt prior to the incident we're talking about. 

        Do we know how good he is with soul magic? I haven't done a re-read, but my hazy recollection suggests he's rather unaccomplished as a mind-mage.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          We've observed very little, deduced a bit more. He hasn't actually demonstrated much soul magic, except that he hunted Zorian with soul perception. He claimed to use soul magic on the aranea, but it turns out that's just a Controller ability; still, he got a soul marker somehow, so he likely had necromancy skills even pre-loop.

          His mind magic was inferior to Zorian's, but that may have just been his unstructured abilities, and for a non-psychic it was probably an impressive showing. His structured mind magic may be far more advanced.
          ```

    - u/cthulhubert:
      ```
      I asked nobody103 on the world-building blog about gaining an ability to do without sleep. He said that he decided that it was possible, but it could have unpredictable effects on the mind, and so very few mages tried it. That not quite the same as making some kind of... soul bonded alarm clock effect, but might point at it as being too risky to try.

    It's not about the timing, it's about Zach becoming a monster who thinks nothing of beating someone in general or even just Tessen in particular to a bloody pulp. That could psychologically screw with him when he gets out and turn him into an actual murderer. Zorian expressed similar concerns about himself, that's why he didn't want to ambush and mindrape all the specialists on his list to get their secrets and abilities.

    In other words, if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.

And she sees quite clearly that having Z&Z on her side can be extremely profitable.

  Since we're talking about soul-killing and people with markers in this chapter...I wonder what would happen if you soulkilled Zach. It's gotta be an unexpected edge case from the Controller's perspective. I figure either (1) it doesn't work at all or (2) it forces Zach out of the loop and back into his real body. If the latter, then it may or may not destroy the benefits of the time loop. I can see this being an (extremely risky) way for him to get out if they can't come up with anything else.

  Man. And people complained about a chapter without a lot of action for the last chapter.

  I feel a bit foolish that I dismissed mucking about with the temporary marker so early as a possibility for entry into the loop.

  We've just recently had confirmation that the Sovereign Gates' safety measures are already obsolete in the face of modern magic. Red Robe taught himself unstructured mind magic just to mess with Zach's mind without triggering them, and that Quatach-Ichl bypassed the "soul-fuckery detection" function to do the soul meld as a matter of course.

  This miiiiight also explain why Zorian was able to use the soul marker divination to find Zach but Red Robe appeared unable to find Zorian: there's a "stuck" identifier value in Zorian's damaged Brand copy that matches the same identifier on Zach's, and a differing value is enough to make it impossible to use as the key to find another matching marker. Or maybe despite it being possible to wreck whatever makes it actually temporary, the temporary mark might be nearly completely different from the Brand. Though not different enough that it precludes using the loop excision ability (which makes sense if it's tied to an item anyways).

  PS: I only just now, writing this, realized that nobody103 has said repeatedly that names are phonetic, and based roughly on Croation. The 'h' in Zach isn't decoration. His name is probably pronounced /zatʃ/ (zatch). I hope I get "mind: blown" comments so I don't feel alone in this.

        I'll admit I didn't keep up with r/rational's MoL discussions lately, but back when I did, there was the following theory: the time loop is one of the safeguards of primordials' prisons, such that if a primordial is ever released, it initiates the restarts and tasks the Controller with stopping it from happening.

        Of course, it needs to be reconciled with time loop's mechanic as we know it now. Since there's no real time travel going on, this system wouldn't be able to *prevent* the primordial from being released, only triggering after it already happened.

        Perhaps there's a copy of the world constantly running in a parallel dimension, one month ahead of the "real" one? But it would be imperfect, with no access to astral plane, which makes it dubious as a security feature. Hmm...

        As a matter of fact, it probably isn't the primary intended purpose of the time loop, as The Guardian of the Threshold doesn't mention anything of the sort in [Chapter 55](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/55/Mother-of-Learning), saying that the time loop's purpose depends on the Maker and the Controller. I'm thinking that *if* it is used as a primordials' prisons' safeguard as well, it was supposed to be operated under gods' oversight, and since they have disappeared, it activated, but picked not a person suited to the task, but somehow marked based on inheritance (?), and didn't explain itself.

        Or were you referencing something else, u/monkyyy0?

          Between the Maker, **or his agents**, and the Controller. It seems perfectly plausible that one of the Maker's agents, presumably the angels but could be others, heard of a plot to release a primordial on the summer solstice and decided to start the time loop early.

      We know that the Gate is normally activated during the Planar Alignment, and that activating it even one month early cut down the number of iterations it can run hugely (going by the "eleven lifetimes" comment we got from the legend of the Sovereign Gate, maybe by a factor of ten).

      But it's been mentioned outright, in the story, that Zorian thinks the Primordial's prisons are special, possibly bridging between the Gate's pocket dimension and exterior reality, and that he might be able to use them to somehow get out of the loop safely.

  So, here is my thought with the 'Redcloak is a modified temporary marker user' theory: How the heck did he get the *temporary* marker. Immediate answer is that Zack, as the probable original marker owner, gave it to him. Well, how did he do that? Current speculation from our protagonists is that one of the seven Items probably grants that ability.

  ...which implies that Zack, at a point in time when he was much weaker in magic, somehow got access to this Item that he currently doesn't know how to access.

  ...which would imply that after after he Temporary Marker'd Redcloak, he lost the memory of how to acquire the Item. Presumably it's something rather straightforward once you know how to do it, otherwise this weaker Zack wouldn't have been able to. The protagonists just need to figure out what Zack used to know, and they could probably acquire a powerful tool (bringing some of their friends into the loop temporarily, for example)

  Actually, here's a bit of wacky speculation: Zack acquired the information on how to obtain this Item through some sort of interaction with Veyers. Maybe his unique knowledge of fire magic was involved in some way. Maybe Veyers' House knew something that Veyers found out about. Maybe he had some diplomatic route to an Item. In any case, in this speculation Veyers is *not* Redcloak, but when Redcloak was convinced there were other temporary marker users in play, he acted to keep Zack from setting up any temporary marker users in the future: 1) "Soul-kill" any people he thought might be temporary marker users.  2) Wipe knowledge of the Item from Zach's mind, along with knowledge that might lead to him reacquiring it, such as talking to Veyers again. 3) "Soul-kill" Veyers so Zach couldn't accidentally run into him again.

    I can pitch a wild speculation to that, the item in question is the one from the royal treasury, and the treasury staff has been infiltrated by the cult (would make sense for them to do so, honestly). So if Red Robe is a high level cultist he can have access to that trinket.

      Doesn't even need to be full-blown mind control, which IIRC is pretty hard to do. Just convince him to bring someone he trusts into the loop, Neolu for example, and use transformation magic to appear as that person to get the mark. Then blank Zach's memories so he forgets that he did it.

  Zorian seems to have powered up way too much in arc 3, compared to how long he has been in the timeloop. Around 7 years since he started looping, he transformed from a first circle mage, to someone who can apparantly rival Silverlake, a century old witch.


  Earlier in the story he admited that without the time loop he would never become an archmage, but now, 7~years later, he can pretty much break any mind shield, cast an invisible magic missile, ward better than a century old witch, create war golems, and who knows what else. In my opinion he progressed way to fast, compared to what I remember of the MoL lore.

    The key to becoming powerful in this world is not to be a genius spending 20 years to unlock a powerful secret, but collecting powerful secrets already discovered by someone else.  Normally these secrets are incredibly well guarded and only given out to those who bind themselves to their teachers in apprenticeship contracts and the like.  

    The time loop is literally made for this.
    ```

      And/or hiring armies of experts to comb through the answerspace.
      ```

  - u/Cheese_Ninja:

    I don't think he's quite rivaling Silverlake here, he basically just displayed his defenses, and made a note that it's a lot easier to establish defensive wards than offensive ones. She also stated that she's not a combat specialist either. His past year in the loop is closer to two years with time spent in the Black Rooms, and they've had basically unlimited funds to acquire top class teachers and training aids. While the simulacra can't directly impart skill to Zorian, they and his associates can do a lot the legwork to get Zorian to people that can help train him.

    But yes, his growth in the past 1-2 years has been pretty extreme.

    His progression is non-linear, because existing progress allows him to abuse the time loop better.

    - u/TaLampaRoger:

      Sure, but his skillset is so spread that it shouldnt progress as fast as it did. Shaping skills gives no bonus to mind magic, soul sensing, or warding. Im not sure if warding and making magical tools have use the same system. The point is, the majority his skills dont build upon each other, unless Ive completly misunderstood the system.

      Going from my memory here, he used his first 7 months before Zach woke to get better at schoolwork, and didnt really progress much overall. Then he spent some time getting to the level of a academy graduate, when he leaves Cyoria after Arc 1. He then spends a few months with Alanic getting the basics of soul sense. Then the next year he focuses on mind magic, getting to be absurdly good after around 4 years in the loop. He also starts diving into golem making at this point. Going from a novice to someone who can make war golems in three years of unfocused study. 

      Where in all that could he have gotten the skills to rival someone who has hundred years of experience in magic in general.
      ```

      - u/HotDropMarble:
        ```
        The mind magic and war golems are less of a hurdle than you think. Remember that he has an innate talent for mind magic due to being an empath, so his rapid progress there is not a surprise. 

        For the war golems, he took advantage of dozens of professional golem makers work. He spent huge sums of money going to many different golem makers having them refine his designs over the loops. Let's say he bought 1 month of polishing each from 5 pro golem crafters every loop. After 12 loops, that's 5 years of pro-level research and design.

        I'm sure you're tired of people disagreeing with you, as I see all the replies are, but I have to contribute. I do have the benefit of rereading the whole thing (and then the world building blog and all comments... just that fixated) just about 8 weeks ago, so let me go through these.

        >Shaping skills gives no bonus to mind magic, soul sensing, or warding.

        Firstly, there are specific shaping exercises for mind magic, as well as soul magic and warding. Zorian may have a special bloodline ability that makes it intuitive, but his mind magic is still basically the same unstructured mind magic a non-bloodline mage could use, just improved hilariously by his clear sense for minds. Shaping exercises should almost help his ability *more* than they would structured mind magic (there's a chapter where Xvim helps him with mind magic shaping by dispelling Zorian's mind shell and following it up immediately with a stunner, so Zorian has to train to instantly reform his defenses; I believe it's the same chapter that mentions Zorian finding a book with mind magic shaping exercises that he starts doing).

        All shaping exercises help with all other shaping a little bit (this is mentioned very early on: that just doing the basic three—telekinesis, light, and fire shaping—improves a modern mage's foundation for all magic), but raw mana shaping and sensing improves all other shaping much more substantially, and Zorian has also trained that under the tutelage of an archmage, and by using incredibly expensive and rare potions to speed it up (mostly one based on the grey hunter that gives him its magic sense, to improve his ability to sense his own magic while doing raw mana shaping).

        And don't forget that there's a lot of time we don't really see, and he's the kind of person who will spend his downtime waiting for someone doing shaping exercises. The benefits of which also carry between simulacrums, because it's still the same soul. Plus, he's had more than 30 days per loop (59, and up to 74 recently) for quite a few loops now.

        Warding is just a normal branch of magic, though I can understand any confusion because it's so often used through spell formulae, which are also how magical tools (like golems) are made. But most spell formulae are still deeply connected with normal spell casting skills. Fundamentally, they are mostly used to maintain and enhance a spell that's cast into them: they act as more complex, harder to create, but much more potent and enduring invocations (also understandable confusion, since chapter 11, Limiters, published some... ~~three years ago?~~closer to five, was the main time that was covered in detail, and it's quite explicit that improved shaping spells make for improved magical objects).

        As for the timeline, he doesn't merely get better at schoolwork in the first period, or improve to graduate level, he gets to the point where he meets Xvim's insanely high standards on both the telekinesis and light shaping exercises and games the loop to get accelerated, apprentice-only instruction from Ilsa until he learns to teleport (when he starts this he believes he's already good enough to test out of the academy, which in the real world at least often implies more raw ability than completing ones courses), a skill that seems to be far ahead of typical-graduate level.

        Now consider the main ways he rivals Silverlake: he's able to bring massive combat golems with him only because he has the divine relic orb, and he's better than her with wards (it's likely that his disadvantage using a small portable wardstone vs Silverlake's permanent ones is matched by his wards being defensive and hers offensive). Wards are actually one of the important components of golem making (half the reason golems are useful is that you can completely cover them with wards powered by ambient mana), which is adjacent to his core interest in spell formulae, and one of the areas he's had at least an actual year of hyper speed advancement via hiring and rehiring some of the best warding experts across the entire continent with his bottomless wallet and carrying journals across restarts. Hell, it's entirely possible that the specific blue-print for that stone he uses to beat her wards is something made as a collaborative effort by dozens of top experts in Altazia, and it's pretty much explicit that at least parts of his golems are too.

        On the other hand, his alchemy abilities may be impressive, but they're not even in the same league as someone who's made a potion of unaging, and we know little about her ability in soul magic, divination, transformation, and many other fields.

        And truly, age isn't everything. Xvim is only a mortal, but was able to block everything Quatach-Ichl (a thousand +year old gods-touched lich) threw at him.

        ~~Though uh, perhaps in support of your point, Silverlake was there for the coming of the Ikosians. She's probably over 400 years old.~~ One more edit: I had a sudden doubt and looked at the chapter itself: "When I was born the covens had already been on their last legs," so that actually puts a ceiling on her age, rather than a minimum.

          One of my favorite moments in this entire series was when Xvim backhanded one of Quatach-Ichl’s spells away and made the lich pause.

          But yeah, this is everything I wanted to say too! I reread the entire thing last month, so a lot of the small details were still clear for me. Btw, what is the world building blog you mentioned?

        His skills *don't* rival Silverlake's in her fields of specialty: potion-making, pocket dimensions. And what he does know about pocket dimensions, he learned from her.

        Combat magic isn't her thing, presumably not something she enjoys, so when she's out in the middle of nowhere, with her home practically undetectable, known only to a few, and protected by heavy wards, she doesn't spend time on it. She's easily good enough to fend off tourists, and isn't picking fights with anyone powerful.
        ```

      - u/FlameSparks:
        ```
        100 years of learning as a hermit. Silverlake dislikes people while Zorian has the advantage of seeking out the best teachers without worring about pesky things like money.
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Zorian had advantages over those seven years that other mages wouldn't:

    - One-on-one instruction from multiple Academy staff.
    - Mentoring from an archmage whose approach was basically focused on preparing others to be archmages. You don't need perfected shaping skills in order to be ordinary, after all.
    - Functionally unlimited money, allowing an unusual degree of experimentation and practical experience in fields such as alchemy and golem-crafting, plus no need for a 9-to-5 to support himself. Consider: Edwin came from a family of golem-crafters and was obsessed with the subject, but couldn't afford to actually make any designs himself, and he wasn't initially able to understand part of Zorian's blueprint as a result.
    - Access to many restricted or outright illegal spellbooks, from the aranea and cultists and various other sources.
    - Advanced tutoring from mages on Xvim's list.

    And remember how Zach said that with his approach to learning combat magic, you tend to die a lot? Outside the time loop, most mages probably either have safe careers, or short ones.

    ETA Also, Zorian's wards didn't necessarily have to be *better* than Silverlake's, he just needed to stalemate her. And his mind magic is easily explained: first, it's an innate gift, and secondly, unlike most humans, he used the loop to get actual thorough instruction in how to use it. His mastery of magic missile was a deliberate choice as a result of his low mana reserves; Zach has much more overall combat skill, just focused on much more powerful spells that would drain Zorian too fast to be worthwhile. Plus, mentored by Xvim.

    If Zorian and Zach fought, those invisible magic missiles would splash off Zach's shields, and Zach would quickly pulverise Zorian's shields in return. Zorian is probably too skilled to be easily taken by surprise, but fighting at Zach's level he would quickly run out of mana.

    ETA 2: It probably doesn't hurt either that Zorian uses mind magic to memorise things perfectly. You and I might need to re-read a book, he just creates a memory packet.
    ```

    - u/jex5:
      ```
      He really doesn't even need to stalemate her - just bluff her into thinking she'd lose more than she gained in a fight. He already put Silverlake off guard with his inexplicable in-depth knowledge about her, and she also had to be nervous of what Zach was capable.
      ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    He can break any mind shield from non-psychics who can't reinforce their mental shields given a couple minutes to work without interruption, the invisible magic missile is a party trick, he's better than said witch in an area she doesn't specialize in, and he commissioned the design of the war golems rather than design them himself.

    In addition to the increased pace of "and we spent 5 restarts doing stuff", another poster said that Zorian is better able to take advantage of the time loop the better he gets. At the start, he basically just followed an average student's path. Go to class, learn spells, work on shaping, read. As he gets better and he no longer needs to do that routine, he becomes able to find ways to repeatedly make literal tons of money, offer that money for normally prohibitively expensive tutoring, spells, and magic items, take what would normally be incredible risks for huge rewards, and more recently use simulacra for a variety of purposes. He seems to be progressing extremely fast compared to how he was simply because he is progressing faster, and it's all explained. Had he tried to pursue the path he has taken in this story, he would have permanently died to the Sword Divers, or in an assassination, or after doing the soul separation awareness ritual enough times, or somewhere else.
    ```

  - u/Melanthor:
    ```
    He has far more help and knowledge than he would have without the loop. Just like Daimen had the skills for the Gate-Spell but lacked the spell itself. In the MoL world people lack knowledge but once you have that knowledge acquiring the skills is rather easy. And especially in the last few months he has been using simulacrums to solve some problems. Think about the defense spell in the previous chapter that was created with his individual shaping excercises in mind. He didnt even create the spell himself,  he paid experts to do it for him. Learning that spell afterwards is easy. And you shouldn't forget the extra time in those time dilation chambers they found, making every month into 2-3 months.

    I dont really find that strange. Once his shaping excercises reach a specific point, learning new skills is supposed to be easy in MOL Universe.

  When I saw the chapter title, I was expecting Silverlake to kick their asses. Even if they are time loopers, that's still nothing against beings that are positively ancient and have had centuries to perfect their magics, as the lich well proves.

  - u/thrawnca:

    I doubt it; I suspect that she's just going to check the connections to the primordial pocket dimensions, and prove that the world is under extreme time dilation compared to them.

    That's assuming that the primordials are outside the loop. Which I think is a reasonable assumption, because if the gods were capable of routinely creating and destroying them, they wouldn't have needed to lock them away in the first place. And if even gods can't deal with primordials that way, I doubt that the Gate can.

  "That means that he knew of a very easy and reliable way of inducing people in the time loop and thought it was entirely plausible that someone was using it on a mass scale."

  GUYS, anyone else think they will induce ALL their allies into the time loop?!?!?!?!?!?!

  - u/eroticas:
    ```
    I wonder if humanity as a whole would ultimately be better off in a time loop. Stockpile a bunch of resources so no one has to work, and start the loop. Infinite life expectancy, highly renewable resources.

    I guess if anyone wanted to reproduce it would be an issue. Maybe some small, non-reproductive communities would live in time loops, amassing knowledge...
    ```

- u/edwardkmett:
  ```
  Guessing the "critical blunder" on the part of Silverlake is a red herring and the real one was telling Silverlake about the loop?

  Let's tell the few hundred year old very rational witch who is obsessed with not only not dying but getting her youth back that every month she dies and resets.
