## Trying to find a story I read about AI

### Post:

In this story, a man wakes up as an AI.  He's talking to his prior partner who won't let him talk to anyone else, including his wife. I think there was a terrorist attack leading to him uploading his consiousness, but I may be mixing two stories up.

Eventually (fairly quickly) he determines that he has been 'reset' by his partner multiple times.

Any ideas?  Google wasn't much help.

  Up until the terrorist attack bit it sounds like Permutation City.

  I recognise this from a writing prompt, but hadn't realised there was more to it!

  Incidentally, I just started laughing at the line "It's not slavery if you have no rights".  Oh, the human history relevance...

  Edit:  I think I smell a double-inconsistency.  In Part 1, it was expected not to work on humans, and he frantically cleaned up the code to give himself a chance.  In Part 2 Chapter 1, the device had been ready to record a dying patient called Tara Jakowski.  In Part 2 Chapter 3, they had been preparing to challenge the courts about personhood if 'Jessica' had been successfully recorded.

    The terrorists expected it to not work on humans. He cleaned up the code to remove the testing requirements because they only gave him an hour to run it.
