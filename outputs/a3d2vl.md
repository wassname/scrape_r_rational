  Can we *un-*recommend something? I've just finished the first two books of the "Arcane Ascension" series after seeing them posted here and elsewhere as rational fic. I would just like to warn anyone else thinking about reading these- they are many things, but rational they ain't. 

  They're about a boy in a wizarding school, replete with the standard lit-rpg tropes of monsters and classes and power levels and dungeon crawls. Sometimes these things can be really fun, especially if the main character really breaks the world over his knee and the narrative gets to explore some deeper issues. This story seems to promise something like that, but never delivers. The main character always *intends* to learn or grow or be prepared for his next challenge, but he is railroaded so hard that he basically has no initiative in the story. Super-powered villains, laughably out of his league, are always countered by super-powered good guys, laughably out of his league, who then take him aside and give him his next objectives at the conclusion of every battle. He (the main character) is intensely, aggravatingly passive, and despite being raised as a noble and a duelist his whole life has basically no knowledge of people, places or events in the world around him. He doesn't plan, barely experiences any character growth, and is just generally intensely dull and unlikable when held up against any of the side characters. 

  In short, it reads like someone wrote down their World of Warcraft adventure. (Perhaps not coincidentally, the writer used to work for Blizzard and Obsidian). Plot elements (keys, dungeon rooms, monsters) and narrative tropes (his fear of touch, his fear of overusing his power, long tedious explanations of runes) are overused to the point that they easily fill a third of each book and I found myself lightly skimming. At no point does anyone come even *close* to the standard of rationality, and it's intensely frustrating that the character's power set (Enchanter, basically can create any magic effect or item as long as he knows the runes/can power it) which is so *easily* broken, is never really taken advantage of at all. 

  Read these books if you want to pay several dollars for a bog standard fantasy school adventure. Or just go play an MMO, you will have the same experience.

    Good to know, thank you.

    &#x200B;

    I started reading it, but the combat annoyed me too much, too unrealistic even though it's sort of trying to be. The author is trying to do it, but he doesn't understand enough to pull it off. Dropped / paused it at chapter 3. Don't know if I'll get back to it anymore though.
    ```

    - u/FormerlySarsaparilla:

      It's got a very anime style of combat. Arrogant villain shows up, finds a million reasons *not* to just take care of business, an ever-growing roster of heros shows up, gets obliterated one by one. The main character musters his gumption and does something minor but clever which leaves the villain open for the final *real* hero who then actually defeats them.

      Unfortunately he repeats this trope so many times that it becomes a little comical, and he never kills any of the villains or heroes so they just begin piling up and the story sags under the weight of a million high-powered characters with unspoken agendas.

    Worth the Candle might be literally the only good litrpg story.  Arcane Ascension gets credit because it's readable but that really just says something about how bad the rest of the genre is.

      WTC is wonderful. It may not be high literature, but it is the highlight of my day whenever a new set of chapters is published. It's a better D&D story than anything ever published under the D&D brand, that's for sure.

        I didn't like Threadbare that much. It's competently written, the main character is not a Beary Stu, but that's about it. I really think it only looks good in comparison to the average litRPG.

        Plot kept getting slightly comedic when it should be getting real, and characters were *really* generic outside of the MC. Extremely unambitious story, I can see the appeal the same way I see the appeal of xianxia, but I can't see myself reading it to the end.

  **Request**   *(I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8wb5nt/d_monthly_recommendation_thread/e1v2oka/?context=0) 6 months ago with minimal luck)*

  &nbsp;

  I'm looking for stories which are **grimdark** and/or have very **gray morality** and/or have **villains** as the **protagonist**, while also having **smart/driven main characters**.

  &nbsp;

  A few varied (but limited) examples:

  * [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) (although all of Wildbow's work probably counts)

  * [Ruthless](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/) (one of the best HP fanfics I've read - smart and depressing)

  * [Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/)

  * [Metropolitan Man](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man)

  * [The Dark Wizard of Donkerk](http://alexanderwales.com/darkWizardNaNo2015.html)

  * [Superman: Red Son](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154798.Superman)

  * [How To Succeed in Evil](https://www.goodreads.com/series/83726-how-to-succeed-in-evil)

  * [Neil Gaiman's Snow, Glass, Apples](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12917233-snow-glass-apples)

  * [The Dire Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/series/179186-the-dire-saga) (Though I stopped reading after book 3)

  * [The End of the F***ing World ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6257970/)
  * [Death Note]
  (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0877057/)

  &nbsp;

  Things that fit on paper but I didn't care for as much:

  I've also tried a few asian translated novels like [Warlock of the Magus World](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world) but (possibly mainly because of the translation) to me they read like written by stereotypical overly excited 13 year old gamers though some of the concepts seem great at first. So maybe there's something that can sate my thirst there, although I am starting to doubt it.
  I also tried [The First Law](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11706669-the-first-law-trilogy), and [The Engineer Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202544.Devices_and_Desires) based on reccomendations when I asked last time but they didn't care for it.
  [Saga of Tanya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saga_of_Tanya_the_Evil) was also reccomended, but at least the anime didn't hold my attention for too long. 
  [Goblin Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_Slayer) I liked a bit more but it abandons most of what makes it interesting episode by episode.

  &nbsp;

  I guess things like Breaking Bad, Blackadder, American Psycho etc. mostly count, too so if I find something else in that direction, I'll be okay with it.

  Edit: A lot of promising responses so far. I'll make another post like this one including them after 6 more months.

    Have you tried [The Prince of Nothing series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40519-the-prince-of-nothing)? It  seems to fit your requirements exactly. It was my favourite series for years, I actually got turned off of it because the sequel series was *too grimdark*, hah. 

    ✓✓✓grimdark   
    ✓✓✓gray morality   
    ✓✓✓villains as the protagonist   
    ✓✓✓(✓)smart/driven main characters   


    -----------------

    I assume you know of [The Chronicles of the Black Company](https://www.goodreads.com/series/233453-the-books-of-the-north)? Their highest ideal is to fullfill their contract faithfully, regardless of how  evil their employer is. Very groundbreaking for its time. The first two books especially seems to fit your requirement to a T. After that they vacillate between doing good and evil. 

    ✓✓grimdark   
    ✓gray morality   
    ✓villains as the protagonist   
    ✓✓smart/driven main characters   

    -----------------

    How about [Malazan](https://www.goodreads.com/series/43493-malazan-book-of-the-fallen)? It's an unmatched achievement in worldbuilding and it certainly qualifies as grimdark.  It demonstrates how exquisite worldbuilding and a long running narrative can elevate storytelling immensely. It's truly unlike any other series before or since.



    ✓✓grimdark   
    ✓✓gray morality   
    ✓✓villains as the protagonist(s)   
    ✓✓✓smart/driven main characters   

    -----------------

    [The Broken Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/series/64473-the-broken-empire) series may also apply. Not my favourite(too edgy), but it has a lot of partisans, so maybe it's just me. The author has two other series which I liked better, but they are not as fitting.

    ✓gray morality

      I've read some of it a decade ago. Not sure why I stopped it - as far as I remember Kellhus was a pretty solid character. I might look at it again.

      > The Chronicles of the Black Company

      Not the first time I've seen the recommendation and I can't recall actually starting it, so I'll definitely give it a shot.

      I tried reading this, but at least in the beginning the book seems to have a bad case of "tell, don't show" with regards to the main character. Everybody always tells you how charismatic Kellhus is supposed to be. The narration is really heavy handed about this point, without ever *showing* the character doing anything compelling. Does this ever get better?

      - u/kraryal:
        ```
        Yes; later on Kellhus is shown using the charisma, and sometimes failing in nicely detailed ways. I'd say he lives up to the telling, but I did find the series too grimdark to finish.

    Sopranos. Life of a mafia man who becomes a boss. 

    &#x200B;

    The Wire. Story with drug dealers and cops as POVs.

    &#x200B;

    Deadwood. Small town in 1800s following relevant people, some of them evil.

    &#x200B;

    The thing is, these type of stories aren't popular with most people so they are rare. It's also difficult to keep them interesting, either the MC succeeds and it get's boring and ends, or he fails and dies / goes to jail and the story ends. 

    &#x200B;

    There's a solo D&D series on youtube, 'Dicing with Death', most of the mcs are evil and they've had many. That's exactly what you see there. Most of the time the MC dies, sometimes they succeed and they have to put the series aside because it becomes a timeskip, self indulgent, "boring" story about a powerful character that will never die, slowly and patiently gaining more political power. Which as you can imagine is not the type of thing people want to do when playing D&D.

    &#x200B;

    Frankly I'd like to see them run with it, but they won't =/

    &#x200B;

    (it also kind of breaks their universe because they have different series set in the same world, with characters that can interact with each other, so you can't have one character going 1 year into the future while the player in the other series doesn't).

    A Song of Ice and Fire(Game of Thrones) I think is the best possible answer, nearly every character is morally gray and it's an all around excellent series. 

    Doctor Horrible's Sing Along Vlog is good, it's only about an hour long and is free.

    Code Geass is a classic anime that I think is pretty gray.

    [https://www.fimfiction.net/story/87619/biblical-monsters](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/87619/biblical-monsters) is a 10 000 word MLP fanfic that I think would count. The only MLP knowledge you really need is that Celestia is a white pony who's the semi-divine Princess of the ponies.

    [Split Second](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/242635/split-second) is another MLP fanfic that I think counts. It's been a while since I read it and I think it does require more MLP knowledge, so if you don't like MLP I wouldn't recommend it. But if you do like MLP it's pretty good.

    The Witcher book series might work. I don't think the protagonist is that gray personally, but might be worth a shot.

      **POTENTIAL GoT SPOILERS BELLOW**

      So, I tried GoT when it first came out but was sick at the time which made me not care for it (or anything). Some time passed, and I got spoiled too much over the years with hearing names of characters who die (the fanbase seems very bad with avoiding spoilers).
      Still, I always approvingly thought that at least it is neat that the pop-fantasy work of this generation is gray, with complex characters, no goody two shoes protagonist etc. Then at some point I saw a few episodes with friends and was deeply disappointed that they centered around a dude that was an obviously Lawful Good MC, possibly a polished Aragorn - Jon Snow. Since then I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.

      >Code Geass

      Yup, enjoyed it when I watched it as a kid.


      Edit: I just googled Jon Snow and apparently his real name is Aegon, which I didn't know. Is he for real supposed to actually be a knock-off Aragorn!? My (apparently undeserved) respect for this work has lowered again.
      ```

      - u/tjhance:
        ```
        I dunno if Aegon is meant to resemble Aragorn, but FWIW Jon is a bit more ruthlessly pragmatic in the books. For example, he >!forces a mother to swap her kid to protect another kid.!< Still, he's a good guy. Most of the story is him being like "um guys can we stop fighting amongst ourselves and worry about the ice zombies that are going to kill us?"

        (The show, for the most part, has done its best to strip down and simplify the characters, or make them not resemble their book counterparts at all.)

        I've never actually seen the show, just the books, and it's not at all what you described in the books at least. The series does not revolve around any one character, they are probably about a dozen characters it rotates POV between. In fact, the fourth and fifth books happen simultaneously, just from the perspectives of about 6 characters each. There are a few protagonists who are pretty lawful good, but they still have to kill people, lie, and make moral compromises. And the other POV characters like Arya Stark and Cersei Lannister are a lot worse morally speaking, probably leaning closer to evil than good.

    I've read a substantial amount of translated asian novels and this one was a breath of fresh air. 

    Pros:

    2) Characters behave as people, and act in their best interest. This is supremely rare in translated novels.

  I've been reading *The First Law* recently, and it's quite good. I assume most people here have heard of it before, but if you haven't it's a dark fantasy deconstruction of traditional fantasy tropes. The mysterious wizard is a bitter old man who's manipulating everyone, the dashing nobleman is a stuck up asshole, and the grand quest ends in failure. I enjoy it, though I do find myself hoping the author eventually writes a series set during the Old Time which tells the story of the conflicts of Euz and his sons in more detail.

  Speaking of that, does anyone know of a good fantasy series like that? Something set in the early age of a traditional LotR-esque setting, before magic started fading. Ideally trilogy-ish length.

  I also just finished *Raven Stratagem*. It was every bit as good as *Ninefox Gambit*, and I recommend the series highly. The setting is fascinating, and the author does a good job creating the appearance of rules without getting bogged down in the details. This sub in particular will probably appreciate that the heroes win by manipulating the rules, rather than simply overpowering their enemies.

    That trilogy is great, but I ended up liking Abercrombie's other books set in that world a lot more. Particularly [Best Served Cold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2315892.Best_Served_Cold) and [The Heroes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9300768-the-heroes). The first is a kick-ass revenge story, and the second is a realistic portrayal of a medieval/viking battle, told from multiple PoVs, from veterans to bright- eyed raw recruits to civilians just trying to survive. 

    Both are stand alone novels set in the same world as The First Law trilogy, and both have characters from that trilogy making the occasional cameo.

  Not exactly rational per se.. but I always was a fan of [Choose Your Adventure](https://www.choiceofgames.com/category/our-games/) type stories. It's interesting to be able to see a story from different angles, take different approaches for the characters.. My personal favourite of the lot is [Choice of Vampire](https://www.choiceofgames.com/vampire/) and maybe [Affairs of the court](https://www.choiceofgames.com/romance/).

    I'd also recommend Tin Star, which is a large and well-written Choice of Games game with a Western theme:

    So far (just reached the point after my first love, Clotho, dies) I'm not impressed. Witcher (Witcher 3 and Thronebreaker) quests are better. I feel too many choices are presented, making each choice less impactful. Also it does feel railroadish, I believe Clotho dies whatever I decide to do.

    What a strange coincidence, I have also been playing a bunch of games from this publisher recently.

  I am really into self-insert fanfiction but I kind of shot myself in the foot getting into this niche genre of fanfiction because self-insert fanfiction has all the irrational qualities that people in this subreddit strove to stay away from. Self-insert fanfiction has a frequent tendency to delve into wish-fulfillment, harems, fix-it gary stus and mary sues, highly irrational power ups, and my least favorite quality of them all, eclipsing the main character role from the original main character. 

  Does anyone have some self insert fanfiction to recommend that focuses on the realities of being cosmically kidnapped to a magically inclined foriegn universe? A focal point on survival and acquiring power to do so in a rational manner with the semi omniscient knowldege they have in the world they are in?

    I've been on this same kick for the last month so if you have anything to recommend, I'm all ears. Here are the incomplete fanfictions I've enjoyed enough to set alerts to. I'll try to remember some of the complete ones I enjoyed, but I don't think there were all that many:


    Bleach, pre-canon. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10572048/1/Walk-Two-Lifetimes

    One Piece. https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12187990/1/Tell-it-to-the-Marines

    Harry Potter

    This is me being relatively picky, too. I'd say I dropped about 4 in 5 of the SIs I've tried.


    Edit: looks like a few of these aren't SIs, sorry about that. If you like my tastes, though, I can post the other pics I've enjoyed.

      Double Rec [Hear the Silence](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896). Lizard Brain is great too.

      Some day I'm going to make a list of all the SIs I've read. Hear the Silence is the best of all the Naruto ones.

      I really liked that Bleach one, thanks. Can't believe I read it in less than 2 days.

        Right?! Such a cliffhanger, though...

    so one obvious rec is [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126), which is highly popular around here. It is actually self-insert *original* fiction - not fanfic - but checks all of your other boxes. (apologies if you've seen this one and just didn't count it cause it's not fanfic)

    realities of being cosmically kidnapped to a magically inclined foriegn universe - check

    A focal point on survival and acquiring power to do so - check

    semi omniscient knowldege they have in the world they are in - check

    rational protagonists - check

    You've probably read this one, but I'm case not, check out [With this ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/). It's a self insert Young Justice fic where the MC gets an orange power ring. It's pretty well written, especially if you don't mind some of the authors stylistic idiosyncracies, and it updates literally every day (he switched forums when he got a temp ban rather than missing a day once).

  Can I sell anyone here on giving Brandon Sandersons new book [Skyward](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36642458-skyward) a try? 

  It's Sandersons second take on a YA novel and this time it actually feels like a YA novel. The basic summary is that it is about a hotheaded girl whose family is at the bottom of the social ladder (because her father deserted during a major battle) and yet wants to become a fighter pilot, which is roughly the highest status job in the highly militarized sci-fi/post-apocalyptic society she lives in. 

  It is also about a million times better than it has any right to be given that summary. I don't know if I would quite call it rational fiction, it's rational in the sense that the characters are acting according to their own incentives and biases, but the main character is not particularly smart and lot of the plot revolves around her working around the biases of other people as well as her own. It _is_, however, a story with fleshed out characters and a coherent world that somehow still manages to be extremely tightly written.

  **For the people that stopped reading at the words Brandon Sanderson**: This book manages to get around one of the major criticism that I have about him, namely that the first half of a lot of his book is dreadfully slow. Skyward has a very brief introduction into the world and the characters after which the pace kicks up and it just kinda keeps on going at full speed right up until the end.

  **For the people that stopped reading at the word YA**: Yeah ok, maybe give this one a pass. Skyward is incredibly good, but unlike Sandersons other YA series this one (despite all the high tech dogfighting and deconstruction of militaristic societies) _is_ at its heart clearly about a teenager trying to figure out her place in the world and that's obviously not everyone's cup of tea.

    Which series are you referring to as the 'other YA series'? My recollection is that almost half of Sanderson's books could be broadly classified as YA.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The reckoners is his only other series marketed at young adults. Though you can argue that the others would appeal to young adults.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        The Alcatraz series is YA, isn't it?

        Edit: Wikipedia calls it "juvenille fiction", but then calls it young adult within the body of the article.

    Honestly I found her incredibly annoying from the start. I was actually chearing for jerkface. I understood that the persona she presents was a coping mechanism but that did nothing to stop it from annoying me.

    When I went to his signing Sanderson called it his dragon egg story. It's an amusing and apt description imo. The actual dog fighting is pretty interesting though, short use recharging inertial dampners used in planes are an interesting idea. The powers reminded me of Gundam newtypes.

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      >Honestly I found her incredibly annoying from the start. 

      Yeah, I suppose that's fair. I usually also get annoyed by characters like this, but for some reason I found Spensa to be much less annoying than, for instance, Lift. 

      >I was actually chearing for jerkface.

      Well, so was I, but that was because >!I saw his redemption arc coming right from the start.!<
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        Thanks for the rec, read and liked. Yeah, Spensa was a bit annoying but I think the fact that the higher ups were actually out to get her made it a bit easier to emphasise.

        All in all a pretty good read, if a bit simplistic.

  Request: Can anyone recommend me *good* crossover fanfics. 'Good' here meaning by the standards of people who came to this subreddit because they were fed up with the certain type of bad plot and characterization that rationalfic writers try to avoid. So no crackfic please, no matter how hilarious.

  If I get to make more specific wishes, what I'd love to read is a story where one or more (can also be many more) *intelligent* characters from a technologically less developed world (anything before widespread industrialization) find themselves in a more modern world (somewhere between industrialization and modern age equivalent or at least near future sci-fi). If back and forth travel s possible that's also fine. Either setting can also be real world history, but doesn't have to be. Magic existing in one or both worlds is also fine. Really the main point is that the "inserted" character(s) move into the future as opposed to being SIs in the magical dark age, but that they are not dumb knights attacking "beasts" (cars) as they often do in those kinds of movies.

  So... Anything that applies to the first paragraph is welcome. Anything that hits the second would be extra awesome.

    [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/) I found good, though admittedly I dropped it back when it went through a long hiatus. AFAIK it is updating again, but I haven't caught up.

    [To The Stars](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars) - Not really a crossover, but I think it fits the spirit of your request. It takes this anime that is itself a deconstruction of the "Magical Girl" genre and makes it into a far future transhumanist military hard scifi. Basically, humanity's government goes on to use the magical girls' physics defying powers to first explore and colonize the galaxy, and then to fight an interstellar war of extinction against a technologically superior Alien species. Great stuff, and some of the authors writings on the philosophy and musings of morality of transhumanism and its politics are honestly better than a lot of professional scifi that I read. The worldbuilding is fantastic. I think you can get by without having watched the show if you read the plot on the wikipedia page.  


    [Harry Potter and the Natural 20 [DnD/Harry Potter]](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20) - This one is recommended here a lot because it's rational, hilarious, and legitimately great. It fits the first requirement that you mentioned, and a bit of the second, at times. 

    [Playing with Lego's \[Worm/SupCom\]](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/playing-with-legos-worm-supcom.377328/) - good and completed! This author is a great writer and he has a bunch of other stories, mostly crossovers. Mostly fits your first requirement.

    [Mass Effect/Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/mass-effect-sid-meiers-alpha-centauri.221597/) parody - This started as a jokey thread, without even a proper name, and now it's over 100k words. first requirement

    I recently read These Games We Play by Ryuugi, an RWBY/Gamer cross. I haven't watched RWBY at all, and I'm pretty sure that the majority of the worldbuilding and twists are non-canon compliant, so you won't be missing much. It's a really well-written power fantasy with a compelling plot and enemies that don't just let the protagonist walk over them, obstacles scaling with the main character's growth.

    The unreasonably fast development of the protagonist's skills as well as the scaling of enemies are justified pretty well in-story, both because of the fundamental premise of RWBY and also other reasons that become revealed as you read on. The nature of the Gamer part of the story isn't handwaved away or presented as an OOC phenomenon—Ryuugi manages to explain everything seamlessly within the the setting.

    I'm not sure it's rational, but it's close enough to count, given the inherently unphysical nature of the Gamer.

  *Request*: Good comic books

  I am looking for any good comic books as long as it is action/sci-fi/fantasy/superhero in some way. Not really looking for rational stories (doubt there is much out there) just ones that don't into the usual cliches and don't have dumb-when-it's-convenient characters. Basically stuff that /r/rational might like. But even trying to pick from what's considered the best my success rate is mixed.

  What I've read so far (sry for the wall of text):

  *Black Hammer*: Good characters and deconstruction of archetypes, will keep reading.

  *The Sandman*: It's too much of a scatterbrain series with some good ideas and some more poor ones and it really tries not to have a main plot. I liked the Nada and Lucifer storylines but not much of the rest of the cast.

  *Watchmen*: Liked it for all the usual reasons: great engaging plot, great characters and themes. Doubt there is much else like it.

  *All Star Superman*: Overall a decent series but it has the reputation for being one of the best and "true to character" Superman stories so I ended up being underwhelmed.

  *X-Men by Chris Claremont*: I read the Dark Phoenix Saga some years back and I wasn't impressed. Recently restarted from Uncanny X-Men #94 but I find it too cheesy. Is it worth continuing?

  *X-Men Age of Apocalypse*: I quite liked the issues focused on Cyclops and the Four Horsemen but most other cross-overs were very poor quality (and there where a lot of them).

  *New X-Men by Grant Morrison*: I really liked the characters of Emma Frost and Xorn but the U-Men and the new teens were so mediocre.

  *Astonishing X-Men by Joss Whedon*: Absolutely great stuff in every way: characters, art, dialogue and a plot that's unpredictable but not off the charts crazy. Best X-Men story I've read *by far*.

  *X-Men House of M/Messiah Complex/Second Coming*: House of M was good but the followup was a very average storyline that's forgettable. It seems to me I should avoid cross-overs.

  *Uncanny X-Force by Rick Remender*: gorgeous art and a good team-up but the actual storylines were so-so. Ended up dropping it in the Otherworld arc which was terrible.

  Some things I have problems with:

  1. The villains are too often... cartoony and evil for evil's sake. I thought superhero comics are now aimed at an adult audience and were supposed to have better antagonists than MCU/DCEU?

  2. Action seems too chaotic. Like if there are 5+ characters fighting I really lose focus of the action and it all seems a mess. Do I get better at reading action over time or what?
