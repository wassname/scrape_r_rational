  Lol.

  They forgot a rule or two.

  Rule 11: Thou shall not continue the debate after there are no supporting arguments left to make that have not already been stated clearly. (don't waste others' time)

  Rule 12: Thou shall clearly state your arguments as coherent, comprehensible, specific, testable hypotheses. (must be falsifiable to be debatable)

  It seems unlikely that they'd be able to come up with ALL the rules of rational debate AND that they just happen to be the same number of rules as the bible's ten commandments? I think whoever wrote this might have stopped looking for possible rules of rational debate the moment they reached ten.

  I think it would have been better to have some "thou **shalt**s" in there as well / instead. For example instead of #2 "thou shalt not straw man" I would have had "thou shalt steel man".

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  Rule 0: Your goal is not to modify your opponent's beliefs to match your own. Your goal is not to modify both of your beliefs to match each other. You goal is to modify your beliefs to match the world. Only then can you modify the world to match your desires.

  I take issue with #3 (and the fact that this is an image and not text, but that's another battle).

  > Thou shalt not use small numbers to represent the whole.

  Given proper statistical constraints, it is perfectly reasonable to use small numbers to represent the whole.

  > 6: Thou shalt not reduce the argument down to two possibilities.

  Of any coherent proposition, you can say it is either true or false. There are no exceptions to that rule.

  You will **not** disallow the use of the law of the excluded middle in argument, for that is deranged.

    ```
    Obviously, that is excluded from the fallacy of false dichotomy. But a discussion usually isn't about wether something is true or false. In those cases there may be 2 options or there may be more.

    Rather than reduce the argument to 2 possibilities, I would say that you shouldn't state/think/defend a position must be accepted as true just because an incompatible one is accepted as false.
