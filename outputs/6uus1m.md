  ```
  Is...is time the only thing we're allowed to communicate?  Will the Gods Beyond Time, Fluffy Be Their Name smite me down if My future-me communicates with present-me?

  Or are we actually discussing how cool it would be to use *time travel as a watch*. 

  Edit: Is our traveling limited to colloquially recognized units of time?  If so, what's the limit? You said hours, what about minutes? Seconds? Could I flood the room with me-copies? How long can I stay in the future for? Is this a license to make infinite clones of myself? How far into the future can I go?

  So many questions...

  Edit':  FF? Is this a fanfic of something? Is there supposed to be a link?
