  So if I'm understanding this correctly, Aang went into a coma in his world, was reincarnated in the real world, lived a full life, and "died", then Angelina recessitated him only after his "soul" or whatever it is exactly that carries Avatar-ness had already been re-reincarnated back in his home universe. Presumably that was the prerequisite for joining their organization that Arthur had been missing earlier, they needed him to die, if only temporarily, so that his Avatar soul could find its way back to the Avatar universe and maintain the cycle. Presumably Angelina is also a former Avatar, that's the only thing I can think of that makes sense with her Earthbending combined with the comments "so he really does take after you" and "how many were there" (presumably how many cycles). I guess this must be something that happens to every Avatar at some point in their life.

  All of that is speculation of course, I'm sure this will be an ongoing mystery.

  Back in the actual Avatar world, I'm curious how well Aang will be able to deal with the challenges he faced in canon, assuming he'll be facing most of the same problems. He's far less competent at Air-bending than his canon self it seems. He has the muscle memory and reflexes, but he's badly out of practiced and failed to air bend at all when he tried to do so intentionally. On the other side of that, he has a lot more life experience, a knowledge of slightly pre-modern science and technology, and according to Angelina some degree of ability to subconsciously use his previous lives for parallel processing although this ability isn't well defined just yet. Realistically, that's a fantastic trade for being slightly out of practice at hitting people with a stick. Pragmatically, hitting people with a stick is something that comes in very handy when the main obstacle directly in front of you happens to be violent conflict. I can see how this version of Aang will need to be much more creative about how to approach situations that the canon Aang could simply bulldoze with superior kung-fu magic. I don't think he could escape from trained guards while tied up or out-match Zuko well enough to escape as he is now, for example.
