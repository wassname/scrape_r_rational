  Using mindscrape to instantly fix our protagonist's little trauma felt like a bit of a copout, but eh. Just a tiny bit. It *was* getting annoying.

  I wonder what the Ice Assafins were trying to do with the ritual, given that they're on the side of the fleshbags. Why would they need power over Herun, what would/will they do with it that fleshies wouldn't?

  Anyway, neat chapter.

      Yeah, I don't think *anyone* was fooled into thinking that Ice Afi didn't cause mental damage of some kind.

  Yay, I called part of it!

  I was expecting them to take a bit longer to learn that Loki was working with Afi, but dramatic irony on that scale is hard to get right.

  They have to apply the *permanency* before the bond wears off, right? It lasts 10 minutes per caster level, so... yeah it's probably gonna be up for a few days or something ridiculous like that. Still, the Gods will know about the Bond if they see Jake permanencing it, won't they?

  The only workaround I can see is to try and slip the trigger words naturally into conversation. "We really need un-eavesdroppable communication with our soldiers in the field. How many *Permanencio Telepathic Bond*s can we rustle up?" Or just say it really quietly; if the scrying port is far away from Jake's mouth, they won't hear him if he whispers, right?
