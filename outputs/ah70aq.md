  Bringing it out here to finally end our dumb debate of the month.

    Mate if you think we can't pick that apart and use it to justify whatever damn theory we want, then you haven't been paying attention.

      ```
      Yes, yes, a fearsome thought police enforcing their makers' eldritch will with an iron beak. Scary.

  I had some fairly strong reservations about the Drow arc but i'm really liking the direction this Book is heading. The author of the Malazan series has a term he uses to describe the showdowns at the ends of his novels where his 20 odd POV characters end up together in one huge conflict - 'Convergence'. 

  "*Convergence. Power ever draws other power*"

  That's what it feels like we're heading towards. It's going to be great seeing all these disparate characters we've slowly become invested in all interact with each other. The Tyrant is one of my very favourite characters and seeing Cat (hopefully) interact with him should be hilarious, seeing how the Heroes react to !reformed Akua should be interesting and you just know the Bard will be involved in a conflict of this scale. I think we're going to get a lot of payoff in the not too distant future.

    ```
    Looking forward to the Uncivil Wars. Are these the uncivil wars?
    ```

    - u/-main:
      ```
      Has been since the Liesse uprising in book two. We've already had a Free Cities civil war, the Arcadian war, and a minor rebellion crushed in Praes. Plenty of impolite civil war already. Now the grand alliance is gonna implode as well.
      ```

      - u/Rice_22:
        ```
        Oh. I guess the Arcadian War could be considered a Civil War too, I suppose.
        ```

    - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
      ```
      Yup. We're probably coming towards the end of them now though.

  > I wasn’t truly beholden to the Sisters in any way that could be considered vassalage – that would have rather defeated the point of what I was supposed to be to them – but it remained a fact I’d thrown Winter under the horse and been handed a direct tap to what had become of the Night afterwards. 

  Fucking finally.

  Still less then half the info we need, but it's the important stuff and will do for now.

    ```
    Need for what?
    ```

    - u/AntiChri5:
      ```
      To actually understand the, as Akua put it, "Metaphysical implications".
      ```

      - u/Jangri-:
        ```
        I don't think we neccessarily *need* to understand the implications, and I think the auther is keeping it vague on purpose. Like right after explaining that she isn't a vassal, he refferences that her purpose isn't known yet to us.
        ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    ... I think you're taking this a *little* too seriously.
    ```
