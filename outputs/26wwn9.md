## Fun/humor - I put an AI-in-a-box style genie game in a role playing subreddit, just to see what people would do. Not rationalist per se, but uses the tropes.

  I'm mostly just going for "fun" rather than "educational" with the genie's behavior, but so far a surprising number of people have (accidentally or not) gone with the strategy of making a wish which modifies the Genie's utility function so that it *wants* to be nice, rather than actually specifying a wish. 

  The rest end up destroying everything, except where dumb luck prevails. One person tried to banish the genie into nothingness but accidentally created an afterlife instead. Only one wire-head, but he seems to be okay with this.

    Aaaand the first arrival from /r/rational manages to essentially [turn their own body into a living genie-lamp](http://www.reddit.com/r/YouEnterADungeon/comments/26u3u5/you_get_as_many_wishes_as_you_want/chvd0rv) :P

      Ah, the Jafar maneuver... Seems risky given what happened in the original case.

        I used the phrase 'without bindings or restrictions of any sort' as an attempt to head that off, as well as saying to transfer the power rather than simply give me the power, so I was not immediately turned into a paperclip when the other genie escaped or continued the wish process. 

        Unfortunately, I've still been ripped off because I forgot to include a method of controlling the capabilities, and I made a fairly incompetent attempt to do that before thinking of about 5 other solutions that would not have a chance of destroying me or not working.

  This is a nice metaphor for the problem, and I appreciate that you are making it into something fun and interesting to people. I enjoyed reading your responses. Well done!

  I wish for paperclips. Lots of paperclips.
