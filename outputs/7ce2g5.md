  I'm gonna be honest, I had to stop reading here and wait to finish cackling before I could keep going.  The best injokes are always the ones nobody else gets.

      Nope, it was just the Team Rocket reference.  I'm a simple man, and simple things amuse me.  The 'injokes nobody else gets' bit was in reference to Joon - in his position, I'd probably be cracking the same kind of jokes.

  Fellis gave themselves a portmanteau. I squee from cute.

   Also, they are working the unspoken plan guarantee. Did Arthur recap tvtropes, or did they just deduce it from first principles?  

  Lets see, what else might be in motion our protagonist is blissfully unaware of? Well, Fenn talked to the prison. She might have ratted out the soul-mage just to escalate that side of things into overt hostilities? After all, the copies are *not* who the prison thinks they are.. 

  Hm. Most Plausible backfire: The prison decides the overwritten are neither the soul-mage nor the criminals they once were, and lets them go. That.. is not the very worst outcome tough, since it saves them from having to fight the lot of them.

  Since the author has already filled his "one submission per week" this week, I figured that I could put this up on r/rational for him.

  It is my opinion that Worth the Candle is an excellent example of rational fiction... cheers, cthulhuraejepsen!

    Huh, that rule is kinda annoying for me in this instance since there's not a central comment chain for typos that automatically notifies the author. I suppose I can just type the user name to notify /u/cthulhuraejepsen of the following typo:

    >If we’d been in a normal building, we might have had an easier time finding out way to the gymnasium

    out way -> out the way [or] our way

  Man, that exchange at the end of the chapter made me think. Imagine a version of this story where Juniper was a softie DM.

  Wrong chapter titles?

  Okay, I just spent basically 2 entire days binging on this story. No regrets! This is the meta, world-building and character-driven role-playing tale I didn't know I needed in my life. I especially find everything related to the world-building to be incredible, I am not sure whether it's actually based on tabletop campaigns but it certainly feels that way. In fact, the campaign flashbacks and how they are inserted in the narrative are among my favorite aspects of the story, which also manages to be emotional and rational at the same time. It's been a wild ride so far and I can't wait to find out how it goes on, although I'll certainly miss the binge!

  Was there a game system message given after shooting the giant suit of armour? 

  I don't see one. Might have been a decoy or the void arrows fired by someone else don't count as defeating it for the purposes of XP?
  ```

  - u/arunciblespoon:
    ```
    Or maybe the giant suit of armour was just a suit of armour...
