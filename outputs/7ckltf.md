## A few recent SCPs

### Post:

[SCP-3159, entitled The Trashiest World in the Multiverse](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3159). Features a transcript from a parallel-universe Jerry Springer. On the lighter side for an SCP. Basically an attempt on my part to crystallize some of what's unsettling about daytime TV.

[SCP-3171, entitled When the Bell Tolls](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3192). A clock that tells you the time of your death. Partly based on suggestions people gave me in one of the munchkinry threads here. A little long. 

A failed SCP entitled [Statistical Significance](http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/167426702262/statistical-significance). This one features only real-world facts, accurately described. Most people on the site hated it, complaining it was too densely written.

  Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it almost looks like SCP-3285-004 and SCP-3285-005 are the votes that happened on 1/7/2015 and 9/20/2017.

  Nice writing.

  I don't like Statistical Significance because SCP's shouldn't be mundane. I really like When the Bell Tolls.

    ```
    I like it as a thought, but it really doesn't work within the context of the SCP Foundation.  Surely the Foundation has numerous ways to prevent a threat so mundane as nuclear war.

  Too smart for the SCP wiki, eh?
