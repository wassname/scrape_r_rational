  Most popular characters have an implicit rule preventing the use of their abilities for major personal gain: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless

      > Seven dragonballs to grant a wish? Why is Earth/Namek only being attacked NOW?

      Believe it or not, this is actually explained in-story; the only reason the existence of the dragon balls is leaked out to the universe at large is because Raditz kept his communicator on when Krillin, Bulma etc. were talking about them after Goku died. Earth apparently had no aliens heading there before Raditz who weren't too young to remember anything different and Namek apparently kept their secret really well.
      ```

      - u/Terkala:
        ```
        Namekians were shown refusing to answer trivial questions about the dragonball while their entire village was in the process of being extrrminated.

        So thats also well backed up in canon.
        ```

- u/LiteralHeadCannon:
  ```
  In rational fiction, these implicit rules should either be discarded or explicitly brought up and explained.
  ```

  - u/CuriousBlueAbra:
    ```
    Of course, but they're often so ingrained in the characters it's rare to see them until you really sit down and think about it. I wanted to make a thread dedicated to that element, noting the weird meaningless restricts characters obey beyond the traditional "No immortality", "No ambition", etc. etc.

    So another example might be the implicit rule *everyone* in the X-men unvierse has that the mutant issue can only be addressed monolithically. The guy whose entire power is growing spikes is utterly irrelevant in the discussion about what to do with the kind of person whose brainfarts can exterminate mankind. Yet they're always lumped in together like it's the same category of problem.

      Sometimes, it only becomes clear after you think "If there was a *completely different* character starting from scratch with the same powers/resources/setup, who thought about things rationally, what might they do with those resources?" It can help with not subconsciously filtering the resulting answers so they fit the personality/MO/backstory of the canon character.

      (It can also help to cycle a number of previously existing characters, including ones who tend to use resources to hand in unexpected ways, through the starting position. The result may not be comprehensive, but it can often generate a larger starting set of ideas and lead to some interesting directions of thought.)

  Voldemort:  one plot per year, to coincide with the end of the year.  No mind magic.  No competent followers.  No contact with or inspiration from muggles whatsoever.
  ```

  - u/noggin-scratcher:
    ```
    > No mind magic.

    Which is kind of weird given all the talk about how lots of people were under an Imperius in the first war.
    ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:
      ```
      Yet somehow this highly effective strategy is abandoned the second time around - aside from maybe the Minister, but that's tactical use rather than as a terror weapon.

      /wizards
      ```

      - u/sir_pirriplin:
        ```
        Malfoy tried to get the McGuffin in the fifth book by casting Imperius on a member of the Order. That's how they found out the McGuffin drives anyone who touches it crazy, except for the protagonists.
        ```

        - u/PeridexisErrant:
          ```
          Good point.

          Here's another Voldemort rule I thought of though:  "All conflict must be within the laws and customs of war".  This rules out terror campaigns, most attacks on neutral civilians, certain classes of weapons and tactics... And it's almost always upheld in fiction, even by the worst (human) villains.
          ```

          - u/sir_pirriplin:
            ```
            That also happens, just off-screen.

            Supposedly, Dementors were feeding on muggles and "breeding" uncontrollably, and giants destroyed a bridge or something.

            Of course, we never get to *see* any of that stuff, but the Minister of Magic assures the Prime Minister that that's happening, and obliviators are working overtime.
            ```

            - u/gbear605:
              ```
              All of that is attacks against muggles however. I guess a better rule would be "All conflict **against wizards** must be within the laws and customs of war"
              ```

          - u/MugaSofer:
            ```
            Isn't torturing and killing civilians against the laws and customs of war? And weren't the Dark Mark attacks essentially terrorist in nature, even if they were often targeted at the enemy's allies?
            ```

    - u/pleasedothenerdful:
      ```
      > all the talk about how lots of people were under an Imperius in the first war.

      I always understood this as "Death Eaters just don't use mind magic, or at least not with any regularity or effectiveness, but 'I was Imperiused!' was the excuse all the rich, powerful, smart, good-looking, or upper-crust Death Eaters like Lord Malfoy used to dodge any consequences, while all the poor, dumb, or weird-looking rank-and-file Death Eaters like the Lestranges went to Azkaban, and everybody damn well knows it but what can you do."

      More of a two Magical Britains thing than an actual use of Imperius by Death Eaters thing.
      ```

      - u/noggin-scratcher:
        ```
        I'm sure I remember someone talking about "The dark days", and how terrible it was to not know who you could trust because they could be under Imperius... 

        Maybe Moody in the 4th film (can't remember if the same scene occurs in the book) when he was demonstrating the Unforgivables to the class, although saying that he would have been Barty Crouch Jr at the time so maybe not quite as reliable a source as if it had come from actual-Moody.
        ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    >No mind magic.

    I'm pretty sure there was mind magic in Deathly Hallows. They had a puppet Minister for a while, stuff like that.

    Also, *Imperius* was used extensively in Goblet of Fire, albeit mostly by proxies, and Voldemort broke an *Obliviate* in that book  -albeit using *Crucio*, which is ambiguously mind magic.
    ```

- u/ansible:
  ```
  I guess it depends on the version of Batman, but most of those rules have been broken at some time or another by 1990s movies Batman, Batman Beyond, etc.

  But yeah, I agree with /u/LiteralHeadCannon that these rules should have some reasoning behind them.

  > the Green Lantern has an implicit rule against creating any construct whose effect would be too brutal (no turning his enemy's brains to mush via razor wire up the nose, no blinding his enemies with retina-destroying brightness, no railgun constructs launching pebbles at mach 3 at the enemy's skull).

        Sounds like a possible existential risk to single planet organisms.

          No idea. He draws power from the 'speed force', allowing him to ignore all sorts of physical laws where they might be inconvenient. Little things like friction and momentum and there not being enough gravity to keep him on the ground and air particles hitting him in the face.

          If you want to figure out to get infinite power or destroy the world or time travel, I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard with that power. Wouldn't even need to think particularly hard.

  > Star Trek's Federation implicitly has a rule banning elective cybernetics 

  They also have rules about not deliberately "waking up" holodeck characters despite the fact that it happens all the time by accident.  Building self-aware robots is really hard, and they spend a lot of resources on trying to figure out why, but you can get the same result with a hand-sized "holo-emitter" and a bit of software.

  > and beaming enemy crews into space

  Can't beam through shields unless it's necessary for the plot.
  ```

  - u/IllusoryIntelligence:
    ```
    To be fair the federation actually has explicit rules regarding transhumanism. Doctor Bashir's storylines in DS9 sometimes involved his own illegally modified nature.  
    The federation taboo against transhumanism being decidedly irrational is a different matter, though not unrealistic given their last serious attempt at it almost ended in genocide.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      So the holodeck protocols that keep holodeck characters from being self-aware are kind of like the Butlerian Jihad?^* How disappointing.

      So, what about Data?

      ^* ^Now ^I ^want ^to ^see ^a ^good ^Federation/Culture ^crossover ^more ^than ^ever.
      ```

      - u/IllusoryIntelligence:
        ```
        Unfortunately Data has an much less rational story to him. His positronic brain is the irreproducible product of a lone genius who refuses to create more.
        ```

  - u/STL:
    ```
    In-universe, it's very likely that beaming an enemy crew into space the moment that their shields collapse would be considered a war crime. The Borg wouldn't be constrained by such petty morality, but they want more drones.
    ```

    - u/ArgentStonecutter:
      ```
      If you can beam them into space, you can beam them into the brig. Directly into sealed closed-cycle containment suits playing "Lost In Space" 24 hours a day. OH THE PAIN!
      ```

      - u/CuriousBlueAbra:
        ```
        My original plan was to beam their brain stems into space as a "more humane" alternative. Beaming them to the brig is a better idea.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          I don't understand why you have to beam them TO anywhere at all. You're shooting energy weapons at them to try to kill them. You're converting their matter into energy to transport them. Just hook the suck end of the transporter to the pew end of the phasers and shoot them with their own weaponized selves.
          ```

          - u/CuriousBlueAbra:
            ```
            Taking everything we're told about how transporters work literally, they give the Federation read write control of reality. They could become gods trivially.

            So I just sort of accept transporters don't really work like they say, and instead are a form of folding space or something. Though that's another implicit rule now that I think about it: Transporters are only ever for bulk movement of cargo or persons, not direct destruction or movement of subparts.
            ```

            - u/Evan_Th:
              ```
              Let's not forget the multiple episodes in TOS about transporters.  Kirk gets split into his evil and good selves, Kirk gets beamed into Feminist Expy's body, Scotty finally does beam the enemy into space at "maximum dispersion," but only when it's the ~~evil spirit~~ *ahem* incorporeal entity which possessed Jack the Ripper...
              ```

              - u/Quillwraith:
                ```
                That's an implicit rule of episodic fiction in general: the monster|MacGuffin|character|phenomenon of the week cannot be used or contacted later, no matter how relevant it may seem. 

                The degree to which the rule is followed is of course proportional to how episodic the story is - many stories will sometimes re-use plot devices, but not as often as would seem sensible from a rational in-story perspective.
                ```

    - u/clawclawbite:
      ```
      In space tactical terms, beaming is a slow process, and trying to hit an actively maneuvering target would take even longer to 'lock' on a target. An energy weapon attack is fast, and reliable.
      ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    Don't forget the explicit rule against genetic engineering, even research thereof. 

    And it seems to work about as well for them as the War on Drugs does. 

    It's cultural baggage from the Eugenics Wars for humans, but that doesn't explain why none of the other 150 races have a seperate opinion on it.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Klingons tried it, got mixed results.

      Ferengi deadlocked it by patenting everything.

      Romulans do use it, but can't get good results from it.

      Cardassians use it for weapons.

      Borg genetically engineer all their children, but don't change their assimilees. Your biological distinctiveness will be added to their own.

      Species 8472 is *made of* it, and has it under their conscious control.

  ```
  * The Flash cannot use weapons at superspeed; he must use solely his own body's *movement* at those speeds, even when it makes no sense (I'll vibrate through this wall!) Actually, this seems to apply to all speedsters; I have no idea why.
  * Superman can only use his superspeed for travel and, occasionally, preserving his secret identity or performing a mundane task faster. (Otherwise he'd make the Flash seem useless.) Nor can he use his heat vision at any appreciable range, despite possessing telescopic sight.
  * Wonder Woman has to block bullets and such with her bracers, because she was originally closer to a Batman-style "badass normal".
  * Nobody can ever use a sniper rifle, even when they're supposedly demonstrating the power of mundane technology/ingenuity. You can use a goddamn *nuke*, but not a sniper - it's unsporting to shoot someone in the back.
  * Science-based superheroes can't deliberately attempt to create other superheroes. No replicating freak lab accidents, no sharing powered armour with other people. Mundanes can *steal* your tech, or attempt to copy your origin; but if they become a hero, they'll never do it again to anyone else.
  * No using FTL drives for time travel, or even mentioning the possibility. The only exception I know about, surprisingly, is the original series of Star Trek (which was closer to technobabble anyway.)
  * If "Deals with the Devil" are a thing, nobody will ever use them for altruistic purposes. You can *summon* demons for altruistic purposes, sometimes, but the traditional Deal is a purely selfish thing.
  * Superheroes are not allowed to keep super-tech from the villains they beat. They can't even release them to the public, or something. Even when they were stolen! Even when they were stolen *from the superhero in question* (I'm thinking of Iron Man, here)!

    This, averted, is the premise of one of the stories I am gradually working on.


    >If "Deals with the Devil" are a thing, nobody will ever use them for altruistic purposes. You can summon demons for altruistic purposes, sometimes, but the traditional Deal is a purely selfish thing.

    Would the Devil accept an altruistic deal? Doing so seems counter to his goals.

    That happens in Polish legend about Mr. Twardowski. He asked devil for knowledge and magic powers, but then used them to help people. In one version of story thats what saves him from hell.

- u/E-o_o-3:
  ```
  The hero almost never calls upon cops, alerts the army, hauls in a scientist or two, or otherwise makes use of the various institutional forces that might majorly help them in their situation.

  The Federation explicitly has laws, albeit unclear ones, against human enhancement - this was a major plot point on DS9 at one point, and is usually strongly implied to be related to the Eugenics Wars.

  Green Lanterns are forbidden from killing; if you kill someone with a Green Lantern ring, it will immediately shut down. I haven't read it, but I've heard this restriction was removed during one plotline (Sinestro Corps War) and they began sniping people at superluminal distances and whatnot.

    If I recall correctly, Sinestro's aim with said war (or at least one of his aims) was specifically to drive the Corps to a point where the Oans would remove the restriction and thereby be more effective.

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  Green Lanterns' limitations stem from blocks put on the rings by the Guardians in order to prevent exactly those situations. Green Lanterns literally cannot kill their enemies or mess with their minds using their rings.
