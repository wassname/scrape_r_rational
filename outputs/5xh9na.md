## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have the ability to smell things before they happen. You cannot see the future, you can only experience future smells.

    Place bets on a football game, bet for team 1 if I smell orange, bet for team 2 if I smell watermelon. When the game ends, eat an orange if team 1 wins, or some watermelon if team 2 wins.

      Scent is an elaborate and distinct sense, so you could establish an entire language of such smells coded out with considerably variety and complexity. With a little work, and with smells that overlap well (sweet vs. acrid), you could establish a code for (in the football betting example) exactly how many points the team would win by, or what the score would be quarter-by-quarter... harder bets with higher payoffs.

      Get a capable enough code and you could find winners on the stock market. It wouldn't be a lot of work to say whether markets are trending up or down on the day, and which of (say) ten or twelve large caps will have the largest gains. A reliable +1% every business day is better in the long run than a big win. Over a year, that's a more than 1200% return, and with large caps you can become a billionaire in three years even paying day trader taxes.

        In the interest of avoiding confusion when your future self is having meals or walking near restaurants, etc., it might be a good idea to carry two perfumes with you. One to smell just prior to sending back important information, and another to smell when you're done or you want to be sure to avoid applying any interpretation to any upcoming smells.
        ```

        - u/Sparkwitch:
          ```
          Indeed, a lot of this depends on whether future smells come all at once or in discrete packets with mental timestamps.
          ```

    I always find it weird how people often seem to think that limited forms of precognition won't incur all the usual problems. Just make a code with ~26 different distinct smells and you have basically an antitelephone, then just clearly delineate the start and ends of messages and add timestamps within the message if it doesn't already come with them by default.                                    
    Then the obvious thing to do is to become filthy rich in stocks and start introducing future tech and science earlier in order to speed up tech development. Use your future knowledge to gain behind the scenes control of most major world leaders and accrued enough wealth to make Rockefeller blush. Once you've got enough influence do everything you can to deliberately stunt AI development and goal alignment so you can work on it exclusively for the as many decades as is manageable.                                 
    Of course none of this will ever actually be seen by you, since all you need is to follow the directions given to you from the future to quickly develop AI tech within a few years.

    Hahaha. I almost gave this power to one of the characters in my story.

  Suppose you're given access to a computer with infinite* processing power and memory, loaded with every programming language you can think of and any other (currently existing) programs that you want. What do you do with it?

  *As in, it can perform any finite computation instantly. Want to brute force a million RSA keys? Want to find every digit of Graham's number? Want to find every prime number less than or equal to Graham's number? All done the instant after it's started. (If you give it a literally infinite computation, like counting the sum of every natural number or something, it just hangs.)

    Some basics:

    Folding@home, Seti@home, etc, would all benefit. 

    Mine tons of bitcoin.

    Use newfound wealth to hire software developers.

    Attempt to solve the Stock Market, more protein folding, and stuff like that. 

    There is a backlog of supercomputer tasks for low-priority targets, like the [moving sofa problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_sofa_problem) that would be cool to solve.

    Bake an apple pie? In the long term I'd want to instantiate an arbitrarily large number of universes of limitless joy and flourishing, but would have to be careful e.g. in kicking off physics simulations because those could easily (and perhaps inevitably) lead to prodigious suffering, too.

    In the medium term I'd solve all the science.

    In the short term I'd do all the [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives) using my shitty, inefficient code! Muahaha!

      Thanks for linking that.  I'm browsing through the problems there, and it really seems that they have hidden depths that allow for both good (efficient, adaptable, simple) and bad (slow, specific, complex) solutions.

        They're a fun puzzle-y diversion that'll help to hone your math/programming skills. They do ramp up in difficulty as you go on (partly reflected by the # of people who have completed each), so while you might be able to solve the first few dozen in a handful of minutes your progress will definitely slow (unless you're a supergenius or something). The forums have lots of people posting and benchmarking their own solutions to each problem, too, so you can see how much more elegantly and efficiently others have made their way through them.

    If you haven't heard of this story, here is a possible use: [I don't know Timmy, being God is a big responsibility...](https://qntm.org/responsibility).

    This computer, as described, is capable of solving the halting problem.

    I use it to crack the secret of Friendly AI and ascend to godhood.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      Sure you could probably brute force some method that gave you AI, but I don't see how it would make solving the goal alignment problem any easier.
      ```
