## Stories Similar* to Pokemon: Origin of Species

### Post:

\*when I say similar, I'm specifically looking for stories/shows that have similar character interaction.  They don't have to be rational, just any sort of fiction/show/anime/whatever with similar group dynamics.

&#x200B;

Like many people, HPMOR was my first rational work, and I loved the lessons, ingenuity, and creativity it brought to the world of fiction.  Upon searching for more stories in the same vein, I checked out Pokemon: Origin of Species and felt more of the same, which is exactly what I wanted.  However, there was one category I feel POS executes amazingly that I didn't really see in HPMOR.  There's a group dynamic between the core group that I can't help but adore, something that HPMOR couldn't really explore because of how isolated Harry tends to be.  Not only is the group fun to read about, but I love all the individual interactions between Aiko, Leaf, Red, and Blue, but especially Blue and Red/Leaf and Red.  All of the characters feel distinctly intelligent in their own way, and it leads to both humorous and surprisingly wholesome moments.  Now that I'm all caught up, I'm trying to find more character interactions like the one presented.  The only other example that I feel could fit is the interaction between Matt, Karen, and Foggy in Netflix's Daredevil, but otherwise I haven't felt similarly reading or watching other media.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.

  I really love the group dynamic in [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) - I don't know if it'll match exactly what you like about Origin of Species but the core group are all well defined and the way they bounce off each other is a delight.

    Seconding this, /u/Shroomily. Twig is my favorite of Wildbow's stories, and the characters and their interactions are why.

    Agree, the party banter here is second to none^*, but don't read this if you're easily bothered by body horror.

    ^* at least in Wildbow's works. Ward is coming along rather nicely, but there's an inherent *familiarity* between the Lambs, whereas the people from Ward came together under very special circumstances, which shows in their interactions.

    The character interactions were by far my favorite part of Twig.

  Just to let you know, I'd recommend posting requests like this to the Monday Thread from now on. The Monday Thread is now meant to cover recommendation requests.

  I'm not saying that this post should be taken down or anything like that, but this is just a gentle reminder for the future.

  The teamwork isn't the focus of the story, [Silver](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11575324/1/Silver), but it's a major component especially when the rest of JPNR finds out the secret Jaune has been keeping from them by lying to them. Mending their damaged relationships is a major arc in this story.

    Thanks for the tip, I'll be sure to stick to the monday thread in the future.

  All of Sanderson's work has great team dynamics & relationship-building. Mistborn is best for this, but Stormlight Archive does it well too--the bonding of Bridge Four is especially good.
  ```

  - u/CraftyTrouble:
    ```
    Disagree. Mistborn is more of a mentor/pupil + side characters ensemble. It's nothing like PTOOS. And not one of the characters feels half as bright as Red/Blue/Leaf.
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Seconding /u/CraftyTrouble's disagreement. Mistborn is the only Sanderson series I've read and I actually haven't read anything else in large part because his characters felt so... dry and flat. 

    The first of the Mistborn books was the best in this regard, specifically because of Kelsier, but the second two were actually hard to get through. The worldbuilding and magic system is great, but the characters not so much.
    ```

- u/CraftyTrouble:
  ```
  I think what stands out about PTOOS is that each character has a distinct personality and real agency, making their interactions feel genuine and interesting. It feels like real, intelligent people interacting rather than a single-mind author telling a story. Another fic with this quality is [Marked for Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest-story-only.24793/), if you ask me.

    Wow, I feel like you hit it right on the mark.  It can be pretty hard to discern what makes something enjoyable sometimes but I feel like your analysis encompasses it pretty well.  I'll be sure to check that fic out.
    ```

- u/DaystarEld:

  I'm glad you've enjoyed the characters so much! In addition to Twig, Worth the Candle, and Marked for Death, I'd also recommend [Animorphs: The Reckoning](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11090259/1/r-Animorphs-The-Reckoning). It has less in the way of fun and warm friendship moments, but the author does a great job of writing rational and fleshed out, agenty characters.

  For non-rational fiction, I'd recommend IT by Stephen King.

    I actually am reading A:TR as well, though I'm not fully caught up, but I agree. These are all great stories, I'll be sure to check them out.  I only wish I'd received more TV suggestions haha

    Thanks for writing, I'm enjoying it a ton!

  What you are looking for is so broad that I cannot suggest anything. Can you narrow it down what exactly you are looking for with character interactions and not leave it to our own interpretation?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Sorry, it's difficult to put into words exactly what I'm looking for, partially because I'm not positive what all it entails either. It's kind of like porn, you just know it when you see it.

    The best description I could give is something like: "Media that depicts friendship in a compelling and fulfilling way without coming across as trite or cliche, and without friendship being the entire plot."
    ```

    - u/Fresh_C:
      ```
      If you haven't already, I'd give [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) a try.

      It takes a little while for the character dynamics to build up, but after a while you get a lot of small moments and bigger touching scenes between the cast. The only downside is that while it's heavily implied (and explicitly stated if I'm not mistaken) that the rest of the cast have equally deep relationships among each other, you mainly see things from Juniper's point of view so most of the interactions "Joon/Supporting character", rather than "Supporting Character/Supporting Character". But it's clear that they all have varied and nuanced relationships with each other.

      Have you read Twig? That description pretty much nails the main group's interactions.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I read the first few chapters, then I got distracted and forgot about it lol

        But I've read every other wildbow work so I trust it'll be good haha
        ```
