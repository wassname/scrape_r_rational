## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  I've been around the sub for a decent while, and I've kinda noticed that there are 3 groups of people in this sub.  
  1. Rationalists. Big fans of Eliezer, prioritize reading 'rationalist' works.  
  2. Rational readers. Enjoy well thought out and complicated stories. Bothered by plot holes and idiot sticks.  
  3. Quality/Deep fiction readers. The 'oddball' on the sub. Enjoy a lot of different things, and are on r/rational because the other subs like /r/webserials and /r/FanFiction just aren't very popular/good. 

  This kinda makes me sad, as I'd categorize myself as somewhere between 2 or 3, but 3 doesn't really have a home anywhere. Am I missing some critical sub?
  This community has grown up to have some actually fairly diverse taste by my metrics, but a lot of this is because it doesn't limit itself to rational[ist] works, or genre, or even fanfic/webserials. Is there interest in seeding a new sub to cater specifically to 3? Not to get them/us out of the sub, just to create an adjacent/partner community that isn't centered around rationalism, and is more accessible/discoverable to newcomers?

    Honestly I just consider this the Ravenclaw common room. There's probably some strange mystical link between excessively logical thinkers and incorrigible aesthetes. Its like Spock meditating by candlelight which is actually a thing.

    r/WiseFiction ? I think it would be hard to get something less pretentious than "rational."

    Actually, I'd say the majority of the fiction that gets recommended on this subreddit is closer to type 3 than to type 2. Admittedly this is because type 3 is much more common than type 2, but still. I honestly don't see the need to fragment our community over this distinction.

    I think the thing you're trying to put a label on is typically referred to as "rational-adjacent" around these parts, and I'd consider the "rational-adjacent" space to be the homeland of my heart.

    If you can find a word that captures the strange intersection of wonderfulness to which you refer and communicates it well to newcomers, I'd certainly be impressed and would subscribe to that community to see where it went.

      “Cleverness fiction,” for people who like watching cleverness unfold. It covers all three types, including things like Doctor Who, Thursday Next, Rick Cook’s Wiz series, The Edge starring Anthony Hopkins, the later parts of Eragon/Inheritance Cycle, CSI Vegas, in-universe in-genre crossover fiction like Ivanhoe, Into The Woods, Shrek and Toy Story, and pretty much anything that’s been adapted with Martin Freeman playing the everyman.

      Not even sure it would be limited to rational-adjacent, as that'll always have a place here. I'm interested in everything from rational adjacent to weird LitRPG systems that don't really make sense, but are interesting to read about.

      Definitely a weird problem. Most of my subreddit name thoughts come off as pretentious, and that's the opposite of what I want the sub to be.

      r/Smartfiction ?

      r/DeepFiction ? 

      r/GoodFiction ?

      If anybody has suggestions/thoughts, I'd love to hear them.

        If you want to do it:

        /r/ratadj

        1. It's good to connect it directly to /r/rational, because then you might somewhat lessen the chances of splitting the (already pretty dead) sub. I regularly visit the subreddits for my country and city, and whenever I check on one for news I immediately go and check  on the other too, and I think the direct connection will help anyone who finds one and likes it want to go and check the other, both when they first discover it and regularly afterwards. I think having the more direct connection makes it much more likely that it won't fizzle out right at the start, unlike /r/insertpositivequalityhereFiction.

        2. It doesn't have to be purely rat-adjacent works if you don't want to limit it, even with the name; you can have a sidebar explaining what most people consider "rational adjacent" and say "post things you think fit into this or that people who like this would also enjoy".

        3. /r/rationaladjacent is too wordy and /r/rationaladj is a cowardly half measure.

    I've certainly always found it odd that there isn't a proper webserial subreddite. I suppose it's partly that the really popular stuff gets its own subreddit (like Worm, PGtE or TWI) and other chat just seems to happen in comments, on royal road or discord.

  Played Star Wars Squadrons as soon as I had the time to sit down. Haven't hopped in multiplayer yet (got a few years of rust I need to knock off, plus a new joystick to adapt to), but it otherwise appears to be the X-wing/TIE Fighter sequel for the modern age that I've been dreaming and idly designing myself since I played those games in the mid-90's.

  11 hours from now or so I'll post a twitch link if anyone wants to watch me dig into it now that I have most of my controls set.

  [20020](https://www.sbnation.com/secret-base/21410129/20020), the sequel to [17776](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football) is out. If you liked the last one, you'll like this one. It's not rational by any means, but it is unique and funny and cool in all the right ways.

  - u/Prezombie:

    I'd argue that it's at least rational-adjacent. The author does an amazing job of setting up a premise, then exploring and expanding that premise that stays constrained by the rules of the game/world, create an extremely entertaining story.

    I love this whole thing, it's absurd and beautiful.

  [I wrote about a Chesterton's Fence.](https://www.reddit.com/r/chestertonsfence/comments/j4ax1h/fix_your_graphs_storagereviews_unusual/) Chesterton's Fence is a parable about how the reasons for a thing's existence may not at first be obvious, but may still be important.

  > There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.”

  Does anyone else have good examples of concrete Chesterton's Fences?

    The anthropology book *The Secret of Our Success* is full of examples of this.  Take, for example, this excerpt on the topic of manioc processing techniques:

    >In the Americas, where manioc was first domesticated, societies who have relied on bitter varieties for thousands of years show no evidence of chronic cyanide poisoning. In the Colombian Amazon, for example, indigenous Tukanoans use a multistep, multiday processing technique that involves scraping, grating, and finally washing the roots in order to separate the fiber, starch, and liquid. Once separated, the liquid is boiled into a beverage, but the fiber and starch must then sit for two more days, when they can then be baked and eaten. Figure 7.1 shows the percentage of cyanogenic content in the liquid, fiber, and starch remaining through each major step in this processing.

    >Such processing techniques are crucial for living in many parts of Amazonia, where other crops are difficult to cultivate and often unproductive. However, despite their utility, one person would have a difficult time figuring out the detoxification technique. Consider the situation from the point of view of the children and adolescents who are learning the techniques. They would have rarely, if ever, seen anyone get cyanide poisoning, because the techniques work. And even if the processing was ineffective, such that cases of goiter (swollen necks) or neurological problems were common, it would still be hard to recognize the link between these chronic health issues and eating manioc. Most people would have eaten manioc for years with no apparent effects. Low cyanogenic varieties are typically boiled, but boiling alone is insufficient to prevent the chronic conditions for bitter varieties. Boiling does, however, remove or reduce the bitter taste and prevent the acute symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, stomach troubles, and vomiting).

    >So, if one did the common-sense thing and just boiled the high-cyanogenic manioc, everything would seem fine. Since the multistep task of processing manioc is long, arduous, and boring, sticking with it is certainly non-intuitive. Tukanoan women spend about a quarter of their day detoxifying manioc, so this is a costly technique in the short term. Now consider what might result if a self-reliant Tukanoan mother decided to drop any seemingly unnecessary steps from the processing of her bitter manioc. She might critically examine the procedure handed down to her from earlier generations and conclude that the goal of the procedure is to remove the bitter taste. She might then experiment with alternative procedures by dropping some of the more labor-intensive or time-consuming steps. She’d find that with a shorter and much less labor-intensive process, she could remove the bitter taste. Adopting this easier protocol, she would have more time for other activities, like caring for her children. Of course, years or decades later her family would begin to develop the symptoms of chronic cyanide poisoning.

    >Thus, the unwillingness of this mother to take on faith the practices handed down to her from earlier generations would result in sickness and early death for members of her family. Individual learning does not pay here, and intuitions are misleading. The problem is that the steps in this procedure are causally opaque—an individual cannot readily infer their functions, interrelationships, or importance. The causal opacity of many cultural adaptations had a big impact on our psychology.

    >Wait. Maybe I’m wrong about manioc processing. Perhaps it’s actually rather easy to individually figure out the detoxification steps for manioc? Fortunately, history has provided a test case. At the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Portuguese transported manioc from South America to West Africa for the first time. They did not, however, transport the age-old indigenous processing protocols or the underlying commitment to using those techniques. Because it is easy to plant and provides high yields in infertile or drought-prone areas, manioc spread rapidly across Africa and became a staple food for many populations. The processing techniques, however, were not readily or consistently regenerated. Even after hundreds of years, chronic cyanide poisoning remains a serious health problem in Africa. Detailed studies of local preparation techniques show that high levels of cyanide often remain and that many individuals carry low levels of cyanide in their blood or urine, which haven’t yet manifested in symptoms. In some places, there’s no processing at all, or sometimes the processing actually increases the cyanogenic content. On the positive side, some African groups have in fact culturally evolved effective processing techniques, but these techniques are spreading only slowly.

    For a quick(er) read, you might want to check out [SSC's review of the book](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/), which highlights several other examples.

  NaNoWriMo is coming up, and I've heard that some folks like to have an editor who can quickly process each day's output. With that in mind, I'd like to offer my services as an editor. 

  In short, **the package is this**: Proofreading + General Feedback (at least a paragraph's worth) every day for $15 per day (a total of $450 for the month of November). You send me what you wrote that day, and I'll get it back to you within 24 hours. 

  I'm flexible on the payment plan. You could pay every day, for example, or every week, or you could pay 
  $225 in the beginning and then $225 at the end. You could also pay for the whole thing up front (this 
  would be especially useful if you want an extra motivation to finish NaNo—if you fail NaNo, I can 
  reimburse you for the $$$ not used, but I could *also* donate it to a charity instead if you think the financial loss would motivate you). 

  **Important caveat:** The response speed assumes that you're doing the normal NaNoWriMo rate of approximately 1,666 words per day. If you skip one day and then make it all up on the next day, then there *may* be a delay (there might not be a delay! I just want to allow for the possibility). 

  If you are looking for an editor, but not for NaNo, then I'd still be interested in discussing a gig. I'm familiar with both fiction and nonfiction (especially college papers, which I will provide feedback and counsel on but *will not* write for you). 

  (ty to the mods for letting me post here)

  Workings as a "solutions engineer", loving it. I want to explore joining-or-creating a professional association for these sorts of customer-facing technical positions; and I want to connect with folks working these kinds of jobs at companies that're making sci-fi real - for example, SpaceX and Commonwealth Fusion are making SF real, but they're not going to be doing the b2b tech products that make for the roles I'm thinking of.  


  Just spitballing here. RN, the various big data offerings (snowflake, spark) kinda fall into this category, and then I realized the DWave (and other quantum computing companies) also fall into it.  


  Any ideas / comments / suggestions? (TBC: NOT looking for new job, JUST looking for networking)
