## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Help me out with some timeline stuff.

  August or September of 2020, Earth is invaded by aliens. Think "portal opens, aliens pour out and start eating people" kind of thing. Military response happens but conventional weapons aren't super effective. (I'm going for an almost magical girl sort of setting so "shoot it with guns" isn't a viable solution, even though they do try.)

  By 2034, the United States and several other major nations have fallen and begun to rebuild, some on a much smaller scale.

  My question is, what needs to happen in those fourteen years? What kind of events need to happen, what kind of infrastructure needs to fail, to collapse a major modern empire in under a decade and a half? Assume nuclear war is still not a serious option, but opportunistic invasion by foreign countries along with the actual alien invasion is. (I'm actually thinking that an unstable President giving the order to nuke an American city after it falls to the aliens factors in, but I'm not sure how heavily it would.)

    The thing that makes a state a state is its monopoly on the perceived-legitimate use of violence. Once that's broken, whatever new armed group is providing government services will become the new state; or multiple states if that's competing groups.

    In your alien invasion scenario, I think the fastest way for the US to fall apart would be if it lost a significant chunk of ground, prompting an internal refugee crisis. Something like losing a chunk of the southwest, large scale displacement into California, a geographically-charged disagreement on whether to commit forces to resettling folks or to fighting the aliens, and failure to succeed at either. Then the de-facto government becomes whichever armed groups successfully relocate refugees and repel further alien invasions. After that you need a few years of those groups raising their own flags and doing the work of governing before it becomes official.

    The US's empire would fall apart during this, since the various subordinate states would see the same loss of legitimacy and start their own resistance and revolution movements. The US's carrier groups are a bit of a wild-card, where they're very beholden to the existing government, which is making decisions they might not agree with, and the supply chain to keep them all operational would be failing. So if one went mercenary or rogue, that'd be a possible source of sudden extra power somewhere else in your story.

      This actually makes a huge difference to me! Thank you. I hadn't thought of it from the "perceived-legitimate monopoly on violence" angle, which is... kind of wild when you consider that the introduction of an essentially unrestrictable source of the capacity for violence is a central part of the premise I'm working with...

        Agree with all the above except I wouldn't put the epicenter I'm the southwest. That probably the most expendable part of the US, very little agriculture or industry, low population other than Texas.  Hit something more substantial that displaces the government, forcing bigger adjustments.

  I have a new warhammer 40K headcannon : the reverse theorie,  
  The Warp is the real world and the Materium is a simulated universe.  
  The asumption is that the "iron men" won their side of the war and greygooed the universe, the grey goo is/was housing the sentient mind of everyone at the time of the war, from both side.  
  This theorie hand wave simultaneously all the plot hole of WH40K.
