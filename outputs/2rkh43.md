  The genre could be described as "non-fiction cosmic horror". 
  Not 100% sure it belongs here, but it's really good and thought provoking, so I guess why not?

  Extemely long, but contains a lot of good thoughts and links to even more good essays.

    It was definitely an interesting read. Thank you for linking it here. I'll have to spend more time reading the stuff it links to later, when I haven't been awake for thirty hours straight(My own fault).
