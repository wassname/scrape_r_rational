  Hmm, I don't really understand the relevance of this (appears to be something about emoticons?) but it's being heavily upvoted, could someone please explain the relevance?

    OP linked to the 6th video of a playlist, but it looks like you're seeing the first video of the playlist instead. The video you were supposed to see is [Danger: Humans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcPqk-O-fD4).

    As a joke, Tom Scott created Emoj.li, a messenger app where you could only use Emoji. Then 70,000 people signed up for it.
