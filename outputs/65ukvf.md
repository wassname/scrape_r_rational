  Whee, infodumps! Pretty cool, and so far Kagome was 10/10 in accuracy AFAIK.

  Not sure how much is actually relevant though to what we'll be doing.

    There's an opinion that what we will be doing is mostly dying because Kagome said all of that right next to the Sage's listening ear.

    ^(I'm still not sorry for bringing it about.)
