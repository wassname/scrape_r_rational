  See, this is the sort of interlude I want to see. Heiress should stay in the background being her boring self.

    Yes, what a great interlude and the Tyrant is such an interesting character. The more so, because of the contrast with Akua.

  I dearly wish Erratic had dropped the Akua thread after the last book. The Tyrant is a much more interesting antagonist. Not to mention hilarious.

    ```
    He's strong, but he's not rational. He is pretty creative when it comes to winning the battle, but he doesn't care about anything beyond winning battles. He can't make a good antagonist of a rational fic. Akua may not be as fun, but she's much more dangerous in the long run.
    ```

      Really? I actually think Erratic has shown him to be very rational. He understands extremely well the rules that bind Names and uses them to ensure his continued success. Mind you his idea of success is everything burning and him dancing in the ashes, but he does have a method to go about it. The Bard even comments on it in this chapter:

      “First step always works, so always have a first step going,” Aoede said. “Now, a lesser soul would say all that will accomplish is destroy more and and more of Creation until it all collapses on your head because you missed a beat.”

      “The part that matters is the dance,” Kairos smiled. “Not the bow at the end.”
      ```

      - u/DCarrier:
        ```
        I suppose you could say it's not so much that he's irrational as that his goals are more aligned with Cat's. Akua wants to control creation. Cat does not want Akua to control creation. They will fight head-on and one will lose. They will each do everything in their power to win that battle. Kairos wants to destroy a lot of stuff. Cat wants him to destroy less stuff. If they have some big climactic showdown and Cat defeats Kairos, they're both happy with that. So they're not going to work to prevent that. Kairos is going to spend his time destroying stuff instead of preparing for that big climactic battle, so Cat will have a much easier time winning.
        ```

    ```
    I can understand that. Given that she hasn't died yet, I think Akua's going to be with us until the ultimate climax of the whole series.
    ```
