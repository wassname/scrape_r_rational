  I like Cat's plan, but I can't help but feel that now that it's been revealed, it will go awry. 

  Incidentally, could she resign from her commanding positions before the fight and thus be able to spare the souls of the 15th and Callow in the event that she did lose?

    I think it will be a surprisingly short but supremely entertaining fight. Like she said; “we’re going to bullshit so hard it becomes a prophecy.”

    I think you're probably right, especially given the amount of detail provided. There's NO WAY Lady Foundlings plans ever work out exactly the way she wants; that's not the way this Universe works. She'll have to improvise to get out of this.

    I don't think there's any way she can resign given she's stuck in Arcandia; but it's a good thought.

      I dunno, the whole "I was dead" plan worked out pretty much how she wanted, in the end.

        Yeah, that's the obvious counter example, isn't it? ... I don't recall it clearly but it seems to be that we only found out many of the key details of that one after it happened. I still feel that this one is just begging to go wrong.

        We'll find out the truth soon enough. :)
