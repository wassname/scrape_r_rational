  Didn't see your previous post, read the whole thing now.
  Its ok.
  The character is fine, if a bit OP due to inheritance rather than figuring out how to cheat on powers (carry gasoline, set things on fire, use heat, don't burn city)

  I am sort of wary of the setting with the whole vigilante hate and shoot on sight the FIS guys seem to do. I know on a sensible level that our own world has plenty of such policies, I just feel a bit miffed.

  World building is fine.

  Nice first chapter :)

  > It's Pandahead

  That's... a very silly name for the leader of a very serious criminal operation.
