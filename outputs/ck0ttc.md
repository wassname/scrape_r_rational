## I'm having trouble downloading Worth the Candle.

### Post:

Hi, I've just mostly caught up with worth the candle, there appears to be 3 new chapters which I'm really pleased about. That said the download links on the ArchiveOfOurOwn page seem to not be working for me. I just have the endless 'Waiting for download.archiveofourown.org...' shown in the lower left. I've tried using firefox and chrome but no luck. I figured it might just be a slow download but I gave it about 15 minutes and it still hadn't started downloading. PDF and HTML works, Mobi and EPUB don't. 

I'm not sure if here is a good place to ask but I'm not sure where else to go. Thanks

  From their website's [known issues](https://archiveofourown.org/known_issues#downloads):

  >Large MOBI files fail: Despite the update of our download software, some very large files with many images may still fail to download. If this happens, you might try downloading the work in another format and then converting it to MOBI.

  [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is what I use for most of my epub/mobi/etc manipulation. It's not bad for converting from another format to e-pub or mobi.

    Yeah I saw that but Epub is also down. It was working for me only a few weeks ago, hopefully they'll fix it soon :)

  I think mobi is legitimately broken for long works, but epub shouldn't be. Give it another try?
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Use https://github.com/kemayo/leech to get epubs from most popular story sites (even works for wordpress sites with some configuration). Then use calibre to convert between formats as needed.

  You can use a HTML to MOBI converter. I have this one bookmarked: https://www.onlineconverter.com/html-to-mobi
