## Shut Up And Do The Impossible

### Post:

After interviewing Alexander Wales and Daystar Eld for The Bayesian Conspiracy podcast, I put together a [Rational Fiction Online Anthology](http://ratficonline.website/). It consists of links to nine Rationalist short stories, with brief introductions explaining what aspects of Rat Fic I believe they demonstrate. Most of the recommendations were taken from this subreddit, and I think every one of them has shown up here at one point or another. And of course this is only possible due to all the discourse here about what Rational Fiction even is.

I hope some people find this cool and/or useful. :)

    Did you get it?  Because it flew over my head.

    What is the Loom?
    ```

    - u/Modularva:
      ```
      It's either the normal human desire to socialize or an extra intense desire to socialize, it wasn't clear which because the protagonist's society seems to be obsessed with ambition and economic growth so their perception of what normal human values are might not have been correctly calibrated. I lean toward saying it's the normal human desire to socialize because that would explain why outbreaks are so common, but the evidence against is that one character mentions that those of the Loom aren't zombies and "still love their daughters", indicating that those outside the Loom also feel, or believe they feel, familial love, and that the Loom is characterized as strongly memetic.

      You have inspired me to write a post to address this question. Maybe I'm entirely off base, but I like my interpretation. Maybe you will too.

  This is a wonderful thing you have done -- the introductions are well-written in and of themselves, and I look forward to showing this to my friends!

  Can you put together an EPUB?
  ```

  - u/embrodski:
    ```
    Nope. That would require getting publishing rights, and authors want to be paid for those. Posting links to sites which already purchased those rights is free! :)

      Fair enough!
