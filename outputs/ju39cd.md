## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  How could you take advantage of extremely strong powers with a really limited range of effect. Any one power from the following list:

  * You can travel back in time exactly 5 seconds. This activation has a cooldown, also of exactly 5 seconds. The activation happens instantly, and you're at exactly the position and pose you were 5 seconds ago (think Tracer's ability from Overwatch).

  * You have the ability to impart 10 million Newtons of force from your palms or your soles. This force is imparted for exactly 1 cm of travel. During this time your hands or legs are indestructible (and as such protected from the impulse), and your body is protected from any immediate environmental effects of your power. You can use this power once every minute. Outside of your power, your body is like that of a normal human being.

  * You can split into 10,000 clones almost instantaneously for 1 minute. The clones only appear in places that will admit their dimensions around you, in a density of about 1 clone per square meter. After one minute, the combined knowledge and thoughts of each clone gets merged inside your brain with no difficulty, just like your own thoughts and knowledge. However, you are still able to forget things your clones thought up/ learned. The clones act as if they have the same mass and inertia as you, and they can interact with most objects. But if they are imparted upon by a force of more than 5N or a work of more than 5J they dissipate into nothingness (air pressure notwithstanding). After one minute, they also dissipate into nothingness. This ability can be used once every hour. 

  * Once every day you can speed up time around your brain to experience one second as 10,000 seconds. During this time your body moves as if it's in real time, but your eyes can move around synced up with your mind (at 10,000x faster speed). Blinks still take the same 400 ms, which you will experience as 4000 seconds. However, after this second ends in real time you feel as if you had 3 hours of effective rest.

    With the first power you can quickly become very rich gambling/trading on the stock market.

    Start with whatever money you have/can borrow, go gambling in blackjack or a similar game with a quick circle of decision/reward. Make a lot of money, leave a generous tip, buy drinks at the bar for everyone so you have better chances of getting out of there with your winning and not being "persuaded" to keep playing.

    Now it's time for the stock market. With only five seconds you need a derivative that moves really fast like options near their end, or a lot of leverage.

    To become rich with the second power, that pressure is maybe enough to make diamonds out of carbon? Alternatively go robbing banks by punching through walls and safes.

    With the third power you can flood entire buildings with copies of yourself, so industrial espionage if you happen to know exactly when something interesting is going to be shown in plain view or reachable within a minute. Time the important slide in a presentation, or use one clone to restrain a upper level manager while another reads their email when the account has been unlocked. Send money to a cryptocoin account when someone has their home banking app open. 

    There are two drawbacks: the first is the extreme unreliability. You know that with ten thousands copies you're bound to find some opportunity at any given timw, but you can't predict which. The second is that everyone will know that you were there. Wear a mask at the very minimum. 

    Also but less usefup: become a one man army. One minute is enough to point 9,999 guns at many different targets from a lot of different vantage points. (you don't want to risk the life of the original you just to fire one more bullet, do you?) 

    The fourth power is strong in the long run: having three hours more each day is going to have a cumulative positive effect on you career/studies. Impress you boss/professors with the ability to find solutions in a very short time. 

    Also maybe gain an edge in chess tournaments?

      Now that I think about it, are your equipment also cloned? Surely the clones don't spawn naked right? Though duplicating guns may be pushing it, so you would need to buy 9999 guns, and carry them around somehow. And people would be mighty curious when they see you have 9999 guns on you.

        ```
        Your clothes are copied, and various paraphernalia on your body. But just like your own body, anything that gets copied gets dissipated with very little force. So at most you'll be able to fire illusory bullets that make a lot of noise but dissipate upon impact with anything.

        Are there really stocks that move significantly over a time period of 5 seconds?
        ```

    > You can travel back in time exactly 5 seconds. This activation has a cooldown, also of exactly 5 seconds. The activation happens instantly, and you're at exactly the position and pose you were 5 seconds ago (think Tracer's ability from Overwatch).

    Unlimited thinking time.  Just rewind time over and over for as long as you want, giving you infinite time to think of anything you want. Whether that's math homework or novel writing or mystery solving.

    > You have the ability to impart 10 million Newtons of force from your palms or your soles. This force is imparted for exactly 1 cm of travel. During this time your hands or legs are indestructible (and as such protected from the impulse), and your body is protected from any immediate environmental effects of your power. You can use this power once every minute. Outside of your power, your body is like that of a normal human being. 

    This doesn't sound all that different from standard super strength, just you are only able to use it once per minute. Still, that means you can do all kinds of super strength things such as breaking stuff for demolition/recycling or spinning a turbine for electricity (may need a more complicated setup to channel that sudden power burst every minute and to stay within the 1cm distance limitation).

    > You can split into 10,000 clones almost instantaneously for 1 minute. The clones only appear in places that will admit their dimensions around you, in a density of about 1 clone per square meter.

But if they are imparted upon by a force of more than 5N or a work of more than 5J they dissipate into nothingness (air pressure notwithstanding). After one minute, they also dissipate into nothingness. This ability can be used once every hour. 

    This power is pretty much the above two mixed together. You get 10000 clones worth of thinking time for 1 minute every hour (so not unlimited, sadly). You also get the strength of 10000 clones for that minute. 

    One thing I must ask though... are the clones weightless? Because if they disappear when faced with a force of >5N, what about their weight? If they weigh the same as you do, the floor they stand on almost certainly imparts >5N on them to support their weight. (Quote wikipedia: The weight of an average adult exerts a force of about 608 N.) So would they just go poof instantly?

    If weight does not cause them to poof, then the combined weight of 10000 clones suddenly appearing can be used to do useful work. The simplest application is having them appear on one end of a lever, so their weight pushes up the other end to lift objects. But naturally more complicated mechanical devices can be created, up to and including spinning a turbine for electricity. After all, if you weigh 100 kg, those 10000 clones appearing would instantly apply a downward force of roughly 10,000,000 newtons. So that actually matches the previous 10 million newton power, albeit limited to a downward direction and spread out over a much greater volume.

    > Once every day you can speed up time around your brain to experience one second as 10,000 seconds. During this time your body moves as if it's in real time, but your eyes can move around synced up with your mind (at 10,000x faster speed). Blinks still take the same 400 ms, which you will experience as 4000 seconds. However, after this second ends in real time you feel as if you had 3 hours of effective rest. 

    Probably the weakest of the listed powers. You get much less free thinking time than the first and third powers, though still pretty useful. You don't get any of the force boosts of the second and third powers, unless you somehow use the movement of your eyeballs to apply it. (That would probably hurt quite a lot so let's not even go there!)

    Still, 10000 additional seconds of free thinking time, combined with 3 hours of effective rest per day (which I assume means you need 3 hours less sleep), would give you almost 6 hours more time per day. Assuming a healthy sleep cycle of 8 hours a day, a normal person only has 16 hours per day, while you have 22 hours, which means you have 37.5% more time than everyone else. Not particularly overpowering, but still pretty neat.

      I should have clarified better for the clones. they behave as if they have the same mass and inertia as your body, but they're mostly weightless. Any big enough outside force on them disperses them like smoke. However I think the limit is high enough to get them to work with small objects.

      One thing I think might make thinking hard, you'd have to divide up a task into 10,000 chunks to take maximum advantage of your one minute, which might take a while to set up. Unless you use one instance of your power to divide up the task, but even then you'd have to check for overlaps between your clones.

  All humans have the ability to teleport instantaneously to any chosen location in the universe. They can do this once per second.

  To do so, they have to identify a specific place they want to go. "The surface of planet Venus" works if you have an idea of what Venus is, but fails if you don't know enough identifying factors about it. For example, knowing "it is a place called Venus and it is hot" is not sufficient, but having an impression of its size and location is enough.

  "The nearest convenience store" fails as a target, as the person is asking their power to identify a place rather than choosing one themselves. "The current location of former president Barack Obama" similarly fails as a target.

  - It turns out this doesn't equate to time travel, for whatever reason.

  - Humanity as a race has always had this power, rather than suddenly receiving it.

  - The teleportation is seamless: it doesn't cause sudden air displacement or vacuums. It also adjusts people to the velocity of the place they teleport to.

  - Teleportation will shift people to the nearest unoccupied space rather than intersect with other solid objects.

  - People bring their clothing and up to an armful of whatever they are carrying.

  How does society as we know it change?
  ```

  - u/DXStarr:
    ```
    No more famines. Ever. (Famine isn't about nobody having food, it's about nobody within travel range having food.)

    Technology progresses amazingly quickly. (A lot of stuff depends on having enough nearby specialists to make the parts, or enough nearby customers to be a specialist.)

    There are no cities and no countries, just clans and societies. People organize by affiliations instead of locations.

    Property rights are enforced by privacy curtains. Blocking the view is their version of our locking the door.

    Unfortunately... humanity died of contagious diseases before any of this happened. (Think about how fast a plague spreads when every extrovert has a pop concert's worth of social contacts every day.)
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    We don't have cars. Nor bicycles, motorbikes, horse-drawn carriages, any of that.

    We don't have separate languages; people have always intermingled enough to prevent too much language drift. We don't have separate countries and we *definitely* don't have borders.

    We *do* have leaders, though. On the 'village chief' level at the very least.

    Travel is limited by two things. First is how far we can see. (We do, therefore, develop telescopes - and cameras are travel aids). Second is the ability to survive once we get there (teleporting to the Moon is *not* the best idea, but a far better idea than teleporting to Venus). Some people maintain caches of stuff in hard-to-reach places - several of these caches are on the moon (to retrieve it, prepare to hold your breath a couple of seconds...) - much to the dismay of the average doctor.

    The discovery of exoplanets is followed, within a week, by people visiting those planets. Humanity rapidly expands to live anywhere vaguely habitable in the universe, and starts to work on making the other places more habitable.

    It is annihilated.

    Humanity that is.

    Here's the problem: teleportation makes attacking REALLY EASY, while defending is basically impossible.

    Any asshole could teleport to a large asteroid, "carry" it in the weightlessness of space, and then teleport back above the earth and throw the asteroid at it as a large meteor. And there is no way to prevent this.

    Earth gets bombarded by such meteors over and over until humanity goes extinct.

    (If we are really really lucky, no such assholes exist. But I doubt that.)

      A meteor would, I think, constitute more than 'an armful of whatever they were carrying'. There are issues with teleport-with-grenade attacks, of course, which are a serious problem to contend with, but not on the level of meteor chucking.

  - u/plutonicHumanoid:
    ```
    The broad idea of it is “getting cut by this gives you weird but probably strong powers if your will is strong enough, but if it isn’t, you die”, right? I think a smaller cut is also more survivable but results in weaker powers. So some uplifting-type guy would definitely try to make as many stand users as possible, doing science to try and (ethically) figure out the lower bound of willpower require to survive it while guarding the arrow from others and recruiting others to their cause. Could be neat, even if JJBA powers tend to be irrational.
    ```

    - u/VapeKarlMarx:
      ```
      The mechanism being viral would probably mean the size of the cut is unimportant.   Since if it hit you hard enough to do big structural changes it would have to go systemic anyway.  

      I expect that the willpower angle is just some post hoc justification by the survivors that haven't done serious tests.  Since,  animals are shown to survive.  If it was related to mental fortitude basically any animal would pass save for an anxious chiwawa type creature.

      It could be the change is very painful and required mental strength to keep from panicking and overloading the system.  That would fit with the ability of a animal to chew off its leg.  However it would mean if you were asleep you'd probably be fine, and that is shown.

      There is the fact that the powers defy understanding.  So it could be evidence of a simualtion hypothesis in universe. 

      However given the presence of the italian mafia it would imply that every major organization had some hidden ability to manage stands or they would be out competeted.

      So the pope's hat?  Made of stand arrow.  The crown of england? Stand metal.  The desk in the oval office? Third handle on the left is made of stand metal.

      - u/plutonicHumanoid:
        ```
        Simulation theory as an explanation is a bit of a cop-out, not a fan. Some sort of “souls are insanely complicated and stands are like a 4d cutout of the users 7d soul” would be interesting.

        How common or easy arrows are to get is something that’s definitely unclear in canon. It’s mostly Joestars or children of Dio who have them, except that for some reason Kira’s dad was just able to buy one off Enya. Assuming that most major organizations have stand users kinda breaks the setting into being a lot less Earth-like for sure.

  You have a robot which looks like and behaves like a human, such that if someone wasn't given a reason to think otherwise, they would believe the robot was in fact a human. The robot is like the one in the 1980s movie Not Quite Human - physically heavy and strong, and has a power cord to plug into electrical sockets, a few sockets in its back in which you can insert e.g. USBs or other things which typically can be plugged into a laptop, and a qwerty keyboard hidden in a panel in its arm. It is as smart as a normal human and operates on a variant of Linux Debian with appropriate programs to enable it to engage in human-like behavior. You are you, with whatever level of computer knowledge you have or can obtain. You and the robot are the only ones who knows the true nature of the robot. You don't know where it came from or how it was programmed but can safely assume they are out of the picture.

    How powerful is the computer it's running on? If it's about as powerful as consumer-grade hardware, every computer I buy is another copy of its mind I can run in parallel. At the cost of public scrutiny, I can use these to make money via Mechanical Turk or remote jobs. Humans are subject to severe side effects from sensory deprivation, so I might have to hook its senses into VR or cameras/microphones.

    I look through the file system. Is its source code readable? If I can log its natural-language surface thoughts, alignment is a much smaller issue.

    The endgame, as often, is to safely build AI that is smart enough to brush away the world's problems. The direct approach would be to earn enough money to buy enough hardware that my army of minds, tasked with doing theoretical AI safety research as a human would, would work fast enough to finish before someone else follows in its father's footsteps.

    Modifying it in ways that change its motivations or intelligence is ill-advised, but reducing its hardware requirements would be great. How much access to give it to its inner workings would depend on my understanding of how it works. Even read access might be a mistake, if it can become smarter merely by understanding its thought processes enough to steer them better. I've heard humans can lose their desires through meditation.

    Shouldn't these be on the front of the robot, so that it can plug those in itself?

    Is the robot self-improving?

    Step the first: Impromptu Turing Test (i.e. spend some time chatting with it and see just how human the responses are). I assume it comes out of the test with a result of "indistinguishable from human", which leads me on to Step the second.

    Step the second: Find out what the robot wants. It's clearly a sapient life form, so I should not ignore its wishes. Attempt to encourage the robot towards self-improvement and learning enough programming to be able to write small helper programs for itself (but encourage it to be super careful modifying its base code).

  Upgrading a character from my tabletop campaign, and I am having trouble identifying useful areas of growth. 

  My character is a movie character who walked out of the screen and took a bit of it with him. He has strange movie based powers like Jump Cut(short-range teleport), Episodic Healing(regeneration), Cinematic Score(very limited clairvoyance by interpreting the current background music) and a gun that only hits what it's aiming at( it can miss, but never damages anything but the target) and never needs reloading( but optionally can be reloaded for dramatic effect and for a one use bonus to hit.)

  This character is based on Cort, from the Quick and the dead, played by Russle Crowe. He recently power up such that he can switch between several of Russle crowes other characters, and have powers approat to them, as well as a base form representing Russle Crowe as seen in interviews. So here is where I'm at.

  What Russel Crowe roles should I select(up to nine total) and what powers should I focus on from each?

  Current already selected roles:

  Base form Ira (Russel Crowes middle name)

  Most of his points are spent on defensive passive abilities and he is paying the cost of the transform power to allow the others to exist. Slight mental control ability from his occasional role as a narrator(forcibly narrating opponents makes them follow that narrative)

  James J Braddock (Cinderella man)

  1930 heavyweight boxing champ, martial skills with an added ability to increase density for damage reduction and increased weight and strength (as this movie is based on a true story, he just has more weight to him than any other role, yep, most powers have a pun basis)

  Cort from the quick and the dead

  Slightly nerfed, lost some powers when ira became base form as all other forms are built to a lower point cap. Lost some range on teleport and power to summon a horse from off screen. Otherwise powers as listed above

  Maximus from The Gladiator

  Can call in a catapult strike from off screen and is very good at disarm, for up to three attacks after disarming someone he is proficient with their weapon, weather it's a sword, bow, Lazer pistol, or enchanted club. Also general martial competence

  Those are already in use and cannot be removed but can to some extent be modified. Now I'm trying to pick the other  5 roles. Because of the limited power of nonbase forms, generally I can put one or two useful powers on a role after buying minimus necessary expenses, so each one will be specialized. The goal is to have a rounded overall character at the end. There will be some gaps, for example Russell Crowe never played a magic user ( a doctor who studied Egyptian magic, and a detective following a runaway wife starting a kind of shamanestic internship, but no direct magic users) but there are others on my team to fill them. 

  Tldr,
  Choosing from Russell Crowes IMDB history, using 8 characters plus a base form, and up to two powers from each, make an effective character. You may switch between roles instantly and often as you want but don't piss of the dm, damage and exhaustion will endure through role changes, power ups will not. All powers pull from the same source.

  Any power selected must have been displayed or strongly implied by the role receiving it, or be derived from Cinematic physics.

  I have a few starting points, but this is already too long. I will post them in reply to this comment. The system used is Heros 6th edition, but due to its flexibility and complexity I don't encourage consulting it for ideas. Any power can probably be made in the system, but the point cost do not follow rules I could feasibly explain in this medium.
  ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    ...I don't know the first thing about Russel Crowe. But some thoughts on generic cinema powers...

    - A thief character might be able to pick locks off-screen
    - A "Master Of Disguise" type character can outright replace a minion of the bad guy while off-screen (but never a named Bad Guy, only a minion)
    - A detective can make surprisingly accurate "hunches" on the basis of insufficient evidence
    - A character may have the power "Dramatic Death Scene" which means that if he's killed, then instead he's disabled (can't move, can talk at length, can do simple actions like firing a pistol) for several hours, as long as he keeps talking (and he can keep going "And one more thing!" as long as he wants). He still dies if he stops talking, but it allows an ally time to obtain a healing potion or similar.
    - "Never Found The Body" - if he dies in such a way as to leave no body, he gets to come back a few scenes later (he might dive into a river when hear death to take advantage of this). This might even follow the Dramatic Death Scene above.
    ```
