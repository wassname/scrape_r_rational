PB's a hard fantasy serial that's been running for a bit more than a year now.  If you want to start at the beginning--it's a grim yarn about power politics in a terrible world that superficially resembles Sumer or Babylon--[click on this](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thank you!

  It looks like the entire history of Ram's world is a factional proxy war between two groups of Bazuu. I can't think of any other group of beings that would know how or want to set up that situation.

      Do bear in mind that you're getting a very garbled and incomplete picture here, from a bazu perspective.  Imbri isn't Tattletale from Worm, after all.
