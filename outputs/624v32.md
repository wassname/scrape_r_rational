  I downloaded this novella just yesterday and have finished it. I found it fairly compelling; somewhat over simplified as far as economics go but still a very enjoyable read at its current price point. I would heartily suggest it for those that own a Kindle or plan to get the Kindle app/desktop program.

        Yes.

          I also wish it was handled better; the origin story for her very nature (something that is at least somewhat important and causing the protagonist a great deal of confusion) seems pretty cheap and uninspired. [](#s "Also her healing factor feels like a cop out because how else would you handle someone getting brutally tortured every day while still remaining functional.")
