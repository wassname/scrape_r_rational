  Earth is destroyed!  (Well, all the buildings and everyone who is inside them.)

  Aliens are going to strip-mine the Earth, but first they're going to run the 13 million surviving humans through a reality TV show consisting of a dungeon crawl.  Carl is unfortunate to go in with no shoes, no pants (he does have boxers -- it's not that kind of dungeon!), and a cat.  

  There's a nice mix of understated humor, action, and character development.  This is currently my favorite story on the internet, ranking above Worth the Candle.

    I really enjoy this series - not just the humor, but also the drama. For the life of me, I can't come up with much rational content in it. The main character (not to mention Donut) is smart enough. The setting is downright surreal to the point where very little analysis and planning seem possible.
    ```

      Hm...not sure I agree.  For example (some of these may reference Patreon chapters, I'm not sure):

      1. >!They discover that bosses have weaknesses and they plan accordingly, such as using the ramp and spike strips against the Ball of Swine.!<
      2. >!Carl figures out out to give Katia a literal ton of mass to work with despite there not being any equipment with anything like that amount!<
      3. >!They build barriers to block off the doors of the trains in order to funnel their enemies into a killbox.!<
      4. >!They come up with a specific playbook of combat tactics instead of always going ad hoc!<
      5. >!Careful planning during race and class selection.!<
      6. >!Carl's handling of Grimaldi and meta-handling of the producers of *Vengeance of the Daughter*!<

      It takes a while for the rules of the dungeon to be completely revealed, but I think Carl and Donut work with those rules in a sensible fashion once they know about them.

        I love the story, but it's one of those things that only pushes rationality because the author is withholding information. Since we don't know the game mechanics, we can't rationally discuss the game.

        But I've said similar things about PGtE and that does well here.

        2.>!The author Deus'd this in with the book won from a roulette carousel; ~~the only thought on Carl's part was following the book's instructions to disguise the idea as his own~~ Edit: I misremembered. Carl was clever here, but the book is anti-rational shenanigans.!<

        5.>!In-story issue here, there were too many choices for the author to list. We got to see like 5 classes, and the races were essentially chosen arbitrarily after blowing the rest off as not worth discussing.!<

        6.>!This is an interesting point, mainly because there was only communication from Carl. He could have been correct in not seizing victory, but he could have killed Grimaldi. Logically, he could have killed Grimaldi, and should have for the greater comparative rewards. He didn't, because he thought that he would somehow be screwed out of his victory because 'That's what happens'. And I'd argue that it makes sense, but only in the context of an already illogical world: I.E. A world where looking at the sun blinds you, because God pokes out your eyes, not because of bright sunlight. Everyone knows God's gonna poke your eyes out if you look at the sun, or the gameshow is going to screw you over, but it doesn't really have good backlogic.!<
        ```

          He *did* read through every race.

          > For the next two hours, I read through every available race. There was a wide variety of choices, from short, squat, purple-skinned little people called Night Dwarves to tall, thin gazelle-like fighters called Lyrx Elves to monstrous rock creatures with molten centers called Coal Engines. There was even a finger-sized parasitic worm creature called an Intellect Hunter. I wondered if they were the same creatures who ran the Valtay Corporation, but I was afraid to ask. They could take over the bodies of any creature they killed, though the bodies would immediately start to rot. Mordecai said that was actually a solid choice, but I couldn’t imagine losing myself to that form.
          ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          6. What's the problem with following the backlogic that was already explained to them of, "Beware of scripts centred around the Elite because the interests behind them may try to incorporate your dramatic death into the plotline"?
          ```

          - u/Gr_Cheese:
            ```
            Because it's the equivalent of God poking your eyes out for looking at the sun. God exists. Your eyes exist. Poking happens. You can deus ex a reason that the poking won't happen, or use luck as a justification, maybe God's having an off day, but there's a lack of rationality applied there unless we get into the whys and the hows.

            Backlogic in this case would be knowing more about the "interests behind them" and their rationale behind acting, so they could be predicted or predictions could be discussed intelligently by readers. We got a bit of that for Grimaldi iirc, but not enough in my opinion for Carl to do what Carl did and have any significant justification beyond wind in the plot sails.

            I'm not going to argue that Carl did not act intelligently in this choice. I **am** arguing that Carl's choices here were not something that we as readers were given enough insight into to be able to discuss rationally beyond 'It worked'.

            A one-path-forward storyline is not rational by definition, just because there is only one path forward and the main character follows it.

            There were other options for Carl that we could not rationally speculate on because we do not have enough information to do so.
            ```

          - u/Gr_Cheese:
            ```
            You're right, I suppose, but the other choices *are* relevant because each player has a unique build that could have utilized them. So while it's impossible for the author to list off that information, Carl and Donut both have the insight that the in-story list provided while the readers do not.

            And yeah, part of the general lack of information is due to Carl / Donut's lack of information, but the game mechanics specifically could be better fleshed out, if the author were aiming for r/rational.

            I mean, there was no good reason for the list to be thousands long. It could have been 3 long and provided the same context, but without Carl and Donut getting massive amounts of background information that we as readers were left out of.

            It just strikes me as a deus ex in the chamber at best, anti-rational worldbuilding at worst.
            ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I think it's telling that he hears about a spell to make a hole in an object, depth depending on practice, and thinks, "That's fantastic and I can think of half a dozen uses for it." Despite his brawling-oriented build and avowed dislike for maths, he's still a thinker and problem solver.
        ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:
        ```
        Thanks for those points. Let me be clear - I don't want to gate-keep; I want to discuss rational storytelling in this work.

        It *is* pretty neat how a lot of Carl's tactical solutions end up being engineering solutions. I also like his constant abuse of the inventory system.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          I know, right?  When he got the early achievement for having 10 tons of stuff in his inventory I knew that there were wonderful shenanigans in the future.

          > Thanks for those points. Let me be clear - I don't want to gate-keep, but I do want to discuss rational storytelling.

          Agreed.  But, of course, there's the rub...what exactly do we mean by that? DCC is definitely not rational*ist* because it's not trying to teach the science of psychology of logical thinking, math, etc.  Is it ration*al*? Let's run the list:

          * Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

          This one is met.  Donut is a child who became sapient shortly after entering the dungeon after a lifetime of being a show cat.  As a result, she has problems consistent with that -- impetuousness, etc -- but I think it's fair to say she's intelligent.  Carl is an everyman (i.e. not a MENSA member etc) but he is definitely smart about how he approaches problems in the dungeon.

          * Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

          This one is met.  They both want to survive the dungeon.  Additionally, Donut wants popularity and enjoys having control of her surroundings for the first time.  Ergo, she negotiates with shopkeepers, plays to the crowd on the TV shows, etc.  Carl wants to save the other humans so he puts himself at great risk to help the Meadow Lark group, the staff and residents of a retirement home.

          > Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

          The story is ongoing but the individual encounters involve intelligent solutions.  The >!ramp / bunker / spike strips!< used to kill the Ball O' Swine being a prime example.

          * Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

          There are clear rules.  The rules expand as new encounters happen and new elements are added, but that's no different from any other novel.  Authors typically don't start with a giant infodump on page 1 that says "Here are the precise rules of every spell that will be used in this story."  The universe looks like it does for very sensible reasons based on interstellar politics and economics.

          The one part of the worldbuilding that could be questioned is "Why is Borant mining a populated planet instead of the asteroid belt?"  That isn't touched on but there are plenty of standard responses: 

          * Kill off young civilizations before they become threats
          * In a galactic society containing quintillions (sextillions?  more?) of intelligent beings, some of them are going to be cruel.  Modern Europe and America still has a small number of people who enjoy dog fighting, so why shouldn't the future galaxy?
          * You get the same amount of minerals either way but if you do the planet thing then you also make a gazillion space bucks off the reality show.  If you don't care about non-galactic-citizen species then why not?
          * etc
          ```

          - u/Gr_Cheese:
            ```
            I love your points here and I for one would be happy to see Carl in this sub more, despite being on the fence about giving the story a Rational genre tag.

            > There are clear rules. The rules expand as new encounters happen and new elements are added, but that's no different from any other novel.

            I'm going to juke point away from Carl to say that there is a **big** difference between small / foreshadowed rule expositions and throwing new rules in to immediately affect the plot in a major way. 

            WtC: Exclusions Zones? Foreshadowed from like the first chapter. Masterful use of an established rule to cause major meta shenanigans later on.

            PGtE: Pulling a sword out of a stone to get a free resurrection? Literally what reason would anyone have to believe this to be a thing prior to it happening?

  Read through this last night after seeing the recommendation here. I uh, I might've binged it for 10 hours straight. It was really good and everything to do with the first safehouse was hilarious.

  ```
  I'll admit to liking it immensely, but I'm not sure it's ratfic. LitRPG, sure, but new elements keep getting thrown at the main characters all the time and keeping them off-balance. They can only make the barest attempt at planning; most of their energy is going into plain old survival.

  ```
  This is a fantastic story but I definitely don't see it as rational.
  ```

- u/WEEBSRUINEDFANFICS:
  ```
  The whole premise is unrealistic and seems like a parody takes too seriously. I just feel like the only way the overarching plot makes sense to me is that the MC is in a coma and he is dreaming. It’s high fantasy on crack.

    Does uh, does somebody want to tell him or should I?
