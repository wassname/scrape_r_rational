  Hey everyone, this is the new story that I've mentioned a few times on Rationally Writing.  It's aiming to be a YA novel for eventual publication, and I have no idea how quickly I'll be able to get through it, or how much of it will end up going online, but for now I'd like to put it up here for people to read and give feedback on.

  Title is still a work in progress. Enjoy!

  (For those of you that might be worried, I can promise that this won't interfere with Origin of Species, since this one chapter took me a few months to write with whatever spare time I had between all the other projects. It's nice to be able to switch gears and work on something fresh, but the new Pokemon chapter is still being worked on too.)

    While I am excited to have another original rationalist story, i hope you try to balance out the action and story with the rationalist sections better. I think you could work on sprinkling out the rationalist stuff in OoS further apart instead of having 60% of some chapters being ai discussion and whatnot.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I'll try to keep that in mind! I'm aiming for shorter chapters (and a shorter story) in this, so I definitely won't be including as much wide scope concepts.

  Some quick thoughts:
  - Incredibly fun to read, I love the premise so far
  - The bit at the end (!), as well as all the other little places where you injected context felt very natural, and it flowed very well. 

  I'm unsure what Terra's motivations are for approaching the fourth "girl". As in, if it were me, I probably wouldn't have taken a brazen approach, but I suspect there's more info here that is probably important, like maybe fae are notorious for messing with people.

    > Incredibly fun to read, I love the premise so far

    Yep, +1

    > The bit at the end (!), as well as all the other little places where you injected context felt very natural, and it flowed very well.

    Actually that last reveal was jarring to me, because it didn't feel like something anyone would actually say. Compare:

    [spoiler ch1](#s " “Well since he’s dead, I don’t know what he’d want,” Terra mutters. “And you’re the last person I’d listen to about respecting his memory, since you’re the one that killed him.”")


    [spoiler ch1](#s " “Well since he’s dead, I don’t know what he’d want,” Terra mutters. “And you’re the last person I’d listen to about respecting his memory.” Puck was, after all, the one to kill him.")

    It makes sense for Terra to be thinking about the background. It doesn't feel natural for him to point it out to Puck explicitly.

    >I'm unsure what Terra's motivations are for approaching the fourth "girl".

    I felt like he was just looking for more interactions with fae, with the feeling of security that Puck would intervene if he was doing something really wrong. It makes sense, he does need to learn how to interact with them better if he's to ever improve on Puck's oath.
    ```

      Yeah, this was bothering me a bit too, but I wasn't sure what the best edit might be.

      What do you think of this?

      “And my dad's murderer is the last person I’d listen to about respecting his memory."

      Still too explicit?
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        I do like that phrasing better, yes. It feels less redundant to address Puck *as* the murderer, than to address him directly and then call him the murderer.
        ```

- u/InfernoVulpix:
  ```
  I'm noticing a good amount of influence from Pact here, so I'm guessing that this story is partially inspired by the question "What would Pact be like if things didn't always suck everywhere forever?"  You'd still have the clever words and mind games, the blood magic and assorted other magics, and the severe *risk* of horrible fates if you're careless, but put instead in a package where, if you play your cards right, you can win or at least break even.

  The fig trick was intriguing.  Terra somehow knew that he was being affected by *something*, even though he was being blocked from comprehending it when not seeing it, but it was only when he had physical proof of her existence that he could actually remember her.  I'm not sure what that means for the nature of glamour and illusions, but it's an interesting data point.

  Naming scheme so far seems a bit esoteric, what with Terra and Puck.  I'm guessing Terra was given an unusual name by his dad, who presumably was thoroughly immersed in the spooky stuff, and Puck's not even human, but I wondered for a moment there if this was a 'fantasy academy where everyone has weird names' story.

  So far, it looks like it has good potential to get Terra more and more sucked into the supernatural world like Blake did, though hopefully less tragically.  I can say right from the get-go that I hope Terra finds some peers to confide in and drag along with him.  Alternate perspectives and reactions are a significant chunk of what makes stories compelling for me, so loner stories don't resonate quite as well.

    Give it time, we don't know where he's going with this. 

    I mean, Pact didn't make its maximisation of global suck levels visible right away in chapter 1.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      As much as I enjoyed it, I definitely found Pact wearing to read over long periods of time, so I can at least assure you it won't get that dark :)
      ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    >Terra somehow knew that he was being affected by something, even though he was being blocked from comprehending it when not seeing it

    My interpretation was that he was able to recognize the memory trick because he could only remember three girls, but he remembered them *acting* like there was a fourth person there. Like their body language didn't make sense if there were really only three. So the memory trick made him forget the fae, but it couldn't alter how he saw the human girls behaving.

    Puck's definitely not the fae's true name or I'm sure he would have objected to Terra revealing it, so I have to assume that he adopted it (or someone gave it to him) as a joke. I mean, assuming that Shakespeare is a thing in this universe.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Correct on both counts :) The reason the other fae rolled her eyes was because "Puck" is a common pseudonym for fae to take when they want to be cheeky.
      ```

    ```
    As an aside, whose the author of pact, and would you recommend it?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Wildbow is the author of Pact, same author as Worm. I'd recommend it if you like urban fantasy and don't mind suuuper dark and gritty stories.

    Fixed the typo, thanks! And glad you like the premise :)

    As for the tense, yeah, this is one of those things I feel like I might be most irrational about. I *know* that I'm losing readers by having Origin of Species and this novel in present tense, but... something in me resists the notion that this is wrong or taboo, and wants to fight back against it out of sheer stubbornness that others have such an aversion to it.

    No disrespect to Phillip Pullman, I love his work intensely, but I find the argument unconvincing. I think it's something that's evolved as a taste simply because of convention. The idea that present-tense is just not how stories are told is strange to me, who finds it a natural voice to tell written stories in. The Dresden Files makes sense to be in the past tense because the writer is documenting his past. Stories explicitly about past events ("Long ago," or "Once upon a time,") make sense to use past tense because it's part of the setting. 

    I'm not writing a journal, nor are my narrators or characters recalling things that occurred in the past.  The narration serves as a simple lens of a story of what's happening *right now* in the world my readers are reading, as they read it. I find it engaging, personally, and it allows me to use past tense as it's intended: to describe things that happened in the past.

    If I end up getting to the point where I have to get this thing published and all the editors notes and denial letters are saying "gotta put it in past tense," I'll cave. But if I can help contribute to normalizing present tense as a form of storytelling, and have people able to more easily read both, I count that as a plus :)

    In the meantime, I'm sorry if it bothers you, and hope the other aspects of the story make up for it!

      Honestly, I read the comments first and saw people saying the present tense took them out of it, so I went into it knowing this was a concern people had--but when I actually went to read the chapter, I immediately forgot and didn't give the tense another thought all the way through. I didn't even really register that it was in present tense, despite having been "warned" in advance. I might be outvoted on this one but I think it's fine, personally. The writing flows smoothly enough, and the plot is immersive enough, that the tense doesn't get in between me and the story.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Good to know :) This is exactly the way I read stories, I might notice present or past tense initially but once I get into the story it doesn't matter. I find it kinda odd that others can be so distracted by it, but maybe people like us just read more present tense stories growing up.
        ```

    - u/CarVac:
      ```
      I think that you may be projecting your feelings as the author onto the reader when you say that it gives a feeling of things happening "right now".

      For me as a reader, past tense works as a way of mimicking how I would sort through my own memories, discovering things as the chain of association makes its way through my memories of a series of events.

      By contrast, present tense makes me feel like an observer, not a participant.

      But I can definitely see that present tense might be more conducive to writing.

      ---

      Also, anecdotally, present tense narration makes it harder for me to remember past plot events. I remember liking Ra, but I don't remember anything that happened in it. In your Pokemon Origin of Species I find myself having to go back and review more often than in other fictions.

      I didn't notice that this was in present tense as all until reading the comments, so it didn't bother me in the slightest

        >I mean, that's exactly what it is.

        Right, but Pullman didn't say that, he tried to make an argument about how the past tense is intrinsically a better medium to tell stories in, for various reasons, and how the shift to present tense can be used artistically. I feel kinda the reverse. The hand-held cameras comparison is a good one, but I do think that it's just as natural to tell stories in the present tense as the past tense.

        Like, a friend could be telling you a story and describe it like this:

        "So I was at the bar last night, and this big guy came up to us and started making fun of my buddy's shirt. I stepped between them and tried to calm everyone down, but he took a swing at me! I got knocked on my ass, and I was like, 'what the hell,' you know?"

        Or they could say it like this:

        "So I'm at the bar last night, and this big guy comes up to us and starts making fun of my buddy's shirt. I step between them and try to calm everyone down, but he takes a swing at me! I'm knocked on my ass, and I'm like 'what the hell,' you know?"

        And in my perspective of how people react to this, no one is confused or taken out of the story because they know that the person isn't literally at the bar right now as they describe it, they're just using the present-tense as a form of immediacy/immersion, unconsciously. 

        That's how it is for me: when I write, it comes out in present tense because the events are happening *now* as I envision them. The reason I don't change it is a bit of wanting to break taboos and buck tradition, but it's more because I'm stubborn rather than the first cause, which is that it's just natural to me :)

    > not insignificant number of potential readers have negative associations with the use of present tense in fiction

    Huh, well I guess you learn something new every day. I didn't even consciously notice it was present-tense until you pointed it out.

    I wonder if it's a native language thing - a lot of Polish fiction I remember was in present tense, and it's not really a weird thing. 


    ETA after reading the article: 
    > I agree with [everything Philip Pullman has to say about the matter](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2010/sep/18/philip-pullman-author-present-tense).

    That rant is really confusing. It's somehow assumed that using present tense as the base of the story means that only present tense will ever be used?

    > But if every sound you emit is a scream, a scream has no expressive value. What I dislike about the present-tense narrative is its limited range of expressiveness. I feel claustrophobic, always pressed up against the immediate.

    >I want all the young present-tense storytellers (the old ones have won prizes and are incorrigible) to allow themselves to stand back and show me a wider temporal perspective. I want them to feel able to say what happened, what usually happened, what sometimes happened, what had happened before something else happened, what might happen later, what actually did happen later, and so on: to use the full range of English tenses.

    Starting with the present tense as what's happening *now* in the story doesn't prevent you from using the past tense to talk about what happened *before*, nor the future to talk about the future. In fact, talking about the future seems easier in english if your base is the present tense - you can now simply use future tenses, rather than have to reverse the relationship and use past perfect, or use some kind of contextual expression to provide the 'jump forward in time' and then get back ('A. Later, B. But for now C').

    I must be missing something. Guess this will be a thing to pay attention to next time I read something streatched over a large time scale


    ETA 2: I am now thinking of a story written mainly in future tense. I don't think it works well in English, alas (too much 'will'); but for something like Polish where the tense is built by transforming verbs, and so without annoying repetition, it could be a fun read.

  Very good first chapter. Sadly, I have no criticisms, only praise.

  I tend to find original web fiction difficult to get into. This chapter was the opposite - it really drew me in from the get go, with no snags along the way. It explained what it needed to explain, but didn't overshare information. 

  I was surprised to find that this was meant to be a YA novel. One chapter isn't much to judge by, but it didn't feel as simple as typical YA fiction. This may be good or bad. It appeals to me, but I'm not in the target audience. On the other hand, the very best writing *should* appeal to all ages, IMO - look at Avatar: TLA.

  I was instantly hooked. Very interesting premise with a lot of potential for fun clever mind games :)

  The present tense didn't bother me as other commenters, I actually had to look back at the text to notice it had indeed been written in present tense...

  Hoping to read the next chapter soon :)

  Well, now. This is quite interesting indeed. Funny that I played my first game of Changeling: The Lost the very day you published this!

  Regardless, I quite enjoyed it. Looking forward to more!

- u/None:

  I liked it a lot. Two minor things that may or may not be intentional: I wasn't really clear what age teh characters were supposed to be, at different points I oscillated between 8 and late teenage. That changes how I interpret the protagonists behaviour. 

  Secondly, I kept thinking the protagonist was female because of the name "Terra", but the comments here seem to imply they were male. 

  General thoughts: I'm interested to learn how different the world in this story is from ours, whether its 99% the same with the magic happening invisibly to most people, or something more like unsong where the world is radically different.
