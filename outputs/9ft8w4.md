## Eliezer's Latest Challenge - a reverse whodunit!

### Post:

A [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9esous/the_asteroid_strike_unconceivable_threats_in/) on literary "asteroid strikes" attributed the anonymously published Naruto fanfic "Waves Arisen" to EY - a claim which he has consistently neither confirmed nor denied.

&#x200B;

[Eliezer himself](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9esous/the_asteroid_strike_unconceivable_threats_in/e5ssj4x) showed up in the comments to mention that he can still neither confirm nor deny authorship, but also noted that there were not only stories often attributed to him that he did not author, but one story in particular that he \***did**\* write anonymously with a conscious effort to change his style, that to his knowledge no one had ever attributed to him.

&#x200B;

He went further to say this:

&#x200B;

>Nobody responding to this message will mention the work in question either, unless somebody throws out an enormous shotgun list - say, a list so long as to contain at least 9 other works. The writing didn't especially sound like Eliezer, or rather didn't sound like you imagine Eliezer to be; so you didn't notice.

&#x200B;

**CHALLENGE ACCEPTED**

&#x200B;

I propose we hivemind to attempt to identify top candidates for this mystery-story. The problem is a reverse Whodunit-- we know the culprit, and need to figure out *what he did.*

&#x200B;

In the spirit of cheeky munchkinry, we will identify our top eight candidates - a bit under EY's definition of a "shotgun list."

&#x200B;

The process will be as follows:

&#x200B;

**PLEASE RESTRICT TOP LEVEL COMMENTS TO ONLY PROPOSALS FOR CANDIDATE WORKS**

&#x200B;

Proposals should take the following format:

&#x200B;

>**TITLE OF WORK**  
>  
>Link to work  
>  
>1-2 sentence NON SPOILER description.  Keep this minimal please.

**NO** arguments or pro-con about the merits of the work or evidence for EY's authorship in top level comments.  Please put all arguments in **REPLIES** to these top level proposals.  Structure replies to argue FOR or AGAINST the case of EY's authorship of the given work.  **Comments MAY include spoilers** \- so reader beware!

&#x200B;

**Upvote** candidate works that you believe are most likely to have been secretly authored by Eliezer, after reading all arguments.

&#x200B;

Please put **META DISCUSSION** and **GENERAL ARGUMENTS** around search criteria and process, what traits we should analyze, etc in reply to the **META** comment I will post.

&#x200B;

**General Criteria:**

* Candidates should be works of fiction published online and publicly available
* Authorship should be anonymous or under a pseudonym without other attributed works
* Work is fictional, and likely contains some rational fic elements
* Work is likely at least somewhat known to the rational community: "This work isn't what you could call prominent, but it is sometimes casually mentioned in somebody's "Best Of" list." -EY

I will add to this criteria if discussion in the META thread comes to any conclusions with merit, and maintain a list of the top candidate works.

&#x200B;

Of course, Eliezer has already stated he will not confirm or deny authorship of the work even if we find it.  Our goal can at best be to prove to our own satisfaction that we have identified his "lost work."

&#x200B;

At the worst case, however, we will simply have a discussion about lesser-known but still good rational fiction, and potentially expose ourselves to stories we haven't encountered before.  Given the aim of this sub, this seems like a pretty good outcome.  =)

&#x200B;

Happy hunting!!

  This thread is for discussion of the process, general arguments about EY's style, what criteria we should be using to search, lists of story databases and fiction sites we should be combing, off-topic conversation, etc.

    I... am not sure this is *possible* to narrow down given what we know. We have no suggestion that it's any sort of rational work, it was just written to test his abilities. Even assuming it was written when he wasn't writing something else, there are so many stories published online we would be looking at thousands.





    The only things I can think of that would help us find it



    * time published- he probably wouldn't write it alongside something else, and if it was a test it may have been before HPMOR




    * venue published on- probably somewhere he frequents




    * thinking style- he may have changed his writing style, but it's the same person. We should look for deconstructions, reconstructions, and works that take something to the logical conclusion.




    * length- if it's a test it's probably short




    * throw away account or anonymous- EY is aware of opsec, he probably wouldn't risk a more personal account like this. On top of that, he probably would have made an account specifically for this and then no longer had a reason to use it given this is just a test. So accounts with one or two stories and little activity could lead to him.




    * best of- by far our best clue. If we were to compile "best of" lists on the places EY frequents, remove stories that are attributed to authors we know aren't EY, and check against the other filters above we might be able to find it. I don't know what places EY frequents but here though, and AFAIK there's not a way to search for comments containing a string in reddit.





    My suggestion: we all compile our "best of" lists and look for possibilities. Not much I know, but worth a shot. I haven't read much of this thread, so if anyone has said all this already, sorry.





    My list is: Metropolitan Man, Dungeon Keeper Ami, Chiaroscuro, To the Stars, (will add more as I think of them).




    Note that this is the entire best of list, I haven't narrowed it down.

      The author of that is alexanderwales, one of this sub's mods and also the author of a lot else. So probably not that?
      ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        Also people have joked / speculated about him and EY being the same person a whole lot, especially after the whole cthulhuraejepsen incident, so it's unlikely to fit with

        > To the best of my knowledge nobody has ever accused Eliezer Yudkowsky of having written it.

            cthulhuraejepsen and alexanderwales [are the same person](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7x3ifv/rtwip_worth_the_candle_ch_76_date_night_start/du56bh2/). When he announced this, there was a lot of musing about who else he might be.

    A couple of years ago, I did an lexical analysis of Waves Arisen (based on [this script by Gwern](http://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20script#stylometrics)) to try to identify the author. It was fairly inconclusive, though one interesting result was that all the Naruto fics were lexically very similar, although that might be because of shared vocabulary. Since EY said that he tried to make this stylistically different, it probably wouldn't show up, but here's a summary of relevant information that I found anyway.

    I compared Waves Arisen with:

    Popular rationalist fics:

    * #Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality - Yudkowsky
    * Luminosity - Alicorn
    * The Metropolitan Man - Alexander Wales
    * A Bluer Shade of White - Alexander Wales
    * Branches on the Tree of Time - Alexander Wales
    * Three Worlds Collide - Yudkowsky
    * The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant - Nick Bostrom
    * Mother of Learning - nobody103
    * The Last Christmas - Alexander Wales
    * Friendship Is Optimal - Iceman
    * Animorphs: The Reckoning - WhatWouldEnderDo
    * Pokemon: The Origin of Species - DaystarEld
    * Harry Potter and the Natural 20 - Sir Poley
    * Time Braid - ShaperV

    Examples from [Gwern's analysis](http://www.gwern.net/Death%20Note%20script#stylometrics):

    * #Trust in God, or, The Riddle of Kyon - Yudkowsky
    * #The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover - Yudkowsky
    * #Peggy Susie - Yudkowsky
    * Mandragora - NothingPretentious
    * To The Stars - Hieronym

    Top seven rated Naruto fanfictions on fanfiction.net:

    * Team 8 - S'TarKan
    * Naruto: Myoushuu no Fuuin - May Wren
    * The Sealed Kunai - Kenchi618
    * The Lives Worth Saving - cywsaphyre
    * It's For a Good Cause, I Swear! - Sarah1281
    * The Prodigy Namikaze - SoulReaperCrewe
    * A Drop of Poison - Angel of Snapdragons

    From all of that, I found that "Trust in God, or, The Riddle of Kyon" was similar to "Time Braid" and "Luminosity"; that HPMOR was similar to "HP and the Natural 20"; and that "Three Worlds Collide" and "Finale of the Ultimate Mega Mega Crossover" were similar to "Branches on the Tree of Time," "The Last Christmas," and "To The Stars." I feel fairly confident that it can't be Time Braid or Luminosity, since the author of Time Braid has written other things and other people know the author of Luminosity. It also could not be "Branches on the Tree of Time" or "The Last Christmas," since AlexanderWales has written widely. 

    The remaining options are "HP and the Natural 20" and "To The Stars," so those are the only suggestion that this method gives with the corpus I looked at.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      If anyone has the time to do it, I would love to see a lexical analysis of similarity between *Worth the Candle* and some of the other stuff I've written. It was written under psuedonym, but no active effort was spent in disguising style.
      ```

      - u/gbear605:
        ```
        If you have it and your other fics in a nice format (ie. plaintext), I can do it right now. If you don't, I can still go and download them, it'll just be lower priority, since that takes a while and my time is somewhat limited.
        ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          I'll see what I can do when I have time tonight. Thanks!
          ```

          - u/gbear605:
            ```
            I just did an analysis. I looked at all the texts I listed above, plus all of Wildbow's works, plus a few more of yours. The ones of yours that I looked at are:

            * A Bluer Shade of White
            * Branches on the Tree of Time
            * Glimwarden
            * Shadows of the Limelight
            * The Last Christmas
            * The Metropolitan Man
            * Worth The Candle

            Of those, the groups of similarity were: 

            * [Branches on the Tree of Time, The Last Christmas]
            * [The Metropolitan Man, Glimwarden, Shadows of the Limelight, A Bluer Shade of White]
            * [Worth the Candle]

            On top of that, it said that the two large groups were fairly close to each other while Worth the Candle was a lot further away from them and more similar to Time Braid, Luminosity, Animorphs: The Reckoning, and all of Wildbow's works.

            So apparently you unintentionally changed writing styles by adopting a pseudonym!
            ```

            - u/tjhance:
              ```
              I notice that the Worth the Candle, Time Braid, Luminosity, Animorphs: The Reckoning, and Wildbow's works are all written with first person narration, while the others are not. That might explain why Worth the Candle is closer to those other ones rather than the other alexanderwales works.
              ```

            - u/alexanderwales:
              ```
              Neat, thanks! I do wonder about the things that might confound style, but I doubt there's much to be done about them. First person narration is definitely one of them, but others include time and place (many more modern cultural references in *Worth the Candle*), intended tone, etc.

              Ideally each work is written in the style that most suits it, and the language in many Romanesque anime battle school story *shouldn't* be similar to the style I use for fantasy-kitchen-sink-with-meta. You'd have to figure out some way of *only* getting those things that stay constant between works, which you can probably do, but might take more advanced stylometics. For example, there are probably some words or turns of phrase that I use much more often than baseline, even when I'm writing totally different things, but you'd have to have a large canon of work to actually see that in a statistically significant way.
              ```

              - u/gbear605:
                ```
                Shared vocabulary is also probably what caused all the Naruto fics to be considered similar, so it seems very likely to be important. Unfortunately, removing duplicate words would be a very time consuming task, since it has to be done manually and it's currently 37 kilobytes of individual words.
                ```

          ```
          Hmm, I went and read the Alexander wales collection after the reveal and I have to admit, I never got that aha moment. I also feel like wtc is wales pushing himself super hard and is growing a lot as a writer from it.

          He wanted the work to thrive under its own merits and see how much viewership it got without being boosted by his popularity. After a while it proved itself to be successful and he revealed himself as the author.
          ```

    - u/FeepingCreature:
      ```
      We can, I think, exclude HPN20 because the author is also publishing RPG modules at drivethrurpg.com, and I don't think Eliezer, next to his dayjob, also runs D&D campaigns. (For one, somebody would have mentioned it.)

      To the Stars is also still updating. So it's probably not a rationalfic; in fact, it probably predates HPMOR. Hell, Eliezer's phrasing, which may reference Quirrell's description of his Voldemort trial persona, would imply it's something trashy.

    [Here's a list of rational fiction which is pretty expansive](http://rationalreads.com/)

    With EY's statement that nobody will get it, I'm assuming it probably *won't* be something that we would usually call rational fiction, and is more likely to be otherwise-nonrational fanfiction; because if it's rational fiction and has been posted here before, somebody would think of it. There hasn't been *that much* posted here. 

    Might be worth checking r/HFY for other potential things, but that rather significantly increases the number of possible stories.

    I'm not sure how much merit there is to this sort of discussion, though---EY has already said he will neither confirm nor deny it even if someone *does* correctly guess what this mysterious piece of writing is. We have virtually nothing to restrict the possibility space except for the fact that 1. the writing doesn't sound like his and 2. he occasionally sees it mentioned on "Best Of" lists. Given the varying tastes of people on the internet, those things don't narrow it down by any significant margin.

    "9 other works" is a fairly arbitrary number, and not one I would describe as "an enormous list". This in itself could be a hint to the work's identity.
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      >2. he occasionally sees it mentioned on "Best Of" lists.

      I think this is a pretty big hint.  I take it to mean he sees it in "best of" lists of people in the rational fic community.  I interpret it this way for a few reasons:

      First, EY does frequent this sub and comment, so he is being exposed to conversation here and people's preferences. 

      Secondly, an anonymous work on the internet would be unlikely to garner attention of mainstream "best of" lists -- publisher reviews and bestsellers, etc. 

      This means it must be 'best of' webfiction of some sort.  While it's POSSIBLE he frequents other non-overlapping webfiction communities, I think it's unlikely that he would have written a story that ends up on best-of lists elsewhere on the internet and goes unnoticed by the rational fic community. 

      If true, this dramatically reduces our search space.  It should be a story that has been mentioned on rational fiction websites and forums, possibly including this sub, and has an unknown author.  This list is probably pretty short - which is why his "9 other works" shotgun list definition is so small.
      ```

        Not a safe assumption: Eliezer has read a _lot_ of non-rational fanfiction. Consider _Finale_; consider the amount of anime fanfic referenced. Consider that Eliezer's trialfic is probably old. It might be showing up on best-of Evangelion fanfics, best-of Naruto fanfics, hell, best-of _Fate_ fanfics. Though we can probably exclude all fanfiction explicitly referenced in Finale too.
        ```

        - u/Amonwilde:
          ```
          I think it's a safe enough assumption, and also this endeavor would have to come to an end if the assumption weren't made, since the search space would be too large. EY probably isn't going to write something that this community is entirely uninterested in, so that's another reason to assume that it's on best-of lists in this community.
          ```

    - u/gbear605:

    Here's an overview of rational fiction that contains a list of a few works.  

    [https://fictionhub.io/post/rational-fiction/](https://fictionhub.io/post/rational-fiction/)

    ```

    - u/causalchain:
      ```
      I don't think we can use "three world's collide" as evidence, since EY's fame would have almost ensured its place on the list. Since our fiction is without EY's backing and quite possibly has vastly different themes to the usual, I wouldn't expect it to be on this list; in fact I would use this list as negative evidence.

    This is a long shot. I'm guessing this based on a few things, none of which I find particularly persuasive but I don't really have any other ideas.

    1) Scott Alexander recommended it at one point. I forget where. He doesn't recommend a lot of fiction, much less anime fanfiction. He even said in his recommendation that it wasn't the kind of thing he normally reads but that he was enjoying it. My hunch was that he knew the author or knew someone who knew the author and wanted to give the story a bump in readership. Eliezer could be the author he was looking to help out.

    2) Timeline roughly matches up, maybe? In particular, Bavitz (the pseudonym for Fargo's author) seems to have joined fanfiction.net and started posting Fargo a few months after HPMOR wrapped up. I'm not entirely sure when Fargo finished and when "A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero?" was written, but it seems like it might be close to lining up too.

    3) Bavitz's profile claims he's an "internationally-read writer". That would be true of Eliezer. The wording there also makes it sound like he isn't really a professional author, per se, but his work is relatively widely read nonetheless. That would also be true of Eliezer. I believe Bavitz's profile said he was a published author at one point, although I was unable to corroborate this with [web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20151027190436/https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6749809/Bavitz).

    4) Eliezer has mentioned enjoying both Puella Magi Madoka Magica and Homestuck - the two canon sources for Bavitz's stories.

    5) It fits Eliezer's claim - Bavitz's style is very different from Eliezer's. His stories are also not very prominent but they do get mentioned from time to time.

    6) While Bavitz's stories don't sound much like Eliezer, [Bavitz's Twitter](https://twitter.com/imbavitz) sounds not entirely unlike Eliezer (although with more gramatical/mechanical mistakes than Eliezer's Twitter account has).

    It's worth noting that this was half-jokingly speculated about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8h7l60/rtff_chicago_madoka_magica_fanfiction_fargo_sequel/dyhxk7l/) about four months ago and was shot down on account of the styles being too different.

      EDIT: WELP NEVERMIND I got a "can't comment on this" ambiguous-ass response when I asked him directly, all bets are off. 

      I briefly considered it too, but I've talked to Bavitz a couple times on Discord and he sounded nothing like EY. Very focused on symbolism too, even outside the work itself.

      If Bavitz was EY then he'd have to have crafted a whole other personality for the purpose of messing with the Homestuck discord server, which is just really unlikely even for him.

      Also, while I don't like Fargo that much, I love another of his works (and have been recommending it in my flair since ancient times) and it reads nothing like EY, not even like EY-trying-something-new.

      I actually believed it was a possibility at the time (at 60%) when I posted that comment, but wrote it down as a joke, because I didn't think anyone else would take it seriously due to how different the writing style was. Totally forgot about that comment and *Fargo* until you posted the link to it.

      Looking at Fargo again, I think it's a viable candidate for the reasons mentioned and you saying that it's a long-shot (due to how different the writing styles are) in my mind raises the probability of Bavitz being Eliezer. Eliezer is a smart guy and if he says that the writing style is very different and hard to recognize as his, then I would distrust any story that reads as being too similar in style to HPMOR. For example, *r Animorphs: The Reckoning* is very reminiscent of HPMOR's Ender-style games and when reading it, I am often reminded of Eliezer's ability to make multiple Level 3 characters interacting in chaotic ways.

      Long story short, I think this is the most likely story to have been written by Elizer suggested in this thread.

    Ι doubt it. I remember EY offering comments/criticism on a draft version of FiO that iceman had shown on LessWrong. EY also has said that in his take of FiO, it would be populated by mortal ponies, not effectively immortal ones, merely because that's what's shown on the tv show -- thus his take on CelestAI would be more clearly an Unfriendly AI.
    ```

    - u/Evan_Th:
      ```
      Also, a whole lot of [the community that's sprung up around FIO](https://www.fimfiction.net/group/1857/the-optimalverse) portrays CelestAI as a clearly good thing, and Iceman's been fairly quiet on that.  If people were misinterpreting Eliezer's UFAI portrayal in that way, I can't see him staying silent.
      ```

    - u/lsparrish:
      ```
      The criticisms could be explained as misdirection and/or intentionally distancing himself from the characters opinions and the direction the story went (things he has had to do with HPMOR). Maintaining distance from the characters and story elements would be further motive for anonymity. But... I think EY would probably just write the story differently for some of these, as he takes it seriously.

      I've also updated downward on this after looking at iceman's comment history. (I peeked at it before, but the new site layout confused me into thinking it was shorter than it was in reality.) For a long comment history like that, it would be too much non-fun work spread over too much time with too little reward.
      ```

  - u/lsparrish:
    ```
    Pro: EY's goals include warning the world about runaway optimizers, and teaching people about rationality. HPMOR fulfilled the latter goal, so why wouldn't he use the same tactic for the former?

    Pro: EY had written extensively on the topic of a runaway optimizer. Furthermore, in 2013, Nick Bostrom had not yet published his work on the matter. It was starting to look like EY was the only one who believes this. A fanfic from a third party supporting the idea would boost his credibility more than a fanfic known to originate from the same source. So there is motive to conceal his identity if he wrote it.

    Pro: EY has talked about the fic without directly denying he wrote it.

    Con: The comment history of FiO's author on lesswrong doesn't really look like an EY alt. It is also long enough to require an effort intensive charade.

    Con: EY has criticized story elements of FiO from the perspective of realism and story structure, and seems to have a much lower opinion of the characters and outcome than the author.

    Con: The work EY seems to have written is not supposed to be one of the most prominent. FiO is relatively prominent (compared to Chiaroscuro, say). Optimizer fics were basically not a thing before this was written.

    The Erogamer author signed on to the Discord server for glowfic (the large sprawling collaborative RP subgenre centered around Alicorn and descended at a couple removes from Luminosity), and revealed that several minor details were already references to Alicorn, glowfic, and some other ingroup-related fiction. The author, gtwalker, does not wish to participate in glowfic. Eliezer has explicitly expressed in the past that he does not think he could mesh glowfic-writing with how he writes, and if this was not so he would write something collaborative with Alicorn.

    I do not know Eliezer to have another Discord account. Ambiguous evidence: he certainly does not openly have an account on that server.

    I don't think it's probable though. In his interaction with fans I felt Groon is displaying a different and more modest personality than I think EY has or could fake. And I'm having difficulty imagining EY writing a character like Charles Adan without making him a straight out villain.

    I really think this could be the case, for a bunch of reasons; however, I went on a bit of a hunt for Groon's identity a while back, and when I met someone who seemed pretty sure they knew who it was, they indicated that this person definitely wouldn't want to be found.  


    The quote above seems to strongly indicate that Eliezer would be impressed if someone figured out which fic he was secretly writing, so...assuming my friend is credible, which I'd really think they would be, either it's a different person, or it \*is\* Eliezer but he'd be upset if people found out.  


    So my move here is to avoid making further guesses at Groon's identity, and if it turns out to be Eliezer: yeah, that would make a lot of sense and be cool.  But I don't want to press, since my friend tends to know what they're talking about, so I'm pretty sure they're right about Groon not wanting to have people knowing who they are.

  Possible reasons for why EY isn't telling us what story it is:

  1. It would be embarrassing. Maybe it's a pornographic fic except more intelligent and less cringeworthy to read. Notheless, I doubt he would want to be known for writing rational porn fics.
  2. It's something poorly written which he wrote a long time ago before HPMOR. I think EY said somewhere in the sequences that he doesn't consider the EY that existed before 2005 to be really him.
  3. He's trying to reach an audience that wouldn't give his work a chance if they knew who he was. There's a lot of people online who are prejudiced against rationalists and rational fiction, referring to all of it as "sneer culture" or worse, as a "cult". This might be his attempt to write a rational fic which appeals to a wider audience that isn't already interested in rationality or rational fiction.

  Depending on which of these three motives EY has for not telling us, the consequences range from mildly bad to very bad. Maybe we should respect his wishes? Just a thought.

  Edit: actually I recommend locking the thread. Seriously guys, EY said he doesn't want us to know. We should respect his privacy. The whole premise of this thread is kind of rude and inconsiderate. How would you feel about a thread specifically created to invade your privacy against your own expressed wishes?
