  [Goodreads link](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77711.A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep) in case anyone wants to check out the reviews. I've copied the summary below:

  > *A Fire upon the Deep* is the big, breakout book that fulfills the promise of Vinge's career to date: a gripping tale of galactic war told on a cosmic scale.

  >Thousands of years hence, many races inhabit a universe where a mind's potential is determined by its location in space, from superintelligent entities in the Transcend, to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures and technology can function. Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these "regions of thought," but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.

  >Fleeing the threat, a family of scientists, including two children, are taken captive by the Tines, an alien race with a harsh medieval culture, and used as pawns in a ruthless power struggle. A rescue mission, not entirely composed of humans, must rescue the children-and a secret that may save the rest of interstellar civilization.

  Can anyone tell me their opinion on joining Tor.comâ€™s eBook of the Month Club? Are the ebooks any good? How annoying are the emails (if any) they send? What are the pros and cons?

    My experience (over the last few months, which is as long as I've signed up for) is that you'll get around one email a week. The last two free ebooks were [Deathless by Catherynne M. Valente](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8694389-deathless) and [The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7235533-the-way-of-kings). I'm not sure if that's a representative sample, though.

    You can also sign up, download the ebook, and immediately unsubscribe, as far as I'm aware. The ebook is a straightforward mobi or epub download (your choice).

  This was actually the first real novel I read in English. I think I was 15 or 16. Can definitely recommend it.
