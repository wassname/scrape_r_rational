## Non Cringeworthy Fanfiction

### Post:

Hey everyone. I've been on this sub for a bit and have run into a problem: I seem to have read all of the ratfic that can be easily found from here that is within a fandom I know about/enjoy (also Luminosity and MLP:FIO when those ran out), and need more things to read. So do any of you have lesser recommended but still awesome ratfic, or, at this point, really just anything outside the usual 90% of awful? Thanks so much.

  I really like [Applied Cultural Antropology](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or). It's about Hermione Grange being sorted into Slytherin.

  I also really love [To the Stars](http://ttshieronym.tumblr.com/). I think it's worth to read even if you aren't into Madoka Magica.

    I watched Madoka Magica just so I could read To the Stars.

      Well worth it, To The Stars is fantastic :-)

      The series is somewhat decent. I'm not sure my mental image of the incubators would be anywhere near as creepy if I'd not watched the anime.

      It was last updated in april this year. I haven't given up hope. But it already spans the content of several HP-books, so I think it's worth a read even if it never get finished (but then I seem to mind dead fics less than others do).

    I usually share your taste but Dreaming of Sunshine completely railroads the plot to canon and abhors changes in the status quo. It's not really a good fic.

      Matter of taste, I guess. It has excellent characterization, clever use of magic, great fights with plenty of munchkinry in them, and an intelligent protagonist who solves problems with her brain. I'd say it's a good fic.

  Saga of Soul
  Not fanfiction, though it is pretty rational, as well as scientific, also deals with people getting powers and how world changes because of them. 
  Word of warning, the author has stopped updating, he said it's not abandoned, just on a long break. But it has plenty to read though.

  I have just one word for you: [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/). Really, really good story, and it has all the best fan fiction.

  Just curious: why the focus on fanfiction?
