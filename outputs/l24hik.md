## Hermione Granger and the Silent Country, ch. 6: Building Bridges (part of a Gryffindor!Voldemort AU)

### Post:

The latest chapter, "Building Bridges," can be found [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/70897179). 

TINTF explores a Tom Riddle who, having been sorted into Gryffindor, remains a Dark wizard but (generally) doesn't view his underlings as expendable cannon fodder and, though he would prefer to live forever, is not so afraid of death that he will make rash and ill-advised decisions like splitting his soul almost as soon as he's heard the word "horcrux."

**This series is being posted in various places:**

  >he invariably handed it off to the black dog that lay at his feet

  Is that...

  > In a corner of the Great Hall was a house-elf, dressed in a bright motley of clothing and carrying a jeweled casket.

  Dammit, Riddle, stop making me like you.

  >anyone whose conduct brings shame on themselves will besmirch the reputation of us all, and be remembered with disdain by each of our schools

  Hmm.  Refusal to participate obviously falls into this category; I wonder what else would.  With that duel we witnessed, I don't think "fighting dirty" would qualify.

  >disqualification will mean expulsion

  Welp.  Hermione's definitely participating.

  >Unobscured by student bodies, the Goblet of Fire flickered white-blue and the flames rose high, reminding her of Peregrine Derrick’s body and the torture—the sheer damage that Haywood had inflicted on him. Even when she turned away, nose deep in Hogwarts: A History, she could hear crackling of the fire, and though she had to be imagining it, Hermione could even smell the burnt-meat charcoal-and-sulfur of the arena stage.


  >The prospect of eating in the Great Hall was frankly unappetizing, and would be for as long as the Goblet of Fire remained there

  Come on, Hermione, *talk* to someone about it.  This is not healthy.  Trust Fleur.  Trust Maxime.

  > Wolfsbane Potion was made freely available to any werewolves to wanted it, and for those who didn’t, monthly portkeys were created to send them to “island reserves,” stocked with game and forbidden even to many members of the Ministry. Aristocratic estates—including Malfoy Manor—were seized. The Muggle-born Protection Act was enacted, and the first abduction-adoptions were carried out almost before the ink had dried.
  >
  >The Wizengamot hadn’t neglected the goblins amid all this. Most relevantly to Hermione’s current topic of research, Riddle had overseen the Chattels and Remainders Law, which provided that the laws of the goblin Redeguild would retroactively take precedence in all economic dealings with goblins and wizards.

  Dammit, Riddle, **stop making me like you.**  Even in a paragraph with "abduction-adoptions," it's hard not to like you.

  >Unbidden, Hermione’s mind conjured visions of the duel, and Haywood standing triumphant

  In the nicest possible way, Hermione: GET HELP.

  >Her father worked as some sort of freelance handiwzard

  That seems reasonable, given his talents (though there's a missing 'i' in "handiwizard").  I wonder why he isn't working at his old job.  Fewer people pranking Muggles, less enforcement of the same, or a dislike for Riddle?  Given Ron's tirade about Bill, probably the third of those.

  >Her eldest brother, Bill, was a Curse-Breaker at Gringotts Bank

  Sounds legit.

  >Charlie, whom Hermione had seen sitting at the High Table during meals, was the assistant professor for Care of Magical Creatures

  I can see that.  I imagine he'll be just as thrilled as Hagrid was if the dragons show up.

  >And Percy, the first of the Slytherin Weasleys, had joined up with the Department of International Magical Cooperation

  No big surprise there, except maybe that he isn't a new-style Gryffindor, since he's working for the Ministry.  Although maybe that's the point.  Canon Percy was sorted into Gryffindor, despite seemingly being more suited for Slytherin, possibly due to his parents' prejudices; maybe the reverse is true here.

  >“That’s Padfoot, the headmaster’s dog,”

  IT IS!

  >At least cats kept themselves clean.

  I wonder what happened to Crookshanks in this timeline.

  >“He teaches two classes. It helps that they’re both electives, and that Werewolf Studies combines all four houses, but he still spends more time teaching than anyone else, and he’s the Gryffindors’ Head of House, and he’s out of commission for a couple days every time there’s a full moon.”

  Was the second class a deliberate omission?

  >“I just said the Ministry isn’t—At least Percy isn’t dating a Death Eater!” Ron said, close to shouting.

  Yeah, that tracks with Bill working for Gringotts.

  >“Sometimes there’s no other way to head off an argument, you see?”


  >Fred drew his wand back for a moment. “And I’m Vice-President Also Fred Weasley, but you can call me ‘Al!’”

  It's nice to see that some things remain consistent across all possible timelines.

  >“You don’t know this because it happened after he killed you, but eight years after your duel, Mulciber was accused of...improprieties with his house-elf.”

  Did... Did George just make that up?  That does not seem like it adheres to the spirit of the rules of Portrait Club.

  >“You had seven, Thaddeus, and you transfigured them into hedgehogs!”

  Ooooof. I imagine this might have been a lot more fun if it weren't so one-sided.

  >Poliakoff and Viktor had never really stopped talking, but now they brought Hermione into it. “Her...mee-oh—” Viktor started, and Poliakoff punched him lightly in the shoulder and whispered something. “My? My. Her-my...oh-nee?” he said and, when no second punch came, he repeated it with more confidence. “Hermione?”

  D'aww.

  >Madame Maxime—disappointed. Professor McGonagall—”I told you so.” Fleur—sad, shocked.

  And, then, of course, Fleur enters the tournament.

  The next chapter ought to be good; we pretty much know who the three champions are (unless there's a twist coming), but will there be a fourth?

    > Was the second class a deliberate omission?

    Not really. It just didn't fit the flow of the conversation. The other class Lupin teaches is Ghoul Studies. 

    > I wonder why he isn't working at his old job.

    Arthur...ran into some trouble a few years ago. 

    > Ron's tirade about Bill

    To clarify: Ron's actually mad about *Charlie* (who works directly for Riddle, as an assistant professor). Ginny brings up Bill because he's "making something of himself" without working for the (Riddle-linked) Ministry. 

    Rereading, though, I can see how that was misunderstood, so... /adds another edit to make during the hiatus

    > Did... Did George just make that up? That does not seem like it adheres to the spirit of the rules of Portrait Club.

    George was just prepared. There's a surprising amount of study required to prepare a good Portrait Club session ("the portraits know what's up and need to get riled up before they'll fight" is an increasingly frequent problem, as we'll come to hear about in the future). 

    > That girl needs therapy

    Hermione's Parents: Oh, Professor McGonagall, Hermione's studying abroad at Norway!

    McGonagall: I'm afraid she's not...

      > Arthur...ran into some trouble a few years ago.

      Iiiinteresting.  I don't remember that being covered in a previous story, so I'm guessing we'll get more details on that later?

      >To clarify: Ron's actually mad about Charlie (who works directly for Riddle, as an assistant professor). Ginny brings up Bill because he's "making something of himself" without working for the (Riddle-linked) Ministry.

      Ah.  That makes the “Not the whole family” thing make more sense, if Ginny is referring to Charlie (who works at the school and could therefore join them) and Ron is pretending she isn't.  But, it wasn't obvious; my instinct from canon was, at first, that Ron was mad at **Percy**, but that went out the window with the "Death Eater" line, so I had to go back to try to figure it out.

      > George was just prepared.

      In that case, you might want to make that clearer.  There's the allegation, Thurkell pouncing on that bit of gossip, the denial, and then the rest of the show we saw was almost entirely a one-sided beat-down of Thurkell by Mulciber, with the fact that the former resorted to violence to try to win the argument only reinforcing that impression.  If there really were points that Thurkell could have scored to salvage his dignity at the expense of Mulciber's, it would have made it more interesting (IMHO).

        Yep! It happened after Riddle took over, if that helps your speculation in the meantime. >:]

        > In that case, you might want to make that clearer.

        Re both that *and* Bill/Charlie/Percy, I'll definitely have those on my list of edits during this brief hiatus. 

        > If there really were points that Thurkell could have scored to salvage his dignity at the expense of Mulciber's

        Oh, in that sense, it really was one-sided. The allegations were (probably) false and Thurkell knew nothing about them because he died before they came to light. 

        (On the other hand, they did know of each other before then, so Thurkell might be able to scrape together some "evidence" on the fly, which would probably make the scene better. I'll have to think about that.)

    To be fair, he probably freed Dobby as part of a plot against Malfoy, and not because he cared about Dobby.

  Without the real version isn't it more likely he'd say there's no year minimum? It makes way more sense to divide it by years than age after all

  Were goths really all that popular in 1995 or whenever this is? Especially in France

    Yeah, that's much better. Changed it. 

    > Were goths really all that popular in 1995 or whenever this is? Especially in France

    I've had trouble finding information on France, but it was fairly popular (to the degree that it was ever "popular") in the U.K. (it started there, actually, somewhen between the late 1970s and mid-1980s depending on how you define things), and between Hermione still having some light connections to the U.K. and France being just across the Channel, I figured it was plausible that Hermione would know what a goth was. 

    (If anyone has hard data on France, though, that'd be much appreciated)
