  The first piece of explicit RatFic (I believe?) to be up for a major award! While there are other things put up that we all point to as great Rationalist Fiction, I don't think those authors were aware of/writing as RatFic (esp since many of them pre-date the genre)

    what makes it explicit ratfic and not just good hard scifi?

      I'd say Jamie Wahls working at MIRI and being intimately familiar with the genre makes a big difference. You can write things that are cyberpunk-esque back before cyberpunk was a thing, but it's not explicitly cyberpunk until both A. the genre is an acknowledged Thing, and B. you are aware of it and its conventions.

        sure but I mean transhumanism has been a thing for a long time.  Rational fiction and EY don't have a specific monopoly on any of the ideas in the story, nor are those ideas required to make it rational fiction.  as a short story with pretty limited time for plot, few of the 'conventions' of rational fiction apply - ie. consistent rules and worldbuilding, intelligent antagonists, logical problem solving, application of methods of rationality or science, etc.  You could say some of these are used a bit in the brief plot, but not in a way far off of anything, say, Herbert wrote.  

        I mean I liked the story, it feels similar to The Last Question a bit, but I wouldn't have said "now THIS is a prime example of rational fiction!"
