**Synopsis**

“Even if this universe is truly nothing more than a brutal, bloody, shadowy forest, we Cultivators will burn all that we have just to give off a single weak flickering spark in the darkness!

No matter how weak each spark is, how short-lived, how small… As long as the sparks flow unabated, then one day one of those sparks will light some tinder, and that tinder shall light some fallen branches, and those branches shall set ablaze each and every last tree of the forest!

In the end, even the smallest sparks will eventually set the shadowy forest ablaze, and illuminate the whole world!”

**Nice Synopsis from /r/Rational** In FMoC, sweeping social change has changed the landscape of the Xianxia world forever. Secret sects have developed from being merely schools of kung fu to being corporation-like entities, with grandmasters and elders becoming equivalent to CEOs and Board Chairmen of modern-day corporations. Sufficiently advanced martial arts is the flavor of the setting; martial arts is interwoven into the entire world.

Schools of fine cuisine teach their chefs methods for cooking their food with magical fire and secret techniques for punching the flavor from one food into another.Universities host martial arts tournaments instead of football games. Scientists debate if the fundamental unit of Chi is a Chi Particle or Chi Wave, and have built Large Essence Colliders to test their theories on the nature of Chi. Magical physics is a study in and of itself!

The military uses high-powered enchanted swords that home in on the spiritual markers of enemy souls, rather than drone strikes, and invests countless crystal credits into researching military applications of magic.And all over the world, everyday practitioners of magic use their abilities to create new technologies, working alongside regular humans. Thanks to the integration of common humanity with the magic of the Cultivators, all sorts of wondrous things have been created, including healing pods, magical prostheses that can even replace the entire body in extreme scenarios, and even transhuman methods of capturing lost souls and bringing them back to life- all things which were once only available to the magic-users, but which have since become available to all, magic users or not. Heck, they even built a magic internet for muggles and wizards alike!

  So is the MC "special" like most xianxia fics? I guess I'm asking if he ends up outshining every other person in his generation? Most xianxia I've read seem to require the MC to move on to some location where the cultivators that used to appear to be strong look like backwater hicks every couple books.

    I don't know. /u/Drazelic will have to be the one to answer that question since he's read it in the original language.

      tl;dr: No, the universe does *not* revolve around the protagonist, in this case.

      The main character of the story is highly competent and through sheer luck has access to the complete life-experience of a high-level cultivator from the past, but it's not the kind of completely broken hax where nothing else can even remotely compare, and its relevance falls off very quickly after, like... chapter 500-ish? I haven't seen it mentioned in a very, very long time. As the story has shifted further and further away from shonen-esque 'beat things, loot the corpses, level up' storytelling, and more towards hard science fiction and conspiracies that wouldn't be out of place in a James Bond movie, the author has correspondingly devoted more and more attention to the protagonist's beliefs and thoughts and less towards painstakingly detailing exactly how powerful the protagonist is now.

      This, I think, was an intentional choice by the author to support the premise of 'might does not make right' that constitutes one of the story's main thematic threads. The protagonist's *powers* aren't important, his *actions* and *beliefs* are.

      The power-cap of the book is pretty sane as well; the story raises the stakes by expanding the scale of the conflict on an economic and social level, rather than just by multiplying the number of planets the characters can explode with a single pinky-flick by ten or whatever, and the story does a good job of keeping previously introduced figures of power relevant to the story- and, moreso, keeping them relevant in a way that doesn't rely on personal destructive potential. Characters in this book tend to remain salient in the reader's mind as 'the cunning, paranoid, but also somewhat tired head of the magic CIA' or 'the charismatic ideological villain who wants to change the social structure of his culture' rather than 'the level 4 guy with the fire superpowers' or 'the level 28 guy who can summon evil demonic dragons from the nether realm to devour souls' or whatever.

      People are *people* in this story, not walking superpowers plastered on top of the generic murderhobo character archetype. That's one of the things I really like about this story, the fact that the characters are memorable not for *what superpowers they have* but rather *what they fight for and what they believe in*.

      (Though, the protagonist's *girlfriend*, on the other hand, plays the "I am a ridiculously overpowered prodigy who can handily beat everybody else in my age range and level up like it ain't nothing" thing straight, as a de-facto genius prodigy. The novel repeatedly states that, on sheer destructive power and rate of leveling up, the romantic interest beats the protagonist just about every time.

      I am pretty sure this is the author poking just a little fun at how xianxia stories usually go, by taking the stereotypical 'beat everybody up forever' shonen protagonist and making them sort of like a 'hey, while our protagonist's story is going on, don't forget that *everybody else* is also doing things behind the scenes too, it's not like our protagonist is the only active mover and shaker in the whole damn universe' reminder. Because as all xianxia readers go, a lot of xianxia falls into that 'only the protagonist can get anything done, ever, and all the other characters just end up scenery' trap.

      It's a nice reminder, I think! The "Slytherin marries Gryffindor" relationship the two of them have is pretty interesting, and it helps set up an implicit tone of egalitarianism. No matter how badass the protagonist gets, he's never so badass that he's the *only* badass in town. If he ever forgets that, I'm sure his girlfriend will be all too willing to cheerfully beat it into his head in a very literal sense :P

      I really like the romantic interest in this novel, if you can't tell. It is literally the only meaningful romance I have ever seen in xianxia, where the characters are actually organically drawn to each other because of mutual respect for each other rather than just because most xianxia writers feel like a protagonist isn't complete without a beautiful flowervase girlfriend.)
