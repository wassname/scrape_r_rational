  Homestuck rational fic? I'm in! I'll edit this comment later with my impressions. Given that it's Homestuck tho, I'm willing to wait another 900 pages to cast judgment.

    ```
    It's not really a rationalfic of Homestuck per se -- just a Homestuck-inspired (copyright-violating-ly inspired!) story with rational-y themes.

    Obviously feel free to pass on this story if that sucks out the appeal of it for you!

    Edit: Crap, I dunno why I assumed you had assumed that -- sorry haha
