  This is meant as a deconstructive take on the Xianxia genre, mixing in horror and mystery elements for the characters to puzzle over in their attempts to survive and thrive.

  edit: I'm not allowed to make a new thread yet so here's the second chapter (01:02 - Measure & Inject): [https://qaod.wordpress.com/2018/12/23/0102-measure-inject/](https://qaod.wordpress.com/2018/12/23/0102-measure-inject/)

      Some things may be confusing without having read any xianxia before, but my ultimate intention is that keeping with it should make all the elements clear and explicit eventually. Even people who have read xianxia before will encounter a lot of new things.

          Not any specific work, but more common setting elements and concepts. However, if you're just looking for Xianxia works, I cannot recommend any better than I Shall Seal the Heavens and A Will Eternal.

          edit: And if you are into the classics, of course, Journey to the West.

  This is pretty good so far!

  *Forge of Destiny* and *White Collar Cultivator* are the only xianxia stories I've ever read, but I will probably be familiar enough with the genre to be able to appreciate the deconstructive elements. The fact that it is apparently also horror and mystery is intriguing.

  There a good way to get notified by updates? Not immediately seeing something on the site.

    I am very new to wordpress, so if you know how I can set it up so you and others can get notifications, please let me know. I'll also look into it myself.

      I have no clue. It would definitely be easier for people to actually discover and actively follow if it were on a website like RoyalRoad or something.

        Thanks! I am definitely cross-uploading on other sites. RoyalRoad is currently in the verification process. Here are links to Ao3 and Fictionpress:

        I've also found good info on email-based notifications for the blog, so that should be available as soon as I can get it set up.

  Seems interesting, I am curious on how you will be deconstructing Xianxia, I look forward to reading some more

    Thanks!

  As someone who's exhaustively combed NU for good Xianxia, and is often disappointed, I very much look forward to this.

  My suspicion is that this is going to feel a bit like Max Gladstone (Two Serpents Rise etc). That's good!
