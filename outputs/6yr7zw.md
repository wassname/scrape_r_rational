  You know, I don't always like every twist and turn that this story gives us, and sometimes I feel like the revelation that we're presented with is not as good as the expectation that was in my head, but it's been running for a year now and the plot is actually progressing and the author keeps finding new ways to get us turned around and disoriented. 

  [spoilers](#s " anyway, anyone have any idea what's up with the writing on the walls? my first thought is that the shelter has been co-opted by the poachers but that doesn't explain why that guy is here. it seems like something bad is happening in the shelter, though.")

    [spoiler](#s "I think something bad already happened. Those must be the names of the guy's dead siblings (we can see Lucas and John among them). He probably wrote that stuff during the years of loneliness after they died. "Poachers" might have something to do with what killed them.")
