## Animorphs:. the reckoning is a fantastic piece of writing

### Post:

I'm only in 2 books and I'm absolutely blown away by the sheer quality of this fan fic. I've never had a book where every single character is this engaging, I look forward to every single character's chapters with equal eagerness it's incredible. I also feel like it doesn't fall into the trap of some rational fics of only having the protaginists being rational and smart. Visser 3 is constantly playing 20d chess with himself and his host and it makes him terrifying along with how accurate and strategic he can be with his plans. Just every bit of this story is excellent and it's incredible

  It's still a WIP, right?

  Not to be *That Guy*, but I just don't have the memory to keep track of a zillion different concurrent stories in my head, and there's so much great stuff that's complete I can afford to be picky.

  Unrelated, but Mother of Learning and HP: Methods of Rationality are the only complete /r/rational web serials I've read. Worm is in my queue... Any other complete series I should be binging?

          Unsong is a masterpiece, I don't think it's exactly rational. More the exact opposite of rational. :)

            Disagree. I would argue that Unsong is rational within a wholly unusual setting. True, there is a lot that would not make sense outside of that setting, but that is because that world is... very, very different than ours.  


            I will warn OP that Unsong, besides being a wonderful read, is a bit... odd. Rare is the book that can successfully make humor based off of Jewish Kaballah and computer programming simultaneously, and have multiple levels of jokes in each. And it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if it is... it's wonderful

              It's not a matter of opinion that people are free to disagree on.  It is *explicitly* not rational fiction.  It's like that one freerunning video that keeps showing up on pure parkour forums—it's nonrational fic that caters to exactly the kind of reader that loves rational fic.

            I think it includes all of (pasting from sidebar)

            * Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
            * Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
            * Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
            * Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows ~~known, consistent rules, as a consequence of~~ rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

            *Some* of the worldbuilding is top-quality rational stuff, with other parts that are entertaining but not so well-grounded in consistent rules

        I totally believe it's the last book.

        Book Four was over 100 chapters. Book Five was over 120. 

        We're 50 deep into Book Six now. I wouldn't put great odds that there are 90 chapters left (which would continue the pattern), but it doesn't seem like a crazy estimate either.

    [Chili and the Chocolate Factory](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13451176/1/Chili-and-the-Chocolate-Factory-Fudge-Revelation) by gazemaize. It's a deconstruction of rational fiction. A real mindscrew, if you can throw yourself into the surreal worldbuilding into it.

      If it has rational elements, it takes forever to actually add them FYI, OP. IMO, not worth picking up this fic for the rationality factor, though it is pretty nice as a "turn your brain off, lol I'm so random" fic.

  This fic feels more canon than canon to me. The Animorphs are actually trying to save their species rather than dick around for three years. The Andalites are as contemptuous of us as the Protoss are of the Terrans. Visser Three, as an extremely ambitious Yeerk in the brain of an Andalite military genius, is where the fic really shines. He's an utterly terrifying villain, a lone wolf and utility monster with several civilizations' worth of tech backing him up, rather than a bumbling doofus who gets duped by teenagers into dyeing his fur purple.
  ```

- u/DavidGretzschel:

  I definitely like the book and it tries so many things, that I haven't seen anywhere else, so I do respect the effort.  And it's a very thrilling ride, thru and thru.

  But it has uhm.... data presentation issues.

  \[warning, many spoilers ahead\]

  There's clones, morphed humans, Yeerks, mini-Yeerks, distributed Yeerks, Andalites, Thoughtspeak, birdperson, Eids, Hiracs (which one was that, anyway?), dains, residual Toms, Esplin and Alloran, the many presidents of the United States, clones, decoy clones, sentient ships, coalescions, War Prince Jake's guilty conscience about totally wanting to bang Marco's mom (that's how I read it, anyway), Aximillilili and Elfangor, War Prince Jake's black box, fifty shades of Marco....... kinda all blurs together, sometimes.

  I don't read a book with pen in hand and with full concentration, I read for leisure, so I don't want to do tedious mental bookkepping to keep things straight.Part of it, is the many numbers. I do enjoy that they are there. Numbers make the story more rational and nail down the context.

  But....I know it is a literary convention to write out numbers as words. Only because it's a convention, doesn't mean it's not a terrible idea.Honestly, if that convention didn't exist, I think the average book would be more rational, simply because it would be easier to present hard data.On a math test, they don't write out numbers either, since you're supposed to quickly think and be able to manipulate the numbers. Why is reading a war story any different?Of course, in some sense, the characters also have to do that mental translation step, so it's "only fair", but they have the advantage of being in the story and thus having more intimate context.Reading "sixtenhundred thousand" is a lot harder to parse than 160.000. And there's a lot of numbers.

  Especially a problem, if you're a native speaker of a language, where numbers have a different Endianness for two-digit numbers. (like German or French)Since two digit numbers are often in the leading position of a larger number, this language interference issue comes up a lot.

  A lot of the multifacted characters are pose a challenge to present coherently write. Parentheses, hyphens and so on are used. Also cursive, but I think authors always vastly overestimate how visible and salient cursive actually is (not very, when one reads quickly).

  The lines of thoughts are referred to as "one glow, one bright, one shade, one dark" in the first Ax-chapter. That..... are some difficult to distinguish properties, since shade and dark and bright and glow seem to resemble each other.

  Though when Ax speaks in Parentheses-threads, I don't get the feeling that this is different from how I think.Like:(We shall have cheeseburgers! There is a McDonald's over there.)((But McDonald's cheeseburgers are lackluster.))(((But there's a Burger King over here!)))((((Burger King cheeseburgers are indeed better, but that Burger King's card reader is broken and we don't have cash on hand))))(((((We shall not eat cheeseburger, then!)))))

  Look, five threads, is my intellect thus superior to even an Andalite?No, that's just sequential thinking. One thought after another.The ()-constructions never seem to run in parallel, so they don't read as any kind of special Andalite superthought.

  Also I wish we would get color coding for all those threads.Also I wish we would get color coding for Esplin and Alloran.

  I mean.... thought-speak being confusing is a running gag, but can't we as the readers get colors?

  Also the "in media res"-nature of many chapters is extremely jarring sometimes.The chapter starts and one of the Marco's shouts "Heimdall!". And I think immediately two Marcos get themselves killed, because they wander off? I still don't know who the hell "Heimdall" is. The Marcos have some kind of id-system where they come up with 12 digit random numbers, but I'm not gonna follow that, because I'm not a Marco and a Marco certainly isn't writing the numbers as words, when he thinks of them.

  The plot also just kinda skips over details. Like one of the Marclones must have witnessed everyone in São Paulo dying around him of radiation poisoning, but this isn't explored or even mentioned.

    Yeah, I'm most of the way through it and although it's very fun, there's just *so much* happening that it's getting harder and harder to keep track.

    One thing I'm really struggling with (spoilers) is the "backups". The story is highly character-focused and character-driven, which I love, but it's hard to keep a handle on the character development when it keeps getting reset by days, weeks, months, and I have to keep track of which of their critical paradigm-shifting moments each character does and doesn't remember. Sometimes that creates frustrating situations--like, how Jake felt about Marco's confession (and how Marco felt about how *Jake* felt) was left unresolved for chapters upon chapters, and then Jake got reset to *before* that happened and they had to redo it anyway. I had the impression early on that the main cast planned on making new backups frequently, but I guess that was just Marco.

  So, I just binge read this fanfic and it is very interesting and well done. I appreciate the way that the author, /u/TK17Studios,  was able to deepen the histories and cultures of many of the alien species. Being able to show the whole way that an Andalite mind might think parallel thoughts at the same time was mindblowing, and I liked the alieness of it. It was like having to learn a new language almost. Similarly the Arn also have a very interesting way of speaking. And of course the fleshing out of the yeerk coalescion and how that works was fascinating.  I also do like that the animorphs are actually trying to win and so do less stupid things in general. The fact that everything escalates so quickly just makes sense when you push this story forward, out of the 90s and into our age with quicker and easier access to technology. The changes to the morphing tech and the explanations about its creation help to make some elements make more sense.

  I only have a few critiques. One is that that sometimes it feels like the characters in the main group all sound like Marco. I like Marco. I love the deepening of his voice and thinking process here. But, I've always thought Marco's ability to point out the issues in scenarios made him somewhat unique and when everyone does it all the time, it kind of lessens that. Is it strange to want some of the other characters to *think less*? Also, the characters of Ax and Tobias especially just don't feel like the Ax and Tobias from the books. Their unique relationship has especially been diminished. With Tobias in particular I get the strong sense that he is a totally different character who just happens to have the same name. The introduction of Garrett as his friend weakens that sense of loneliness from really having no-one and being separate from everyone. The changes to the nothlit rules, which don't allow him to be stuck in hawk morph and thus be an outsider of sorts even within the animorphs group, also changes that. I'm *ok* with this new Tobias, but he will always be distinct from the canon Tobias to me. The effect is that in this version he's no longer my favorite character.

  I'm not sure if I would have liked this fanfiction (or maybe *appreciated*) it as much if I had read it in elementary school like I did with the originals. Where the books have a certain levity and pervasive humor and silliness to them with a background of serious themes and issues, this fanfic brings all of that to the forefront. As a result, it does lose some of that energy, but it is excellent as a thoughtful read. I'm excited about the next chapters and the final arc.

  Edit: Also, I have a theory about Cassie, but I'm afraid to post it cause I don't want it to be changed if I'm right.

  I started reading it based on a previous recommendation here. It's got a lot going for it, but I got dragged down by the angst... okay, yes, war is horrible, it's good that you kids recognize that. Great that you think violence isn't the answer, even when you're dealing with an existential threat from an alien source that barely recognizes your species as intelligent. Your parents raised you well.

  and, gosh, yes, there are a lot of ethical issues involved with cloning and mind control, aren't there?

  but, like, I thought I was going to get to read an adventure story about kids with superpowers kicking ass and discovering how much more there is to life in the galaxy than we ever dreamed. Instead I get kids wallowing over ethical dilemmas while amoral aliens continue the murdering.

  I don't expect it to be a carefree romp all the time, but does it ever pull out of this funk and become *fun* to read?

      Yeah, I remember after the series was over the author wrote a statement to the effect of, "Did you not like how this war ended with characters you loved dead or traumatized? Remember that when you're old enough to vote." It was never *supposed* to be about our heroes casually kicking ass. Even the ethics of morphing and its parallels with what the Yeerks do was directly addressed in the original series.

    Haven’t read the reckoning yet, but the real Animorphs books eventually became so dark that you could argue the theme of the series was “what would it take for the power rangers to become terrorists?”
    ```

  - u/kleind305:
    ```
    Minor/major spoilers for the series ahead, but in the final chapters of the book series, the Animorphs recruit dozens of disabled kids and end up using them as glorified cannon fodder. It is arguably not the worst thing they do, and they're miserable, exhausted, and hideously on-edge throughout.

    &#x200B;

    The series is, if anything, a purposeful deconstruction of exactly that sentiment — albeit somewhat buried by scholastic ghostwriters. Morphing is fun sometimes but is mostly creepy body horror or worse.

    &#x200B;

    To echo a previous comment, [u/TK17Studios](https://www.reddit.com/user/TK17Studios/) has managed to do the 'HPMoR thing' of taking apart an existing canon of inconsistent quality and using the pieces to build something bigger and better. My SO is/was a big Harry Potter fan, but I have to remind her that Daphne Greengrass doesn't 'exist', as far as the original canon is concerned. Nevermind Azkaban and the dementors. 

    &#x200B;

    I don't know if not knowing anything about Animorphs makes the reckoning hard to follow, but I do know that the original characters are every bit as good. It sucks that the fic doesn't get the front-page WtC treatment here, but it absolutely should. 

    &#x200B;

    PS: u/TK17Studios, I appreciate the shout-out earlier on, and even though ACAB, I completely forgive you for making me a cop.

    Here's one data point for you. I am not familiar with the original Animorphs, but I tried to read this rational version, and I found it sheer torture. I kept skimming ahead hoping it would get better, but it never did.

    The angst, as you call it, and the writing style grate on me. All the complaining and arguing that rarely turns into taking action. Characters beginning every other sentence with "I mean..." whether it makes sense or not, and characters not finishing half of their sentences. Frequent POV switches, and the switches usually happen when the action is about to start so that we skip over the action and get to more whining and complaining and endless arguing and worrying about feelings instead of getting down to business and taking action.
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      It honestly makes me feel much better when people who are trying to tear the fic down have to fill their complaint with falsehoods.  Like, "ugh, this just doesn't work for me" is WAY scarier to hear by itself, and makes me feel much more like I've failed as a writer, than a bunch of complaints that just aren't true.

      Anyways, you might be interested in [this review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3041712412?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1) on Goodreads, which seems to me like a pretty close match for your style.

      Well this is rational fiction. Some degree of thinking and introspection was to be expected. 

      I admit that sometimes when I watch action-based works of fiction I complain - not about the presence of action obviously, but about the characters' lack of thinking. So you might still have had a point. 

      But it is very easy to prove that there is in fact a lot of action-taking happening in this fic, so I too wonder why you felt the need to use false statements in your data point.
      ```

      - u/morgf:

        I did not use "false statements". I shared my opinion of the story.

          I am not disputing your having an opinion here.

          However you also said stuff about "whining and complaining and endless arguing and worrying about feelings instead of getting down to business and taking action." Unless I misunderstood you (which is in fact possible as I'm not a native speaker) you were attempting to describe things here. And some descriptions can be more accurate than others, right?

          You did not say "I would prefer if there was more thoughtless action and less thinking in this rational fiction", which would have been a weird but ok opinion to state. Instead it feels like you said there was no action taking, which I think is provably false (but still ok to state as long as you allow others to contradict you ^^)

          - u/morgf:

            Are you seriously arguing that my use of hyperbole makes my opinion wrong? I find it hard to believe that you thought I meant "endless" literally. It seems like you are arguing disingenuously here.

              What I was trying to say is :
              1) your analysis contained opinions and descriptions.
              2) I think that these descriptions are inaccurate, even taking hyperbole into account.

              Also, I feel like yelling "Opinion!", strawmaning and questioning my motives is obviously not the best course of action if you are trying to convince me, so maybe that's not what you're doing rn?
