    Some guy asked a question and he was salty due to my reply for some reason and decided to delete his comments. He did follow my advice though, amusingly enough.

  Ooooo! I absolutely love world-building and in-setting bits of lore like this. It really brings out a lot of depth in the background that lot of fics sadly gloss over. Really enjoying your lore about golems and the undead (two subjects I can't get enough of), and the joys of flesh golems as well. Thank you for posting this. I'm going to be checking out your MoL work a lot more now.

  You've given me some confidence with my own fiction. I've been really wanting to expand the world and in-setting lore on my fiction as well. Make it more concrete for those readers that want something more than a story to read. I've been second-guessing myself at trying that. Seeing how well you've done it, I can't wait to give in on my own work. 

  Keep up the good stuff.
