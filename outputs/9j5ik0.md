  I remember being quite put off by an early scene in which a man has sex with his teenage daughter, and the police are portrayed as unambiguous bad guys for arresting him over this.

    Edit: I mixed up part of the timeline of events. See posts below.

    ---

    Since the author didn’t deign to actually address it, here is a spoilery summary of how I recall that happening, and how it slots into the larger story.

    tl;dr: It can be considered a consensual relationship between two adults without one having power over the other.

    1.  A large part of the story is about sexual moral edge cases. This is one of the cases where it was intentionally constructed to appear superficially repulsive and clear cut to "normal" morality, with the particulars shifting into moral ambiguity. Note: *Ambiguity*, not moral rightness.

    2.  The protagonist in particular can be considered a hardcore pro-sex fanatic and missionary. In effect, the sexual aspects of every situation, no matter how horrifying, are automatically contextualized into something positive. 

    3. The incident itself pretty heavily started off with porn logic. This *lessens* its impact quite a bit, at least to me. Specifically, >!The father sleepwalks into the daughter’s bed, mistakes her for his dead wife and then has sex with her while remaining unconscious!<. Also, the typical father-daughter relationship paradigma don’t apply here, since a) The daughter is (functionally) an independent adult. b) >!The daughter is a superpowered magical girl, reversing the typical power structures!<. c) >!The daughter is an empath, who coaxes her father into the relationship because she can feel how much it actually means to him despite trying to repress those feelings.!<

    4. The cops were there because >!The magical girl’s mascot society decided to mess with the girl. The cops that came were chosen for seeing themselves as puritanical moral guardians, not as law enforcers. They were also given misleading information.!<

    ---

    My personal judgement:

    >!I dislike the porn logic that starts it off, since it lessens how seriously I take it. The whole thing feels kind of fake to me as a result. I also felt uncomfortable when the daughter tried to sort-of seduce her father. (I don’t recall the details.) It felt like she was talking him into something that he didn’t really want, even if it obviously turned out alright for them. Lastly, the cops being effectively parodies didn’t help make it feel more real. It did fit the theme of how the magical girl mascot society impacts the world. Kind of similar to how the witches in PMMM are comical exaggerations of real life things!<

      So I just read up to that part of the story, and I think I agree with /u/TempAccountIgnorePls. It definitely trips my "this is presented as okay but objectively shouldn't be" sense.

      >a) The daughter is (functionally) an independent adult. 

      In what way? She's 16, so still a minor dependent on him for housing, food, etc.

      >b) The daughter is a superpowered magical girl, reversing the typical power structures. 

      She was not yet a magical girl when the relationship formed.

      >c) The daughter is an empath, who coaxes her father into the relationship because she can feel how much it actually means to him despite trying to repress those feelings.

      Same as above. She didn't get her powers until after.

      As for the cops, it doesn't really matter *why* they were there, they still had evidence that a father was having sex with his 16 year old daughter and were written as villains. There's no *actual* misleading information they were given, other than that she consented, which is not relevant to the law anyway. If a ~35 year old man has sex with a 16 year old girl, it doesn't matter if she consented, it's still statutory rape. That he's her father makes things worse, but it's still a crime that they had evidence was being committed.

      Writing them as cruel thugs adds nothing to moral argument and doesn't actually justify the response of the "heroine." Any other cop would have involved child protective services regardless of what the daughter said, and they would have been right to do so. Grooming is a thing that happens in real life to real people.

      Don't get me wrong, if I'm viewing the whole thing through porn-logic it totally works. But as rationalfiction, not so much.

      I wouldn't mind it as much if it were presented as a morally ambiguous situation (or at least acknowledged why some might see it as such), but it's *presented* as this poor innocent girl and her loving father being preyed on by a gang of bloodthirsty bullies.
      ```

  - u/Ephemeralen:
    ```
    This is one of those statements that is technically true but massively misleading, IMO.
    ```

    - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
      ```
      How so? It's been a while since I read it, maybe I missed something
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        It's not exactly an objective narrator, and the police aren't exactly blamed or portrayed badly for arresting him. They are shown as deceptive and not really acting to protect the supposed victim, but that's not really surprising or out of line.
        ```

        - u/TempAccountIgnorePls:
          ```
          The narrator can literally *read minds*. Her objectivity is a moot point, because she knows exactly what they're thinking and feeling, and it's quite unambiguously bad.

          > "That's right," Officer Calton said smugly. "Your daddy's going away for a long time. And you, you're gonna cooperate and say whatever we damn well tell you to say, or I might start suggesting that a girl in your position ought to be placed in intensive psychiatric care. Clearly you've been damaged by your experience, honey. You're gonna play ball with us or you're gonna spend the rest of your life strapped to a bed. Your choice."

          I mean *come on*.

  When will you start on book 2?

  For those of you who missed it [the first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/8ifrxq/rtchfthnsfw_veilfall_book_one_a_rousing_rebirth/), or decided not to make an account on Questionable Questing, *Veilfall: A Rousing Rebirth* is now available in ebook form!

  > After being thrust unexpectedly into the world of the supernatural, a neophyte magical girl has to balance her mundane career in indie porn against the lurking threat of fey creatures hunting lonely men in her city, while the tenuous balance in a fellow magical girl's life comes crashing down on them both in this explicit sexually-charged journey into a dark magically-influenced alternate future.

    I assume that buying a copy from there does help support you, and it doesn't all go just to smashwords instead?  


    Also I note you like the name Eelesia, given how that was also used in Forever After Earth? :-)
    ```

    - u/Ephemeralen:
      ```
      It does, yes. :) I get most of it.

      And well spotted, tho it could be that they're AU versions of each other... :3

      - u/EliezerYudkowsky:

        Wait, is "Eelesia"...
        ```

        - u/Ephemeralen:
          ```
          >///<

          actually tho I made that name up like years before I'd ever heard of you

        - u/ArisKatsaris:
          ```
          I'm sure the ship 'Eliezera' in Forever After Earth is a reference to you, though.
          ```

          - u/Ephemeralen:
            ```
            Its true.

            One ship named for Eliezer. The rest named for the Mane Six.

            But I'm retroactively declaring that there was also a ship called *Azure Butterfly* off-screen. And if you know who *that's* a homage to, have a nectar-cookie.

                yup!
                ```

        - u/Anderkent:
          ```
          I cannot confirm or deny that Eelesia is in fact Eliezer Yudkowsky.
          ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  Are there any differences between the version on QQ versus smashwords? I'm wondering if QQ was a first draft and smashwords is the final version.

  - u/Ephemeralen:
    ```
    There are minor edits and corrections, but nothing major.
