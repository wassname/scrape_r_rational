  Writing yes, publishing, not so much. Glimwarden will start updating again once I've written to the end of the first book and not before; that might be a while. I've written a novel and novella in that time, but won't be publishing those unless it's traditional publishing. I did write about 80K words of *The Dark Wizard of Donkerk* in the last year, linked to in this thread.

  (I have also posted a few things to this subreddit under pseudonym, especially to the weekly challenge, but those are of somewhat lesser quality because I use them as writing exercises and don't do much editing, so I don't want to link them to this account.)

    If you sold on Amazon I'd buy. Or a Patreon. :)

    I can highly recommend this. It didn't read as particularly unpolished to me either.

    Dark Wizard*

    And seconding rec, it's a good read.

    I hadn't realised this was completed!  Just finished reading; I find myself thinking that, given there have been spirit-callers before, the most important thing a spirit-caller should be doing is to arrange communication devices that allow others to communicate like spirit-callers can.  Maybe not permanent in the longest term, but they would only have to remain in use until near when the next spirit-caller was born (a self-duplication-on-command function would help), but otherwise everyone would be back in the same place within three generations, all items/wards/prices intractable again.  Even items that would imitate specific communication signals would be helpful, such as a very specific oathkeeper-related one...

    (That aside, at the end somehow I kept thinking of the ending boss fight of BioShock.  \*amusement\*)

  That would be glimwarden.
