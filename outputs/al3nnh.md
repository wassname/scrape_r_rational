## What qualifies as a rational fiction?

### Post:

I know the examples. But how do you "bound" it to an information theorist? For clarification, consider the hypothetical:

"One has been able to come up with a literature parsing engine using some form of highly advanced NLP. You are allowed to use high-level speech as input to this engine in order to make it categorize the entire published library of human-kind and one of the parameters you want is that the piece of work is rational. You could say that a certain set of rational books as exemplary inputs might do the job, but what if you need a more specific definition."

I've gone through the previous subs, and I've yet to come across a well-bounded answer for this. That being said, it's not as if the other genres are well-constrained.

Note: I'm looking for a one-level deeper analogy which considers the case of "Every story qualifies as a piece of rational fiction and projects thoughtful behavior relative to its original author. A language parsing engine wouldn't necessarily be able to differentiate between an agent in a story coming up with actions vs an agent coming up with a story with actions".

  Just to verify, you have looked at the sidebar?

    I have. I'm trying to account for the one-level deeper analogy, i.e. what would be the definition if it were to account for the rationality of the author itself.

      So you are really asking "What qualifies as a rational author?" 

      Why would the definition be meaningfully different from that of rational fiction?

  Okay this is entirely outside my wheelhouse- you want some kind of machine-learning implementable definition of rational fiction?

  I don't know if that's really possible even in the abstract. Ratfic isn't really a genre, it can cross virtually any medium- it's more like a tag on existing genres. The only shared quality is that the character's behavior seems thoughtful and informed, given the rules of whatever world they exist in. You could do some kind of parsing for written speech and thought that have higher "Thoughtfulness" scores, I guess? Beyond that, a certain amount of genre-awareness seems pretty common, maybe you could cross-reference against tvtropes articles to find significant matches?

    "Okay this is entirely outside my wheelhouse- you want some kind of machine-learning implementable definition of rational fiction?"

    Yeah. I was trying to rethink everything I've read in HpMor and all of the others as being -rightly captured- some kind of machine learning process.

    I'm trying to model the feasibility/practicality of Hierarchical Temporal Memories and this seemed like a fair thought experiment.

    What you're suggesting in terms of "cross-referencing" and "thoughtful" and "informed" is really what's bothering me. They almost feel like the **Words of False Comprehension**. I mean I get the idea. But when I'm thinking in terms of agent behavior, I can't quite mark a tipping point apart from this that some models are simply more accurate in such portrayals than others. Which I presume you've defined with the "Thoughtfulness" score.

      What make you think HPMOR as rational fiction? It's quite possible that it fail in some aspects and not other.

  You have posed this question in a weird way. it seems you are two steps further in your thought process than where your understanding of definitions are. You are asking the question in terms of Neuro-Linguistic Programming and Hierarchical Temporal Memories when you should be asking it in simpler ways. What about the standard definitions of rational fiction are you not understanding, or do not satisfy a coherent idea to you?

    I think I'm failing to isolate the intention from the realization of the rationality of a project.

      **The Intention**
           To create a coherent interesting story in which a protagonist overcomes obstacles in a way devoid of cheap author tricks. Where cheap author tricks can include the protag luckily stumbling upon an item or person that they need or the protag remembering something integral to the plot, before unknown to the reader, that they were told as a child. There are lots of these tricks out there and I'm sure you can think of more of them.

      **The Realization**
           Lets observe hpmor. We know exactly how the protag processes information (We are given a list of books from which he references). The protag will not have any 'secret knowledge' by which to judge things that are unknown to the reader. The actions of the protag are completely understandable if we know how they think and what input is given to them.

      Another way to think about it. is a rational protag can be seen as a function f(x). If they are truly rational we can understand that function and when given input 'x' from the environment (literary universe) it is entirely possible to know what the outcome of the function is before the author writes it. 

      I could probably whittle this down a lil more if you want, but thats all imna write for now.

    I am damn near sure the OP means “natural language processing” :P

  Have you heard of [Wittgenstein’s theory of Family Resemblance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_resemblance)?

  Categories like “games” and particular genres of fiction don’t tend to have some single qualifying metric.  What we consider ratfic just has to resemble other ratfic closely enough that the comparison doesn’t seem like a reach.
