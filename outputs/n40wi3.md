## [Worth the Candle] Some plot elements and character decisions that I have trouble reconciling.

### Post:

So, the original trigger to go after Fel Seed was the U.S.A military uniform found in the Glassy Fields, Juniper theorizing that since he hadn't found any sign of Long Stairs in Aerb despite it being one of their DnD group's major campaigns (+ some other narrative related evidence they later got from Perisev) that the Long Stairs were the dimensional portal that came after Fel Seed. And that it would lead to Uther and possibly Earth.

Now, one thing I didn't fully understand while reading the story as it was released, was the hurry that Juniper seemed to be in to go at Fel Seed. In chapter 221, there are some justifications given, like the fact that he wanted to try while they still had Gold Magic, and that Fel Seed cheats, so any amount of preparation that they do would be moot (which did turn out to be true).

But in the very next chapter, he lost Gold Magic, yet they still kept to the original plan of just blindly rushing Fel Seed, despite not exactly having any extreme impending threats within the next few months. The following dialogue is the only one I found that even contemplates the hurry they are in -

“'I know,' I said. 'But that’s where Uther is, and if we’re going to bring this thing to a close, we have to go there sooner or later. If we don’t, I’m worried about the kinds of threats we’ll see.'” (ch.227)

Now, I find this decision to be weird because of two aspects of the story -

1. Juniper considers the DM to be an asshole but still somewhat competent. And competent DMs would not hesitate to slap down an underprepared party, especially if they took on the final boss when there was content left uncovered, and if the party was not at endgame level.

2. The group were trying to go past the supposed last boss of the entire world. Narratively there was no way they would be allowed to just "bypass" the final boss that the DM set up for them, so it's weird to me that "going past the last boss" was even a core part of the plan.

Another unresolved question so far, was how far Amaryllis' idea of "narrative" applied in the real world. Until now, the DM had worked behind the scenes for the most part, with justifications for major events that the characters run into having placed into the world beforehand.

But as of chapter 236, Fel Seed was resolved via DM fiat, and DM confirms that it was the only way to defeat Fel Seed. This opens a whole can of worms which had already been partially opened in Chapter 215, which is the fact that no one knows what objective reality looks like, and how much the "narrative" theory of Amaryllis applies to Aerb.

Very Crucial Question to ask after the recent chapter : Would the strategy of Mome Rath bone + cloning of Vorpal Blade + Toad Locus assistance(?) have worked in the previous run if they had prepared all of it + maybe more?

If this was Yes (which is very likely to not be the case) then the hurry they were in seems to be pointless. As, if they had waited and prepared more, they could have very likely killed him without Juniper having to go through hell.

The Actual Answer is of course : No. Fel Seed cheats, so no matter what happened or how much they prepared for the first run, they would not have been able to beat him. And this + DM's words confirm that Aerb runs on Narrativium as well. If that was the case, then the first attempt at Fel Seed without a prayer to the DM (as discussed in ch. 228, Fel Seed has no weaknesses) or sufficient preparedness was extremely ill-advised, which is a rare departure from the party's previous ventures.

This answer of course, also breaks the world and the reader's investment in it quite a bit. This is a battle that requires direct DM involvement to resolve (even if Juniper prayed to him before the first run and the answer was "No", that would still be the DM railroading them towards his preferred outcome). The ambiguous actions and "slight nudges" that the DM has taken so far are in the past, and with this resolution the DM is now firmly set up as an Omnipotent entity who directly controls all of Aerb and possibly all of Earth as well.

DM's will trumps everything else, Juniper will only go along the paths that the DM prefers, and perhaps it always has been that way.

---

This of course, very clearly implies that the DM is actually the Author Himself, and the point of the entire story is an elongated DnD session + therapy for Juniper (whoever he is) to get over his past issues. >!/s!<

### Comments:

- u/RiOrius:
  ```
  IIRC the reasoning behind the rush to the end was based on two things. First, they were hitting diminishing returns on power ups. Juniper had all the magics available to him capped, level ups weren't going to get his caps high enough to get to any boons, and they had entads coming out their ears. Yeah, there's always more sidequests to do, but the party wasn't going to win or lose based on a few points in STR.

  Second and more importantly, another year or two spent on grinding would have consequences. Exclusions and entad losses which could leave them at a net power loss, but also a year or two of crises thrown at them. Things were going to be bad for the world at large. People would die. Probably not party members, but civilians. Cities.

  At the end of the day, they knew they would either win or lose by the whim of the DM. The DM said lose. Can't out-grind a dick DM, so might as well lose quick and try to pick up the pieces afterwards.

  As an aside, my personal read is that the plan they used wouldn't have worked the first time. The bit that some people are reading as toad assistance where Fel Seed can't dodge like he thinks he should isn't weird locus magic, it's Fel trying to activate his cheaty powers and them not working because the DM has turned them off.

    Even so, they did have to put significant effort in preparing to face Fel Seed.  If they had not done that, the DM might have slapped them down *really* hard (as in TPK, including Bethel) and then it really would have been game over.

    Do you feel that a prayer to the DM from Juniper to make the fight fair before going into it the first time would have worked?
    ```

    - u/GET_A_LAWYER:
      ```
      Not the previous poster, but no, Juniper requesting a fair fight would not have worked. The DM almost explicitly said as much in hell. Recall the DM asked Juniper if, in the Earth!FelSeed encounter Juniper would have shown mercy to his players, and Juniper answered that Juniper wouldn't have shown mercy due to his emotional state at the time. 

      The only way to beat Fel Seed on Earth would be for Juniper-as-DM to resolve his emotional issues; there was nothing in-game that could beat Earth!FelSeed. Earth!FelSeed could only be beaten on the meta-level by Juniper himself fixing his own emotional trauma. (More on this later.)

      In my opinion, that's why the DM "revealed" that he hates Juniper, in order to draw a parallel between Juniper's relationship with his players and the DM's relationship with Juniper. We're past the point at which in-game combat matters, and into the part where the characters' relationships with themselves and each other matter. The transition is shown by them beating the Final Combat, the combat so difficult it cannot be beaten by combat. It's then reinforced by the fact that they have (two!) Vorpal Blade(s), a sword so powerful it trivializes all combat encounters.

      In my opinion Aerb is [The Egg](http://galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html), a place created with Juniper's consent for him to resolve his emotional trauma.

        I feel like there was perhaps a second path where they focused entirely on the DM appeal angle the first go around, but it would have been a completely different story less about the world itself and more about using it as a medium to divine the DM's intent and mental state.
        ```

      - u/munkeegutz:
        ```
        I think we got some foreshadowing of what's going on here from "Interval":

        >“No,” I said. “Or … maybe. Between things with Fel Seed, the Dungeon Master, the hells, and before that, Invriezen, and the locus, I’ve been thinking about gods a lot. About how I would do things in an ethical way. I’m thinking of opt-in danger, like there is in video games, some amount of risk and pain for people who want it that way. So maybe, if we both opted into that, then I, as a benevolent god, would have contrived circumstances so that both of us would have been stuck together in such a way that we both had a chance to learn and grow.”

        If the DM really hated Joon, he wouldn't have purged his memory of whatever Fel Seed did to him.  It kind of points towards this whole story being one of those opt-in situations.  Thus, the conversation at the beginning of the story ("Rule Zero") is that consent.
        ```

        - u/gramineous:
          ```
          It wasn't stated if Joon was tortured or just bottled. I don't remember the game over screen implying stuff happened past the decapitation and before hell though.
          ```

          - u/munkeegutz:
            ```
            Fel seed said that june was "in a sorry state" before the city explosion.  I considered that to be "fate worse than death" kind of material.  Fel Seed would be able to prevent someone from dying even if they're freshly decapitated.
            ```

        - u/GET_A_LAWYER:
          ```
          The story explicitly states that Fel Seed cut Joon's head off, killing him, at the end of the first Fel Seed fight. Joon could have bottled at that point, but not tortured.

          Not torturing Joon is out of character for Fel Seed. Not having Joon be tortured is in-character for Alexander though, so I appreciate we were spared chapter of Joon being tortured into insanity.

        > Juniper requesting a fair fight would not have worked

        If that was the case, then would that not be railroading by the DM at that point? Either towards Juniper's own death, or a TPK. Which implies that this was always going to be the intended end for Juniper, and that any character actions, entads, preparations, levelups etc. until that point did not matter in-story. It firmly casts in stone that the DM is controlling whatever happens to Juniper to get him to this (his preferred) ending. No agency.

        Also, the hell arc was a very short time, and Juniper obviously hasn't changed much from Hellfall until his escape. If the FS encounter is supposed to be the DM showing a mirror to Juniper, nothing really changed between the first and second encounters.

        > The transition is shown by them beating the Final Combat, the combat so difficult it cannot be beaten by combat.

        But from the text alone, the combat _was_ how they beat it. Just a better strategy and having Mome Rath bone compared to last time.

        > In my opinion Aerb is The Egg, a place created with Juniper's consent for him to resolve his emotional trauma.

        DM is the Author then? Also, if this theory is true, can of worms again. Why bring Arthur and have him go through the bullshit that he did? Why target and bring Juniper alone? Is he like "the best GM in the world" or something? What makes him so special that the God of both Worlds brought him here just to heal his emotional scars and offer him Godhood? What makes his emotional trauma stand out from those of millions of others in both worlds?

        Or is he not alone? Are dream skewered folks other people brought in to cure them of trauma? But if so why is the world built off of Juniper's ideas?

        And it goes on and on and on...

          Yes. That's how the Fel Seed incident went in the real world too. The DM's behavior is a manifestation of Juniper's time as a DM. Every quirk, belief, and idea he had got thrown in, plus a few more. Played as he would have played them. Fel Seed was the conclusion of Juniper's DM career, and what destroyed his group back on Earth. It's only fitting it destroys him as well. The removal of the game interface symbolizes that this isn't a game anymore. Punches won't be pulled, or artificially enhanced anymore. Full verisimilitude. 

          > Juniper obviously hasn't changed much from Hellfall until his escape

          It's stated that the Hells alter your psychology to make suffering less destructive to your psyche. Though I think Juniper's reconciliation with his party could have been a bit more emotional and breakdown-y, it's at least explained

          > DM is the Author then? Also, if this theory is true, can of worms again. Why bring Arthur and have him go through the bullshit that he did? Why target and bring Juniper alone?

          Maybe! We don't know, and it hasn't been answered in the text yet. Don't mistake unanswered questions with plotholes.

          > Are dream skewered folks other people brought in to cure them of trauma? But if so why is the world built off of Juniper's ideas?

          There are no other dream-skewered. That was a plant by Uther and Masters to lure Juniper.

        Sure. They could have figured out his intent and opt out; they could have embarrassed or bullied him such that it didn't feel like a cathartic power fantasy; they might have been able to take his mind off of things by exposing him to positive emotions. Just abandon the conceit that you're in the DM's world and have to follow his rules.

        Which is kind of hard when you're actually a person in the DM's world and the DM can just tune you out or throw arbitrary distractions at you, and when you don't know the DM's motivations.

  I think this is undercut by the fact that the DM isn't competent in the sense that he's built the world as a place for the players/characters to have fun, learn, grow, etc. He's built it for his own amusement/edification, and Arthur and Joon were basically NPCs from his point of view. It's why he was so upset and frustrated when Arthur wasn't taking up the Call to Adventure that the DM was offering. If he had wanted Aerb to be just a fun campaign for Arthur, he would have simply rolled with Arthur wanting to play a bard/theater troupe story and gone with it. Forcing him to become an action hero was because that's what the *DM* wanted, and he gets some gratification from the fact that his MC is a real, thinking person dancing in the palm of his hand.

  This is why, IMO, he hates Juniper. Juniper flatly refuses to play the game and follow the Narrative as if he were a character in the story at any level. From basically the start, Joon has been playing Aerb as a pseudo-DM/game designer rather than a player, dissecting the systems thinking about why the DM set up the world and how he would do it differently. The DM hates this because he wants people to play *his* game, and Joon just keeps saying, "Yeah, but your game is stupid".

  They decided to rush at Fel Seed since by that point they realized they weren't playing the game against Aerb, they were playing against the DM, with Joon increasingly annoyed at being forced into playing by the DM's rules and Mary increasingly worried that this would lead to a direct confrontation with the DM that they'd inevitably lose.

  The confrontation with Fel Seed essentially became that confrontation, with Joon trying to see if he could just force his way past the DM's systems and the DM asserting that he has absolute power, but that he no longer has any interest in playing with Joon or trying to force him into Narrative like he did with Arthur since Joon would just bitch and complain about it the whole time. So, the DM smacks Joon down, declares the campaign over, and walks away, hence Joon losing the UI layer and becoming essentially no longer being the main character of the story - just a super-powered dude bumbling around Aerb at his leisure.
  ```

  - u/keturn:
    ```
    "Why the DM hates Juniper" is a big question in my mind, but this doesn't feel right to me. His hatred for Juniper in that conversation seemed way, *way* more personal than some upset that Joon tries to beat the system.

    - u/BePatientImAcoustic:
      ```
      > this doesn't feel right to me. His hatred for Juniper in that conversation seemed way, way more personal

      Same here. To me, it seems more like the DM is.. an older, alternative-timeline Joon who never learned to fully like himself.

      When he says he wanted to see Joon suffer, at least a bit, and hated him.. that's like depression talking.
      ```

    - u/JanusTheDoorman:
      ```
      Eh, I think he says "I hate you more than I care about you" or something to that effect, which to me implies that he views Joon as having a negative effect on other things he cares about more than Joon. If he is in some way a projection of Joon-as-DM, then Joon's need to exercise control and influence over campaigns and maintain DnD sessions as his essential safe-space in a life he didn't much enjoy otherwise could be manifesting in the DM as a value system totally wrapped up in Aerb or other created worlds.

      Joon is an existential threat to that norm, or like a bobcat that's stuck in your garage. You probably don't care about the bobcat itself in any meaningful way, but you might hate it because of the damage you think it's likely to do to the things that you do care about in your garage.
      ```

  - u/JustLookingToHelp:
    ```
    Except he still got to kill Fel Seed.  So he's not just "some very powerful dude."  The DM still turned off the cheats for him, and this was probably always part of the plan, if Joon was willing to prefer Hell to Nothing.
    ```

    - u/JanusTheDoorman:
      ```
      Yeah, I think there are two possibilities regarding the DM now:

      1. He's genuinely over-and-done with Joon and is essentially just letting him play in sandbox mode, without setting explicit quests or targets, and is just gonna sit back and let Joon do whatever with Aerb before rolling up his next world or whatever

      1. He's double-faking Joon, pretending he's no longer involved/interested just so Joon stops trying to play "against" him and does something interesting with Aerb rather than trying to constantly circumvent the Narrative.

      If I understood the timelines correctly, the DM and Joon's conversation takes place after the 3-year timeskip, when the DM can be reasonably sure that Mary will rescue him from Hell, so his attitude in that conversation of "this is the end of the line and I'm not gonna be paying attention to you anymore" doesn't make much sense unless he's either deceiving Joon or just so genuinely frustrated at the way Joon approaches Aerb that he's walking away, not buffing Fel Seed cause he doesn't care to try and teach Joon anything, and just gonna let the chips fall where they may.
      ```

      - u/gramineous:
        ```
        I forget the exact conversation, but is it possible the DM stopped caring about Aerb after Joon died and just fucked off for a nap or something? I mean there's the implied crew of underlings to keep Aerb running (the Layman, the Architect, etc), and the point of Aerb was for Arthur and Joon's adventures. Capacity for omniscience is different to permanent omniscience.

        - u/RetardedWabbit:
          ```
          After 3 years of watching Joon be tortured and Aerb without Joon his hatred has chilled but not left. The 3 years reveal makes that conversation even weirder. The DM showed up to insult Joon, criticize his Fel Seed/narrative thinking and tell him he's being "abandoned" out of DM hatred. Even if the DM kind of timeskipped to that time that raises a ton of questions, like why he came back etc.

    It's the style of the original group that they argue about the morality, then jump to the end of the campaign because it seems to make sense.  A different group would have a different endgame.

    It's also partially because the outcome of the first fight seems to be DM railroaded. Like no matter what the party did before then, June or the party would've still died. It's even lampshaded in ch. 238, and I feel the party (being intelligent characters) knew this on some level.

    If that was the case, I just can't seem to understand why they didn't plan for failure or death. The p-space analysis could've been done while June was still alive, and they could've set up the Hell-escape before going for the fight. Mary seems to have had 3 years to plan without too much trouble, so the hurry seems to have been a waste in hindsight.

  Something I haven’t seen brought up is that if I was a DM and my players’ characters got obsessed with narrative when I hadn’t intended that, I’d be pretty annoyed. It’s immersion breaking, after all. 

  Now, it’s hard to say whether or not it was intended by the DM - I believe the two things that set the party down that path was Juniper recognizing tropes and the discovery that Uther also believed in narrative. They might have been allowed to find out about Uther’s belief in narrative, or railroaded into it. I don’t think the DM would railroad Juniper’s thoughts. But what I wonder is, did the party make the narrative elements stronger by obsessing about them? As in, the DM sees that they’ve figured out they’re in a narrative and won’t let it go, so now he has to create a whole narrative about narrative, except he makes it brutal because he doesn’t like that he had to do this. I guess this could apply to both Uther and Juniper.

  I don’t know if this makes sense, I’d have to reread most of the story to get a better idea. Along these lines, I think the Dice Guy and the actual DM/entity controlling the world might be different.

  This is why they're in a hurry. "The DM will destroy the world if we don't do X" is a very powerful reason to do X.

  In-game this comment is actually the culmination of a many conversations where they discuss how applicable narrative theory is to Aerb, and it's the one where they decide the narrative is the driving force and that they need to play along. It's not, "we decide on a whim," it's "we argue about it for a million words and finally come to a conclusion."

  Out-of-game, the author has posted elsewhere about the difficulty in balancing the narrative tension between the joys of wrapping-up and the risks of getting bogged in boring grindy power leveling. (Some of this conversation happens in-story as well.)

  The characters explicitly state that they're (1) at the point of diminishing returns on quest completion, (2) reaching the limits of potential increase in power, both personal and entad, and (3) already the most powerful entities on the planet other than Fel Seed.

  They grind out half a dozen world bosses in one chapter. They are 95% as prepared as they can be: they've literally maxxed-out Joon's character sheet, there are no more new magics to get. Getting the last 5% would be boring to the DM, and more importantly boring to us readers, so the author needs to generate an excuse to rush things. (The player/Joon/DM vs reader/author parallels are an intentional part of the story.) Personally I think Alexander is right – I don't want more completionist wrap-up, I want to see where the story is going.

  The rush is also to generate a feeling of time pressure, to make things feel dangerous and important.

  &#x200B;

  >2. The group were trying to go past the supposed last boss of the entire world. Narratively there was no way they would be allowed to just "bypass" the final boss that the DM set up for them, so it's weird to me that "going past the last boss" was even a core part of the plan.

  Except that's what happened. The whole point of the Fel Seed fight is that Fel Seed can't be beaten by any in-game actions of the characters. Fel Seed can only be beaten at the meta-level by changing the relationship of the characters with the DM, and the DM's relationship with himself. The Aerb!FS fight is the parallel for the Earth!FS fight; it makes explicit that the game is only a reflection of the relationships between the people. 

  There's no in-game power that would let the Earth!Players beat Earth!FS, or Aerb!Characters beat Aerb!FS. The only thing that causes either Fel Seed to be beaten is Joon's development as a person.

    That only "tells" the viewer though. After Juniper acquired Gold Magic there haven't been any proportional threats other than the Dragon Fights, and after that there hasn't been further escalation (other than the call of the Gold). Raven also implies that the Dragons won't get involved further after Perisev's death. And after the Gold Magic loss, there hasn't been any immediate threat in front of them.

    Remember that in-story it took 3 years for things to get worse and even then, the worst parts were due to Valencia's open approach to hell and Amaryllis detonating a rune-bomb and excluding rune magic (both due to the party's direct action).

    Heavily implies that the pacing of the adventure was for the most part within the party's control.



    > The characters explicitly state that they're (1) at the point of diminishing returns on quest completion, (2) reaching the limits of potential increase in power, both personal and entad, and (3) already the most powerful entities on the planet other than Fel Seed.

    Mome Rath's bone and Onion's sword were the key aspects of defeating Fel Seed during this run, both of which they didn't have in the previous fight, which somewhat undercuts this.

    If the world is set up to be at least somewhat consistent, we have to assume the same strategy would've worked previously, but DM dialogue indicates that it might have not.

    Do you feel that no matter what they did the first time around, they would have failed? Do you think the characters at least on some level understood this? If yes, then I can't understand why they didn't create a strategy around their failure.

    > it makes explicit that the game is only a reflection of the relationships between the people.

    If that's the case, what's the point of the world and the story then? If everything is resolved as per DM fiat, it opens a whole can of worms that I've detailed in other comments as to the nature of the world and the aforementioned question.

  IIRC the justification was just that they had already prepared for it so losing gold magic at that point was bad but, because they were already invested they decided to go anyway. Something was said along the lines of 'if we don't go now we'll keep finding reasons to postpone indefinitely' or until the DM forces their hand.

  Kind of lame if you ask me but it is what it is. It feels like AW is kind of done with WtC and wants to end it, which is perfectly acceptable. I'm a bit disappointed though, I expected more from entads, when they were introduced I expected HxH fights, but what we got was just very sharp swords, and very hard armor. Sure Bethel is interesting, but I expected more things like that, rather than this sword can cut through X, or this armor is inviolable, both are clearly powerful but somewhat lame.

    That strikes me as extremely unfair. I'd be surprised if you could name any fiction with a breadth of more creative magic items than what we see in Worth the Candle.

      It's not that WtC lacks magical creativity as a whole. More that it hasn't indulged in that element much in the last arc or two.

      It's all "Gosh, Amaryllis sure does have a lot of enteads now, so many that it's rarely worth mentioning which ones she has with her in Sable or they've fed to Bethel. We'll do all the quests in montage-mode because Juniper is too OP, so it's not worth talking about the strategies or mechanics, and we'll have a lot of scenes with characters moping over *Narrative* and obsessing over FS."

      We also got in to the FS arc as the external world went through the trauma of 2020, and I think I recall reading that there *was* an element of "fuck, WtC *can't* skip Fel Seed, it's too integral to the overall story, but this isn't what I want to spend my time thinking about these days." Which would mean there is some basis for the feeling like AW and Juniper are kind of done with this whole thing.

      Agreed. Sounds like a player complaining, "But I wanted a ring of \*four\* wishes!"

      I can name several, Worm, HxH, jojo, wake of the ravager, one piece, naruto, apocalypse generic system etc. 

      No they aren't exactly 'items' but the magic is in general as creative as wtc if not more. 

      Criticizing creativity is not what I'm doing though, have you seen HxH? Do you know what it's combat is like after characters learn nen? If you do, you know it's on a completely different level..

        I am familiar with all of those and yes, I think Worth the Candle is superior to all of them. Hunter x Hunter ( except for the Ant Arc) is extremely good but I think Worth the Candle is better in basically every metric that matters to me.

          Okay, that's good, and I respectfully disagree.

          I would reeeeallly have loved to get a few chapters focused on the in-depth exploration of ink magic. The possibilities just seem endless, more than just a glorified stat stick of a particular i-Level. 

          But I guess it's quite hard to write a story with the mc as a worm-esque tinker rather than a 5e artificer because said tinker can always prep time their way out of any puzzle.

  I think that though joon would have died in the FSEZ basically no matter what, they could have prepped for that contingency better. Though the rest of the party did get out, it was a very close thing, they should have been prepared (though maybe only the locus could trump fel seed in getting them out). At the very least, they should have already thought of a way to ensure joon goes to hell instead of oblivion, already had a basic list of avenues to pursue to rescue him, and maybe even try to go for more levels so that, if not to help against fel seed, help the party via twinned souls + symbiosis (most likely avenue is using joon + grak to finish the 13 horrors quest (though I don't remember if fel seed is included on that. if it is, then that's kinda moot, though clearing EZ'S still gets XP).

  Just as a quick asside. If any of you were thinking of reading this book. 

  Imagine 6K pages of lamp shading with self aware characters criticizing the lamp shading, the Author contriving ways to gaslight you into accepting the lamp shading, with some will they won't they thrown in. 

  Oh and accepting and forgiving rapists because you're forced into positions where you need them by a spiteful God. Can't forget that.

  Well yeah, the story is explicitly a way for awales to work through some shit.

  The way the characters discuss thing echoes rational fiction, but in a lot of ways that really isn't an appropriate label for the story.
