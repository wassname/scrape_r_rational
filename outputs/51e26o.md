  **Synopsis** 

  All across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

  Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?

  This story has died a few times under the weight of perfectionism and uncertainty, so consider this the beginning of an extended test run: I have a couple of months' worth of updates written already (with updates twice weekly) and I plan to finish another 26,000-30,000 words over the next two or three weeks. At that point, I'll take a step back, keep releasing material, and see how you like it. 

  I'm doing some things that I haven't done before and taking some risks, but left to my own devices I will eventually convince myself that what's gold is lead and that I should stop spinning my straw at all, so I'm going to stop that bad train in its tracks and let you be the judges. I am a font of ideas, so ultimately I don't just want to write, but to write something that people enjoy. 

  Let me know what you think, and thank you all for your part in making this subreddit what it is.

    Sounds like a more extreme version of the Strong Female Protagonist webcomic, from that description. I'll check it out.

    That's impressive. I only have two chapters ahead of me at most.

    My target production rate gives me only 1.6 chapters ahead of what I written. That's not considering editing.

  Well, that was a hell of a hook.

  Loved the hook! Can't wait for more.

  Good start.

  A couple of thoughts:

  > He isn’t doing a particularly good job.

  I would remove or shorten this sentence. Show don't tell as the saying goes. You have the setup, we can tell Simon isn't paying attention by the very next action. 

  > At first he thought that he was still dreaming, but then he realized that he’d never...

  You don't need "and then he realized". This is easily inferred, and the shorter sentence is stronger. You can also remove the repetition of the word "dreaming/dreamed": "At first he thought he was still asleep, but he'd never dreamed lucidly before. 

  > He’s smart, yes, but smart enough to realize...

  This may be a stylistic choice, but I don't like the "yes" here. Sounds a little strange, like the narrative is in need of affirming itself. "He's smart, but is he smart enough to realize..." Reads much better to me. 

  > but in the back of his mind a stray thought goes, But they’re kind of turning out that way.

  Starting with the second "But", the thought should probably be italicized.

  I swear I saw a word missing a letter somewhere, but on a re-read I can't find it.

  Watch your tenses. Sometimes we are in present, sometimes in past.

    Thank you for the critique, and especially for pointing out the tense issues. I'm not sure how those got away from me.

  ```
  Looks interesting. I'l be following it.

  I really enjoyed this, and I'm looking forward to reading.  Let me know if you need a beta reader :).

  One very minor thing that stuck out to me was the following:

  >He can already imagine some evil, corrupt, sixty-year-old Simon playing games with his current self, somehow stacking things up so that he, in the present, never saw any hint of it, or maybe even leaving hints in visions that led him to do things that ended up turning him into that evil Simon. Nor is he immune to foolishness.

  The final sentence there seems out of place to me, as a short alternative following a pretty involved description.  Even just making it a full sentence rather than a fragment (so, not starting with "nor") would improve things I think.

  I'm pretty certain there was a worldbuilding discord chat about this a while back. Based on all the cool munchkin ideas in that chat i'm super psyched for this story.
