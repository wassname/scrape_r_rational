## [Q][D] How to turn abstract rationalist ideas into concrete examples?

### Post:

I want to learn to write short rationalist stories/fables, I am aiming for something like [Programming Koans](http://thecodelesscode.com/), [Unix Koans](http://catb.org/esr/writings/unix-koans/ten-thousand.html), or [Transhumanist Fables](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/27/transhumanist-fables/).

It seems like these stories take some abstract concept/idea, and come up with a specific metaphor or example to express/explain/illustrate it.

But when I'm trying to do that I am completely stuck, I just can't come up with anything. It's hard to turn an abstract principle into a story with characters.

Can you share some advice that could help?

I have written down a list of a few ideas that I'd like to express, to make it more clear what I have in mind:

1. **Occam's Razor**  
   Among competing hypotheses, the simplest one(the one with the fewest assumptions) is probably correct.
2. **Confirmation bias**  
   The tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses, while giving disproportionately less consideration to alternative possibilities.
3. **Reversed Stupidity Is Not Intelligence**  
   Don’t think something is false because an idiot believes it to be true.
4. **Rationalization**  
   Making up "logical" excuses  for irrational behavior.
   
5. [**Shoulding at the universe**](https://youtu.be/RpXyy2RLnEU?t=29s)  
6. **Opportunity cost** 
7. **Expected value**    
The probability of each outcome multiplied by the value of each outcome. For example, a 50% chance of winning $100 is worth $50 to you, and you should be willing to invest up to $50 for a chance to win (but no more).
8. **Local vs global optima**  
   (you might need to make things worse in order to get to a global optimum – the best possible place to be)
9. **Broken Window theory**   
10. **You Can Face Reality**  
    “What is true is already so. Owning up to it doesn't make it worse.Not being open about it doesn't make it go away. And because it's true, it is what is there to be interacted with.Anything untrue isn't there to be lived. People can stand what is true, for they are already enduring it.”
11. **Ad hominem/Genetic fallacy**  
    Don't dismiss argument based on it's source. Don't accept it just because a person who talks about it sounds wise and confident either. 
12. **Self Fulfilling Prophecy**  
    Your beliefs/expectations can affect your actions in ways that create situations that make  them true.
13. **Fake explanations**  
  Your theory is supposed to be able to predict things, not just explain stuff that's already there.
14. **Utilitarianism**  
  It doesnt matter how it looks, just what it causes. 
15. **Deliberate Practice**  
  Practice matters more than natural ability. To get good - take a long time to practice challenging but achievable tasks that provide immediate feedback.
16. When you really believe something, you act like it is just true.

P.S. 

Just for the context - my purpose is to make a series of short funny animated videos that would introduce people to rationality. They will be aimed at 14-17 year olds, and will be in a form of 1-3 minute stories/sketches/jokes. 

To give you a general idea of how it can look like, my first few attempts are [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxm7uJEEVtXPRzhEX2EBq_Q)(so far these are just little jokes, nothing rationalist yet).

I'm not 100% certain yet that I'll go through with it, if I'll figure out how to express such ideas through short fiction
- I will, otherwise I'll just focus on learning to make fiction/comedy, and then make a series of short rationalist "lectures" as a separate project. Or maybe I'll need to change the format in some other way to make it work.

If anyone has any other helpful ideas or wants to contribute to the project - let me know)

  I believe the best way to go about it is to first find your characters. If you want a fable about Occam's Razor, you either have two characters with competing hypotheses or a single character who has an obviously overly complex hypothesis. I don't know how universal reading Highlights magazine was, but think of Goofus and Gallant. Goofus always goes with the explanation that's the most complex. Gallant always goes with the simplest explanation.

  If you need a scenario, just pick something at random. Or better, if you want a series, figure out some sort of frame. Animals in the forest are a classic for fables (including the one that won the [legends and fables challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3pp3lw/biweekly_challenge_fables_and_legends/cw9o0kj)).

  The trouble with communicating ideas is that you can't be subtle. My most salient example of unsubtlety is Umberto Eco's *Baudolino*, which really, really, really beats the audience over the head with the idea of the unreliable narrator. And I think it's just about right! If the book wasn't half obviously unreliable, with occasional references to what a liar the narrator was, you could have had a serious problem with readers noticing it's unreliable at all.

  Now, this example only directly bears on longer-form fiction. But still, if you want the audience to really notice (e.g.) the planning fallacy, not just as words but as a pattern, you may need to go to similarly ridiculous lengths; the book didn't just explain its conceit and use it in the obvious way, although it was explained, it was also mentioned, expressed in metaphor, and used in places both obvious and minor.

  Compare this to The Codeless Code. You're still really beaten over the head with the message; the plotlets revolve entirely around a moral, which is not necessarily a general principle, maybe just a bite-sized piece of one. The prose style is obscure when obscurity serves the purpose of getting you to think more about the moral, and otherwise is just setting a tone of Deepness that attracts readers. There's no room for most of the trappings of a story. You could absolutely do this with rationality content. Goodness knows it's easy enough to sound deep. Maybe you could even do something like trying to get people to think about the moral because of humor rather then because of obfuscation.

  Another option would be to jump straight to trying to give people mnemonics. "You're hiking across the plains when you begin to think something is stalking you in the high grass. You look at your map, and realize you've covered much less of the trail than you expected. One section of the map is marked 'plan,' and the other is marked 'fallacy' - no, wait, that's 'plains' and 'forest.' You hear something behind you and try to walk faster, but you've only covered 50% of the trail when you thought you'd be 95% done, and the sun is beginning to set. You look at the map again - the shape of the trail has twisted to spell the words 'planning fallacy.' The rustling from behind you seems to grow louder, and you break into a run. Your footsteps sound like 'plan plan plan plan' and the rustling of the grass sounds like 'fallllaccccyyyyyy.' You wish you'd planned this hike better."

  Here's a nice way to explain to a small child just what a complexity penalty and Occam's Razor is:

  >  ...keeping track of complexity penalties."

  > "Ba?"

  > "Hm... do you know what ninjas are?"

  > "Na."

  > "They're people who do sneaky, tricky, spy stuff, and are very good at hiding. In fact, they're so good at hiding, that there's always a chance that one is hiding right behind you, /right now/." Minnie turned her head to look behind her, and I grinned. "And they're clever enough to keep moving, to stay behind you where you can't see them. So one explanation for anything that happens while you're not looking at it is, 'A ninja did it.'"

  > "Did a ninja do it?"

  > "You tell me. Say you hear a clack sound beside you, and you turn your head, and there's a stone where there was no stone before. One explanation is I threw it at you. Another is a ninja did it. Another might be, oh, a squirrel dropped it. The 'complexity penalty' for each of these explanations is how many other things have to be true for that explanation to be true. So if I threw a rock at you, then what else would have to be true, that wouldn't necessarily be true if it wasn't me?"

  > "You... wanted to hurt me? And you didn't like me? And were hiding that you didn't like me?"

  > "Alright. And if it was a squirrel?"

  > "That... she carried a rock up a tree?"

  > "And a ninja?"

  > "That... she's been following me all this time? And nobody's talking about her? And she's been really really quiet, until she dropped a rock? And she knows how to keep hiding from me, and wants to, and-"

  > I held up a hand to interrupt. "That's good enough for now. So out of all of those, which has the smallest complexity penalty."

  > "The squirrel?"

  > "Got it in one. There's an idea called 'Occam's Razor' that says 'the simplest explanation is probably the right one', which is actually based on a bit of math called 'Kolmogorov Complexity' that gives precise definitions for what counts as 'simple'... but anyway. That's one of the tricks - come up with a list of explanations, and figure out which ones need the least extra things to be true."

  Do you think #15 could incorporate Julia Galef's "Redefining Success" video?  

  https://youtu.be/96VlDtwfbpQ

  Basically, success should be measured more so by how quickly/efficiently we get back to attempting to achieve our goal after we fall off the path, rather than whether or not we actually achieve the goal. (Could fit better with goals that transform due to new knowledge and understanding)

  Or do you think it could be its own story/theme?

    Fantastic video! I think it could be it's own story, it's good as a separate topic.
