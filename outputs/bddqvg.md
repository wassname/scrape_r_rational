## [FF][C] Silent Partner, Unfinished Business â€” not necessarily a ratfic of Death Note, but the characters actually *think*. Also, it is excellently written.

  Oh hey, I wrote this!

  Thanks for recommending it! I didn't set out to write "rational" fiction but I wanted to give everyone a fair shake and a coherent sense of how they see the world. So if you can enjoy it on that level, great!

  Did you hear about it from Argumate?

    I just finished the fic and I really enjoyed it. It was very well written and you did a great job with both presenting a coherent world but also allowing some really great mindfuck moments by shifting perspective around through various parties so you couldn't always tell what was going to happen but there was always a Checkov's Gun. Loved it.

    186k words flew by and I wish there was a sequel.

  Oh, I'll have to read this one, it sounds like an amazing premise!

  BTW reminds me that I once wrote (in Italian) a fanfic about Naomi Misora's last hours, and her method of suicide of choice. Perhaps I should translate that and post it, you could say it was rational as it focused on her using her intellect to find the best way to follow Light's instructions, and why her body ended up never being found again.

  I really enjoyed this. The depth granted to Misa's character in particular was refreshing given how short changed she was in the original work and it's rare to see a character with a communication related disorder handled as well as this fic managed.
