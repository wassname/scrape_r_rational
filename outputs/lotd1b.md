  Well dang. That was unexpected. Awesomely busy chapter.
  ```

- u/DavidGretzschel:

  Did not see that coming. 
  Was a very surprised, only Anton seemed psychopathic enough.

  I would have expected Brovose to claim that they once killed a team of plate hunters.
  Given that that would be an alternate plausible explanation, he really missed a beat there.
  So definitely the right move to kill him.

  Rain was really lucky that he made the choice so easy.

  Mechanics-wise, can you prove that you dropped all your accolades?
  Brovose could not have simply dropped a couple and said that those were all he owned?
  ```

  - u/zombieking26:
    ```
    I mean, obviously not, given that no one asked him to do that. (At least, there doesn't seem to be a way that any characters know)
    ```

- u/zombieking26:
  ```
  I'm very surprised with Rain's decision, even though I know he's grieving right now. Amelia is the one who started the fight! It seems wrong to me for them to start the fight, see that they have all those accolades, and then condemn the mage to death for it.

  That being said...given all the evidence, it seems pretty likely that the mage was in fact a mass murderer. Still, his personality from the previous chapters makes me feel like he wouldn't be that kind of man.

  I think that Rain made the right decision, but I very much feel uncomfortable about it. He really should have waited until he was in a better state of mind.

  All of that being said, I happy that Rain has finally grown up a little. This chapter, to me, signals that the author has taken the criticism to heart and will try to pivot the story in a better direction.
  ```

- u/FullHavoc:
  ```
  One of the better chapters in a while.
  ```

- u/FallToTheGround:
  ```
  “I know what you are thinking,” Tallheart said as the shower of accolades finally came to a stop. “You want to give these to the company. You will not. You will take them, and you will take them all. Only through your own strength can you keep anyone else safe.”

  FINALLY. If Rain kept up this “nice guy”TM act and the author didn’t accordingly punish him for not changing, that’s a straight drop on this novel. Hell, I’m not sure slogging through the drudgery of the past 50 or so chapters was worth this buildup and character development, it’s long overdue.
  ```

  - u/zombieking26:
    ```
    I really wouldn't call it an act, Rain genuinely does care for others.

    That being said, it's clear that power is exponential in this universe, so it makes sense to fewer people have higher levels then multiple people with lower levels.

    Not that Rain shouldn't help others, but I do agree that it's long overdue for Rain to get some upgrades.
    ```

    - u/p3t3r133:
      ```
      I think the point of the story is that its only like this because everyone's selfish, but it doesn't need to be. If people were trusting there would be more room at the top. If people protected crafters, there would be more powerful items. If people take specialized roles, more powerful blues can be killed by people of appropriate levels, removing the need for power leveling with a higher level person.
      ```

- u/fassina2:
  ```
  Finally a good chapter. Rain is finally growing up, that childish nonsense was getting annoying.
  ```

  - u/poequestioner2:
    ```
    If you mean the memeing and annoying cultural references, no they do not stop. In fact, they get worse and more common.
    ```

- u/zombieking26:
  ```
  > Rain had reached out as Tallheart spoke and started sifting through the pile. The first few boosts were small—accolades from low-ranked lairs, Heat, Cold, and Force. The sorting process came to a crashing halt as he read something that he knew was possible but that he nevertheless did not expect.

 

  > He stared at the plate in his hand, not believing his eyes.

 

  > “One THOUSAND Heat resistance?!”

  Welp, looks like Deathzone will soon be living up to his name.

      :p

      Soon in Delve time, lol
      ```

- u/mightykushthe1st:
  ```
  I will start reading this story again when Rain's levels get uncapped. It's the reason I started this story in the first place. Does anyone from patreon know if it's happening, or looks likely to happen? I'm ok with spoilers; in fact, in this case I really want them.
  ```

  - u/echemon:
    ```
    Hasn't happened as of the latest chapter.  They're in the depths, though, so it seems obvious that this arc will conclude with him killing a blue.

    On a different note, the latest (patreon) chapter had way too many annoying references.  They've always been there, but there were maybe 5 in one chapter alone... and then there's a bit where Rain asks Ameliah if they're that annoying, and she says no to protect his feelings.  Writer, it's obvious you know what people think of the memes.  Why are you still cramming them in?  Do you hate money?

    I really want to make an editor's cut of this story that goes through and eradicates 90% of the cringe and bloat.  It'd probably cut the runtime in half.
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      Use spoiler tags please.
      ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      In-universe it makes sense since it's Rain's way of dealing with homesickness, but... Yeah, it's grating.

      Also I'm mildly miffed about him being able to casually translate Hobbit on the fly into a language that's entirely divorced from any on Earth. Something really tells me that the author isn't bilingual.
      ```

        >In-universe it makes sense since it's Rain's way of dealing with homesickness, but... Yeah, it's grating.

        I can buy some of them, like in some recent chapter he made a "special eyes" reference. It seems plausible to me because someone else brought it up so he'd probably laugh at the unknowing reference. 

        As it is currently though, Rain just feels like one of those military LARPers who nonstop uses military acronyms in their daily life despite knowing full well that no one they're speaking to understands them. Knock it off, you're just intentionally being an asshole.
        ```

  - u/plutonicHumanoid:
    ```
    I’d recommend waiting a month to start reading again to anyone who hasn’t liked the pace of the story so far. I did that a month or so ago and I enjoyed it more when I started again.
    ```

- u/lsparrish:
  ```
  Well handled. Rain values human life, and the virtues of civilization, but when pushed into a corner and forced to choose, he realizes that he has to shut up and multiply... And that it sucks regardless. Hopefully he will develop abilities that prevent ever being forced to do this again.
  ```

- u/RiOrius:
  ```
  Well, I guess this'll make the haters happy, but now I'm getting worried. I liked optimistic, idealistic Rain. I thought he was on to something with power through community and party synergy and whatnot. I don't want him to go all murderhobo dictator.

  Sure, he can go raise his cap, but I don't want him to give up on Ascension and democracy and his ideals. Hopefully when Ameliah and Dozer get better he'll calm back down.
  ```
