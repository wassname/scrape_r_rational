[https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/09/01/chapter-7-5/](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/09/01/chapter-7-5/)

PB is the story of a boy in a radically unjust fantasy society who sets out from home to save his family and gets involved in a mess of skullduggery.  If it's new to you--hi!--a short synopsis is [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com), and the story starts [here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  It's been going since late January and a bunch of people here seem to like it.

Thanks for reading, one and all!

  Also, since you're my largest single group of readers: is Pyrebound what people call "grimdark," and if not, is there any accurate descriptor for this type of fiction beyond possibly ratfic?

    I would say it could fall into the category of grimdark, yea. The term comes from an way to describe the feel of a story via a coordinate plane. On one access, you have how "bad" the world is, on a scale from dark to bright. Dark means the world is, well, a pretty awful place. Things suck. Bright is more like a fairy tale; things just work out nicely for everyone. Your world definitely falls on the dark side of things.  


    The other axis is how much power your characters have to influence the world and events surrounding them, on a scale of grim to noble. Grim means they are acted upon more than actors, and while they obviously can make decisions those decisions are unlikely to have an significant, lasting impact without a LOT of effort, if it's even possible. Noble means that your characters have the ability to make drastic changes to the world around them, improving it as the results of their actions. So far, you seem to be on the grim side as well although we'll see what happens when the characters aren't starting from a place of total and complete ignorance.  


    So yeah, so far I would classify your story as grim dark.

  Another great chapter. I love the character interactions and dialogue, and it is clear how much care you take with them.

  I only wish we would actually get to see more of the world at large. It seems like a very interesting place.

    The world at large is, for human purposes, mostly the Dominion.  We just saw our second pyre, and number three is coming up--though as the plot unfolds, things might start moving a bit more quickly and in unexpected directions, and I'm somewhat limited by the intimacy of Ram's perspective.  What were you hoping to see more of, specifically?  The other races, or what?  I've already substantially modified the story in response to one reader request; this thing is far from fixed in stone.

      I love the intimacy of Ram's perspective. I don't think you should change that up in-story. I would just love to know more about the history of politics, religion, and warfare in the dominion and beyond. 

      MoL's author does these worldbuilding-only posts, removed from the main story. I'm not saying you should necessarily copy him or her, but it is one way to convey information to the reader without messing with the story.

        You'll be learning a good bit about at least the first two, though it might be a while, as the story progresses.  There's not a big difference between religion and politics here, and warfare I suppose ties in as well.  The plan is to write appendices for the print edition I'll be publishing when it all wraps up.  One doing an overview of the Dominion, and one on the Five Peoples of Ki.  Maybe others, depending how much stuff I have leftover when the story's told.  The print edition being a sort of alternative to setting up a Patreon, which I feel weird about.
        ```

          You'll have one pre-order here!
