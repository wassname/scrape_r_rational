  It seems out of character for (I'm assuming) Dizzy to offer help. Her character was interesting initially, but if she helps whenever it's plot convenient then she turns into a boring tsundere. That section could be omitted at no cost to the story, I think.

    Apparently, Dizzy is now our source of River Facts (even though I assume Nic would already know that rivers are smaller near their headwaters and get bigger downstream). Maybe we were supposed to get that she wanted Nic to cease his approach but she still wanted to reinforce that they were on speaking terms?

    This plus the comment about the fish species makes me think the River Din will be important to the plot later.

    I don't think they even crossed the river, so it seemed out of place. Maybe the info will be useful later, but I'd prefer the information to come out of their atlas studying session.

    Looking back, the whole journey from the cabin to the peak felt rushed. I felt whiplash from the quick transitions of doing things in real time and suddenly a couple of hours had passed. 

    Beforehand, we knew they had a (somewhat abstract to us) plan to take the easy slope and did a lot of topographical research we don't see. Since we didn't get the build up, I assume we could skip the journey except then we were thrust into talking about boulders and logs and specific paths like the story requires us to know the general topography of the mountain.
