## Rational Fiction recommendation

### Post:

After reading Mother of Learning , my appetite for rational fiction has increased by a lot, I have been searching on the internet but did not find many choices. I like a story which hs rationality , might or might not have romance but it should not drive major portion

I have read and liked the following 

MOL

Worm

Metropoliton man

Practical Guide to Evil

HPMOR


Sufficiently advanced magic

I recently started Void domain , it's been ok ok so far.

  *Significant Digits* is a great fan-sequel of HPMoR. 

  Then there is *Pokemon: Origin of Species*, *Animorphs: The Reckoning*, *UNSONG*, and *Worth the Candle*.
