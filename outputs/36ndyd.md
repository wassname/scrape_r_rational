  Loved Redshirts.

  For another story with a similar kind of feel, from the universe of fanfic, [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/159ASjt0t-YVWcKY8l1CzWF3IqmgxnOlNPy6iBUbN40M/edit)

    Previous discussion of the linked story [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/28asb0/wipstar_trek_transporter_tribulations/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/343hzq/replicator_story/). I should probably just say "this is good enough" and post it on ff.net, especially because it's not in active development (and if it does ever go into active development, this would just be the first chapter - I've sort of moved to thinking it works as a standalone).

      I assumed it was a oneshot and thought that it worked well as one, but I would hardly say "no" to anything with your name on it. 

      I mean, I'm not a Tarzan fan by any stretch of the imagination, and yet I will still read that Tarzan fic that you've mentioned in the past.

        Oh man, that Tarzan one is going to be great. I have the first three chapters written, it's just one of those things that's been sitting on the back burner.

        > **Foreword**

        > I have endeavored to keep this story as accurate as possible, but I must admit that where the truth could only be guessed at, I have made my guesses. I shall also caution that this story has not been kept free of outright fabrications. There were places where a flourish was needed, and where dramatic license was taken. Do not mistake me though; I have pored over a multitude of documents, including those taken from the trials, and where possible I have spoken with the survivors. It may seem to the reader that I want it both ways — that I want the story to be seen as accurate but not find myself beholden to the truth of history — and it may be that the reader is correct. When I was approached to write this book, I was given the task of turning a pivotal event in Britannia’s history into a personal one. If a few useful lies needed to be told along the way, so be it.

        > Our story begins with a young girl on a steamship off the coast of Africa, and ends with the crucible in which the modern world was forged.

          The whole first paragraph sounds like a very clever and wonderful defense against potential plot holes. 

          "Well, um, er... It was totally intentional! Yeah. Totally intentional. It's supposed to be reflective of how the *fake* author didn't do a tip-top job of writing this thing. Yeah..."

      Would Totally Read more chapters. :)

  If you want to read another book with a similar idea, I recommend [*Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosencrantz_and_Guildenstern_Are_Dead) which stars two minor characters from *Hamlet*.

    ```
    The movie of that is also really well done - it's got Gary Oldman and
    Tim Roth.

      I'm pretty sure the movie adaptation is called Lion King 1 1/2
