## [Biweekly Challenge] Mimicry

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7d7nx2/biweekly_challenge_inexploitability/), the prompt was "Inexploitability". Our winner is /u/Laborbuch, with their story, ["Fall Guy"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7d7nx2/biweekly_challenge_inexploitability/dq8e5pi/). Congratulations to /u/Laborbuch for their win!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **Mimicry.** I'm leaving this relatively wide open to interpretation, though there are lots of canons and genres to draw on if you want to do fanfic, pastiche, or draw inspiration from somewhere. John Carpenter's *The Thing* or the recent videogame *Prey* might be good places to start, though "mimicry" has pretty wide bounds. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, December 13th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Next Time

Next time, we will be doing ultra winner /u/vi_fi's choice, **Self-Destruction**.

"The theme I would like to see r/rational work on is Self-Destruction. At first glance, this prompt can be understood in two ways. On one hand, it can be about the self-destruction of a character. The first question that comes to mind is whether self-destruction can be a rational course of action. On the other hand, it's also possible to understand the prompt to be about the trope of the Self-Destruct Mechanism. In that case, a driving question might be why (and how) a rational supervillain might implement the self-destruction of their doomsday device. Of course, these ideas are meant to inspire, not to limit ;)"

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 12/13.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat will be up shortly.

  This is the first thing I've actually written out in years, and it popped into my head pretty much fully formed when I saw this prompt. I hope it's at least moderately enjoyable but I'm happy to accept even mean-spirited criticism.

    I can offer half-baked criticism! Is that acceptable?

    1451 words are not a lot, even when you try to illustrate only one concept (a [spoiler](#s "Dungeon Mimic") using a rather well-known setting (classic DND fantasy). You use the minimum amount of words to introduce the entire party, which is rather economical compared to something like this paragraph, which re-states the same thing quite a few different times, and is really unnecessarily rambling at this point, by which I mean to say, I liked how *compact* your story was.

    The one thing I would like to nitpick is that it lacks a bit of polish, which is not uncommon for these challenges. For example, the beginning sentence of the fourth paragraph ("And yet..."), is not unambiguous in its meaning, as well as somewhat complex, which made me stumble over it. Since multiple editing passes are the only cure for something like that, it's an understandable imperfection :)

    All in all, excellent work, keep writing if you have any more clever ideas, and have my upvote.
