  Green Lantern Corps never made that much sense to me, since they have no legitimacy. So far as I know (though I don't read the comics), no one on Earth consented to their governance. You can't just come into a town and say "hey, I am your police now". It would make even less sense if the Green Lanterns of Earth weren't humans (which, statistically, they shouldn't be). They don't have a monopoly on legitimate use of physical force, and in fact they undermine existing police structures. If the comics ever go into detail on the matter, I'd like to know how they resolve this.

    I've never read any GL-focused comics either, but my understanding is that they mostly deal with such [intergalactic scales](https://i.imgur.com/tCZ7UXs.jpg) that they are to earth what the U.S. Government is to a petulant, 10-year-old sovereign citizen, or the clubhouse they form.

      Yep, except for the first Green Lantern of Earth, Alan Scott, who wasn't part of the Corps. He just happened to find a Lantern on Earth (long story).

    >You can't just come into a town and say "hey, I am your police now".

    You can find yourself a nature reserve and decide that you’re interested in protecting some of its fauna from non-native species^1 though, especially if you’re big-headed enough. You can even amuse yourself by “talking” with the animals.

    ^1 maybe also from some apex predators — schizotech users, superpowereds, and the like.

    Dear Sir,

    If you want to secede from the rule of the Guardians of the Universe, please fill out and file the standard forms on Oa (conveniently located at the center of the universe) indicating that a positive majority of the sophonts of your galactic cluster wish to secede, and we will begin standard separation negotiations.

    Until that time, please be advised that the Guardians of the Universe will continue to operate in your galactic supercluster through their designated agents (currently the Green Lantern Corps) as they have for the last 3,500,000,000 of your planet's years.

    I mean you gotta be practical. It's not like we can have every planet individually consent to governance, that would be chaos!

    I haven't read the comics either, but it's always been my understanding that the people the Corps go after tend to already be recognized as criminals, terrorists, or dictators by local governments and are usually too powerful for them to stop themselves. 

    The Lanterns take advantage of the same laws that superheroes do when turning criminals in and have their own prison for the ones locals can't hold. I think it's fair to assume the Guardians maintain diplomatic ties with governments to handle affairs like extradition.

  Seemed topical, given the current weekly challenge. As always with Dinosaur Comics, don't forget the following after you've read the strip:

  [RSS Entry Title Text](#s " DINOSAUR COMICS PRESENTS: number #25536 in the "one day batman" short story series")

  [Mouseover Title Text](#s " green lantern was like, "i'm not the loser green lantern you might be thinking of.  i'm the coolest one, whichever one that is."")

  [Contact Link Email Subject](#s " batman rolled his eyes.  "I KNOW EARTH IS IN SPACE," he scowled, "I'M NOT SHERLOCK HOLMES."  Sherlock Holmes glanced at Batman, eyes wide.  Was he being BAT-DISSED??")
  ```
