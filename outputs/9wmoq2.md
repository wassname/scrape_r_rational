## I am looking for realistic self insert fanfiction

### Post:

What do I mean by realistic? I want the author to treat their self insert not as an fun adventure but as a grimdark survival guide. Wish fulfillment, harems, and fix-it sues makes me want to gag. I want the author to treat their story as if they were actually reincarnated/transmigrated into a fictional universe treating their new life not as a game to explore in. It also ruins my immersion seeing the SI seek out canon characters to befriend them or use earth idioms and flaunt knowledge they should not have. Why even risk butterflying the future plot to nonexistance. You lose your only advantage doing so. Also fuck gamer and random omnipotent beings self inserts. Will read female self insert recommendations if they are realistic and not romance centric.

Sorry if I am being too specific.These type of self inserts exist though. Here is my list which I highly recommend.

  >[Walk on Moon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10779196/1/Walk-on-the-Moon)

  I dropped this story partially because it was doing exactly what you list as unwanted traits of an SI story. Granted, I’ve only read it to chapter 10, but even in these starting 10 percents of the story, the protagonist does all this:

  * instantly gets attached to Ino, who is her biological sister in this story, and develops absolute loyalty to her.

  * potentially arouses Hokage’s suspicions by making a dumb ominous remark for no reason 

   > "... You begin the academy next year don't you?"
  > 
  > "Yes Hokage-sama," she replied with an exaggerated nod.
  > 
  > "See that you do well. I'll be expecting great things from you."
  > 
  > Rei's smile turned sly. "Don't worry Hokage-sama. I promise I'll be like no one you've ever seen before."
  > 
  > *That* earned her a long look and suddenly the smile on his face didn't look quite so genuine.
  > 
  > "Take care of yourself Rei-chan," he said before turning and walking away.
  > 
  > The smile on Rei's face fell as soon as he was gone.
  > 
  > *Damn it damn it damn it. I definitely went too far. Shit!*

  * intentionally copies young Orochimaru’s style of dressing — again, for no reason than I assume to appease her mary sue / SI aesthetics and use it later on as an excuse for drama complications.

  She also has a very shitty personality, and the other character behave out-of-character to enable her. [I’ve commented more on this here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/NarutoFanfiction/comments/9p7vfo/ocsi_prodigy_fanfics/e8lck1v/?context=3) I’ve tried looking for others’ reviews on this story to determine whether maybe it gets better later on, but it seemed like drastic personality and goal changes keep happening almost from one chapter to the next, and her personality traits and behaviour only worsen in the later chapters.

  Because by just existing the SI already influences things and thus changes the future. The stories also like to use the butterfly-effect excuse to explain their lack of originality and regurgitation of canon stations.

    Don't even know why I'm replying to this old post but I never understood the take of just by existing the SI already changes the timeline that's a lie except for specific cases. Example if you were reborn as Naruto's brother then yes just by existing you change the timeline because Naruto won't be as lonely but if it's a random SI civilian in konoha who doesn't attract attention to themselves and avoid changing the future path of main and important side characters then nothing happens the actual bullshit excuse of just by existing you change the timeline is a retcon authors uses so MC loses advantage of knowing the future it doesn't make sense you could literally just choose to be a random ninja of a random non important village(because usually SI 
    MC are reborn with wishes and perks) and never interact with the main cast. And another point unless the author already specified that it is an alternative universe which is another case but if they wanna uses the butterfly effect excuse thing with canon, the plot would still go in the same direction for major events eg: if they appear in the world same time as Naruto is born Minato and Kushina still die Naruto still has nine tails seals in him, the village will hate him, Pain still attacks konoha, Uchiha massacre still happens unless MC prevents it, 3rd still dies unless MC stops orochimaru or kills him before he defects ,  Tsunade still has hemophobia unless MC isn't reborn as her brother and is still alive at most the time those events would happen will change ie: if you train Naruto and Sasuke early and they are considerably stronger then Oro and Akatsuki might choose to actually act a bit early before they are too strong things like that.

  Try [Dreaming of Sunshine](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine). It has extensive and grounded worldbuilding, good characterisations for the SI and the background characters. The story does have some problems, but nothing bad enough to spoil the otherwise great writing quality.

  It doesn't exactly fall under the "grim dark survival guide" category that you're looking for, but [What's Her Name in Hufflepuff](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff) is a pretty enjoyable Harry Potter SI that just started back in August. The main character is a 30-something woman who falls through a mirror at a garage sale into a Gringotts bank vault and realizes she is in her 11 year old self's body because... magic. Though it isn't finished yet, it's already got a 16 chapters and a good 98,000+ words for you to go through. It's also Gen which is pretty nice. I've been enjoying the heck out of it.

  - u/SilverstringstheBard:

    Just caught up with the story. I really like it, and I like how it's consistently clever without being up its own ass about how clever it is.

    The characters are all distinct and really fun. I like that Hermione gets the most focus of the three, she's fun in this.

      short for 'general fic.' It can range from meaning that romance isn't a main feature of the story to there being no romance or pairings in the story at all.

  [Shadows of a Slaughterhouse - Burnscar](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11245587): As far as I can tell, the main character was forcefully recruited by the S9 immediately after arriving on Earth Bet, and only managed to free herself after months. At the start of the story she just moved out of the Pelham's, who helped her recover.

  So far it's purely dialogue focussed, but what's there is good.

  Try **[Hear The Silence](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12697202/Hear-the-Silence)**, which follows a female SI put into a child in the midst of *Naruto*'s First Ninja War. 

  The author's recently dropped FF.net in favour of AO3 because of some toxic commentors, so there are one or two extra chapters on the latter.

  I'm curious about this evolution of language. By your usage, I take it that Self-Insert in this case means the author is a human from our world that is transported into a fantasy or SF world? The classic example being Narnia?

  (i'm curious both because I'm aware of an older term for this phenomenon, and because Self Insert is also an existing fiction term which has meant something rather different before)
  ```

  - u/Gworn:
    ```
    Yes, that's basically correct. In this usage (most of this seems to come out of the spacebattles/sufficient velocity forum cluster), it's a version of the author being either transported or reincarnated into a fictional world. Generally told from a first person perspective.

    The self insert generally has full knowledge about the fictional world they are in. (So if they're in Harry Potter, then they have read all the books before they arrived there.)

    It's not the same as a Mary Sue, as it's not necessarily an idealized version of the author, though it often becomes a fix-fic. (Which means "fixing" bad outcomes that happened in the original canon by getting directly involved in the plot.)
    ```

    - u/Chosen_Pun:
      ```
      Yeah, Self-Insert is being used here to refer to a trend in fanfiction, where the viewpoint character is a forked personality of the author introduced to a setting they are *already familiar with.*

      In contrast, Narnia is an example of the related but much broader Portal Fantasy, where a plausibly-from-real-life original character, enough for the reader to empathize with, is thrust into a setting they are *wildly unprepared for.*

      As this is a rec thread, I won't be the only one to put forward Worth the Candle as an incredible marriage of both concepts, even if OP has a hate-on for the game elements c-:
      ```

      - u/xartab:

        Seconded. Worth the Candle is outstanding for many reasons, this included.

  Well. If you're looking for sci-fi/anime SI, try Undocumented Features from Eyrie Productions. It's basically the largest one out there, so there's a good chance you'll find at least part of it to your tastes.

  I'm rather surprised that it's seemingly never been mentioned here, actually. I know some of Eyrie Prod's works have sparked some... controversy (please don't start about DJ), but it's still a fanfiction landmark.

  It's also collaborative, more than five millions words, and still growing since 1991; and the story itself is multi-generational, stretching over more than 400 years and many, many worlds. Not quite a crossover, but certainly the largest fusion I've ever read, in terms of sources, cast and world-building.

  Due to its age and collaborative nature, its quality can vary (especially at the beginning), although I can't say I've been disappointed by anything in the last fifteen years or so, and even the beginning is a fun read (in an insane, wtf is happening way). The Symphony of the Sword books in particular are really great.

  [World full of monsters](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11122077/1/A-World-Full-of-Monsters) is hands down best SI fic I have read - somewhat sociopathic SI in Naruto world who fixated on getting Rinnegan. Starts  with humour and friendship like so many fix fics, but by the end of 3 chapter you would see that it's definitely not one of those. The only downside is (slight spoiler) >!female!Naruto !<. Unfortunately on hiatus.
  ```

  - u/Ih8Otakus:
    ```
    The gender bends threw me off and I felt that the SI was way too OP.

- u/SilverstringstheBard:

  I heartily reccomend checking out [A Subtle Knife](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-subtle-knife-worm-yj-si.342043/) by Industrious. It's a Young Justice SI with some Worm elements. The protagonist wakes up in a Gotham alley with Jack Slash's powerset, including his enhancements from Bonesaw. He almost immediately kills a man in self defense, and things progress from there.

  The prose starts a bit rough, but improves noticeably as the story goes on. It's got some of the best character work I've seen in a fanfic, I'd really recommend checking it out if you're at all interested.
  ```

  - u/Ih8Otakus:
    ```
    I had to drop it because of the angst. I love angst when its plot driver but in the first couple of chapters of the SI freaks out rabdomly due to rape? It didn’t fit with the jack type character he was trying to portray.
    ```

    - u/SilverstringstheBard:
      ```
      We're very different people I suspect. Jack's freak-out moments humanized him for me, made him more relatable.

- u/xartab:
  ```
  Definitely [Dreaming of Sunshine](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7347955/1/Dreaming-of-Sunshine) \- long, slowly ongoing

  Maybe [Sleeping With the Girls](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5792734/1/Sleeping-with-the-Girls-Vol-I-Fictional-Reality) \- short-ish, dropped or dead, requires extensive knowledge of tsundere classics
  ```

  - u/Ih8Otakus:
    ```
    Dreaming of sunshine is basically a retelling of naruto with fillers included. But I have to admit this fanfic was the self insert I read that intoduced me to the genre. Its a really good beginner self insert fic if you never read self inserts before. It scratches all the itches but nothing the SI do affects canon.
    ```

    - u/xartab:
      ```
      Plot-wise you're perfectly right, nothing changes, and I had some trouble pushing through the fillers, but the internal life of the SIOC, the events that surround her and her original solutions, not to mention the level of writing, I think make up for those flaws.
      ```

  - u/SeekingImmortality:
    ```
    I remain sad that Sleeping With the Girls has been on hiatus for so very long, as there are scenes in that series which consistently make me snicker gleefully upon rereading.

  If you're willing to take serious purple prose in the first ten-odd chapters and grimdark survival guide 100% fucking seriously, then try [Of the River and the Sea](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10996503/1/Of-the-River-and-the-Sea) where the SI is born as the daughter of a whore in the Bloody Mist, and at fucking *7* is sent to the front lines of the Third Shinobi World War.  Kiri is a bitch, and anyone sending children to their deaths like that are fucking sociopaths and in this story are characterized appropriately.  Also the protagonist has some sort of medical disorder involving brain chemistry (schizophrenia maybe?  Whatever) and guess what civilization doesn't have appropriate mental health care yet?  Guess who she turns to for the development of the pills she needs?  It does get better, but it's slow and realistic, especially how fucking traumatizing it is to A. fight in a war against super powered shinobi and B. Watching children die around you and C. Deal with A and B in a civilization that hasn't discovered therapy yet.

  Realize this is 3 years old but whatever. There is a Renly SI called The Prancing Stag. I'm currently reading it rn it has 118,000+ words. The SI is was a former environmental engineer/small town politician, this does not mean he is a one man industrial revolution since he has a understanding that the cost of that endeavor very early on but he does some simple things. He understands that the characters are real people this time around so he doesn't treat them like video game characters. He also fails a few times so he isn't OP. Its good so far, fyi if you don't like LGBTQ stuff it isn't really that bad since its not overbearing like other fanfics. Also the SI isn't exactly a goodie two shoes, he will get his hands dirty if need be.

  My 2nd recommendation is The Prophet from Maine. Its a pure SI meaning that he is actually himself and not a body takeover. Set around 8-10 years or so before the events of GoT show. I forgot who he was because its that long with 500,000+ words. Its a very realistic setting where he is somewhat weak. He has minor superpowers but nothing OP at all. He nearly dies a few times. The author is very talented able to create a entire story without the need of the actual canon plot until very later on. He does no industrial revolution thing either. He basically hides in plain sight slowly pulling things in his direction.... most of the time.
