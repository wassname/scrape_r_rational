## Stepping into a book

### Post:

When I am in the middle of a book, and doing menial tasks, I sometimes imagine what I would do if I was transported in a character's body with my current mind and meta-knowledge of the book.

I was thinking about this recently, and it occurred to me that something like this can be simulated. Get someone who has read the whole book (or series) to Dungeon Master for you, and commit to not reading the rest of the book/series yourself. The DM would then have knowledge of what other characters are going to do and what is going to happen normally, and could plausibly integrate your different actions in that world and extrapolate what might happen.


**spoilers for Worm bellow**

For example you might be in the middle of reading Worm, and you get 'transported' in Taylor's body (it is important to not have read the full work). The DM would know what is to happen [ ](#s "Scion possibly ending the world, new endbringers, Cauldron's role etc."), while you don't and they can extrapolate what will happen when you for example decide to tell everyone the Traveler's backstory or Coil's power or whatever you know from the chapters before.  You can recruit capes that you know to be sympathetic to your cause, etc, but would you be able to prevent the apocalypse without knowing how?

I assume this has been done or suggested somewhere before given the popularity of Tabletop gaming, which comes close to this. Does anyone know of people who do this? Would anyone else be interesting in something like this?

  This sounds like it could work well as a modification to SI fics.  It annoys me that the author/character's metaknowledge is *never* wrong.  Having one person make the decisions and another choose the outcomes would fix that.

    Yup, although if the writer/DM is very sympathetic to the player/character you can end up in a similar situation.

      DMs should never be sympathetic to their players.

    ```
    Wasn't there one SI fic that actually did that? Wish I could remember the details.
    ```

  ```
  Ooh.

  DM has to to flesh out the rest of the world too for this to work though. Realistically, you're going to hit unexplored patches and the story might well spiral completely out of its original trajectory.

  I'm at 17% of Worm. It would be interesting. Though, considering Worm's length it would be a very long game, I guess. Maybe something shorter would more approachable.

  - u/Tenoke:
    ```
    Yes, that is true, although I am not certain what is more relevant - the novel length or the time frame of the novel.
    ```

      ```
      Please actually spoiler tag your spoilers.
      ```

      - u/Tenoke:
        ```
        Sorry. I also hate spoilers, but given how almost nobody on this sub even mentions them, I assumed this was enough.
        ```

  If anyone's interested, I would be totally willing to do this.

  My most recent GMing looks to be falling to everyone-too-busy-to-coordinate syndrome, so I'm pretty much between games; and I always end up spending tons of headspace rationalizing whatever I'm reading, which is usually wasted effort unless I end up running a game there instead of a homebrew setting.
