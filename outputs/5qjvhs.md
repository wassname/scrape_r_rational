  Noburi's so fucking entitled, I'm starting to get really annoyed by it. The entire flirting rant is ridiculous, and that Inoue doesn't say anything (especially since she basically started the flirting with her flower arrangement thing)... Ugh.

    Good, sounds like we've written him right if you're responding emotionally. As to the specifics, please keep in mind that he's a 13-year-old boy with insecurity- and mild body-image issues. 

    On a related topic: I often find the genin hard to write because it's always a balance between "here is how my model of a  a 13-year-old would react" (which is based on experience with 21st-century American kids) and "here's how a child soldier from feudal Japan would react" (which is based purely on guesswork).
