  I've read this before and will have to check for updates, but I am reminded of the [mis?]quote from *Three worlds collide* "incompatible values".

  Edit: Also an upvote for /u/traverseda 's flair which I have not yet had an opportunity to recognize as the correct approach to the singularity.

  I did not really like this one that much.

  by the same author is much much better.

    Agreed.

  Alexander said he was going to go back and rewrite this. I'm hoping he lengthens it considerably.

    I am working on a rewrite - it's half again as long right now, and though I'd hoped to have it done for Christmas, I don't think that's going to happen, especially since I'm trying not to rush it this time (and I think in the last year I've learned the secret to roping people into editing for me, if nothing else). Anyway, here's all the stuff that I'm hoping to add/fix:

    * Give better characterization to the three principle characters
    * Clever exploits/consequences of the panopticon (naughty/nice) viewers
    * Smoothed out progression of the elves
    * Background on the bad Santa (origins/motivations/plans)
    * Filled in some background stuff on the elves
    * Close any plot holes that remain once all that's done

    Anyway, I don't think that the story is truly terrible as it is right now, just below what I'd consider to be my quality waterline. And if I'm going to miss the Christmas 2014 deadline, I'll probably just blow right past that deadline and save the rewrite for the Christmas after this one and put it out at a more preferable time.

    If anyone has any questions/complaints about this story, I'd be happy to hear them.

  Is there a trope name for "Muggle gets summoned with magic with the explicit intent of being put into into the leadership position of some fantastical realm"?

  Because so far "Two Year Emperor" "Erfworld" and this story here all share it. (This isn't spoilers, as it's pretty much mentioned in the very beginning of all these stories)

    [Summon Everyman Hero](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonEverymanHero) - it's a fairly common wish fulfillment trope used fairly extensively in fantasy fiction.

  What's with the reposts?
  ```

  - u/Pluvialis:
    ```
    First: Reposts, plural?

    Second: Because it's a year later, and once again seasonally relevant, and awesome, and most of us will either have not read it, want to read it again, want to participate in renewed discussion about it, or not mind ignoring it.
    ```

      ```
      >First: Reposts, plural?

      Yes, plural. For example Demon was posted thrice in 2 months, most recently 6 days ago..

        ... And yet even in [its most recent posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2pfc78/demon_the_story_of_a_rational_sociopath/), it was inspiring new, relevant discussion. That's not a bad thing, not at all.
        ```

        - u/Tenoke:
          ```
          Sorry (you hit a nerve there), but the discussion  was actually mostly untagged spoilers, which some of us dislike.
          ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Reposting is explicitly encouraged by the sidebar. Admittedly, that rule is now a lot more hidden than it was when I first wrote it, but it's still there, yep.
    ```
