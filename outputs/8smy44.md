  Okaaaay, I'm officially on edge. Congratulations, I guess, seeing Amaryllis react with utter terror and be absolutely confident that they will all die if he shows up really drove home how the joke has become a very very horrifying reality. The true final boss has revealed himself, though making him beatable may rob him of the mystique. 

  On to Grak, very good scene. Explains a lot, and seeing him break down crying at the memory of his dead home does a lot to let me empathize with a gruff no-nonsense character who I've never gotten attached to very much.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Yeah, Grak's scene was really good. It explains a lot of his character, when previously he was one of the less interesting characters comparatively, explained in universe because he was reluctant to share much about his past with Joon.  I teared up when he mentioned what happened to his home.
    ```

    > The true final boss has revealed himself, though making him beatable may rob him of the mystique

    The obvious "solution" to this is to get him to say his own name, and subsequently choose to kill and eat himself. That way, he stays unbeatable.
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      I don't think he ever speaks, he just shows up and kills everyone. There is nothing that can force him to do anything else. 

      My guess is that he is indeed killable, but only through specific circumstances. Remember, in the song in question, he was successfully killed. The MC of the song 1) escaped Shia's pursuit, 2) snuck up on him, 3) stabbed him in the kidney with *his* knife, 4) left him assumed dead, 5) decapitated Shia with an axe. I think at least the last one will be the key to actually hurting him. This is, again, contingent on Shia actually being killable. 

      Goddammit cthulu, this is such a weird paragraph you've made me write.

  I've got to appreciate how you took a silly meme and used it to put me on the edge of my seat. The moment Amaryliss' eyes went wide and she told everyone to stfu i felt my heart start racing.

  And in today's most unimportant observation:
  > some of it I guess I would also attribute to Jorge (blegh) 

  My first thought upon reading this was perhaps the reaction was one of jealousy on Junipers part but then there was no mention of a reaction from Juniper at the time Valencia actually mentioned her date with Jorge. Seeing as Juniper appears to be retrospectively narrating this story, i'm guessing in the future Jorge shows himself to be a creep of some sort.

        What makes you think this Jorge thing will go anywhere? Val/Mary has way more setup and Mary has already stated to be more than a little homosexual, even if she isn't entirely homoromantic.
        ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I think that might just be that his name sounds like a homophone of a Harry Potter character.

          Did you hear that if you say "/u/cthulhuraejepson", there's a 60% chance that he'll come in the next hour and kill the most of the conversation and the topics that invoked it? And if you say cthulhuraejepson cthulhuraejepson cthulhuraejepson, then he's guaranteed to come?

          On a related note, upon rereading the chapter, we can conclude that either Juniper is *not* retrospectively narrating the story, or that he neutralises Shia Lebouf - he writes down the name *nine* times (0.4\^9==very low, he probably wouldn't even get past \^5) in that chapter alone.

  The most clearly munchkinable magic item Bethel has is probably the Repeated Crossbow's unlimited ammo of any non-magical type. Mary can make a gun that shoots only silver bullets, now you have unlimited silver to trade for gold to pay Grak (and fund the nation). I assume Grak would object to just creating gold directly. I wonder if Valencia counts as non-magical--you could probably craft a cannon that can only fire non-anima of her size (requires a sentient to operate it from the inside, malfunctions in the presence of a soul), and duping her could let her harrow hell.
  ```

  - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
    ```
    Oh my god I love the idea of duping Valencia. That's fantastic, grade a munckinery.
    ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    > now you have unlimited silver

    Presumably the ammo fades over time in some way; if it were that easy to munchkin, they'd probably have already used that trick with Fenn's duplicator arrows.
    ```

    - u/GeeJo:
      ```
      Would they? The arrows were an extremely limited resource that acted as a massive force multiplier. Meanwhile, they haven't been short on cash since hitting Aumann.

      Why throw away a resource you need for one you don't?
      ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    Using the cannon to dupe a demon vessel looks like the fastest way to get excluded, so I hope they don't try.
    ```

    - u/PanickedApricott:
      ```
      there is precedent for duping being an exclusionary act too.
      ```

  - u/honoredb:
    ```
    Other stuff Bethel could try: 

    * Make her outer walls immaterial for half an hour (Evanescent Armor), then expand them as far as possible (Anyblade). Hopefully a continuous, quantitative increase in her sensorium is less unpleasant than abrupt qualitative ones. If she can be a "house" containing all of Aerb, she can easily kill almost anyone she wants using her various other powers. 
    * If Aerbian physics is like ours, I don't think she could *quite* split atoms with 5 pounds of force. Probably best not to try it though.
    * Have a bone mage interrogate a prisoner by draining their skull of KNO through their teeth, then use the Wishes ability to undo the harm to the prisoner.
    * Use the Everflask for secure communication. Bethel and a spy agree beforehand on a code mapping hypothetical drinks that the Everflask can't make yet to messages ("n parts dandelion wine to 1 part year-old whiskey means the prince is hiding in sector n"), and the spy communicates by mixing the appropriate drink and getting someone to "consume it for the purposes of pleasure, sustenance, or health". Whereupon Bethel brute-force tries to make all 32 agreed-upon drinks until one of them works.
    * Orb of Brilliance + Sunlight Mirror = Lasers??

    Isn't gold magical, though? Gold mages use it, and it's something like entity to them:  

    > SOC important for many magics. Obvious in retro that gold mage would rely on it, 1 part TK control via CUN, 1 part POI as social interaction with gold (entity-like) (why not CHA? J unhelpful). Also soul value-based? F could have answered.

  Sooo how do you warn an *entire clinic and its insane inhabitants* about an infohazard? Not really insane, but, you know, dreamskewered. 

  - theres this infohazard, you might all randomly die, be sure to write your will

  - you need to kill every dreamskewered person that remenbers Ace of Base or the internet

  - we need to do this extremely experimental procedure on all of your dreamskewered. You see, we have this fancy memory eating entad sword, and need it to eat some specific memories. No, we dont know how to control it. No, we can't tell you what this is about. 

  Edit: Oh my, and how about bringing instantaneous mass media into a world with info hazards. Holy shit. Talk about weapon of mass destruction, and you can make it selective too via tailoring it to broadcasts.

      This one, sure, but Shia LaBeouf isn't the only infohazard on Aerb.

      >  “Infohazards,” I said with a nod. Of course Aerb had infohazards, why would it not? One of the Thirteen Horrors I had a quest for was [REDACTED]; that was his name given in both the quest text and the description I’d read in The Exclusionary Principle, Seventh Edition, complete with brackets. It was heavily implied that he got more powerful the more you knew about him. To me, that hadn’t implied an entire class of memetic threats, especially because he was in an exclusion zone, but apparently I should have just assumed that Aerb would contain every single thing I had ever thought of, so long as it was at least loosely within the genre.
      ```

      - u/Mr-Mister:
        ```
        Different levels of infohazad though - Shia's is what I guess you could call a comhazard, but [REDACTED] is most probably a cognitohazard.

    "I want to kill everybody who could possibly say it."

    "Um..."
    ```

    - u/PM_ME_OS_DESIGN:
      ```
      It also kills bystanders.
      ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    A magical compulsion not to say any actor's name would do the trick.
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Would work, but kinda dangerous. You give away the class of dangerous words - and in case the magic ever wore off trough any of a myriad reasons it could be trouble.
      ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    The quest doesn't seem hard, since the known/outed dreamskewered are conveniently and inconveniently gathered in one location. Inconveniently, since the nature of the infohazard means it's most likely to be bandied between fellow dreamskewers. Conveniently, since Joon can easily draw on oblique references that any dreamskewer who's familiar with Shia LaBeouf can recognize (and if they're too old to recognize the name, all the better) and nip the bud on the likeliest ground zero. 

    One question is *how* the infohazard triggers. Does the summoning occur only if you complete the entire name? Or is uttering just "Shia..." with the name in mind sufficient? Because it's way easier to explain to fellow dreamskewers if he can truncate the name.
    ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      Edit: Silly me. I forgot the *hazard* part of infohazard. Most of the above assumes sharing exactly what the infohazard is with the dreamskewered (with the assumption that they would never use or share that knowledge), whereas the goal is minimize the risk any unhappy lab rat dreamskewered would decide to abuse that knowledge.

      So a blanket ban on any celebrity's name from Earth from any time (to hinder dictionary attacks)? That might be sufficiently wide to dissuade casual rebels and terrorists-to-be. They should probably lie about the effects of the taboo and evoke something familiar to Aerbians like "you'll suffer for the rest of eternity" in case any scientists get nosy.
      ```

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    I was thinking about it, but it's actually fairly easy:

    Go to the Athenaeum. Tell them "There's an extremely dangerous infohazard that the dream-skewered may be vectors for. We can't be more specific or it might spread to you. It is **very important** that, upon the discovery of a dream-skewered, you tell them that communicating the name of the main actor in Transformers comes with a very high chance of mass fatality, beginning with the one who communicated it." 

    Also, *why in the everliving fuck* did that dead guy go to all the trouble of recording the name and playing it back? Why not let it die forever?

      So you tell them the means to conduct a mass suicide bombing, so anyone with depression among them can easily take out a thousand people alongside themselves? That's safe for you?

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        True. In that case you communicate the danger to a few high-ranking Athenaeum employees, who keep an eye out for dream-skewered with memories of the right time period. Telling everyone outright is probably not the best option, but there are ways to make it less likely if people know about it.

      > Also, why in the everliving fuck did that dead guy go to all the trouble of recording the name and playing it back? 

      Probably someone doing experiment, record it, but killed in action. Or the recording itself is actually the experiment. Well, it proves success since Amaryllis get to know the infohazard.

      [Ace of Base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_of_Base) was a musical group popular in the 90s and early 00s. Anyone who remembers them, is also from recent enough period in Earth history to possibly know  the name Shia LaBeouf (he got his acting start in the mid-90s). Ditto for people familiar with the internet. 

      You can't say or otherwise communicate the name, so to identify people who probably know it or are capable of knowing it, you have to use other cultural/historical mileposts. E.g. by asking about stuff from the same time period as Shia LaBeouf.
      ```

    ```

  - u/matematikaadit:
    ```
    > Sooo how do you warn an entire clinic and its insane inhabitants about an infohazard?

    If verbal or written communication can't be used, but just thinking the name is okay, I think you can use Bethel's telepathy ability (the Soskanna sword entad) as a medium to tell people the infohazard.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Why would you tell anyone the infohazard? You don't want to spread it, you want some sort of magical compulsion that's specific enough to be unintrusive, and wide enough that hostile agents can't immediately deduce the "kill everyone horribly" word from it.
      ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    I was thinking just tell them not to mention Earth actors (or even Earth names) ever.

    > Edit: Oh my, and how about bringing instantaneous mass media into a world with info hazards. Holy shit. Talk about weapon of mass destruction, and you can make it selective too via tailoring it to broadcasts.

    You could program the operating system to take a hash of every string passed to it and every string passed out, compare it to a list of variations of the Actual Cannibal's name, and stop anything that matches. If that's not sufficient and even having his name in memory can summon him, you can use [homomorphic encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) so that everything is encrypted during computation, and it deletes any mention of the Actual Cannibal before decrypting.
    ```

    - u/MaddoScientisto:
      ```
      Amaryllis explicitly said  encryption wouldn't work so the moment somebody tries to program a rule for it everyone dies (assuming computers, etc)
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        Hashing might work though, since it's one-way (eg you can't deduce the name from the hash).

          Problem being that the Council of Arches would be the ones ordering that.

          As Juniper/Amaryllis, is it worth the chance that you're wrong and SLB murders the entire party, preventing any future good you could do (and, you know, killing you)?

          After all, every single one of the military R&D teams that worked on weaponising SLB *also thought* they had a clever workaround. And they're all dead.

  That is a rough quest too (assuming you don't just make dream-skewered kill on sight). Mary says there have been about a thousand dream-skewered, so extremely roughly call it anywhere between 5 and 100 currently known of. Even assuming you do a good enough job of impressing that no, no it is not a joke if you say Stanley Yelnats three times everyone dies, now you have just have smart bombs instead of time bombs argh argh infohazards.

      Maybe. But just this update we saw Bethel trying to get a magic item to work by saying all sorts of words in order to try to trigger it. If someone tries to do that exhaustively, they might very well try all standard words and start trying permutations of syllables or phonemes, at which point it's just a matter of time before they and anyone around them dies of Shia LaBeouf. So, if anyone else in the world is stupid enough to try to spend time triggering artifacts, you'll see a few Shia LaBeoufs constantly being (very briefly) rediscovered, at the very least.

      Well Juniper writes it down in the chapter, so that implies that either SLB is eventually defeated or that Juniper eventually returns to Earth to write the whole story. Obviously, the latter seems pretty likely since I'm here on Earth reading it, but that line of reasoning might be a little too meta.

      This is why it's so important that several of us are very good at counter-memetics.

      For instance, I'm very proud of the people who identified the real infohazard right away and quickly replaced it with the entirely harmless idea now known as "Roko's Basilisk." The replacement is even viscerally frightening enough, and treated with enough caution, that it spreads with little awareness that it *is* a replacement.

          I was actually quite surprised, it seemed to be the first thing I'd actually consider a real infohazard I've heard of. Turns out I was already infected though, but assuming you can become infected just by being told about it as others in this thread claim, then I think it qualifies as a real infohazard.

          It's something I've always been infected with, so it doesn't feel that bad to me, but I imagine for someone newly infected, it could be at least a little unpleasant for a while, until you get used to it.

              I think we are just using vastly different minimum thresholds.

A 0.5 rating would be ridiculously mild negative utility like being aware of inappropriate Wilhelm screams in movies you otherwise enjoy.

        Hey, carrier of the infohazard here. I have become a bit more strict with deseminating it. Please read the following disclaimer. Think hard, and then PM me: 

        My infohazard has a chance to make you feel otherwise unfelt pain. Based on responses, you have 5% to already be infected, 20% chance that it works and produces mild pain.

          I kinda don't know if you're just fucking with us, but is there a way to sort of hint about it without actually causing the infohazard? Kinda like that earlier SCP link, where you can vaguely describe the thing without actually spreading the infohazard?

          In actuality, I don't want to know it. But I can think of things that act like temporary infohazards that aren't bad, like knowing where your nose is in your vision or feeling yourself breathing or eye floaters. Is it like that? Or is it scary fiction I don't want to think about, like Cordycepts or any SCP?

          Is there any chance I could come across it in the wild or by myself? What if I search for infohazards?

          I'm curious especially about the 5% already infected. Where does that number come from?

          Can I know how that negative response happens that's like torture without knowing the infohazard? I have no clue what could possibly cause that.

            Hey, congrats on withstanding your curiosity! 

            >Is there any chance I could come across it in the wild or by myself?

            Yes, by all means. Its a "natural" thing. Though I doubt it would be considered infohazard anywhere except here. Its a 0.5 to 1 on the scale, maybe spiking to 2 due to "torture" response. 

             5% has gone up to 10% over today, based on three natural carriers (as opposed to one). Sample size still small. 

            The very negative response seems to be on the very far right side of the bellcurve, my response was a one time pain experience.
            ```

            - u/Green0Photon:
              ```
              So no hints or descriptions remotely related to the topic?

              I'm not withstanding my curiosity, but rather trying to get you to satisfy it without actually subjecting myself to the infohazard.

              Come on, give me something here.

              Is it sleep paralysis and the phantom thing I've heard people see? Is it knowledge of a super scary statistic that keeps you up at night? Is it the knowledge of the infohazard that you're telling us, causing to feel "pain" from the overwhelming curiosity?

              Oftentimes it's possible to describe the infohazard without spreading it. There's an SCP that causes people to forget about it, but you can remember what it's not.

              Also, that other one about breaking your thumb ligament is enough without seeing the picture to satisfy curiosity.

              Can you describe it in any way without spreading it? If you really are worried, PM me the ideas around the infohazard, but not the infohazard itself. I'd really rather not get it.

              I swear, it feels like you're priming us away from what it could be.

              Uggggghhhh! I can't think of what could possibly be natural that could cause pain for a week. The only method would be if the pain was already there, but people just started to pay attention to it until they forget about it.

              Can it be spread through text alone? Or a picture? Sound? Video?

              I vaguely remember a real cognitohazard, that had something to do with red and green lines or something.

              Please satisfy my curiosity slightly! I beg you!

              Edit:

              >>5% chance of, quote "extreme negative response - something akin to torture. The ensuing week - pretty shitty."

              >This must be an *extremely* bad pun.

              Is it an a pun that's the infohazard? Or is it knowledge of actual shit that makes the week bad? Is it literal pain, like shit I stubbed my toe/stepped on a Lego/have a cut, but worse?

              Ugh!

              Edit 2:

              Was the pain from a response from someone doing something after learning it, like face-desking too hard?

              - u/Xtraordinaire:

                I really dont think I can give a much better description without outright telling. Its knowledge, not some crazy infohazard concept. Its not something abstract like a statistic that keeps you up at night. I'd rate the stastic at about 0.01 or so, thats only barely and technically an infohazard.

                 It sometimes causes pain, spreadable by text alone, and about 10%ish people are natural carriers. I give you a single sentence, you say "neat" or "huh" and are infected.

              No, actually. It’s something about knowing and experiencing everything I can know. I don’t know how to put it into words but having a shitty week is a small price to pay for knowledge.

        - u/meterion:
          ```
          Because I’m skeptical about how “powerful” infohazards actually are in the real world, at least where the danger is inherent to knowledge itself and not people trying to kill you for knowing it (e.g. state secrets, witness killing, etc). If anything aren’t I being a good rationalist by actively seeking out information to disprove my hypothesis?

          The closest thing I’ve seen to a Serious Business Infohazard is that one infographic showing you how to snap a tendon in your thumb in two simple steps, which is not too impressive since there’s plenty of ways to fuck yourself up easily.
          ```

          - u/sicutumbo:
            ```
            Well, there are two possibilities:

            1. The information is not an infohazard, either through it being incredibly weak or just not one in the first place. So it's not interesting, because the interest was in the property of it being an infohazard.



            2. It is one. You now know a legitimate infohazard, willingly. Congrats.

            To me, this seems like sticking your hand on a hot stove to see if it hurts. Sure, it's technically in the name of science, but the result is either boring or harmful, potentially lethally so. Or maybe a label on a bottle saying "Danger, do not open!". Either way, I just don't see the reasoning in hearing someone say "I know an inforhazard and am willing to share!" and immediately asking about it.
            ```

            - u/meterion:
              ```
              From my values, the first possibility is more like:

              1. It’s not an infohazard, but a decent amount of people think it’s enough of one that they go to the effort of some information control, which makes it interesting to me simply by the virtue of being taboo. I wasn’t impressed with the hazard levels of Roko’s Basilisk, either, but I found it a rather cute idea. 

              The hand-on-stove analogy is weak because the premise and results are mundane and well-known. The exotic mystery of it is appealing, like if someone discovered some basilisk-y sound you could listen to that would make you feel pain, but is still completely unknown to the layman. There’s literally no healthy outcome from doing it but I damn well would, because hell yeah that sounds dope. 

              But I guess you gotta be the type that would want to try getting taxed just to see what it would feel like to find the appeal.

              If you've never experienced pain before, the first time you do so is fantastically novel. This novelty  feels important to the curious, and curiosity has a natural reward system built right in.

              Likewise; if you've never experienced an infohazard before, it doesn't seem surprising to seek one out even if you predict you'll be unhappy with the specific consequences because you expect the reward of novelty to outweigh the harm of the hazard.

              You're forgetting the biggest one. You now know legitimate infohazards exist. Which I don't. Paying 5% chance of a extreme pain + 20% chance of weak pain is a fair price.

            - u/Noumero:
              ```
              Well, in that particular case it was quite likely that the infohazard wasn't lethal or very hazardous at all, since it was transmitted from one human to another, as well as because its current bearer was willing to transmit it to consenting people (as opposed to being terrified of the idea, or alternatively disseminating it as widely as possible for mass chaos purposes).

              The rest is just estimating how harmful it could possibly be, how much potential harm you're willing to suffer in the name of your curiosity, and how likely you think it is that someone would try to weaponize it later on (i. e., whether you need to vaccinate yourself).

              True infohazards are unheard-of, and existence of one would have massive implications. I wouldn't say that you can't fault rationalists for jumping at the chance to confirm it — it was, in fact, unsafe — but it's perfectly understandable.

                  Nah, the idea is this:

                  1. With a starting position of your arms in front of you, palms together

                  2. Rotate your wrist so your thumb is pointing upwards(or as close as it gets)

                  3. Bend thumb as far as possible and wrap fingers around it to secure in place (I.e. the way that will break your thumb if you try to punch someone)

                  4. Quickly snap your wrist in the opposite direction as quickly as possible. 

                  Since your thumb-to-wrist tendon/ligament is already tightened with your thumb bent as far as possible, putting extra strain on it will make it snap. Or at least, that’s the intended result.

    If "object" can be a person, she could push Joon up to absurd speeds within the confines of her house (providing enough space with Pikel's Gap). Transferring the muzzle velocity of a heavy cannonball (even easier if the momentum can be stacked) to Joon while creating a relative vacuum is more than enough for 600 mph.

  E: Actually, why can't they request the backpack to provide "X without any mentions of a person with initials SL"? If they can't trust the backpack to actually follow the requests, they cannot use it at all. If they can, this is a method that should make any requests safe.

  You know, I love the idea of infohazards (read this whole [set](http://www.scp-wiki.net/we-need-to-talk-about-fifty-five) of connected short stories, it's great), but I've got to wonder how anyone knows the percent chance of the trigger word working.

  If they know he's summoned 3/5 times, and is guaranteed to arrive if you say his name three times, that implies they had people try to summon him multiple times, and write down data.

  That doesn't jive with the idea that he appears, kills *anyone* with knowledge of his name, or who handed off knowledge to his summoner, as well as hundreds of other people. 

  On another note, If I were Joon, I'd take great care to not say the names of other infohazard memes from Earth. Bloody mary, biggie smalls, Cthulhu Fhtagn, etc.

    Amaryllis says:

    > “I heard it from a phonograph playing in the middle of nowhere on a loop, recorded by a dead man who had heard it from others who were also dead,” said Amaryllis. “That’s the only safe way to learn it.”

    That's a fairly wide loophole that you can drive experimental models through.
    ```

    - u/SpeculativeFiction:
      ```
      Sure, but it implies six or so *entirely* new groups found:

      1) A shitload of dead bodies. Dozens to hundreds.

      2) Records about the word, and that saying it will summon an unbeatable murderer who will kill everyone who said the word, and the people who told them it, and the people who ordered them to say it, even without knowing the word. (I suppose this may have only happened with the very last group, but it seems like most would know about it by the nature of the experiments)

      Then decided to commit suicide by researching it. 

      I guess Amaryllis did say  

      >“Not all the time. Sixty percent, maybe.” 

      Which means there aren't weren't *that* many experiments, but there were at least 6 different groups that had that little self preservation.

      I suppose her kingdom has a lot of assholes with power running around, so it's possible they could blackmail people in killing themselves for science, but there's not a lot of incentive there. The assassination thing, sure, but just getting the success rate? Why bother?

      In the case of some poor smuck saying it by accident, who would record what caused it? Or more importantly, how many times they said it *without* dying horribly? All you get from that are positive reports.

      I'm probably just overthinking this. Amaryllis probably gave out a random percent chance of death, knowing that the words didn't work every time. Anyone making up the estimation would err on the side of caution, even if they only said the word twice (one dud, one "success"), and say 60% chance of death, rather than 50%.

      Regardless, I'm looking forward to the next chapters. I'm curious how this will all go so very wrong for Joon and Co.

      Edit: 

      > “None of it is paranoia,” said Amaryllis. “We’ve tried to harness him in the past. It always ends with everyone dying.”

      I suppose they could have tried mind controlling him, or using Entads that can somehow control a person on him. I  guess I can plausibly see several groups trying different things to get a tame weapon of that power.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I would guess every group who willingly summoned him had some kind of solution to the problem they were prettysure would work, so dind't think they were committing suicide. But after a great number of attempts people wised up and assumed he was unbeatable

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        It does seem like they would have needed SCP-level personnel casualties to get enough data that Amaryllis can state with confidence what the rules are.

        If this were the Second Empire, it would make sense, but Amaryllis is implying that the experiments were fairly recent (a bunch of her cousins died), so I think it's a little implausible they'd have kept experimenting past the second or third occurrence of "The guy showed up, killed the test subject, killed everyone in the testing facility, resisted every single magic we threw at him, destroyed several irreplaceable military entads, killed the highly-trained soldiers wielding them, then worked his way up the chain of command until he killed the head of the research program" for the sake of curiosity.

      - u/eroticas:
        ```
        I think they figured out that Shia kills everyone who hears it and immediately decided to weaponize it against *enemies* who they want dead. Then they realized it kills everyone in the causal chain, not just everyone in earshot. But once you have the phonograph and figure out that you can break the casual chain linking yourself to the Shia it's not even a particularly ineffective weapon. Therefore you can weaponize it as a workable suicide weapon. All of this is enough repetition to figure out that it doesn't happen every time.
        ```

        - u/Izeinwinter:
          ```
          Heck, they have in fact found a working use for it - That is why Amaryllis knows it. The high echelons of their government all know it, which is a horrifying insurance policy against kidnapping. - They learn about it from a phonograph. No back lash there. They elect to use it on their own recognizance - so no chain of command for him to work up. High collateral damage to any innocents nearby, but also pretty much guaranteed death to the people responsible. 
          - This may be where they got the data about odds of a single utterance being successful - if Amaryllis is not an extreme outlier in terms of what kind of person the court educates, I can easily see a kidnapped princes and princesses of the realm taking notes even as they are committing mass-murder/suicide.

  Something that other people have probably noticed before me, but I somewhat recently noticed on a read through: CRJ basically dropped health as a relevant stat as the story progressed. I actually like this, because it felt somewhat intrusive and took me out of the moment, but it is noticable when you compare latter fights with the early ones.

  Would the Shia Labeouf thing be the way to kill Fel Stead or whatever the name is? Both are described as being unkillable killing machines, so setting one against the other seems like it would lead to profound breakthroughs in science.

  I'm also wondering how Aerb first discovered that the words "Shia Labeouf" repeated three times killed everyone around. Like, how did anyone say those syllables those number of times, accidentally, and then manage to record the process in the only way that they can be recorded?

  Edit: it's really lucky that Amaryllis didn't pull up, say, a list of the most popular movies of the 2000s in the months in the time chamber. Holes was fairly popular, and he's been in a number of big movies in addition to that.
  ```

  - u/docarrol:
    ```
    >I'm also wondering how Aerb first discovered that the words "Shia Labeouf" repeated three times killed everyone around.

    I was assuming it was another dream skewed, or possibly more than one. Even if 60&#37; of them got killed, you only need one survivor to pass on enough for a line of research.

    Heck, it might even have been Arthur himself, if he found a way to cheat his way around the killing/communication restriction.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      But, how would that work? 60% of the time, nothing happens, and no one knows that they were close to death. 40% of the time, the knowledge dies with them, if they even realize what they did wrong. All it would really result in is a warning that some guy randomly kills lots of people around dream skewered people, mostly from America.

      The only way I could see it working is if someone had some form of danger sense, and was near the dream skewered person while they said his name, and knew to connect the name with the potential summoning, and that the 60% is in fact random and not just lack of information of hidden variables (i.e. saying his name with different inflections guarantees his summoning or makes it never happen if the name is only said once). But the only form of danger sense I can think of in WTC is elf luck, but that would just have the elf avoid the skewered person entirely, and wouldn't give them any information on what caused the slaughter that happened.

      Edit: Maybe an elf who has luck strong enough to see an hour into the future happened to be near a dream skewered person, without their luck telling them to avoid the person (??? No idea how that would work) and then their luck tells them not how to avoid death, because death is inevitable, but how to convey the warning onto others? Luck gives elves information they have no way of knowing, so it's about as plausible as anything else.
      ```

      - u/docarrol:
        ```
        > But, how would that work?

        Well, there a few possibilities I can think of, but the most likely that springs to mind is something fairly similar to what we just saw in the chapter. A dream skewed says the name out loud in front of an audience, but nothing happens.

        One or more of those people then later repeats the name, where someone else could see the action, but not hear (or read, or...) the name being said, and this time it *did* summon him. Now you have one slaughter, one witness of the summon, and one or more people who know the name, but haven't repeated it yet, for whatever reason. A slaughter, but the knowledge didn't die with the person who said the name (or wrote it down, or whatever).

        Since infohazards are a thing in Aerb, it's not inconceivable for someone to connect the dots from that, or a surviving dream skewed who got the "joke", then someone set up a research project to see if it can be weaponized, before they realize just how dangerous it is. 

        It may have taken more than one cycle of failed summons, followed by slaughters with surviving name-knowers for someone somewhere to have worked this out. Possibly a steady drip of dream skewed making the same mistake, getting themselves and everyone around wiped out for some unknown reason, before someone somewhere got "lucky" enough for the events to line up.

  Seems like Shia could be killed by a small group of powerful individuals. I wonder where they can find something like that.

    It's the incident with the tattoo mage in Barren Jewel.

    As Surface Sheath itself: from chapter 30
    >  **Surface Sheath**: An object pressed against the tattoo will skin into and become part of the magic of the skin, allowing it to be retrieved later by pulling at the edge of the tattoo. Object must be inserted within thirty minutes of tattoo completion. Required size depends upon the size of the object to be stored. 

    The variant that they talked about is the one where you need a keyword to retrieve the object.

  Oh Jesus, poor Grak. Somehow it didn't click for me that having a warder would be an extremely pragmatic thing for an underground dwarven village. Da didn't just run away from da nad family and social obligations, da deprived da nad community of one of its most vital institutions. This really explains a lot.

  Also, I keep forgetting the scale of Aerb. If the majority of a billion dwarves live in strongholds of a couple of thousand inhabitants, there are hundreds of thousands of Darili Irids - that's just staggering.

  With Valencia and that armor, does that essentially make her immune to damage now? I guess narratively it makes sense for her to be hard to hurt, since she is also much harder to heal. Still seems overpowered though.

  It seems like I'm in the minority, but -- I feel like using a dead meme for a plot point is kind of... uglier or more garish than the rest of Aerb. Feels tacky.

  Just my two cents. I did still really enjoy the chapters.
  ```

  - u/meterion:
    ```
    I do like the layers of meta in it—ACSL is terrifying in his “origin story”, ridiculous to a Terran audience, then terrifying to Aerb, then ridiculous in a terrified way to Joon and co. when they realize his origins. 

    But otherwise it is much more of a “lol get this reference???” kind of Easter egg than everything else the DM’s done so far. Even the author anagram was at least somewhat obfuscated.
    ```

    - u/KarlitoHomes:
      ```
      The in-text justification for why ACSL exists on Aerb is not that he's a silly internet meme, but that Juniper and Co. played a microrpg based on said meme.
      ```

      - u/meterion:
        ```
        Sure, it's just to me it crosses the line from "heavy inspiration" to "blatant plagiarism" in terms of Terran cultural material. Pretty much everything else in Aerb introduced so far is either made solely by the DM, adapted from Joon's campaigns, or somewhat hidden easter eggs from Terran culture (the Kinsey book anagram).

        Since it's said that Joon ran conventional campaigns, it would be like them coming across an enclave of Yog Sothoth cultists, assuming he played Call of Cthulhu at some point. If the DM is borrowing material that Joon didn't come up with, he at least makes a token effort to disguise it.

        I wouldn't have any complaints if there was an inhuman monster that would kill all those who named it, known to few as the *Haal sou Beif*, that would be totally in line with what the DM's done so far. Not even trying to hide the connection to Terra, not so much.

          Ah, I remember now, Kinsey!

          I can see where you're coming from, but I actually find this idea interesting - the theme of either Aerb pulling stuff from Jun's subconcious (in warped form)(ie nothing he conciously put in a campaign, but stuff that he was aware of) or even more scarily stuff from Earth that he didn't even know about showing up warped (potentially via the same link that draws other dream skewered?)

    Chapter 63
    >“I don’t get how it’s possible,” I said. “Is memory not part of the soul?”

    >“It is,” said Fallatehr. “Though it’s nearly inaccessible to attempts at manipulation.”

    Chapter 70:

    > I suspected that Fallatehr wasn’t telling the whole truth, [...] because it was possible to look at and presumably alter memories, even if the interface for that seemed lacking.

    Chapter 72

    >“Memories are difficult to work with,” said Fallatehr. “Difficult, but not impossible. Your memories of what you have seen and felt of your own soul would suffice, for my purposes.” He held up a hand as I opened my mouth to offer the obvious objection. “I would not need to touch your soul. With your skill as it is, you would be able to transfer those memories into the soul of an intermediary, who would then go to visit me, on another continent, as Amaryllis suggested.”

    Chapter 73:

    >"If you could reverse what you have done and erase our memories --”

    >“No, memories are nigh-impossible to work with like that, even when freshly made, at least if attempting to manipulate them through the mechanism of the soul,”


    So putting this all together, memory reading and transfer is well within the domain of soul-magic. Memory editing is extremely difficult. Selective memory deletion is likely not possible, except *maybe* with a repeat of that skill sacrifice trick.

  Whew, finally caught up from _Grayscale_.

  Registering a prediction: *Uther, having a game layer, had the same level-up compulsion with no way to manage the resulting addiction. Some actions, like dropping into the boundless pit, were taken largely in pursuit of ever more hard-to-obtain fixes.*

  Come to think of it, there are a few good reasons for something like this not to be true. (Also, I didn't do the least bit of checking for similar guesses) Still, I'll be damned if I call a plot point and without proof again, so I'm erring on the side of caution.
  ```

- u/HaramDatingSim:
  ```
  Well, that explains the inclusion of a Medium Armor skill in the system, a bold move that I haven't seen anyone try to pull off since Morrowind (if you played Morrowind, you know why).

  Retroactively funny that Amaryllis chided Joon for picking redundant armor skills. Turns out that Medium Armor exists solely and entirely for the purposes of making a mega-armor build with all three skills.

  Possible further virtues:
  Medium armor usage also grants skill gains in heavy/light
  Use whichever armor skill is highest while wearing medium armor
  All Medium Armor virtues also work while wearing non-medium armor
  Add Unarmored to the pile, just for shits and giggles?
  Add the skill ratings together?

  Well, that last one looks like it would be a trap. A sneaky way for the DM to modernize the system and get rid of the unfashionable Medium Armor skill while maintaining simulationist deniability by making some poor fool get the skill - and himself - Excluded.
