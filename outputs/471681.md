## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  In Pathfinder, Holly and Mistletoe has a cost of 0, and a weight of 0 and is, afaict, the only such item available to starting characters in the CRB. 

  What useful things can I do with Graham's number of Holly and Mistletoe?
  ```

    ```
    If it has no mass then it may not be a physical Holly and Mistletoe. It probably an idea that exists only in your heart.

  - u/gabbalis:
    ```
    An object that has volume but no weight? Wouldn't it... float?

    ... Mistletoe Zeppelins. Final answer.

      ```
      Good try (I mean *really* good, damn do I want to be the Chaos Cleric riding around in a Holly and Mistletoe Zeppelin), but a signal whistle also has 0 weight, and doesn't float. :(
      ```

      - u/PeridexisErrant:
        ```
        That's OK, obviously a signal whistle also has 0 volume (maybe it's still visible due to being a space-filling line). Since the mistletoe clearly has volume, it can be used to build a zeppelin.

    - Donate to local Druid school so they can put them in a Graham's number of starting equipment packs for new Druids. Write it off on tax.

    - Cross class into Druid a Graham's number of times, get Graham's number of Wildshapes per day, never get caught without a spell focus

    - Put them in a small bag of holding, use as portable pop-up camouflage 

    - Become an interior decorator, but not a very good one

    Hi Mr. Evil Lich Lord. I have here a sack containing a Graham's number of Holly and Mistletoe. It's not infinite, but there is so much that if hypothetically every being in existence were to do nothing but shovel it out for their entire life under the effects of a haste spell, you wouldn't be able to notice the difference. I have also readied an action to light it on fire, which I calculate to release 5.46 xkcdillion ridicujules worth of energy, unless you surrender unconditionally and acquiesce to the following...
    ```

    - u/blazinghand:
      ```
      Well, Graham's number x 0 lb of mistletoe comes out to 0 lb of mistletoe, which means it will release 0 joules of energy.
      ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      > 5.46 xkcdillion ridicujules worth of energy

      I'm stealing this.
      ```

  - u/Gaboncio:
    ```
    The easiest thing to do is to start ridiculous fires with mountain-sized (or larger) piles of Holly and Mistletoe. You could probably also use your effectively infinite supply to perfectly mark your path through a mundane dungeon.
    ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    Not too certain here. Not a D&D player really. Can objects with no weight have any sort of effect on the world? No weight implies no mass, which means it has no energy to be utilized, correct? Burning it would (presumably) result in destroying the object with invisible, intangible flames (as the fire would produce neither light nor heat)

    The mere fact that it's visible at all implies it must possess some form of energy. Your challenge, as a noobie lvl 1 starting character, is to figure out what that is and how to use it. I wish you luck.
    ```

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    Stand in the centre of town on the tallest tower, and drop them all. 

    The Mistletoe will pile as high as a mountain, and the puny peasants beneath it will suffocate, clawing at the foliage as a thousand barbs of holly pierce their eyes.
    ```

- u/Gaboncio:
  ```
  For the first time since I started browsing this subreddit, I have something related to getting your shit even-more together. [This](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/want_to_learn_a_new_skill_faster_change_up_your_practice_sessions) is a summary of recent research on how to learn skills faster. What do you all think? Anyone already use this kind of practice methodology and see positive results?
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    People already do something similar when memorizing facts. For example, if you have a bunch of index cards with study questions, then mixing up the order would help to learn the material faster. Using different questions from session to session or a different style of memorization such as a friend quizzing you would also help to learn faster (albeit less people mix things up like this).

    I would also like to point out that this study was referring specifically to practicing motor control which is useful to know for martial artists and sports athletes.

    Either way, this is helpful to know explicitly that having more variety in one's practice is a good thing, so thanks for the link!

  ```
  For my English 102 term paper, I want to write about effective altruism, covering specifically pricing lives and triage, QALYs, scope insensitivity and outgroups, diminishing marginal utility of money, and effective measures in Africa. One thing I'm concerned with, though, is an egoist argument for African aid. How would investment in Africa's stability and economic performance instrumentally benefit a US citizen who is terminally fine with letting the outgroup wallow?
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    Hmm, it's probably a bit of a stretch to say that altruism in Africa is the BEST use of money to help Americans, but it certainly does something to help Americans. The goal of altruism isn't "help me personally" so it's not going to be as helpful as just putting that money in the bank then using it later. Whatever you do is likely to be less useful than buying more stuff for yourself or putting cash aside for a rainy days

    That being said, making the world more stable and wealthy in the long run probably makes things better for Americans by providing more trading partners and reducing the likelihood we need to get involved in wars.
    ```

  - u/gbear605:
    ```
    More stability in Africa -> less terrorism -> safer Americans. Point to the destabilization in the Middle East leading to greater terrorism, such as 911.
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      Sub-Saharan African terrorists are targeting the US?
      ```

      - u/gbear605:

        In the 1950s: Middle Eastern terrorists are targeting the US? That said, many Americans aren't looking fifty years into the future.
        ```

        - u/Transfuturist:

          They seem to be a part of Da3sh now, so that's some reasonable evidence for regional hostility.

  Well, this isn't really a rationality related question, I suppose. It could be, but it probably isn't. However, it IS a fiction/author related question, so I figured I could still ask it in the general thread.

  I'm about to start a multi-chapter fanfiction story. It won't be a rational work specifically. I haven't really finalized any of the details, but I've had trouble finishing multi-chapter stories in the past. I get about 20, maybe 30k words in before I run out of steam and abandon the project. Here's my question:

  To our authors. Those people that have written and completed many chaptered(?) works. What sort of tools/techniques do you use to assist you? Do you storyboard things? Do you build outlines? Do you schedule time just to write? What methods do you find effective in maintaining both your desire to write and your passion for the current story? Some gentlemen of note I'd be interested in hearing from are /u/eaglejarl and /u/alexanderwales. I'm sure there are other noteworthy authors here as well, so please comment! :)
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I use a program called [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php), which is where I do all my outlining and planning these days. So my whole manuscript looks [like this](http://i.imgur.com/QqYaRmv.png) with everything broken down by chapter and scene. Most scenes are planned out ahead of time, if I'm doing things right, and they'll have a single line description like "Sander goes into the woods alone". On a higher level, I tend to plan out story and character arcs, usually with [a story circle](http://channel101.wikia.com/wiki/Story_Structure_104:_The_Juicy_Details). Breaking a whole big thing down into 20 or so story beats is really helpful, especially if placed along the circular story path.

    As far as keeping up motivation ... deadlines tend to help me with that, especially when I've stated them to other people. I definitely set time aside specifically for writing, because it's easier to write when that's part of my routine. Scrivener lets me set session goals and I usually consider par to be 600 words (actual output varies quite a bit depending on what's going on and what I'm trying to write).

    If you need a break, take a break, but ideally take a break that you have a set time to come back from. When I was writing *Shadows of the Limelight* I needed a break so took a week off to write a novella (*The Case of the Sleeping Beauties*). But I had a definite restart date, so it wouldn't have been easy to just let one week off turn into two weeks off, which would have changed into three weeks off, etc. It's still definitely possible to burn out on something and struggle with remembering what attracted you to it in the first place.

    Edit: Also, if you want to see some of my planning process and don't care about **spoilers for The Dark Wizard of Donkerk**, in 2014 I wrote three articles ([pt1](http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing.html), [pt2](http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_25.html), [pt3](http://thingswhichborepeople.blogspot.com/2014/09/pre-writing-for-national-novel-writing_28.html)) detailing my pre-writing process for National Novel Writing Month (for a story that I'm still in the process of actually writing).

    It sounds tangential, but one important thing is your physical environment.  Make sure that your desk is the right height and etc so that you don't start getting sore shoulders / painful wrists / etc from being at the keyboard a lot.

    As to what you asked:  for my books until now I didn't do a huge amount of outlining or preplanning, although I'm doing more as I go on.  2YE was written completely off the cuff.  Induction was planned on an arc level but the actual writing was pretty freeform.  The Tinker's Daughter has much more planning, but still not down to the outline level.

    This works really well for me because it makes it fun -- I'm not spending effort writing a novel where I know everything that's happening, I am reading a novel that is exactly tuned to my tastes...I just happen to be writing each sentence down as I read it. 

    There are some issues with this, of course.  I've had things go completely not where I expected -- when I wrote 2YE I never intended for Loki to be in it.  He just inserted himself at the end of chapter 21 and started stealing the show.  Next thing you know he'd talked me into making him the power behind the throne that was driving most of the plot.  Albrecht and Jake making a peace treaty was another surprise -- I had intended to have a big blood-and-thunder war with cannons and fireballs and whatnot.  When they sat down and signed a peace treaty I was gobsmacked.

    (Note that I'm not being hyperbolic here -- I literally had no intention of these things happening, but that's what my fingers wrote.  It makes the writing process a lot of fun, but it can play merry hob with your plans.)

    The question I would ask:  are you writing this for fun, for money, or for something else?  If it's for fun, don't spend a lot of time doing the planning -- just let your fingers create a new novel that is specifically tuned to your tastes.

  The D&D campaign I'm running these days is set in a world where most characters (for unclear reasons) never level up beyond ECL 6 or 7. This setting is set a couple thousand years after the previous setting I ran, which took place in The Age of Legends, when the level cap was 20. During The Age of Legends, most countries were just "the amount of area this particular monster/dragon/magelord can personally project force over" and that was that.

  Now, in The Age of Kings, it's plausible that a level 5 or 6 mage (who would be one of the most powerful mages in a country, if not the most powerful) may not be able to just murder the King, seize control of the country, and put down anyone who tries to stop him. A level 6 mage is still a sizeable threat, of course, but has a pretty limited ability to project force. No Teleportation, and a lot of the greatest tricks don't work. 

  So, most countries are feudal monarchies, with adventurers forming their own companies and guilds. A typical country will have one or two major PMCs operating within its borders, each having a few thousand employees. Most of these will be apprentices (levels 1-2), a couple hundred will be journeyman (levels 3-4), a few dozen will be partners (levels 5-6) and there will be a very small number of masters (levels 7+) who are living legends. Rank in the corp doesn't always correspond to power, but it does most of the time.

  In any case, our heroes are traveling in a neighboring country and dodging patrols from from enemy PMCs while they carry out their mission. Along the way, they end up encountering wild cats several times. First, they encounter a mundane Great Cat (like, say, a leopard) and kill it. A few days later, their camp is attacked by several Great Cats, a Greater Cat, and a Greatest Cat. They down the Greater Cat and drive off the Great Cats and the Greatest Cat. The ranger decides to kill and skin the unconscious Greater Cat, refine the hide and use it to create a sweet cape or cloak. 

  They're traveling on the road a few days later when they spot something flying through the air towards them. It's tough to tell how big it is, but it's too big to be a man, and anything that can fly and is bigger than a man is a potential threat. They calm down the apprentices with them and prepare for the encounter.  The creature approaches, and is an elephant-sized quadripedal demon with a huge set of leathery wings that end in clawed hands.

  He lands in front of the party and accosts them, accusing them of murder. He introduces himself as Arrkupalak, King of Cats, and charges the party with the murder of Nyanor, his granddaughter. Over the course of the discussion, their defense, and the negotiation of what their penalty should be for killing Nyanor, the party learns more about Arrkupalak. 

  Arrkupalak is the offspring of a Great Cat and a Demon, born thousands of years ago during The Age of Legends when the barriers between planes were weak and Demons, Gods, and Dragons walked the material plane. Arrkupalak is not a particularly intelligent creature, but he's clever, careful, and has seen The Turning of the Ages, the rise and fall of countless kingdoms and many empires, and more besides. Most of what Arrkupalak does is hang out in the wilderness and mate with Great Cats. He can't die of old age and nothing can really threaten him, so his life is pretty good. He doesn't really venture out of the wilds, except when his children are attacked. All the Greater and Greatest cats in this area, unnaturally large creatures that they are, are his descendants, and he takes attacks on them seriously. 

  The party makes a decent case for it being self-defense, and he demands services from them (or their descendants; he's a long-lived cat, after all) to be cashed in at a later point as punishment for their catslaughter. 

  Later, the party does some digging and learns Arrkupalak is known to exist (at the very least as a legend) but the local PMC, Insha Corp, has never made an attempt to kill him. Insha Corp makes a good amount of its income from merchants and caravans hiring it on as guards to take them through Arrkupalak's territory. They carefully frighten away any Greater Cats or Greatest Cats so as not to anger the creature that provides them with so many easy, lucrative, low-risk contracts to fulfill.

  I had fun with Arrkupalak's stat-block. I took a Dire Lion and applied the Half-Fiend template to it, and carefully optimized the resulting creature. With 6 Int, 14 Wis, 12 Cha, and millenia of experience (Arrkupalak gets a +15 "lived through it" bonus to knowledge checks related to the Age of Legends, which are normally quite difficult to make), Arrkupalak was difficult to RP. He's not smart, but he's bright, and he's seen it all. The actual statblock he got in the end was pretty solid, too. A Dire Lion that can reason, fly, think (6 int! He's sapient now!), use a couple SLAs etc is good. And he can't really get taken down by town guards, either. With his Damage Reduction, Spell Resistance, and various elemental resistances, there's not really much Arrkupalak fears. 

  The party could have taken him out, but probably would have lost several apprentices in the fight. Also... it's actually fairly hard to catch Arrkupalak. He can fly. He'll just turn and run if things look rough for whatever reason. This cat has seen the death of an Age, he'll not get crushed by a fight he can easily flee.
  ```

  - u/Aabcehmu112358:
    ```
    How many spell-casters are there among the party? I'd imagine that, if you have sufficient spellcasters (who know Summon Monster spells of the appropriate level), that summoning enough Celestial flying animals to threaten Arrkupalak should be possible.
    ```

    - u/blazinghand:
      ```
      There's a Magus and a Wizard. The Wizard knows Summon Monster II, so if he prepared only that, he'd be able to summon a good number of creatures. A problem: the only flying things that Summon Monster II can summon are elementals, and at that size they're unlikely to able to overcome Arrkupalak's DR 5/magic, and nothing that can be summoned by summon monster can keep up with his speed (celestial template isn't that great). If he's flying away, it's probably already over.

      Arrkupalak's Speed of 80 feet while flying is a huge problem. If the party really wanted to kill Arrkupalak, the main issue is holding him down. I'm guessing the best strategy would be to draw him into melee, feigning weakness, then cast Enlarge Person on the Paladin and have him wrestle the cat. Once they're grappling, try to take Arrkupalak out before he escapes or tries something too tricky (or kills the Paladin)
      ```

      - u/Aabcehmu112358:
        ```
        No divine fullcasters? Seems like a bit of poor party management, but can't be fixed shortly.

        Summon Monster II does come up a little short. Going from the fact there's a Magus, I'm assuming you're playing Pathfinder? What sort of spells to the party casters know? If I'm guessing wrong and you're not playing Pathfinder, one thing the party could do is see if they can find a partner who's a craft-oriented Warlock, and see if they can kit them out in custom gear.
        ```

        - u/blazinghand:
          ```
          So the party (and yeah, it's Pathfinder) has:

          **1x Wizard** who mostly knows transmutation. Her favorites include Pyrotechnics, Enlarge Person, Glitterdust, Summon Monster II, Haste, and so on. She doesn't have any entangling or web-like spells, and she has a couple evocations like Scorching Ray that she prepares sometimes. She has 7 wisdom, 14 charisma, a huge force of personality and an insane, paranoid irrational fear of birds and bird-based conspiracies. She is risk-averse, but her conception of what constitutes a "risk" is unusual. She is by far the most effective combatant in the right circumstances due to her ability to disable or blind groups of enemies.

          **1x Paladin of Law** who in theory hits things with swords but spends 90% of his effort trying to talk his way out of situations. He thinks that violence is a last resort. That said, he is very good at hitting things, and very good at taking hits. He carries a light crossbow in addition to his greatsword. He is a monotheist. He's also the only worshipper of his god, who is named "God", and he's having trouble getting new converts. His goal is to create a continental government and bring order to the land. He is an amiable, ruthless fascist who asks questions first and shoots later.

          *Note: Paladins in my campaign setting can be of any alignment as long as they believe in something. Their abilities are "Detect Sinner" and "Smite Sinner" and so on. A Paladin's power comes from faith, rather than the favor of a god. So, for example, a hypocritical LG Paladin that was sufficiently self-righteous would retain powers-- they would not be revoked by his god or pope or whatever. Paladins spend a lot of time praying, meditating, and having religious debates with other members of their orders in order to make sure their faith is correct.*

          **1x Monk** with a variety of combat abilities and good sneaking skills. He is modestly risk-averse, and usually supports the Paladin's attempts to talk instead of fight whenever possible. However, when there are fights, he leaves no survivors. Fame would be dangerous to him. 


          **1x Magus** who uses every spell slot for Shocking Grasp (including his level 2 spell slots) and fights with a sword. He is the most risk-averse, advocating running, hiding, and talking whenever possible. Although he's not a huge fan of it, he usually gets talked into executing prisoners and so on after fights because of his risk-averse nature. He's not a big fan of killing innocents. 

          **17 level 1 and 2 NPCs:** these guys come in various non-casting classes, but there are two sorcerers and a druid. These guys are armed with crossbows, but are fairly flighty. Most of them are in their teens and not used to battle. A PC often has to direct them in combat, yelling at them not to be heroes and to keep shooting. Out of combat, the PCs find themselves often advising and couseling these children, encouraging them to stay with the group and helping them through their problems. They handle the carts, horses, tents, fires, cooking, and so on, in addition to providing support in combat. They are paid little but learn on the job as apprentices.

          **1 level 4 Rogue NPC** - This guy is Iraj the Sly (known to most as Iraj the Honest) and is no good in a fight, but has lots of useful plot hooks, er, knowledge, that makes him a useful resource when the party is in a bind. Give him a dagger and he might be able to take an unexpecting enemy down, but he's more of con man / sleight of hand / guy in the know sort of fellow than a fighter.


          In general, the party makeup and lack of a Divine spellcaster doesn't reallly have any impact on the party's effectiveness. In a typical session, there will be 5 or 6 encounters, of which one at most is resolved with violence. The Paladin has the ability to do some small amount of healing, but in any sort of fight where the enemies are capable of dealing more than 15 damage quickly, things are gonna go really badly. Most of the PCs are quite devoted to keep their level 1 apprentices alive, so what kind of fights they can get involved in are pretty limited.

  I'm doing a original research final project for AP US History. The issue is that I have no idea what the topic should be on. Specifically, the requirement is that the topic is at least partially related to US History.

  I originally thought about talking about encryption and the NSA, but my teacher thought that it was too recent.

  Any suggestions?

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    For AP US History, try not to write about anything post 1970s if it can be avoided. If you want to focus on information security, The Underground Railroad is a good thing to write about.

    If you're open to other things, basically any of the major movements or events you've learned about are good to write about. Socialism in the US, Women's Suffrage, the series of deals and compromises that Congress tried to use to delay the civil war, are all good things to write about
    ```

    If you still want to talk about encryption, I'd go back further. Everyone is familiar with Turing and the Enigma machines, but in the Pacific Theater of WWII there was "Purple" which the US broke and codenamed "Magic".

  **Know about geospatial analysis?**

  I'm building a story involving Jupiter's moon, Io. There's a geological map of it on the bottom half of [this image](http://gallery.usgs.gov/images/03_15_2012/xcs1VIh77P_03_15_2012/large/Io_figure_press_2xglobal_300dpi.jpg). What I'd like to figure out is which sites have the widest variety of terrain types within the shortest distances? Or, put another way, which sites would be most worth dropping an automated factory down on, as they'd require the minimal amount of road-building to get to a useful variety of resources? Or, put a third way, what's the fewest number of sites that would be required to have a complete set of the terrain-types within, say, a hundred kilometres of each site?

  I can sort of see how a computer program might run some colour-detection on that image to figure out a map, and then run some algorithms about the value of each pixel - but that's a notch or two above my programming skill, and I don't think I have the time to both improve my programming skill and keep working on the story.

  Any suggestions?

  Thank you for your time.

    Ooh, yes - geospatial stuff was one of my minors (and now two jobs). 

    What you want to do is called "image classification", and it's pretty easy in a program called QGIS. 

    However getting the input data for Io is a lot harder than Earth. I'd suggest looking for existing geological maps, such as in that image, and picking sites by hand. Remember to account for the map projection! 

    All this depends on how accurate you want to be of course - if it's enough to spend a weekend learning the tools, I'd be happy to send you in the right direction.

  Can you guys give me some advice on becoming creative? I absolutely love rational fiction and I really want to be able to write it, but when I'm trying to write it - it's like there's a wall in front of me I can't get past, I just don't know what to say that hasn't already been said before.

  Did anyone had this problem and then successfully overcome it?

    Reduce the stakes. Write silly things. Play around with ideas. Maybe answer a writing prompt or two, or just fuck around. Doing that can perhaps trigger ideas and get a habit of writing things going.

  What's a good way to find out a decent place to volunteer?

  I think volunteering is probably something I'd enjoy doing, but it's a bit daunting trying to isolate the best/most effective place. The hard part is how to identify a suitable match.

  Ideally, it's something I can sink a part of the weekend into.

  **Final update up!**

  So does anyone remember when I made a hypothetical post about a poster posting hypothetical questions about powers that actually has those powers in real life?


  Not a hypothetical. Or at least, not exactly.


  The long and short of it is that I got in contact with someone who has what I'd hesitantly characterize as "magic." (At least until we study it some more.) I won't get into *why* I believe them, but I do.


  I'm keeping his name (and username) in trust, because, hey, while most if you guys seemed to be pretty benevolent in [the thread I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3mw44m/mkmeta_we_as_a_community_discover_a_poster/), a fair few of you were basically treating empowered humans as x-risks. But I would like to get help from you guys on figuring out what exactly their powers are, since we're a little stumped, and because, hey, even if you don’t believe me, you guys like puzzles. The general idea seems to be that, if he gets two different objects in his hands, dust gets attracted to those objects, and only if he’s close to the ground. Underwhelming, I know.


  But there are a *lot* of bizarre caveats. First off, they can't manage to manifest anything if they're more than a few dozen miles from their home town. Second off, his powers only work a limited amount of times per day. Maybe. We used to think it was just once per day, and only in the afternoon, but then one day he woke up pretty early in the morning and it worked then too, and has every other time he gets up before dawn. Maybe it’s something like half a day of chargeup? Third off, it doesn’t work for every object, too. Organics never worked once, and neither did plastics. Fabrics alone don’t work, but while most shirts are a bust, pants tend to work. He tried a few metal objects, but tinfoil and car keys don’t work, while silverware and his macbook did (but only poorly, for the macbook.) He haven’t tested any ceramics yet. And if he does the exact same thing at the exact same time twice in a row, it’s absolutely guaranteed to not work. I used to be that he would wait a little bit and then it would start, but that stopped working after he left around christmas/new years to visit family.


  For reference, this first started happening in august, and he’s only ever done it at home with the blinds closed to make sure other people don’t notice. When he’s out of town travelling, it didn’t work in or outside of a house.


  Feel free to ask questions about the data we’ve gathered, there’s more to it that this, but I don’t know what could be important and it would be potentially dangerous to just post everything at once.

  Edit: there are more caveats than these, these are just the ones we're more sure about.

  #UPDATE:

  New results are in as of this afternoon! This is pretty blatantly some sort of electromagnetic effect, because he just got a positive test result for extracting iron from crushed cornflakes. Looking back at the tests, it's also been confirmed that the effect only happens when he holds something that contains iron in each hand. (Other ferromagnetic metals don't work.)

  #FINAL UPDATE:

  check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47g47k/rtrstso_do_you_guys_remember_than_unhypothetical/) thread for details.

    What do you want exactly? We can't exactly suggest he test new items if the power stopped working. Or if we're trying to determine a natural cause there are a few possibilities.

    It could be related to something in his behavior,
    It could be related to something in the air,
    Or there could be something in the dust.

    A change in one of those might explain why the phenomena is location dependent and stopped working.

    That said, My first guess would be something related to static. Since static would account for charge times and interaction with dust if nothing else. I haven't played with static all that much though so I'm not certain it fits all the described phenomena. In any case, you could make a static generator and cross reference the phenomena to see if they match.

    Honestly as far as minor superpower gadgets go a personal static generator is one I'd recommend anyway. For the lulz. Speaking of which if it is some supernatural power he could probably disguise it as static anyway. Probably doesn't need to hide it...
    ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    Very low (I don't even know how many zeroes) estimated probability of the phenomenon being evidence for anomalous physics. Low probability (one to two zeroes) of the phenomenon being an undiscovered/unelaborated consequence of known physics. The rest in a known consequence of known physics or an interesting known or unknown consequence of biology.

    Accumulation of dust points to static electricity. Temperature, humidity, air flow, particulate composition, all of these atmospheric qualities can affect dust accumulation. Your friend is the other factor. I don't know what electrical properties are relevant there.

    I don't know if the guy whose skin was adhesive ("magnetic"), or spontaneous combustion, etc. have all been explained satisfactorily, but I think this fits in that category of useless curiosities. I estimate very low expected utility in the use of this anomaly, and somewhat low expected utility in further investigation.

    I have no clue what exactly you think you're describing when you say "dust gets attracted to those objects." This isn't interesting unless you actually describe what is so anomalous about it. A video would be appreciated. Otherwise I'm not even sure why you're being so cagey about it, unless this is an in-character brainstorm, this person you're describing is yourself, this anomaly is significantly more surprising than I'm imagining, you're overreacting to peoples' x-risk assessments of hypothetical powers that are significantly more exploitable than dust-attraction, you're simply the right amount of paranoid about personal information, or you're otherwise lying about something or being fooled.

    I mean, that's a lot of options. My biggest point is I'm not sure why you're behaving cagily (I don't think the guy saying he would hunt down that person would consider this worth the trouble), and a visual demonstration would be appreciated. If one cannot be obtained or published, some clarification would be nice.

    I'm extremely hesitant to believe this is real, and frankly, even if it was, attracting dust to things doesn't sound very useful.  Could be static electricity, though, maybe?  Has he tried testing it in conditions where it should work but he's wearing a grounding wristband?

    Again, I think the following advice from the linked thread is helpful:

    >Assume I'm wrong and temporarily crazy, and go about my days--because that's much more likely than a bunch of internet nerds catching on to the secret of the biggest change to the history of life itself since the development of the cerebral cortex.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      I have some pretty convincing evidence, at least to the point where I believe that he isn't *intentionally* deceiving me about any aspect of the power. It might be something completely explainable by current physics, effectively a false alarm, but for now I'm treating it as real, until experimentation proves or disproves any conjectures we make.

      That being said, feel free to not believe me, I just ask that you treat it as a thought exercise for the moment :)
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Have you checked to see if you can do this as well? I'd suggest starting there.
    ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:

    Yeah, I’d go with something static related too. But let’s handwave that away and assume it’s just a generic [unexplained phenomenon] plot device for an online-published story.

    >But I would like to get help from you guys on figuring out what exactly their powers are, since we're a little stumped, and because, hey, even if you don’t believe me, you guys like puzzles.

    Thinking inside the hypothetical, I’d say the best result is observing a side-effect of a previously unknown phenomenon \ law of nature. So the recommended order of actions would be something like this:

    * 1) go ask in physics.stackexchange.com and some other physics-related forums what (un)known phenomenon could — hypothetically (they like downvoting inane questions) — cause such an effect.
    * 1b \ c) go find some more physics kids (undergrads, professor relatives, whatever) and ask them the same.
    * 1b \ c) go check the guy for yourself and see that he’s not simply attention whoring;
    * 2) if still nothing comes up purge your current internet persona, advice the x-guy to do the same and from here on work through i2p\tor
    * 3) advise him to learn how to properly document scientific studies\experiments and to start doing just that with his daily tries.
    * 4) record his attempts on a high quality camera in a setting that will reveal neither his identity nor his location, then remove all the meta-information from the recording files and put them on an i2p server.
    * 5) ???
    * 6) [eventually the scientific community gets interested in this goofy project and learns something new about the universe.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/locke_and_demosthenes.png)
    ```

      >1) go ask in physics.stackexchange.com and some other physics-related forums what (un)known phenomenon could — hypothetically (they like downvoting inane questions) — cause such an effect.

      I'll definitely keep that in mind as an option. For now I'm just sticking to /r/rational, and maybe spacebattles, because you guys are fairly likely to humor hypotheticals (and have a lot of experience doing so.)

      >1b \ c) go find some more physics kids (undergrads, professor relatives, whatever) and ask them the same.

      I believe that he's not intentionally misrepresenting anything, but there's still a pretty high chance that it's just a minor scientific curiosity. It currently doesn't cost me anything to believe him, but I'd rather not look like a crackpot IRL.

      >1b \ c) go check the guy for yourself and see that he’s not simply attention whoring;

      I'm reasonably certaint he's not, for reasons I won't go into here. He could be, but it's not like believing him is costing me anything, while not believing him would cost me a car trip to prove him wrong.

      >2) if still nothing comes up purge your current internet persona, advice the x-guy to do the same and from here on work through i2p\tor

      The benefit to my current internet persona is that I have a *lot* of stuff posted, as well as several hypotheticals and misleading posts claiming that I wanted to do something like this as a writing experiment. I can easily pass this off as a meta-joke if I need to.

      >3) advise him to learn how to properly document scientific studies\experiments and to start doing just that with his daily tries.

      He's been recording this stuff pretty well so far, I'm posting here to see if anyone has ideas for what to control that we might have missed.

      >4) record his attempts on a high quality camera in a setting that will reveal neither his identity nor his location, then remove all the meta-information from the recording files and put them on an i2p server.

      Unfortunately that's a little out of his price range. I mean, his phone camera is pretty good, but he has some unspecified fears about the NSA. That leaves an older camcorder, and we all know how easy it is to fake footage with lower resolution cameras. *I'm* convinced for reasons I won't get into here (it has to do with how I initially made contact with him) but I'm not necessarily trying to convince you guys this is real anyways-- if you guys take it as a hypothetical, that's perfectly fine with me as long as you respond seriously.

        And now it's a meta-meta-joke

        > Unfortunately that's a little out of his price range

        Good web cameras that can record 1920x1080 are in the realm of $40, which probably wouldn't be too bad, considering he might have superpowers.
