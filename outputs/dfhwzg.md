## "Left Beyond Quest" has ended, read the whole thing here.

### Post:

 

So,  what happens if we put the canonically-hypercompetent government  telecom repairmen in evangelical best seller "Left Behind" under the  control of a bunch of 4channers?

They watch the Rapture happen, XCOM the Tribulation, and give God and Satan a run for their cryptocurrency.

  Great, now someone just needs to turn it into a cohesive story on an easily readable page, like with chapters, designed for webnovels and such, then I'll read it.

    Working on it.

        No, I'm still transcribing it. But it's most of the first story

          thank you, let us know when we get a complete epub/pdf. will start the first part tonight <3.

          I read some of it, but it's hard to continue since you it's not in an epub.

          Definitely let us know when it's in an epub. From what I remember, it was pretty cool, except I'd like it better in a story form.

   All right.  Which should I believe: the title of your post, or the name of the website?

    I almost gave an answer. Got a chuckle out of me.

  I found this page a couple of months ago I just took all the archived pages and glommed the HTML together. With calibre to do the conversion it works surprisingly well.

  although if you wanted to make an into an actual novel just take everything GeistKlempner says and put that together.

  Personally I think it's more entertaining to read it in quest form.

  - u/spiritplumber:
    ```
    Yeah that's what the pdf is for :) I also prefer to read it in quest form but that's just me
    ```

- u/LazarusRises:
  ```
  I've never been able to get into quest-style stories. Are the originals worth reading despite being propaganda?
  ```

  - u/spiritplumber:
    ```
    No, but the tvtropes page is.
    ```

  - u/nerdguy1138:
    ```
    The left behind books? No, they're hot garbage.

    There's a book "Antichrist handbook" about how bad the first book is. The author goes practically line-by-line, detailing exactly *why* they suck so hard.
    ```

- u/MetaMetatron:
  ```
  Yeah, I can't even tell where to start...
  ```

  - u/spiritplumber:
    ```
    http://emlia.org/pmwiki/pub/web/LeftBeyond.LeftBeyond.html There's a wiki :)

      Thanks!!

  This is fun, thanks for bringing it to our attention!
