## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  What works are you folks following every update? Here's a list of ones that are active and I automatically click read when a new chapter is out.

  [A Rabbit among Wolves](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13420487/1/A-Rabbit-among-Wolves) is a RWBY fanfiction that asks the question what would happen if Juane Arc became the head of the White Fang instead of attending Beacon. It's a popcorn fic that offers some solid laughs.

  [Street Cultivator's Book 3 is being posted on Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23220/street-cultivation-a-modern-wuxialitrpg-hybrid). Sarah Lin puts out two chapters of this urban cultivation novel weekly. It's a fantastic story of cultivation that avoids the standard cliche's that often come with cultivation based stories. Books 1 and 2 are available on Kindle Unlimited.

  [Confessions of a Magpie Wizard](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27872/confessions-of-the-magpie-wizard) is a decent fantasy story of a demon who infiltrates a human academy and learns empathy. Pretty fun read. 

  [Never Die Twice](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32067/never-die-twice) is a fantastic story about a necromancer who's goal is to kill death and give everyone the ability to live forever. His goals might be admirable, but his methods are fairly evil. 

  [Less Than Zero](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10362076/1/Less-Than-Zero) is a DC fanfiction where the author has inserted an OC character. The story follows Null as he discovers his powers and tries to use them to move on up from poverty. He tries to figure out where his ethics lie and works with villains and heroes alike. One of my favorite stories out there.

  [Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl) is the story of a man named Carl and his ex girlfriend's cat as they fight their way through a murderous dungeon that exists as a form of entertainment for the rest of the galaxy. 

  [Castle Kingside](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27456/castle-kingside) started off as the story of a surgeon in a fantasy world, but now it's transformed into one of the best uplift fictions there is. 

  [Paragon of Destruction](https://www.webnovel.com/book/paragon-of-destruction_12311119706248305) is easily one the best cultivation novels out there. The story really starts getting good after the first arc ends (I got frustrated around chapter 30 and jumped to like 68?) and I haven't been able to put it down since. It follows a very standard shonen wish fulfillment power fantasy, but it does it well. The story has a cool magic/cultivation system, well put together world building and is quite well written.

  [Vainqueur the Dragon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon) is hilarious story of a thief helping a dragon navigate a world with litrpg mechanics in a goal to make the most gold possible. Fun in small bit sized bits. Can get repetitive if you binge through it in one sitting. 

  [Ave Xie Rem Y](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ave-xia-rem-y-a-very-cliche-xianxia-story.589587/#post-41524293) is a fantastic story that follows a boy who wants to be a doctor in a world of cultivation. The standard xanxia tropes exist, but they're shown in contrast to the mc who's a breath of fresh air in this genre. 

  [Going Native](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/going-native-dbz-dc-comics.10534/) is a DBZ/DC fanfiction where the mc is a reincarnated individual born as the younger brother of Vegeta. They're drafted into the Saiyan army and commit atrocities in Frieza's name. It's an interesting story that does a good job of melding DBZ and DC. It's gotten a bit boring as of now and I'm mostly waiting to see how the story will look once the mc goes to earth.

    I've spent this past week binging a large portion of *A Rabbit among Wolves*' writer's (Coeur Al'Aran) works, and I have to say that a lot of them are good and even reasonably rational.

    In particular, *Forged Destiny* is the same type of rational-esque LitRPG as Delve, with a great premise and outstanding execution. It managed to run 1.1M words (being actually a complete series of 9 books) without running out of steam or becoming repetitive, staying gripping throughout. It's good enough and divorced enough from the RWBY setting to stand alone without any knowledge of the original show (which I myself haven't watched, but have picked up the general gist of from other RWBY fic).

    Honorable mention is *Relic of the Future*, which is a Peggy Sue and therefore arguably rationalist by default by letting the protagonist preempt practically all idiot balls by foreknowledge, though it puts a twist on things by throwing Jaune so far back in time that the majority of the fic is pre-canon.

    Lots of the others were also good, but not particularly rational. Many are guilty-pleasure types, self-indulgent, leaning heavily into tropes like the grimdark antihero/sympathetic villain (Null), angsty backstories (A Hunter or Something), identity porn (White Sheep, Forged Destiny), overpowered protagonists (*White Sheep*, *Null*, *Relic of the Future*, *Not this time, Fate*)... but always keeping it just grounded enough with reasonable stakes and challenges so as to not let it become actively cringey. The author is good at writing those viscerally satisfying moments—foreshadowed twists, important reveals, vicious beatdowns, things that *should* feel like fanservice and powerwank but are well-written enough to *not*.

    More importantly, it's all technically proficient with the exception of their earlier works, and even those improve quickly. (*Not this time, Fate* starts with mediocre prose and an inability to properly punctuate dialogue, but ends its 600K-word run with basically novel-quality writing.) All in all, it was a pleasant way to spend a week's worth of commute, and *I'm not even done*, because holy shit, this person has been churning out fiction on a regular schedule since 2015 and they're *not stopping*.

    [Dark Skies](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies) Very innocent likeable MC has lots of bad things happen to them and has to figure everything out starting off not knowing anything. Slow burn. Prolific update rate. Semi-rationalist leanings as the MC figures out the world, although it's not competence porn - lots of mistakes.



    [Cinnamon Bun](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/31429/cinnamon-bun) Isekai where the main character is very enthusiastic and naive. Has been described here as 'reasonableness porn'. MC tries to solve things with hugs where possible, but accepts that this isn't quite *always* possible. 

    The author, [RavensDagger](https://www.royalroad.com/profile/147338/fictions) has a number of works on RR and his own following. They're fun, and I enjoy them, but also not what I'd call rational in general.



    [Solomon's Crucible](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32617/solomons-crucible). System apocalypse. System tech trees include modern weapons, which the MC picks up. Popcorn fic. Enjoyable.



    [Blue Core](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core) - (NSFW, Explicit) Cooperative dungeon core story. MC gains power by doing magical experimentation, by gaining and supporting a ~~harem~~ group of companions. Think dungeon core makes lasers and expands political influence + explicit scenes.



    [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/),
    [Previous /r/rational Discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/6oje2x/nsfw_the_erogamer_a_quest_about_a_girl_who/) - (NSFW, Explicit) Last updated Jan 2020, but I think worth mentioning since it's been so long since it came up in the sub - Also, I'm still binging. It's Rational Porn. 

    To borrow from /u/XxChronOblivionxX in the older thread:
    > The thing that really stood out to me when I first started reading it was the depth of the MC's thoughts about the true implications of a power like this. The EroGamer power, as it's manual describes, has this casual and fundamental control over literally everything. History is rewritten, personalities shift and change, all to serve Cindy's little Erogame experience, and this is not lost on Cindy. It's surprisingly hard to describe this in detail, but people not shy about erotic fiction should absolutely give this a look just for that part.
    ```

      [Ar'Kendrythist](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) is a fantastic litrpg, with a social worker dad and his daughter getting isekai'd into a world with a system. Like Delve, it takes a deeper look at how a system would affect the world (logistics, warfare, politics, etc.). The system is very different from Delve though, it's more mystical and less "crunchy," but there is nonetheless a good exploration of how and why the system came to be. The worldbuilding and characters are really good. Highly recommend. Updates about 10k-15k words per week.

      [Infinite Realms: Monsters and Legends](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27325/framework-monsters-legends) is a litrpg/xianxia hybrid. Like its name, the story happens on an infinite plane (think minecraft world), following two main characters and some side characters (and the occasional interlude). Very competently done. The characters are good and 3 dimensional, even the side characters. The power system is interesting, and the main characters are very interesting. At the start one of the characters is much more interesting than the other, but starting from volume 2 the other character is getting development. Updates 3 times a week with around 4k-5k word chapters.

      [Brockton's Celestial Forge](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13574944/1/Brockton-s-Celestial-Forge) is a worm tinker OC story with an SI being the passenger. The main point of view is the OC, who gets vague directions from his passenger which sometimes ends up screwing him over. The tinker power is basically Inspired Inventor lite, so it quickly gets very powerful (the consequences of which we're only starting to see). The characters are pretty well done and face actual consequences from their actions (even the protagonist). The tech jargon gets a bit much sometimes but the latest few chapters have been good. Updates once a week, ~10k words.

      Hah. I haven't gone back to Erogamer in a while, mostly because I became more aware of Cindy's horrifying lack of caution, especially when >!that one boyfriend talks about how his extremely conservative grandfather would use it, how he would test and test and test and never do anything that hasn't been verified to not go horribly wrong. Contrast to Cindy, who explains why fat people's consent doesn't matter when it comes to forcibly making them beautiful.!< It just started making me anxious, which admittedly isn't terribly difficult and probably isn't indicitive of most people, but Cindy is far from the ideal person to hold the reigns for the universe.
      ```

      - u/happyfridays_:
        ```
        Perhaps someone who is up to date can comment, as I'm still only 30% through the story.

        I haven't been turned off by the existential horror yet, but hey, maybe the Erogame just pre-emptively found just the right people in just the right situations such that it only had to nudge them and nothing has been rewritten and continuity has not been revised and [minor]>!the houses just happened to have been arranged for high heeled jumping before Cindy tried that run! The bushes too!!<

        Otherwise I'll come back here and retroactively edit once I'm deeper into the fic.

      I liked Dark Skies in the beginning, but I just got tired of nothing happening. The story is a decent length, but the story just drags on with practically no plot progression. I think this story falls into the category where the author describes it as a Slice of Life story but uses that as an excuse to not work on their pacing.

    Bit of a tangent, but it seems like every Rwby fic that gets recced here has Jaune as a protagonist? Why is that? I get that he has a disproportionately high amount of screentime in the show, but that's generally seen as one of its (many) *weaknesses*
    ```

    - u/Prince_Silk:
      ```
      There's a couple reasons.

      *  One of the obvious ones is that Jaune is a blank slate for authors. His portrayal on the show is is very meh while at the same time his backstory is fairly interesting. It offers a fanfiction author a lot to play with. 

      * Another is that many, if not most RWBY fics, like most fanfiction in general, are shipping fics. They tend to focus on the relationships more than the plot, For whatever reason, Jaune fics might have ships, but they're usually not the focus.

      * Another is because of just how big an influence the author Coeur Al'Aran has had on the fanfiction scene in general. His works are extremely popular and he tends to use Juane as his go to MC which has inspired many others to write fanfiction like him. Like for example, I only got into RWBY b/c of his fanfiction and I'm pretty sure this is the same situation for many people.



      * My last point one is more speculation than anything, but imo I think r/rational tends to prefer stories written by male authors and male authors tend to write male MC's more often. I haven't checked, but from what I've seen, even the sotries with female MC's that get recommended on here are more often than not, written by male authors.

    - u/Tenoke:
      ```
      I just read it and it's okay but at best vaguely rational. The MC is portrayed as smart but the character motivations, behavior, the plot, and the world building aren't consistent or sensible a lot of the time.

      Way too overly complicated, unrealistic and frankly stupid plots are common. The MC who is portrayed as very smart and safe and afraid of death takes unneeded big risks constantly. Characters that the author has decided are important luck out page after page despite being repeatedly set up for likely death. Level 50 is extremely high yet even at the highest levels you get 3 levels per feat/fight. It's fun but no, I would not say it is all that rational.
      ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      I would say it is. At the very least, it checks off all the points in the sidebar.
      ```

    - u/Reply_or_Not:
      ```
      Very, the MC is a type of lich and he is seeking eternal life.  However, his very existence is a crime, so he is undercover as an alchemist in town, while secretly running a dungeon to advance his work.

      The characters are believable with their own goals, and no one holds the idiot ball. I highly recommend it

  https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32123/just-a-bystander

  This is a~~n urban fantasy~~ world with a hard magic system. It explores a lot of questions about what magic is and why it works.

  Edit: See the comment from /u/GlueBoy, below.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Besides the fact that it's not set in a city but a magical school, I wouldn't call this urban fantasy, which is usually low fantasy, hidden magic practitioners, oblivious populations, and so on, like dresden files. This story is high fantasy in a modern setting, and all tech is made of and runs on magic.

      ```

      - u/TacticalTable:
        ```
        Not sure, looks like his patreon cut out at the end of June, so maybe just an extended break due to Corona/job related troubles? He didn't really make enough/month to pay the bills through patreon alone.
        ```

        - u/GlueBoy:
          ```
          That's a shame, as much as his stories frustrated me, he's better than 90% of the writers making thousands on patreon with shitty generic litrpg knockoffs. 

          I think a big part of it is that he's terrible giving the reader payoff from his cool interpersonal and power conflicts, at giving an actual feeling of catharsis or following up on a [crowning moment of awesome](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/CrowningMomentOfAwesome/CrowningMomentOfAwesome). 

          The Good Student is a perfect example, a story that started really strong with a great hook and a bunch of interpersonal relationships with deep wells to draw for conflict and resolution, like the MC's pining for an unattainable girl. But the reader is never given **any**  satisfying, clear-ended emotional payoffs with their relationship. He makes a character unlikeable, but characters keep liking them? And their motivations don't change? It's maddening.
          ```

          - u/ironistkraken:
            ```
            Thats why I dropped a good student.   No pay off and it seemed like the MC was not achieving much but being pulled around on a string (I think I got to the conclusion of a big arch then dropped, but its been a while).

    It's a Chinese xianxia trope which is inspired by Buddhism and Taoism and a bunch of other stuff, ~~kinda like how mana comes from the Bible~~. Supposedly there are xianxia novels from the warring states period, 2200 years ago. 

     I always found it strange that the Buddhist idea of meditating to eliminate the illusion of self and to relinquish all earthly attachments in order ascend to the next level of existence is twisted into xianxia's avericious, nihilistic, amoral race for ultimate power. Fodder for a humanities thesis.

      Seems like kind of an interesting premise for a setting. If actually achieving enlightenment causes you to fuck off to a spiritual plane, you'd expect all the people left on the material plane to be selfish unenlightened assholes.

      - u/None:
        ```
        Everything I've seen on the internet about the etymology of 'mana' in the fantasy context suggests it comes from the word of Polynesian origin whose meaning seems roughly the same as the common modern usage ('supernatural power that permeates everything'). Dunno where /u/GlueBoy got the connection to Biblical 'manna' (which is more of a nectar/ambrosia thing anyway).

    At the beginning, it was all Chinese novels, web or otherwise. I don't have much knowledge about the popularity of xianxia in China.

    Translation of Chinese novels to English began with wuxia (cultivation+martial arts) but it was a niche community, much like how anime was niche. I only got into it when the community branched more into xianxia (seeking immortality) and xianhuan (cultivation+fantasy), and around then it got a lot more popular. I was introduced with Coiling Dragon on [wuxiaworld.com](https://wuxiaworld.com) around 2015, and from what I've heard a lot of others were the same. 

    I agree with u/CreationBlues that English-written xianxia has since melded with Gamelit to an extent. I disagree that Savage divinity is that popular - check out [novelupdates](https://www.novelupdates.com/series-ranking/?rank=sixmonths) for a better reflection of what is popular.
    ```

    - u/reddithanG:
      ```
      Savage Divinity was the first English written/non translated novel inspired by xianxia that became popular. Novel updates only posts translated novels. Also keep in mind that the novels posted there are most popular when they are being actively translated. It also doesn’t include novels from webnovel.com. So it’s not a completely accurate reflection of what has been popular in the genre IMO.
      ```

  - u/Trew_McGuffin:
    ```
    I personally don't believe there's a single story that can be pointed to and given the credit for cultivation novels being a thing in English speaking countries. I do not believe Savage Divinity is the first popular cultivation novel as it'd have to compete with a slew of translated works some of which have good translations.

    I started off by reading Tale of Demons and Gods' manhua on Batoto, got impatient for new chapters, and ended up finding the novel on Wuxia World which was further ahead. Qidian, Gravity Tales, Wuxia World, and Novel Updates helped make xianxia more available to the public.

    If you're looking for some pretty alright novels Er Gen's stuff is pretty good along with Cultivation Chat Group, Street Cultivation, and Forty Millenniums of Cultivation.
    ```

    - u/fassina2:
      ```
      Same for me TDG on mangalife, many years ago. Got impatient, went to the novel. Caught up with the novel, the author went on a hiatus. Started reading other things on the genre. Most of it bad until eventually found good works. 

      &#x200B;

      TDG has interesting combat and would be really good if the author hadn't gone into the go to the next dimension where people are stronger trope. If he just had slowed the pacing and made the MCs story be about saving his country and repopulating the world it'd have been one of the best cultivation stories out there.

      > I started off by reading Tale of Demons and Gods' manhua on Batoto

      Same here, though I stopped after they started inventing new ranks past gold (or black-gold).
      ```

  - u/CreationBlues:
    ```
    I'm not sure. I think it's kinda a slow boil thing. Basically, xianxia starts as shitty translated webnovels, which started a while ago. They're aggressively bad, so they don't get a lot of mainstream interest. However, the ideas influence people, and more and more works are translated at (minorly) better english. Gamelit starts breeding with xianxia, which are written just as bad as the translation novels are but from actual english writers. Keep in mind, the entire time most works aren't disappearing, if they're good they stick around and people keep reading them. 

    Savage Divinity might be the first popular xianxia webnovel? It's written competently enough, and it has clear influence on it's system from xianxia. Asian aesthetic, tiers of practitioners, single unifying energy currency, body reinforcement, meditation, spirit weapons, etc. etc. etc. It's a lot lower power than traditional xianxia, but it's basically the same stories and systems.

    There's been a bit of a renaissance in mindless, cheerful Worm fanfics.

    None of these are particularly rational, but they're all fun in different ways: 

    * [Oogway's Little Owl](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/oogways-little-owl-worm-kung-fu-panda.857691/): Worm / Kung Fu Panda crossover. Really nails the heartwarming and funny bits of Kung Fu Panda.
    * [Refusing the Call](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/refusing-the-call-worm.869941/#post-69059755): Worm / DC (but not really) crossover. Someone, somewhere, is trying to get Taylor to be a cape. She's far too sensible for that. 
    * [Taylor has a Strange Hobby](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/taylor-has-a-strange-hobby-yandere-taylor.860167/): Yandere!Taylor knows how to get bullied. Sophia starts bullying her. It's (one-sided) love at first shove, but evolves quickly from there.
    ```

  - u/SpiritLBC:
    ```
    Going Native, other works by ShayneT like Adaptation or Lodestone. They all are pretty dynamic action fics.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Ex Synthetica is an optimistic Worm fanfic, with a Taylor that is a shaker able to control really small mechanisms (think nanites). 

    Aces and Jokers has an SI with card powers, kinda. It's like a combination of Dauntless and Uber. The SI goes on to fool around in Brockton Bay instead of being too fix-it-y. Usually keeps a pretty comedic tone throughout, although it gets kinda wild later on with what happens with the power. You might still like it.

    Communication is a worm quest where each decision is the combined opinion of all the SB users' replies. Pretty funny to read at first, and at times wholesome.

    I can't recommend anything like Erogamer, but out of curiosity did Tales of MU ever complete? It appears to have never gotten past the second year of the story and I'm curious if the main plot was ever concluded.
    ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Regarding Tales of MU I want to warn you that the links to the first chapters are all broken. You can still get there, but it requires some manual fiddling.

    Beyond that, I remember enjoying it as a teen, but the author definitely has (or at least had back then) a problem with dropping story lines and never picking them up again. In the beginning 3+ chapters were needed to cover a single day (which I personally still enjoy but many regard as far too slow pacing) until she herself noticed it went nowhere and skipped a year ahead in time as a soft restart.

    I think it's still ongoing, but I haven't read it in over half a decade and don't even remember why I stopped.

  I just finished reading [Gideon the Ninth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42036538-gideon-the-ninth) and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's not rational but I'd compare it to the Dresden Files as being somewhat trashy fantasy fun.

  The blurb on the cover describes the plot as "lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space" and honestly the only thing that description is missing is some truly atrocious puns along the way.  It has a dark souls-esque aesthetic in which everything seems to be the decaying remains of a greater world.  It also has some apotheotic themes which I suspect people in this community would enjoy.

  My only complaint is that either the author or I am wildly incorrect in our understanding of how colons should be used.  

  The sequel came out just a few days ago and while I haven't yet read it, I am looking forward to picking it up.

  Any recommendations on Kafkaesque rational fiction? I'm really interested in reading a story where a rational main character has to come to terms with a completely irrational and surreal world (i.e. waking up as a bug in The Metamorphosis).

  However, the premise certainly doesn't have to be about a MC transforming into something else—just something that explores similar themes of alienation and anxiety in a world that no longer makes sense.

    You asked and you shall receive. Now I don't know if I'd call any of these stories particularly rational, but I enjoyed them.

    [The Games We Play](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/) 

    Probably the most famous RWBY fic. Jaune awakens one day with the powers of a gamer. Great fic with lots of cool plot developments and worldbuilding. Diverges heavily from canon almost immediately as when it was written not much of RWBY had actually yet been made.

    [Not this time, Fate](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11822902/1/Not-this-time-Fate) 
    >When Jaune woke up back in his house with his sisters and family, all he could do was sigh. Every time he died he was forced to start over again, and this was what... the one thousandth time? More? If it doesn't matter how hard he tries, doesn't matter how much he fights. Then maybe it's time to just kick back and enjoy himself. Fate can find someone else to be its whipping boy.

    One of many stories from Coeur Al'Aran and in my opinion his best. If you really want RWBY fanfics he has written several, and they are all competently written. I do think his quality goes down with later stories though.

    [What Defines Us](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12779151/1/What-Defines-Us) 

    An excellent White Rose (RubyxWeiss) romance story that is absolutely filled with angst in the best way possible. I highly recommend this if you at all like romance stories. Mikotyzni has written several other great stories that are worth checking. [Rush](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157764/1/Rush) is another great White Rose romance story by the same author but is significantly less heavy than What Defines Us. Might actually be a better starting point even though I personally like What Defines Us more.

    [The Seventh Circle](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13438301/1/The-Seventh-Circle) 
    >[Faunus!Ruby] Ruby was taken from her family at a young age, and indoctrinated into becoming a killer. Now, ten years later, she escapes to Beacon Academy... but is she truly free? Surrounded by remnants of her past and trapped in her own trauma, she must learn to overcome her guilt, lest she be consumed by it.

    Not a finished fic, but great and worth reading despite that. When I first saw it I assumed it was going to be yet another trashy Ruby becomes evil fic, but it surprised me with its amazing quality. It just finished its first phase at 301,541 words so its a good time to pick it up despite it being unfinished.

      Ayy rwby fics are my jam. Here's a few more, although they probably don't reach the same quality as the previous ones. 

      [An Exercise in Stupidity](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13067349/1/An-Exercise-in-Stupidity) is a Gamer SI fic, with the usual powerwank, but the protagonist is actually pretty fun to read. He goes full juggernaut, with high health and strength. His attitude is like that too, just butting head-on into danger and out of danger. His luck and intelligence stats are also 1, which should tell you a lot. He's not actually dumb, but let's just say he's a very impulsive guy. Pretty AU, but with some interesting developments.

      [Forged Destiny](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny) is also by Coeur Al'aran. Probably my favorite work of his. It's pretty much original, with characters from rwby. Takes place in a gamelit world where people are born into classes, which are divided into castes. From the point of view of Jaune, who was born a Blacksmith, but one day found an item that changed his class appearance into Knight. Of course, he goes into Beacon, the academy for training Hero caste (combat classes mainly) people to do quests. It's pretty good, although I found the last part a bit slow and formulaic. 

      [Professor Arc: Student of Vacuo](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12909945/1/Professor-Arc-Student-of-Vacuo) is a fanfiction of a fanfiction. Takes the premise of Professor Arc, one of Coeur's works, and makes Jaune's backstory real. He actually becomes a student of Vacuo, and then becomes a legit professor in Beacon. I remember it being pretty enjoyable, at least more so than Professor Arc.

      [Nevermore, Sweetling](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12097232/1/Nevermore-Sweetling) is a Lovecraft crossover, kinda. Follows Qrow Branwen, who takes care of cultists and dark rituals. I haven't read all of it, but it was pretty enjoyable. Funny too. Kinda like Dresden Files: RWBY edition.

  I just caught up with the current translation of Reverend Insanity. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes wuxia, or villain protagonists
  ```

    I haven't read much, but I recall the translated prose being barely coherent. Would categorize it as unreadable.

      I have read a ton of translated works, so maybe I’m just used to it.  But it was a well done translation to me.

      Like I said, it’s really good if you like translated wuxia and a villain protagonist
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        I never understood judging translations on a lower standard. Maybe it's because I'm German, but I grew up on translated books where the prose was no worse than German original books. If the Chinese to English market doesn't pay well enough to stand up to the level of quality where I am able to actually forget that it's a translation then I'd rather read something else.
        ```

        - u/Reply_or_Not:
          ```
          I’m not paying for these translations and it turns out that I like decent stories more than I care about grammar or other translation quality type things. It’s not for everyone though which is why I put the disclaimer.

          Honestly, I have no idea if Reverend Insanity is a high quality or low quality translation.   Im just so used to translations that I just dont evaluate stories along that axis any more.
          ```

          - u/Bowbreaker:
            ```
            A high quality translation is a book where you don't know that it is a translation until you are either told or assume so due to the names and regions involved.

  [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst) 

  This has been a really cool litrpg with interesting applications of basics of science in a magic world, with a bunch of moral quandaries mixed in. A slow start in the first couple of chapters that rapidly ramps up with the character's power and access to the world.
  ```

  - u/sephirothrr:
    ```
    I'd like to counter-recommend this, actually. I'll flesh out my response more fully later when I have more time, but for now-

    It doesn't feel rational at all, with the main character receiving arbitrary powerups while his allegedly min-maxing daughter just reacts.
    ```

    - u/amaze-username:
      ```
      Seconding the counter-recommendation. It started out promising, but the characterization, power scaling, and plot, have been all over the place. The last few months' worth of updates have been particularly tough to slog through for me.
      ```

    - u/tjhance:

      that's too bad, the idea of a father-daughter pair in a litrpg sounded fun

      For those people seeing how divisive Arkendrithyst is, know that his might be a good thing. Some media is like that. People either loved or hated Napoleon Dynamite, and I think Arkendrithyst is the same way.
      ```

    - u/Judah77:
      ```
      I read it to about chapter 70ish, and the min-maxing daughter chapters are excellent but the father chapters I can hardly stand.  I really don't the father's trait of immediately following the lead of any being of power who is half-way persuasive, regardless of their affiliation.  He's a spineless wimp who justifies this with espoused pacifism, and at the same time he agonizes about not being a wimp but he caves anyway every damn time and I find that is not a fun read.

          Yes, children swallow whatever propaganda is fed to them and I would no less blame an american child from admiring the CIA than I would a german child in the 30's from wanting to join the hitler jugend. But the author is presumably an adult, in which case lionizing the CIA betrays either ignorance or endorsement of evil.

          I say this as a citizen of a country that suffered for decades under a military dictatorship whose coup on a democratically elected government wasn't just aided by the CIA, it was instigated by it, and whose new regime's torturers and political suppressors were trained and indoctrinated [on US soil by it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation). The US president at the time even committed to an outright military aid(i.e. an invasion) if there was any pushback in order to reassure the conspirators, which luckily there wasn't. Regardless, the result was thousands killed and tortured, neutered and stillborn democratic institutions, and considerable economic and cultural development set backs. 

          The funny part is that because the CIA sowed so much chaos and caused so death, disorder and misery on false intelligence and harebrained analysis throughout the entire world that the above paragraph **does not narrow down which country I'm speaking of at all**. It could be indonesia, where [millions were abducted and secretly killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366), and their families didn't know for sure for decades. It could be Chile where the tens of thousands of political prisoners were tortured or killed, or a dozen other countries in central and south america, in africa or asia. And that's just the tip of the iceberg, there's no knowing how much shit they got up to that we'll never even find out. 


          In closing, if there's any justice one day admiring the CIA is going to be regarded by the wider public as only slightly better than admiring the NKVD or the SS. For many people that's already the case.

              > It's just a character detail, which you would know if you had actually read anything instead of instantly dismissing it.

              I thought that the whole "I’m going into the CIA, and that’s that" business at the beginning of Chapter 1 was pretty good. It provided a plausible reason for a 22-year-old college graduate to be "bodyguard certified and boot camp trained" and to be familiar with a couple of languages. It also introduced her insecurities:

              > She added, half whispered, “If they’ll have me.”

              (I am not qualified to judge whether this type of conversation between a new CIA intern and her father would have been considered a security breach in 2019. My guess is that it wouldn't have been a problem if she had been an analyst, but she apparently wanted to be a field agent, which is more problematic.)

              Unfortunately, the rest of Chapter 1 -- the writing, the characters, the dialog -- didn't work for me, so I set it aside before the LitRPG part could really kick in. Perhaps I'll give it another try at a later point.
              ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    I'll second the recommendation. It's not *that* rational, the protagonist becomes really powerful pretty quickly and receives some questionable powerups from dubious magicking. But overall it's a solid story all around. The worldbuilding is really well done, with an interesting and vibrant world with rich history. The system is really interesting too, but on a more mystical level than the math behind it. The characters are good, with most people being well rounded in flaws and qualities.

    As for the quick powerups, it turns out later on that while the protagonist is technically powerful and an accomplished mage, he's pretty weak compared to his peers. He works to round out his flaws of course, and later on his power base is significantly more connection based than just raw power, as in his status allows him to make friends with powerful people. 

    The one part that irks me a bit is that Erick's success at magic overshadows his daughter's practical experience and min-max mindset. It's sorta explained in one chapter by "the mana loves Erick," but we're still waiting for a better answer to that. Besides, Erick is a terrible combatant, which I feel balances out his powerful magics.
    ```

      I think the latest chapter helps tip the balance a little better in Jane’s favor ;)

      - u/CaramilkThief:
        ```
        Yeah. I'm a patreon subscriber, so I'll just say that Erick starts to tip his balance a bit too :)

        Speaking of Jane though, that's one part of the story I just adore. It has a really wholesome father-daughter relationship, especially later on. Although I'm biased, it's my favorite ongoing story right now.
        ```

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
    ```
    I'd give this a counter-recommendation. I read the first few chapters, and while the premise sounded interesting the story itself isn't great. 

    My biggest problem is the characters. They're just kinda bland, especially the dad. It feels like the author tried to make funny and eccentric but it falls flat and comes across as him not being aware that they're a step away from death.
    ```

    - u/jacksofalltrades1:
      ```
      Stories need to start out showing their characters flawed. Otherwise, how would you have a character arc?
