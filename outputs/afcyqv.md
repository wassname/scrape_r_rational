  Some thoughts:

  * Dogsi and Vedsi are hilarious.

  * The game could be over on day 1, theoretically. I wonder if this will incentivize Claim to actually play. He might have been assuming that to win, he would need to wait out all 91 days. But now, he could theoretically kill someone, win the game, and walk away with $10 million dollars and almost no time commitment.

  * By says it doesn't sound original, and apparently this is all inspired by a game called *Danganronpa*. I'd never heard of it until recently, though, and it still sounds exciting to me.

  * Knowing the rules, there are some plausible reasons you might want to keep By around, like if you think she would be easy to kill. Some of the players who voted to keep her around may have anticipated something like this.

  * I guess the reason Corn is so confused is that the properties of the Sludge sound totally impossible, and anesthesia is his area of expertise.

  * I'm excited to see the rest of the facility!

  But most importantly, we learned that two players can win. And you know what means... it's time to start shipping!

  I've taken the initiative to come up with some pairing names.

  * By & ZB - Bipolar
  * By & Caroline - Rationally Writing
  * By & Hold - Twin Towers
  * By & Claim - Wertifloke

  I figure there *must* be a clever name for By & Strait, but I can't figure out exactly what.

    also, ZB is going to be a lot harder to hit with sludge, since she's wrapped up in her penguin suit with little skin exposed.

    also, the mention of The Laundry Room makes me imagine tide pods full of sludge

  It's great to finally have the rules. Now, given those rules, what would a person do in order to maximize their utility? Hiding a body seems to be a pro strategy, as does moving a body, both in order to ensure that there's as limited an amount of evidence as possible during the trial. I'm also kind of thinking about the idea of a buddy system, which would clearly implicate one person in the event of a murder.

  (A while back I watched like five hours of sped up Town of Salem play in a row, and one of the dominant town strategies seemed to be putting everyone in a position such that town would have the best chance of winning, and anyone who was lying would be at a severe disadvantage. Of course, in this game, people need to be eliminated for anyone to win. The cooperation/defection aspects are interesting.)

  > I carefully read through it three separate times, not quite sure how to process everything all at once. It was a lot, and I had a million different questions, although some rose above others. The presence of some rules surprised me, and the absence of others I might have been expecting surprised me even more, but past that there was plenty to analysis to be had.

  Which rules do people feel are notably absent?

    There is the strategy of getting stupid people to take out the high powered people, and then eliminating them. Taking two birds with one stone, though it's hard to say how that would actually work out in practice. At best you can only provide the gun, and what they do with it is entirely out of your hands, so you'd have to rely on other effects to manipulate them so that they don't know that you know what they'll do.

    Something that will drastically affect how the game is played is how common the sludge is. If only one or two people have it, then carefully tracking who has it would be a good strategy. If it's as trivial to find as By made it seem, then the balance of power swings heavily in the killer's favor, as literally everyone will both the means and motive, and the only thing you can rely on is opportunity and evidence.

    While the rules eliminate sharing *the prize,* what's defined as the prize is more vague. Is stuff purchased with the prize unable to be shared? Of course, that quickly devolves into trading stocks or gold or whatever, which can all easily be converted into money and which the prize was probably going to get converted into anyways. Even more complicated is the fact that a modest 3% interest on 10 mil is 300,000 per year, which would be almost impossible to argue is part of the prize. Obviously the hosts are only interested in closing the most obvious loopholes, but know where they stopped is tricky. What's worse is that it is literally undefined. Sure, they probably thought of the 100% case beforehand, simply because of the drama, but it's likely they'll go with the rule of drama in the future as well. Which means you can't simply go up to them and ask, cuz they'll probably just say no.

  Immediate thoughts:  rules 10 and 25 (and 26), multiple perpetrators before the Sludge Announcement--trials just handled chronologically, I imagine, but--what about when two perpetrators team up to simultaneously sludge two people each (in slightly-separated rooms, so that no three people see a body before all victims are down) then pile up the bodies?  Four people, clearly two victims, but how to guess which victims were which perpetrator's evenif you narrow down the two culprits?

  Similarly with if one victim each, and hoping to be thought to be just one perpetrator, and even if both identified then how to vote which perpetrator for which victim?  Even with a split vote, each true perpetrator wins.

  Permission for simultaneous perpetrators...  just preventing such perpetrator-collaboration through insisting on microsecond-level prioritisation of Trials (with a later one bumped to after the first one's hour) might work.  I wonder how it will be handled...

  The magic-/nanotech-like Sludge is fairly intriguing, regarding no partial effects and no body weight effect.  Assuming that the bracelets deliver Trial and rule-breaking and similar Sludge, I'm tempted to consider that most 'Sludge' is just a bloodstream(?) marker for the bracelets to gauge (calculated according to each participant's information), with By's sludge a deliberate false-demonstration of inherent effectiveness.

  (Incidentally, I'm somewhat familiar with Danganronpa (through the anime) and after starting this story am enjoying it and feeling greatly intrigued!)  ((As well as about the mysterious 'God' and 'Reformation' elements of the title...))

  Edit:  I forgot to mention my appreciation (of the relevant mechanic in this story) in the context of my (others' too?) Danganronpa reaction:  "Huh?  Why aren't any of the deducers talking about that neon pink paint on the corpse?  --Wait, was that supposed to represent blood?"
