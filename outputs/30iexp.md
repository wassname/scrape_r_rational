## GEB Discussion #6 - Chapter #5: Recursive Structures and Processes

### Post:

**Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid**

This is a discussion of the themes and questions concerning the **Chapter 5: Recursive Structures and Processes**, and its dialogue, **Canon by Intervallic Augmentation**.

**Recursion**

This chapter is simpler to understand than the earlier chapters, because it focuses on explaining recursion through a dizzying number of examples such as recursive definition, stacks with the pushing and popping, Recursive Transition Networks for language and physics, Escher’s paintings, and computer programming. Notice that in every case when recursion occurred, there was a base case which is how Hofstadter distinguished between recursive and circular definitions. Recursion can only happen when there is a base case for it to bottom-out in cases like the Fibonacci Functions, or to act as a starting point in cases like the G-plot. Yet when the base case is not defined for:

> **Hofstadter's Law**: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account **Hofstadter's Law**.

How is the above example still considered recursive?

Note how some forms of recursion seem to be recursive on a meta-level. In the example of computer programming, it was recursive by repeating a loop from 1 to N - 1 to test if N is prime, and it was meta-recursive by repeating the above algorithm for when N = 1 to when N = 5,000 to find out which N’s were prime. Can you think of cases of meta-recursion? Is it possible to have meta-meta-recursion and other higher levels of meta-…-meta-recursion?

Hofstadter concluded the chapter by briefly talking about recursively-enumerable sets where “This kind of ‘tangled recursion’ probably lies at the heart of intelligence.” It may be a little soon to question this idea, since Hofstadter has not yet mentioned any possible supporting arguments, but do you agree with the idea that recursions is a fundamental quality of (and possibly the cause of) intelligence? Or would creativity be a better description for how recursion relates to intelligence? Remember if you believe Hofstadter is right, then why are humans so bad at it as compared to computer programs which are clearly not as intelligent? A good example is Gary Kasparov vs. Deep Blue in a chess match.

Hofstadter briefly brought up God as related to recursion. Why would someone believe the G-plot to be a picture of God, or in other words, what is so compelling about the graph? What is your opinion of the agnostic fellow.

Curry’s notes talks about how Hofstadter has an analogy for God as “Something which is unattainable, or stands outside the system”. Curry asks the question, if God is the universe and part of the universe prays to God, then is God recursive? What would happen if you made the following prayer: “I pray that this prayer is not answered”?

……

**Dialogue**

The jukebox brings up an interesting question. What contains more information about the song, the record or the phonograph playing it? We can agree that the information about the song is contained in both the record and the phonograph, but the record only contains the most basic information, the ‘skeleton’ of the song, and the phonograph simply modifies it into multiple variations.

Is this jukebox idea even possible in real life? Hint: Look up [Steganography]( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/steganography). In addition, what do you think would have happened if other songs have been selected? Remember that there were an entire jukebox worth of songs and they all can’t modify the ‘skeleton’ in the same way.

I recommend looking up [John Cage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage) and his music such as [4’33”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%E2%80%B233%E2%80%B3).

  Chapter 5 leads to a lot of questions. I'll copy them from the wiki to here for discussion:

  1) We have provided lots of examples of recursion, self-similar fractals, and so on. Come up with some other contexts in which recursion appears.

  2) Use the RTN on p. 134 to come up with some "fancy nouns".

  2a) What path do you go down to implement the linguistic structure of the nursery rhyme "The House that Jack Built"? Leave off the "This is", because this isn't a machine for making complete sentences. For reference, it goes, in part:

  *[This is] the dog that worried the cat that chased the rat that ate the cheese that lay in the house that Jack built.*

  2b) What path do you go down to make a phrase where all the verbs pile up at the end, as the German language is known for?

  3) On p. 137, Hofstadter describes the sequence known as "G-flip", where you flip diagram G from left to right and re-number the nodes.

  3a) Draw a few levels of G-flip. What is the algebraic expression that defines it?

  3b) Draw a few levels of H-flip. What is the algebraic expression that defines it?

  4) What does the diagram of the "married" functions F and M look like?

  5) To what extent are Feynman diagrams a formal system?

  6) What type of isomorphism links all the butterflies in Escher’s Butterflies on page 148?

  7) What is the connection between recursion and isomorphism? What does Hofstadter say the connection is?

  8) What is the essence of modularity in programming?

  9) Discuss the following quote: “Modularity exists, of course, in hi-fi systems, furniture, living cells, human society — wherever there is a hierarchical organization.” (p. 150)

  10) Did "Hofstadter's Law" (p. 152) actually apply to a computer program becoming the world chess champion?

  11) How does human intelligence make use of recursion, according to Hofstadter?

  12) How does human intelligence make use of recursion, according to someone relevant *besides* Hofstadter?

  Writing the post for this chapter felt weird, because for once there wasn't a large number of ideas being discussed simultaneously all at the same time and I didn't have to pick and choose the most interesting ones. It was all about recursion and the post feels particularly short.

  I'm also glad that next week, we are going to be going over only two chapters. I wouldn't have been able to keep up three posts per week much longer. I noticed that last Friday's post is the worst written of the lot.

  Oh, Hofstadter. Pessimism can be just as blind as optimism, if neither is paired with accurate observations and correct principles. You can't just expect every plan/expectation to fall through and call that wisdom. (Although being prepared in case things do go long/wrong can be wise.)
