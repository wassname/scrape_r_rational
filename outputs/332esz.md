  So, based on this chapter, the only information Ginny is missing is what the Dementor represents and she'd be able to cast the True Patronus otherwise.

  Saying this now in case the opposite ends up happening, so I will have agreed or disagreed in advance.

  It's interesting to see how there's such a difference in up/downvotes between the Sealed Intelligence posts here on /r/rational and over there on /r/hpmor. It has been very consistent, too, after it first started to dip over here.

    After seeing this comment, I decided to plot it. On both subreddits, there was a large drop between chapters 1 and 8. On /r/HPMOR there was about an 80 point drop before the scores started oscillating around 20, while here the scores started just over 50 and dropped to zero. Given that there are 2850 subscribers here, and almost 8000 there, I don't think there is a significant difference.

      I was paying attention the percentage of upvotes, but this is also interesting.
