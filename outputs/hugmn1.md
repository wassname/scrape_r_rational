## Coherent urban fantasy

### Post:

Have you ever read a realistic or coherent urban fantasy novel? Or setting.   
Where there is a good reason why no one sees supernatural everyday, why vampires are not on MTV and immortal dragon ruling the countries?   


I have read a couple of urban fantasy I like, Laundry Files and Monster Hunter International, but they are far from rational.  


So, what is your favorite urban fantasy and what is the most rational urban fantasy you have read?

  Pact is probably worth mentioning here. In it there's stuff like the Seal of Solomon, which punishes supernatural things that act out of line, including by messing with muggles. Wildbow seems to have made an actual effort to think about how a masquerade can exist, even if its not the story's main focus.

    Additionally you are magically responsible for the actions of the people you let in on the secret which creates believable incentives to keep it a secret.

    I would assume that Wildbows new serial also would fit the description \[edit: since it's the same setting\] OP asks for though I haven't been reading it.

      It's based on the same world, so yes

      Wow I missed Wildbo started it. I loved the setting of Pact but the beginning was too slow and depressing. Is this Pale good? impressions so far?
      ```

      - u/Aperturelemon:
        ```
        Pale is very good. The protagests don't have several generations of bad karma like Blake did, so their luck is much much better. Wildbow is also doing this thing with adding artwork, detective notes, spell notes, etc every few chapters.

        People have said that it's more lighthearted that Pact and I'm getting the impression the scale is smaller though I haven't read it.
        ```

        I'm enjoying it and find that it avoids many of the pacing issues that Pact encountered - the new protagonists get into the thick of things right away  in a way that reminds me of the opening parts of Twig, and there's enough lighthearted interactions that it doesn't feel like an eternal doom and gloom conga like like late-story Pact did.

        Pact ends up being really good :)

        No pressure-- there are plenty of stories out there that are just as good, and probably without the start up cost of the slow burn. I only mean to communicate that I dont think you'll regret having read it, imo.

  Maybe try Library at Mount Char or Orphans of Chaos.

  I'll mention Seanan McGuire's October Daye series. Modern day meets fairy magic, in a nutshell - the fae are mostly hypertraditional, but use glamour to hide their presence from the modern world, the protagonist is a halfbreed "knight" who gets sent for when the human world is involved. The worldbuilding is vibrant and beautiful, the stories themselves are more noire style though, with Toby being a fairy private eye - more like Jessica Jones than Sherlock Holmes though, its not a rational story in the sense that the character's intelligence is key to the plot. It does feature a cyber-dryad living in a decision tree though, who is basically the best side character ever.

  I think a coherent urban fantasy could be made true if a long time ago a group of people botched a "hide me" ritual that became a "hide all else" blood curse.  
  that way we have the "normal" that are made incapable to comprehend the abnormal (the crazy cultist are the "normal" that are trying to fight the curse by cheer will).  
  and we have an actual functionning "abnormal" society wich is surimposed.  
  this way we could incorporate the metal panda anime as an actual place where were-beast compete with the "normal" for office space.

    I had toyed with ideas for an urban fantasy setting a few years back, and this was very close to my answer for a meaningful Masquerade.  In an act of final desperation, the Chefzauberers of the Thule Society had repurposed an experimental antimemetic weapon into a global Pyrrhic bomb.  The bomb indirectly killed virtually all magical creatures and magically active humans (magical equivalent of pilots suddenly forgetting, not just how to fly, but what flight was, en masse), and contaminated their works, remains, and ruins with a mighty antimemetic effect.  In this setting, the mundane world was just what was *left*, and the magical world would have been a devastated post-apocalyptic wasteland, set in and alongside the muggle world, only a twist in perspective away...  Abandoned wizard towers dotting the skylines of the bad parts of Chicago and Detroit, the carcasses of dragons rotting in unused fields.  And a small number of survivors fighting for control over the few relics that permit selectivity of the antimemetic effect.

  *The One Who Eats Monsters* had a lovely coherent setting, and was pretty good (if rather dark).

  Basically the fantastic things tend to avoid urban areas where they are less powerful (too many humans amd too much iron), have a pretty serious antimemetic effect protecting them, and are very rare - think global population in the thousands. They also tend to be very, very nasty...

    Ok read it.  I liked the monster the protagonist was. Novel yet similar to old archetypes. Very good. Disliked that you could clearly the political stance of the author. It is fucking annoying when the author pushes her political opinions down your throat. Also it is basically a rape revenge female fantasy across the whole book.

  The hardest part of a rational masqurade is that human nature opposes it. We probably would be ok with having wizards around rather than "scared of what we don't understand". How many cultures have given prestige and respect to the local magic user? 

  Or the idea that we don't want to know, check a poll for how many people believe ghosts exist. Even if ghosts actually do exist, they never ride a zombie dinosaur through Chicago. So the percentage of people who believe in wizards in urban fantasy should be higher than the percentage of real people who believe in ghosts. 

  I think you'd pretty much have to come up with a supernatural reason. Anyone who sees magic always forgets about it. Anyone with magic is cursed to have to hide or else. Or a powerful group with a motive (ideological or practical) enforces the masqurade lethally.

    >I think you'd pretty much have to come up with a supernatural reason.

    **Pact** has it. Mundanes have natural protection against magic. Anyone who notice magic become vulnerable to it and most of them quickly die and/or disappear. Magic is mostly metaphorical and it's effects on mundane world are seen as natural phenomena. Victims of magic often disappear with all their causal connections to mundane world, without any trace.

  I kind of like how the Dresden Files handles this. The masquerade is pretty porus, people aren't aware of the supernatural but the supernatural only really put in a lazy effort to keep things under wraps. Supernatural entities do run much of the world. The upside is that Dresden can go around doing whatever without worrying too much about the masquerade, though he's likely more cavalier than most.
  ```

  - u/CorneliusPhi:
    ```
    It makes for a good story, and I have fun reading them, but Dresden Files is in no way a rational take on a masquerade.  It is trivially easy to prove that magic exists in that setting and there are tens of thousands of people in the magic world who would be actively better off if they just showed the government that
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      I don't think there are tens of thousands of paranetters, and they're the only ones who would really benefit; and they've been actively hunted by both the Fomor and all the Vampire courts, so they're definitely trying to fly under the radar as much as possible.

      There's also a clear weak-masquerade which would result in them not being taken seriously.
      ```

- u/EsquilaxM:
  ```
  Isn't the standard answer that it's in the best interests of the supernatural elements not to go to war with the muggles, and any ridiculously powerful creatures have been put at bay by the wizards and such? And that they use mind magics to stay undercover?

  e.g. in the Alex Verus series>!the vampires were wiped out, at least in the main dimension, by all the magicians uniting against them.!<

    That spoiler tag doesn't work, at least not on reddit is fun and old reddit. It will work if you get rid of the extra space after the first ! though.

  In The Rook (read the book, the TV series is so-so) and Rivers of London the authorities do know, but they're keeping a lid on it for various reasons.

  China Mieville's works fit this bill. Kraken especially is a great take on the "modern cities with magical underbellies" trope: magic is associative and metaphorical, and anyone perceptive or intuitive enough can crack the veil. I haven't read it in a long time but I remember really enjoying it.
  ```

  The reason why this is rare is that the constraints make for unsatisfying stories. The inability to do things at scale (because doing anything at scale necessarily means no masquerade) saps agency from the protagonist and strongly opposes the wish-fulfillment of the reader, and working through why is... shitty. But if you can do things at scale, or there isn't a masquerade and magic is publicly known / widely available, it's not our world and people connect to it less.

  The solutions all suck. You can be:


  - totally uninterested in coherence or sense (Rowling), 
  - your characters can just all be selfish, petty-minded pricks (Grossman), 
  - there could be a centuries-old conspiracy to hide everything (Jim Hines, highly recommended), 
  - the supernatural could be hiding for its own safety from the mundanes (Harry Connolly's "A Key, An Egg, An Unfortunate Remark", highly recommended), 
  - there could be a weak masquerade that lets people in but makes the civic/secular systems not take them seriously (Dresden Files), 
  - there could be a strong masquerade that no-sells your attempts to change the world by erasing or imploding you (the Mage setting).


  But pretty much never are these things the point of the story (even Mage isn't about the masquerade so much as it is about being a super-badass up against the Evil Empire), so you don't get a better story by being realistic or coherent about it at the expense of other things.

  It's interesting that you mention the Laundry Files, because it's about as ratfic as urban fantasy gets.

  These aren't supernatural, but they're basically fantasy-like superheroes series: the Reckoners series by Brandon Sanderson and Wild Cards series by Geroge RR Martin. *[Pith](https://pithserial.com/)*, a new web series, is urban fantasy set in ~1950s.
