  I really like the way Sanderson writes his books. I'm not sure if they are entirely rational, but he is amazing at foreshadowing and creating engrossing worlds and characters.

        Yes, I note he repeats a 'fact' which we discussed, he agreed was wrong, a century of time when people were doing nothing. His ideals of why the story are irrational are fact insensitive. What actually happened in the books has minimal impact on his opinions.

        That's obviously a bit awkward for a discussion on foreshadowing and one on how engrossing the world is. That's a very fact dependent discussion.

        I definitely like how Brandon's books tend to tie the magic system into the world and science and the weather and people. There's very strong visual imagery in all of that. That would be something I'd enjoy seeing more in worlds, a pervasive impact of magic on technology, nature, and culture. It's a fairly standard thing for magic to have it be a rare thing that a few experts use which is sad for most of the populace.

          It is a classic example of bias to be literally unable to comprehend the points of people on the other side of the issue, and be forced, in your own head, to attribute it to dumb/bad/wrong instead of to the result of reasonable causal processes.
          ```

          - u/Nepene:
            ```
            I can comprehend your points. You read the book a long time ago and don't or didn't want to remember all the details but your central argument is strong, I didn't address all of your points to your satisfaction.

            I disagree with you though and think you're wrong. It looks a lot more like you treat arguments as replaceable soldiers than that you have a strong central point. You challenging me to some sort of public duel or debate to be voted on likewise didn't seem like a reasonable causal process.

        Feh, I'm not a fan of the Stormlight archives.  The damn things are literally about 3 times longer than they need to; the exact same plot, exact same progression, can all be portrayed without all the damn filler.  Also I don't give a shit what he says, Kaladin is not friggin 19, he acts like a 38 year old vet.

          Honestly people acting more mature than you'd expect for their years is something I easily overlook, mostly because I always keep in mind that in times of hardship people mature faster, and even before the current century responsibility tended to be shouldered earlier in life. 

          Of course that might create some dissonance for our generation.

          You know I found the same thing too I tried to read way of Kings and it just took way too long to get anywhere. And you're somewhat right about that character. I think Brandon was going for a depressed character and he succeeded in my opinion.

        What's the problem with referencing the Bbroken Windows theory?

            ```
            That's a fair point, but I think that if he came up with a different description it would be obvious what he was referring to (let's make one up: Smashed gaslights) It would be even more jarring because you know exactly what he is referring to (broken windows) while making a rather pointless change in words. So in reality you are totally correct that a different society would be VERY unlikely to come up with that term, but changing it for the sake of changing it would be even more immersion breaking for me.
