  Eesh, this is the problem with writing a God. (Or even a Superintelligence.)

  So, God is a sex maniac who has almost no consideration of how many beings and civilizations suffer and die on the path towards His next aeons-long orgasm, and none of the advanced civilizations that have escaped His seemingly endless series of Great Filters have the decency to spare their less advanced neighbors from these dangers. This story uses the language of futurism and transhumanism, but it all boils down to the same old crap about pain and death serving some higher purpose.

    Not entirely. It actually boils down to social darwinism, where pain and death are just the fruits of failure.

  Definitely could have used a question like "factor this randomly generated 1000 digit number, and wait while I check the answer", or a similar question that's hard to find the correct answer to, but relatively easy to check for correctness. That would provide strong evidence against telepathy if "God" got that one right.
  ```

    Rather, it would imply telepathy plus enough computing power to calculate that answer efficiently.

      I should have said "would provide strong evidence against **just** telepathy...".
      ```

  Which explains why the deity only allowed hermaphrodites to become the dominant species on Earth.

  > He could have been a true telepath. No documented evidence exists of anyone ever having such profound abilities to date but it was a possibility. It would have explained how he could know my best-kept secrets. The problem with that is that it doesn’t explain anything else! In particular it doesn’t account for the answers he proceeded to give to my later questions.

  I read the whole thing, even when the grammar started falling apart, and I'm not sure which "later questions" that hypothesis doesn't account for.

    Yeah, I mean if this guy is an actual telepath with a very good understanding of the author's mind, he'd know the things to say to convince the author. 

    Honestly, the probability I'd assign such a guy being a telepath wouldn't be so high as the author's. Imagine writing a program to simulate that hypothesis. You'd have to completely describe telepathy (reading an incredibly high amount of information, the physics that allows for the actual transmission of thought, accounting for one brain to completely model both its own mind and the target mind, or whatever other craziness is necessary). And then you'd have to account for the rest of the situation. That'd be far longer of a program than one that assumes no telepathy and only relies on things like cold reading, mental health record access, standard old manipulation, suggestion techniques, and even life-long stalking. 

    So, it seems to me even the telepathy hypothesis isn't really necessary.
