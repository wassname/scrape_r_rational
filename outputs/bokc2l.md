    From the Home Page:
    >Thou Shalt is an ongoing, young adult fantasy serial novel by Zev Shields. The story follows five people who each have to deal with their own distinctive challenges, histories, and Commands â€“ the mystical method by which the gods tell individuals what they should do.

    >The story begins by focusing on Learn, an orc who has left his clan when his Command was at odds with his day-to-day life. Does he truly have a say in the matter, or do the gods hold the final say over fate and destiny. Is everything truly writ in stone?

    >Thou Shalt updates once a week, on Thursdays.

    >Thou Shalt contains occasional scenes of violence, abuse, gore, and ilk. Please read with discretion.
