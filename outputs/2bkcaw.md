## [META][RT][HSF?] The Quantum Thief & Trilogy, which side do you choose?

### Post:

Hannu Rajaniemi's trillogy: *The Quantum Thief*, *The Fractal Prince*, and *The Causal Angel* recently ended.  Many of us here are fans of the idea that death is an enemy to be defeated, but [Basic setting spoiler] (#s "The faction most dedicated to defeating death, the Sobornost, are depicted in a less than 'friendly' and overall totalitarian light.  As opposed to the libertarian Zoku who allow death")[Causal Angel Spoiler re: "The spike"](#s ", but did have one tribe permanently escape it.") Which faction do you identify with, and why?

  I tend to think that making immortality the default option would be good. It's important to have an opt-out system, but hopefully you can also deal with depression and other quality of life problems that would cause someone to want to. 

  And beware the siren call of an argument from fiction!

  Survival is only one of the things human beings value.

  We're driven by instinct to value survival, but those same instincts, as well as (I'd argue) an unknown psychological process by which we acquire new motivations drive us to value things like love, freedom and the preservation of various things other than ourselves.  Those aren't means to accomplishing any greater purpose (in this context), they're the fundamental basis of our decision-making.

  A decent society is a social contract meant to promote what its constituents value.  In Hannu Rajaniemi's novels, the Sobornost seem to do a very good job of promoting one of the things it's people value, but at the expense of seemingly every other thing.  The uploaded minds in that society seem to be little more than tools, lacking most of the parts of our lives that we value for their own sake.

  The Zoku seem like a much more representative society.  I can't remember if their reasons for not keeping lots of backups of their minds around was ever fully explained, but I get the impression that it's more of a cultural aversion than something strictly disallowed.  That said, the way the Zoku volition affects their minds is worrying.  Can a society really be representative if it modifies what its constituents value? 

  While I'd greatly prefer the Zoku to the Sobornost, I think if I lived in that setting, I'd want to find a third option.  Maybe one of the smaller, politically unaligned tribes.

    The Zoku don't clone because they seem to be proponents/dependent on technology that is non-deterministic and unique, where the sobornost, drive for a deterministic universe where they can eventually go back and reconstruct every historical, but [Causul Angel spoiler](#s "They see the person being made up of their relationships to their society/quantum jewels and the re-instantiate a body, so long as some of those jewels survived.")

    Sobornost get's really scary when you consider they are editing people's utility functions for the partial Gogols.  We don't know if they treat the rest of the uploaded well, but it is implied that those minds are working in a task they all believe in and that they have time off in "vers" i.e. simulspace.

  Damn, the third one is already out? I haven't even finished Prince yet. :/
