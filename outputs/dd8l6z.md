## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

  So just found out that there seems to be another 'universal' human experience that I don't have.

  http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20181112-severely-deficient-autobiographical-memory-is-surprisi

  Can you guys really go back in memory and experience what you felt at a time again? The closest thing I can think of that I can do is remember something that happened, and then try to guess how I'd feel if it happened to me again. This is easiest with embarrassing memories, or memories I'd be embarrassed about now even if I remember not being embarrassed at the time. Those also seem to be the moments that I remember best / for longest.

  Mostly posting here to make sure I'm not misreading the article completely and self-diagnosing lack of ability that people don't actually have
  ```

  - u/meterion:

    Yes, that is pretty standard fare of experience to me. It sounds like the article is describing something even more severe than what you have, where not only can she not recall any emotional experiences from the past but has difficulty imagining herself within a memory or daydream at all.

    For me it's pretty effortless to reimagine being in some past situation again and running through what happened again, feeling an echo of the same emotions without any extra thought involved.
    ```

  - u/ElGuien:
    ```
    Yep. I can remember fairly well what I was like at various ages and how I felt at the time certain experiences happened. I would not describe it as "mental time travel" though. More like emotional state is just information that gets recalled along with the events and context. It's typically only significant if the event produced strong emotions, but then "experiences that evoked strong emotional responses" are what we remember most anyway. Or at least that's my impression from general knowledge - I've never really bothered to look into it, so I don't know what current research says.

    It's kind of weird to think that you wouldn't be able to remember what you were feeling at the time some experience happened, but you can remember the actual events. Can you remember what you did and why you did it?

      >It's kind of weird to think that you wouldn't be able to remember what you were feeling at the time some experience happened, but you can remember the actual events. Can you remember what you did and why you did it?

      Well, I generally think I remember less than other people, have noticed that long ago already. I can only remember what I did for specific events that seemed significant at the time (or shortly after), and so became part of a mental story. It's not particularly easier for me to remember what I did versus remembering something someone else did.

      I can remember what I was feeling during an event if that was a really important part of the event, but again - that's the same as remembering something that happened to someone else, and knowing what they likely felt at the time.

        Interesting! Thanks for answering. I'm not quite sure what to make of that other than "OK, so that's a thing."

      That's tough to interpret. I definitely don't experience anything *visual* when reading, but if I'm engrossed enough I don't really register the text / page / screen visually either.

          Do you ever get engrossed in music? Close your eyes and just feel emotions without any particular visual or conscious aspect to them? It's something like that. In fiction I can identify or relate to characters and feel things as if what I'm reading was really happening to me or someone close to me, but there's no visual aspect to it.
          ```

    - u/MayMaybeMaybeline:
      ```
      Neither for me as well. When I'm engrossed I don't see the page, and I'm not aware of the words as such, but it's not visual either. It's hard to describe because it's very abstract, I just experience it as an awareness of a series of events happening, and of the feelings of the protagonist. It's pretty much the same way I experience recalling a memory, as I responded to OP with, which has an interesting effect in that my memories of books are pretty much identical to my memories of my own life, and my own memories don't really feel more significant in any way.

      I have a friend I like to talk to about this kind of thing because she's at the extreme end of being a visual thinker, to the point where her internal voice exclusively uses images instead of words. She has trouble reading stories unless there's a film adaptation or fanart of the characters she can look at first, because otherwise she'll just imagine the characters as stick figures when she reads, which isn't very enjoyable.

          ```
          Yeah, it was very strange and surprising to me as well. If I understand her right (which I easily could not be,) she can't really hold a vague and fuzzy image of a person, she needs to have a fully formed image, and since people and especially faces are so distinct, I think her brain can't just produce a new unique person on demand, so it has to settle for a cartoony stick figure.

          I like your example of the red train. For me, I can imagine shapes and movement and spacial relations, but it's more like proprioception than like vision, more like feeling my hand being in a place and moving around than like watching an object move. There's no color, and shapes are only as complex as I bother making them. I could construct a whole model of a train with lots of detail, or a basic outline of a train, or just a cylinder. For a quick sentence like this I'd probably just make a point particle and label it 'train' and 'red'.  The point particle would be moving along a pair of lines labeled 'track', maybe along an inclined plane l label 'mountain'. Then the point particle is relabeled 'toy train' and everything is shrunk to a smaller size. A object labeled 'hand' appears and picks up the train and is then extended into a basic body shape standing over a table shape.

          Having written that, I think it's still actually more detail than I usually use when reading a sentence. To some degree I think spatially like that, but to some degree I just invoke the concepts by themselves. It's hard to even describe it more abstractly though, except as just like: red, train, movement forward, train tracks, mountain, smallness, hand, grabbing, person, table.

            For me it's quite different, I can't think visually at all, unless I'm either very close to REM sleep or otherwise (very) strongly in a sort of "wandering" state of mind.

            I'd say my main mode of thought is auditory, but that may not be exactly accurate. I'd say it's sort of a mix between auditory and "generic language processing".

            For a long time I thought my thoughts were almost entirely auditory, but I noticed that I can think about things even without a coherent "inner voice", which is most noticeable when speed-reading, or skimming some text.

            On another, slightly related note, I believe I have aphantasia. I cannot imagine anything visual vividly - unless I'm on the edge of REM sleep. I recently took a survey about aphantasia, where one of the questions was about the vividity of certain modes of thought - including visual, auditory, olfactory, and so on. I'd like to score how vivid some modes of thought are for me:

            - auditory: I can recall somewhat complex audio sensation (simple melodies, simple percussion) with near-perfect clarity. I can _almost_ hear any audio I imagine, but real auditory sensation takes precedence unless I've tuned it out (fan noise, AC hum, radio static).
            - spatial: Great vividity, great recall (but I never got the memory palace method to work). I can extremely vividly imagine a space, and I can easily mend it. If the space becomes too complex (e.g. trying to imagine a maze) I lose detail. This 'sense' is completely separate from all other senses, and is hard to explain. I imagine an entire space at once, OR I imagine a view (non-visual) from a traversal within that space.
            - kinesthetic: Very mild vividity when awake. I can imagine the sensation of movement, but it's extremely dull compared to the real thing. When near REM sleep (or even in light sleep) imagining this is way more vivid. One of my methods of inducing a lucid dream is imagining something with strong kinesthetic sense, like laying on a beach, with the waves moving me (pulling me, pushing me, and rolling around me, with an occasional larger wave that spins me around), or being on a swing/hammock, or on a rollercoaster.
            - olfactory: Absolutely nothing. I cannot imagine a smell in any meaningful way. I cannot recall smells at all, only the connections I made at the time of making the memory (e.g. I can recall that I felt a _sweet, flowery_ smell, but only if I've taken note at the time, and these are just arbitrary labels that describe smells that share some characteristics, I most likely couldn't distinguish smells from memory if they shared those characteristics). I can't imagine smells even in REM sleep.
            - visual: Minimal vividity. When fully awake, it's hit or miss whether imagining anything visual works at all. If it does, it's likely just a simple shape, minimal color, if any. Recall is marginally easier. In REM sleep, however, I can imagine strong and vivid visual sensation, which seems moderately tied to spatial sensation.
            - touch: No vividity for recall or imagined touch.
            - pain: No vividity for recall or imagined pain of any form, except for rare occurences in REM dreams, where the pain is dull, mild, short-duration, and usually leads to instantly waking up.
            - temperature: No vividity for recall or imagined sensation of temperature. The real sense overrides any possible attempt at this.
            - faces: This is potentially a subset of visual, but I have zero face recall, if I try to imagine faces on the edge of REM sleep I get generic 'fuzzy' features, which look fine at first, but if I try to "concretize" any one of their features, I end up neck deep in the uncanny valley (which is weird to experience from within your own mind). I can only *learn* faces by A LOT repeated exposure until I hardwire some neurons to recognize them. This is only a one-way recall. I could not draw ANY face, not even my own, or my parents' faces.
            - Am I forgetting anything important?

            - u/Anderkent:
              ```
              Oooh, love this idea.

              auditory: Very vivid. I can hear something like a symphonic orchestra in my head, and if there's no distraction / am in the right mood identify position of individual instruments. (though, my memory is not good enough to confidently recall something like this from memory; it'd likely be made up)

              spatial: Moderate. I can imagine / 'feel' distance and relative position of two objects on a plane (though scale is very abstract; i.e. something can be twice as far from X than some other thing, but not '10 meters away')

              kinesthetic: Moderately strong. Things like 'this is what it feels like to move my hand' or 'this is what it feels like to ski' are identifiable and distinct, but not possibly confusable with actually doing it.

              olfactory: Yep also nothing.

              visual: Basically nonexistent. I can visualise basic geometric by constructing them with intersecting lines / planes.

              touch: Reasonably vivid. I can recall and feel things like the feel of sea spray on my face while sailing, the feel of snow, the feeling of pressing a key on a mechanical versus rubber-dome keyboard, or fingernail striking a guitar string.

              pain: Yeah recalled pain feels nothing like real pain to me. I also have fairly high pain tolerance naturally - whenever I see someone writhing under a massage I feel quite envious actually :P Those never really feel like much to me.

              temperature: Weak. I can imagine being hot, warm, cold; seems there's a couple levels but no gradual scale.

              faces: Am basically face blind :P

    I think it depends on how you recall the memory, recalling the facts or details doesn't do much but putting yourself back in it does for me.

    When you think of a horribly embarrassing memory you don't get the sensation of it? I don't really feel the emotion that much, but I still feel the chest tightness of embarrassment. Or can you think of a time you were justifiably angry? Does your heart rate not pick up a bit or you feel it pounding?

      >I think it depends on how you recall the memory, recalling the facts or details doesn't do much but putting yourself back in it does for me.

      See that 'putting yourself back in' part I always thought was a figure of speech about imagining you're in that kind of situation again.

      >When you think of a horribly embarrassing memory you don't get the sensation of it? I don't really feel the emotion that much, but I still feel the chest tightness of embarrassment.

      I kinda do. But it happens no matter whether I was embarrassed at the time, it feels like run of the mill second-hand embarrassment.

      > Or can you think of a time you were justifiably angry? Does your heart rate not pick up a bit or you feel it pounding?

      No, can't really think of a time like that :P I don't really get angry.

      Oh that's very easy to interpret for me. Suppose someone you know went on a trip. You know they went on a trip but you personally don't have any memories of the trip.

  The latest [SAO Abridged Episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7bzWoWNz1w) just came out and there's an element in there that I think will appeal specifically to /r/rational.

  Does anyone have links to detailed anatomical diagrams of jumping spiders' faces, specifically regarding the articulation of the pedipalps?

  This is for a Halloween costume of a spider head similar to [the dancing peacock spider](https://biomorphosis.tumblr.com/post/95684854810/cant-dance-well-youre-not-getting-laid-a). Last year, I had a single point of articulation located beneath the eyes, where the top of the pedipalps were tied to the skull with strips of fabric. The pedipalps didn't move convincingly, and I'd like to do better this year, but that requires understanding the anatomy.

  Just finished the first Cradle Anthology, which I got free on Kindle a week or two ago. The worldbuilding is fun, but the characters are somewhat one-dimensional. The twist at the end of the third book was actually a refreshing surprise.

  Is it worth reading further?
  ```

  - u/Throwoutawaynow:
    ```
    Yes yes yes. I just binged the series, it’s fantastic, the characters aren’t the deepest ever, but there’s a lot of really fun and interesting ones, and the world building continues to be fantastic

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      One thing I will say about the characters in pretty much all of Will Wight's books, is that they may not be deeply explored but they tend to be *very* self-consistent. There's no backsliding in character development just to progress the plot, and characters almost never act out-of-character.

      IMO the best example of this is Lindon's self-assertiveness. He starts out the series speaking in a super formal and submissive manner (largely because he's the weakest person around), but as he becomes more powerful and as people tell him to stop talking like that, he slowly drops it and becomes more assertive. 

      It even turns in to a joke in Underlord: >!people tell Lindon he's not allowed to go somewhere and he decides you know what? I'm a powerful Sacred Artist so I can do what I want. He barges in only to realize that they were telling him not to enter because Yerin was changing.!< It's funny, but still in character and even works as a bit of character growth.
      ```

  - u/nohat:
    ```
    I think so. I felt like it kinda slowed down as the world grew (particularly the most recent book), but solid overall. If you enjoyed the first books you will enjoy the rest. Characters are indeed kinda one dimensional, but they do their job.
    ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    Yeah, I think the characters get reasonably more complex as they're explored. It's never going to be Dostoevski, but it's definitely good enough.

    My only complaint with Cradle is that the last book's ending doesn't close enough threads. It's not really a cliffhanger but it feels like a middle act of a bigger book rather than a thing on its own. But you have a bunch of stuff to read until that becomes a problem :P

    I would not say PGtE has an ending in sight. We're not even in sight of the ending of this book, and I don't even know if this is the last book.

So it’s currently on book 5, the books have gotten longer and there could be anywhere from 6-8 books total, assuming the author didn’t inflate things even more than intended since the Drow arc.

    Practical Guide to Evil is just entering the endgame.  That's nowhere near ending in sight though.
