## Any good rational(ist) Diablo, Starcraft or Warcraft fanfics?

### Post:

Blizzard not being known for producing characters/storylines that are at all rational, this seems fertile ground for rationalist fanfic.

  Not really rational, but there's some Sufficiently Analyzed Magic in [Frostblood](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6423427/1/Frostblood).
  ```

  If there are, I've never found them.
  ```

  ```
  [This story](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9997352/1/Zanathos) came closest to scratching that itch, in a guilty-pleasure sort of way.
  ```

  Iâ€™d love myself a good Diablo story.

  On a somewhat relevant note, there are [*Dungeon Keeper Ami*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/DungeonKeeperAmi) (Dungeon Keeper) and [*Tabula Avatar*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheTabulaAvatarUniverse) (Baldur's Gate).
  ```

  - u/Kinrany:
    ```
    I second Dungeon Keeper Ami. Great worldbuilding, and the setting is similar to Warcraft.
    ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    I tentatively advise against Dungeon Keeper Ami. It has its moments, but it's butter spread over too much bread. And even in the best bits, the writing isn't very good. (It's... not very tasty bread? Work with me here.)
    ```
