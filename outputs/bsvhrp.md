## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I'd like to reverse-Munchkin Emperor Palpatine (circa Episode III).

  He has:

  * Nearly-full control of the bureaucratic mechanisms of the Republic, due to being the Chancellor and having been given emergency powers to deal with the Separatists,
  * A clone army which has been programmed with secret orders which only he knows the extent of,
  * Total control over the Separatists and their droid army,
  * A mole in the Jedi Council, who will side with him instead of the Jedi in any dispute, as he is, for all intents and purposes, holding that mole's wife hostage,
  * The full knowledge of the Sith (from Darth Plagueis) and the Jedi Order (from Count Dooku), and
  * The ability to "foresee" the future, and to block the Jedi from doing the same.

  You are Mace Windu.  You have just been informed by Skywalker that Palpatine is also Darth Sidious, leader of the Separatists.  You have reason to suspect Skywalker's loyalties (as Palpatine had been his patron for years), but no definitive confirmation that he is a mole.  Whether or not this is the case, Skywalker has told you Palpatine knows that he was coming here to tell you.

  You do not *know* that Sidious has implanted secret orders in the clones, but you have figured out that he is the one who commissioned the clone army in the first place, so taking precautions for such an event would be wise.

  You're also smart enough to figure out that any direct attack, if unsuccessful, will be portrayed as an assassination attempt and used to turn the public against the Jedi.

  Master Windu, Jedi Master, tactical genius, accomplished rationalist, and all-around badass: what do you do?
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    First, it is obvious that Skywalker plays a key role in some Sith plot, as there would be no reason otherwise for Darth Sidious to have been his patron for years. Even if Skywalker has not personally fallen to the dark side, he has still been working closely with Sidious for years, and so Sidious knows Skywalker too well.

    So first and most importantly, you must convince Skywalker into voluntary self-imprisonment within the Jedi temple. Tell him that years of unguarded contact with Sidious has let Sidious learn how to manipulate him with ease, and that any action he takes could be furthering the cause of the Sith. Tell him also, that his very presence as an active force in the Republic will endanger everyone he cares about, as Darth Sidious knows who he cares about, and will gladly involve them in dangerous Sith plots to manipulate Skywalker further. Therefore it is unfortunate, but Skywalker must retire to the Jedi temple until Darth Sidious is defeated.

    The next step is capturing a clone and analyzing him. The clones are clearly part of a Sith plot, since Sidious couldn't possibly have strengthened the armies of the republic out of goodwill.  Interrogate the clone. Scan him with the Force, with X-rays, with every method imaginable, to find out what Sidious has done with the clone army. With luck, you may uncover the Sith plot without anyone noticing. Otherwise, you have to go to the clone army creation facilities and force the creators to tell you. The latter plan is significantly more risky, as Sidious would definitely be looking closely at those facilities.

    If you find evidence that Palpatine has rigged the clone army creation facilities, you can then reveal it to the public, and denounce the Chancellor as a tyrant forcing the clones to obey him even if its against their will. Systematically reduce the powers of the Chancellor and get others to vote against him on every issue until he is removed from his position, then the Jedi can freely strike at him.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      Alternative plan that might work even better: assign teams of Jedi as bodyguards for every Senator, with the most powerful team guarding the Chancellor. Cite the separatist threat, and claim that the separatists may wish to assassinate the members of the Republic council, so they all need Jedi bodyguards 24/7. 

      If, it turns out that Skywalker was lying or mistaken, the Chancellor should welcome this extra layer of security. Otherwise,  Darth Sidious will find it really really hard to control his various Sith plots while a team of powerful Jedi are watching him 24/7.
      ```

      - u/hh26:
        ```
        The issue here is that is the Chancellor might counter this with fake evidence of the Jedi being traitors and this as some plot to assassinate every Senator simultaneously.  Though this would be much harder for him to do than if you attack him directly.
        ```

        - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
          ```
          Indeed. Further, in the event that the Sith has prepared such fake evidence, it may still be in the best interest of the Jedi to force him to play his hand early, rather than allow him to wait for an opportune moment to reveal the fake evidence at a time when the public perception of the Jedi is at its lowest. Revealing the fake evidence now, while the Jedi are still well-respected, would turn the affair into a he-said she-said issue of the Chancellor vs the Jedi, and the Jedi may receive far more support in such an event.

    Here's the [scene in question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0efr3g9fW8), to set the stage. Looking at this again with a critical eye, Windu's actions are simply baffling.

    Just imagine, a young Jedi, but the most promising Jedi ever in history, 'The Chosen One', casually walks up to you and tells you that the chancellor is a Sith Lord (as if it's just a minor problem, nothing you need to be called about immediately), and that he 'Knows the ways of the force and has been trained to use the dark side'... ?!?!?!

    Anakin, I sense your confusion, and my mind is positively *brimming* with questions right now as well. Firstly, how could Palpatine be a Sith Lord without the Jedi Council sensing it immediately?

    Maybe he's clouding your senses?

    He would have to be an extremely powerful Sith to cloud the senses of even Master Yoda. But let's suppose that's possible. How do you know that he's a Sith Lord?

    Um, well I overheard it while he was talking.

    Anakin, you had just told me that the chancellor of the Republic is an incredibly powerful Sith Lord with no hesitation whatsoever. When I asked you how you knew it, you started off by stalling with 'well' and 'um'. Your sudden hesitation makes me think you just lied to me. Aside from which, you want me to believe that the ultra-powerful Sith Lord who has successfully hidden from the Jedi council is sloppy enough to reveal his true nature to other people in the presence of potential eavesdroppers? Nope, I'm not buying it. You're in on this somehow and you're covering it up, and poorly. But look, if what you said earlier is true, you may have just saved the Republic. I don't care if you're in on this somehow, I just want to get to the bottom of this. Try again. How do you know that Palpatine is a Sith Lord?

    Search your feelings master Windu. You'll see that I'm telling the truth.

    Anakin, no. You *just* told me that an ultra-powerful Sith Lord is clouding my feelings. Now you're asking me to trust those feelings. Think about it. Right now, our only option is to think logically. Whatever you think you know from your Jedi senses, disregard it. Let your feelings go away, and for now just act on the basis of factual information and logical conclusions built upon it. Again, how do you know that Palpatine is a Sith Lord?

    Okay, he just told me a story. We were sitting at the opera talking in private and he revealed that he had some knowledge of the dark side. He told me a Sith legend about a Darth Plagueis the Wise, a Sith Lord who could use the force to create life and prevent death. He then said that Plagueis taught his apprentice everything he knew, and then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. The way he told it, it sounded like Chancellor Palpatine was implying that he was the apprentice.

    Alright, I'm still skeptical, but that sounds closer to the truth. Still though, why would an incredibly powerful Sith Lord reveal that to a Jedi, let alone "The Chosen One", the Jedi who is to bring balance to the force? Presumably, if he's telling you something like that, he's expecting you'll work with him rather than against him. What did he offer you?

    He didn't offer me anything. I think he was just...

    Bullshit Anakin. You've told me that he successfully hid himself from the Jedi council but then revealed himself to the Chosen One. He wants you in his pocket, and he knew you well enough to determine that it was safe to tell you that story. Since you've lied to me, it seems most likely he succeeded. But I know you're not a bad person, Anakin. I know you well enough to know that you wouldn't be happy about a Sith Lord becoming powerful enough to rule the Republic as an emperor. He's obviously offering you *something* incredibly important to get you on his side. What is it?

    Okay, he implied that he would teach me how to prevent death.

    Alright, I can kind of believe that. Still, it doesn't seem like an even trade. Learn how to prevent death, but help a Sith Lord become even more powerful. I'm not quite buying it. Unless he's claiming he'll teach you how to prevent all death, everywhere, forever? Is that it?

    I don't think so. It didn't sound like he was talking about anything that powerful.

    Then what's the secret that you aren't you telling me? Who are you trying to keep from dying?

    *sigh* Padme. I want to save Padme from dying.

    Okay. Why exactly do you think Senator Amidala is going to die?

    I've had dreams, visions of Padme dying in childbirth.

    Oh. Hmm. That's a lot to take in. But okay, so you're going to be a dad, Padme will be the mother of your children. You're having visions of her dying, and you're willing to do anything to save her. Alright, this is fairly manageable. Remember how we just talked about Jedi senses? Don't trust them. Palpatine could easily be giving you visions of Padme dying and then exploiting them. Isn't it odd that he specifically offered to help you learn how to prevent death? He has to know about your visions at the very least, and if he's clouding all of our senses, it seems rather likely that he's inventing the visions as well.

    I don't think so. I trust my visions.

    Anakin. Think logically. There is no good reason to trust Jedi senses right now. You're being deceived.

    Master Windu, I understand, but I've had visions like this in the past that were very accurate.

    Anakin, that doesn't matter. Did you sense that Palpatine was a Sith?

    No, but the visions are too real. There's no way they could be made-up.

    Anakin. Look, you've already acknowledged it. Palpatine is clouding your senses too, and you've admitted that you couldn't tell. There's really only two choices - one, if you really believe he's a Sith Lord then you can't trust your own senses because he's manipulating them perfectly and seemingly knows about your visions, or two, Palpatine isn't actually a Sith Lord and he's just trying to manipulate you into thinking that he is. In the first case, Palpatine is offering you a solution to a problem that may well be fabricated. In the second case, he's offering you a solution that he's not actually capable of providing. Either way, siding with Palpatine is a bad choice. See my point?

    Well... okay. Fine, you're right. But there's still a chance that the visions could actually be real and he may be my only way to save Padme.

    Anakin. Think logically. If Palpatine is a Sith Lord, then he must have been giving General Grievous commands this whole time. If what you're telling me is correct, then he's been secretly running both sides of the galactic civil war the whole time to maneuver himself into the position of chancellor and to acquire emergency powers. This is the kind of person that you're going to trust when he says he can help you save Padme if you'll help him?

    Okay, okay, I get it. He cannot be trusted, my senses cannot be trusted either. What am I supposed to trust then, the Jedi council?

    Facts, verifiable facts. And logic to connect them together.

    Okay. So what do we do?

    Let's contact the council and tell them what we know. If Palpatine is really powerful enough to cloud the senses of the entire Jedi council, we'll most likely need several Jedi masters to have a chance of taking him down. Let's start by talking with Master Yoda.

  Through the ages, there has been a powerful spell so costly that it was cast only by people of great means, and only in times of great need. The spell pulls in a person from another world, one suited for a specific task identified within the customization of the spell. It was a person from another world who brought the Midnight Prince low, a person from another world who pushed back the Benthic Horde, and a person from another world who saved this one from a fracture beyond time and space. The spell offers no guarantees, and in fact, has been cast twice after a first failure of the otherworlder, and its methods of accomplishing the needed tasks are often unorthodox and surprising, but it's been a tool of last resort for millennia.

  Seven years ago, new agricultural techniques allowed one of the necessary reagents to be grown and harvested at a small fraction of the previous cost. At the same time, better mining techniques have allowed the opening of a mine which gathers the requisite ores at a small fraction of the previous cost. And lastly, flourishing education initiatives have meant that the requisite technical aspects are available at (yes, you guessed it) a fraction of the previous cost.

  The end result is that this spell which summons the (unexpected) perfect person for the task can now be cast for approximately the price of a used car.

  ----

  You get pulled to another world. You are summarily informed of the above, and told that your task is to prepare society for the influx of people from other worlds, which has already begun. Further, you're tasked with finding as many possible exploits that this spell makes available, as well as guarding society against those exploits where they would have negative effects.

  For the purposes of this discussion, the world contains no useful magic whatsoever besides the summoning spell itself, which can draw from hundreds of worlds with varying technology levels, Earth being one of the most advanced.

  For the purposes of this discussion, the person pulled in by the spell will be chosen using a combined metric of non-notoriety (how little their world changes in the next 1000 days given their absence) and efficacy (how likely they are to complete the task in the next 1000 days). The spell won't select people it deems "important" at all, though a low level of notability is acceptable, if no one less notable is available.

  For the purposes of this discussion, the spell uses a strictly defined language to select tasks, one which doesn't allow for nesting, conditionals, adjective stacking, or much abstraction. Generally speaking, you can specify a verb and a noun, with not much else, though the noun *can* be an individual if their full name is known and identifies them uniquely, or if the spell applies to everyone with that name (you cannot specify who gets summoned).

    One big moral problem here is that human trafficking is now incredibly easy. For tasks like being a hero, it's completely believable that a pool of people exists that both have the talent/skills needed and would be happy to do such things, and the high costs mean that any summoning will have oversight, but with lowered costs that goes out the window.

    For reference, [this AskHistorians post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1dp3cb/how_much_did_slaves_in_america_cost_in_todays/) says a skilled slave, adjusting for inflation, was around $50k, and a followup links a source on modern black market prices that still puts children above the used-car threshold.

    Consider as well that being taken to another world entirely is going to absolutely remove any safety net/known figures of trusted authority, and you have the recipe for a global crisis. At a very minimum, criminal organizations and other such unethical groups will be abusing the spell for slave labor/sex trafficking.

    How to combat this, then? We have no other useful magic, so that won't be able to detect the ritual; still, other modern techniques could be applicable here. The three main ingredients absolutely must be controlled, requiring governmental oversight for any summonings that are performed. Also, public awareness campaigns/posters advertising help to any such people are absolutely necessary, both to help them and to find any illicit summonings.

    In general, assuming that the cat is out of the bag and summonings can't be banned altogether, accountability and prevention at the level of actual casting are the biggest areas that must be targeted, because once you have the perfect person for a task, likely that perfection will include being able to slip past anyone trying to keep watch and prevent whatever harmful task is their goal.

    My immediate thought is that if slavery is on the decline or largely eliminated, it will almost immediately make a comeback, especially sexual slavery. The cost isn't negligible, but given the description of the spell it seems like it would pull in people who are especially suited for being slaves both physically and mentally, it would still be common. Combine that with the fact that these people would be literally in another world, with no resources whatsoever and no knowledge, they would be basically helpless unless a very strong governing body stomped on slavery hard.

    Oh, can we assume that the language of the world is either magically transferred into our head or some similar shenanigans making it so that everyone pulled into the world doesn't have to spend weeks to months learning enough to establish basic communication?

    A scientific revolution would happen pretty quickly, given that engineers and scientists from Earth could be pulled in to complete R&D projects more quickly and otherwise advance a more primitive society into one closer to Earth's level. It would be hard to predict the precise effects of that without knowing more.

    Trained mercenaries could be summoned in, people willing to fight without the incentive of actually caring about who they fight for. Depending on the material cost of the spell, you could possibly slowly funnel weapons armor and food into a covert location in your enemy's country, then summon a ton of people to fight. This would give extremely little warning to the defenders, as the majority of the army that is in the enemy's territory didn't exist until a day ago. Hiding a warehouse of goods is easier than hiding those same goods plus a bunch of people that don't like to stay couped up for weeks.

    A lot of governance would likely be replaced by summoned people, because their competence in a given task could be ensured by a rather objective spell rather than whatever candidate selection technique you're using to sample from a much smaller and less qualified population of candidates. Generals, advisors, people who need good technical and theoretical knowledge and where a deep understanding of the current world they're in isn't super relevant. Given the constraints of the spell you couldn't pull the best of the best in these positions, since they would tend to be well known and influential, but you could pull people who did well in whatever training program they attended or who have achieved success but not huge success. It would ensure a base level of competence for high level positions that is hard to determine ahead of time.

    I'm not sure what I would be able to do to prepare a society for these huge changes, but these are the changes I would anticipate happening.

    >For the purposes of this discussion, the spell uses a strictly defined language to select tasks, one which doesn't allow for nesting, conditionals, adjective stacking, or much abstraction. Generally speaking, you can specify a verb and a noun, with not much else,

    I have a feeling, that even though the spell cannot specify conditionals, there are still conditionals implicit in the summoning. For example, when the spell was invoked to summon a person who was uniquely suited to the task of defeating the Midnight Prince, the spell presumably said something along the lines of "<Summon person who can - spell identifier> <defeat - verb> <Midnight Prince - noun>". But under what conditions can this person defeat the Midnight Prince? In one on one combat? In army vs army warfare with the two being generals? In the event where the person is using his own technology, which is not brought along with the summoning spell?

    If the conditions under which the summoned person can defeat the Midnight Prince are random, you would expect the summoning spell to fail almost all the time, since it would repeatedly summon various masters who can defeat the Midnight Prince, but only under certain niche conditions.

    Since the summoning spell is well-known for succeeding instead of failing, one can conclude that something about the summoning spell is able to read the state of the world, and summon a person who has a great chance of succeeding at the task under the conditions presented by the state of the world.

    If this is so, then even though conditions may not be specified in a spell, conditions can still be specified by changing the state of the world. If you want to summon a person who can defeat the Midnight Prince and be very resistant to heat, you could cast the summoning spell to summon the person in the middle of a burning building. If the spell can adapt to the dynamic armies of the Midnight Prince, surely it can adapt to a little fire.

    To take this one step further, you can design an elaborate series of puzzle rooms, and summon a person in the start, and that person will be one that can both defeat the Midnight Prince and solve all these puzzles to get out and then find the Midnight Prince. Make more than one path in the maze of puzzle rooms, and you just specified an "OR" in the summoning spell: the person can either solve the puzzles on one path, or the puzzles on the other path. Add fake puzzle rooms that kill you when you solve them, and you just specified a "NOT" in the summoning spell: summon the person who can NOT solve this puzzle.

    Since IF A THEN B is equal to NOT A OR B, you effectively have all the logical operations you need to specify conditionals in a summoning spell.

    Now replace the various puzzles with problems that you actually want to solve, whether they are just paperwork for the summoned person to do before you let them go to the next room, or battle strategies that will only open up the next room if the battle is won.

    Of course, the summoning spell may not be able to detect all these manipulations, so much experimentation is necessary. But by the end of it, you will understand far more about how to specify conditions in the summoning spell, and so be able to more accurately summon people that you want.

    EDIT: Just realized my NOT room construction is flawed, but I'm confident there's a way to do it.

    So they've summoned you as some version of "the perfect person to plan to help our world the most using more summons" and you're the most likely to complete this within 1000 days. 

    Here's the steps of my plan:

    1. I don't know what I don't know or the specifics of most things. Give me summons of the best planners/advisors for: social engineering, politics, engineering, agriculture, and "the planner for the most useful field I haven't requested so far" until I think they are getting too niche. At this point you don't really need researchers or revolutionary thinkers, you will just be bringing already discovered science up to the modern age into this world.

    2. Long term planning with these new advisors, and summoning them advisors as needed.

    3. Further reduce summoning costs if needed, we are going to use waves of summons for each major tech level of each field to advance them to modern levels. Once the current workers have their field up to their comfort level you summon the next level up and have them modernize their field and so on.

    4. Summon already skilled and motivated workers for each tech level you are reaching for to rapidly tech as planned above.

    5. Once you reach the highest tech levels abuse the summons to get the best and brightest from all the world's that didn't have good opportunities in their world's. Set up a super university where these great minds can get educated then collaborate with each other to advance science. "Give me the person who would advance science most if given a free education" or even weaker wording since the spell will automatically avoid people who will revolutionize their own world's.

    At some point you might have to conquer the world and set society moving towards utopian ideals, for efficiency's sake.

    Exploit: "Make me lots of money" is a thing that can be summoned up.

    So is "Win the next election", and won't it be fun when multiple parties do this and all come up with super charismatic candidates who couldn't govern their way out of a paper bag?

    They'll need better agricultural techniques to deal with the sudden population boom from people being summoned (and then the second population boom nine months after some bored teenage guy thinks "girlfriend-summoning spell" - that's a task that can be identified with one verb and the teenager's own name).

    Then you need to bring legal structures into place to give a legal identity - and a degree of self-determination - to people who are all new, and her by no fault of their own. They must be looked after and cared for.

    Also, measures must be put in place to handle rampant unemployment, when companies decide that summoning up a 'perfect employee' is so much easier than putting out an advert and doing interviews...

  You have been cursed with perceived devaluation: everything you touch (including yourself) has its perceived value permanently decreased the longer you touch it, until people feel utterly disgusted by it. The devaluation effect is rather quick: 1 minute of touching is enough to make people throw out gold bars/priceless family heirlooms/famous  art pieces/etc. in disgust.

  This curse only affects sight, so items that you touch still sound/feel/taste/smell the same. People feel utterly disgusted when they see you, but feel nothing in particular when talking to you by phone or by any medium that does not let them see you. This curse does not work through cameras. This curse also requires actual skin contact: touching an item through gloves does not devalue the item. 

  Is there any way to use this curse to benefit you?
  ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    * Go to strictly in-person auctions, touch the antiques to devalue them and buy them up for next to nothing, then resell them online for significant profit as the online purchasers will not be subject to the disgust until their delivery arrives.

    Assuming this power will also affect people's feelings about similar objects:

    * Earn money on the stock market by shorting companies and then using their products in Times Square or a similar public location to make people disgusted with them.
    * Improve public health by carrying around lots of different types of alcohol, cigarettes, and other drugs.
    * De-escalate violent situations by carrying around a variety of weapons and bombs so that you can make the aggressors disgusted with their tools of violence.

      > Go to strictly in-person auctions, touch the antiques to devalue them and buy them up for next to nothing, then resell them online for significant profit as the online purchasers will not be subject to the disgust until their delivery arrives. 

      Wouldn't the purchasers be very angry and think you sent the wrong item or put up misleading photos/descriptions? It's similar to if you put up a blind date photo of yourself: when the other person meets you, they will think you horribly misled them. You could use services that don't allow purchasers to complain about defective items, but then you could just send them shoddy copies without needing your curse at all.

      > Earn money on the stock market by shorting companies and then using their products in Times Square or a similar public location to make people disgusted with them. 

      The more I think about it the more I like this idea. Physically touching expensive items one by one to manipulate their values is much much slower than manipulating the value of entire companies. Public displays can reach large fractions of a local company's customer base, allowing you to utterly wreck them and make yourself filthy rich in the process. Delightfully evil and effective.

      > Improve public health by carrying around lots of different types of alcohol, cigarettes, 

      This could work as well, you could wreck the local branches of alcohol/cigarette companies.

      Not sure it would work for drugs and weapons and bombs though, since you might be mistaken for a criminal and arrested.

    Other people have mentioned how you could earn money with this power so I'll instead address the downside. You are going to be very lonely and your self esteem is going to be absolutely nonexistent after continually being rejected. Note though that the power is sight based.

    Find some full body costume that you can wear all time to avoid people being directly disgusted by you. Have a layer of clothing between you and your costume to avoid having people be disgusted by the costume. Further you can only really find your significant others in the blind community so educate yourself about how it is to be blind and become an ally.

    Big question: is the devaluation mystically attached to the physical object, or does it cause a devaluation of that specific object *in general* when seen thereafter? Because that's a significant difference in terms of munchkinry. To what degree of transformation does an objection remain devalued? If you hold and orange and then peel it, do the slices of orange remain devalued? If you blend the orange slice into a smoothie is the smoothie itself devalued, and is it devalued by the same amount or proportionally less by volume, mass, etc? By merely existing, are you slowly causing people to become disgusted by the air around them?

    In any case, I believe it would practical to live a (relatively) normal life somewhere in the far north where it is common to wear layers of clothing year-round. Simply put on a morphsuit and bundle up on top. The morphsuit is disgusting, but does not make the clothes disgusting. As long as the morphsuit is covered, you blend in just fine.

    As for profit, it would be as simple as keeping a variety of containers with various devalued substances within, such as cash, precious metals, and so on prepared in advance. Whenever you need what you want, simply display and offer to take what they have off their hands.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      The perceived devaluation is mystically attached to the physical object that you touch. Your power does not magically devalue that specific object *in general* when seen thereafter.

      However, suppose you bought a beautiful expensive handbag from a famous brand, and then the next day you see an extremely disgusting handbag on the floor, one that must be owned by some total scum who has done who knows what unspeakable things to the handbag, and then you realize the handbag is the same brand as the handbag you bought yesterday. Would you still treat your handbag to be as valuable as before, knowing now that its the preferred brand for various scum of the Earth?

      So depending on the item, the perceived devaluation of single item may then non-magically reduce the perceived value of similar items. Items that depend on brand image or art pieces are especially vulnerable. Items that serve actual non-aesthetic uses like steel girders or drinking water may not be affected at all, since seeing the most disgusting creature in the world drinking a disgusting puddle of water won't make you stop drinking water forever, just not from that disgusting puddle.

      > If you hold and orange and then peel it, do the slices of orange remain devalued? If you blend the orange slice into a smoothie is the smoothie itself devalued, and is it devalued by the same amount or proportionally less by volume, mass, etc? By merely existing, are you slowly causing people to become disgusted by the air around them? 

      Yes to all questions but the last. If you have reduced the perceived value of an orange by 10, the smoothie of that orange has its perceived value also reduced by 10 (minus the amount of orange that didn't make it into the smoothie). If you make a large smoothie of two oranges, one whose perceived value is decreased by 10 and the other you have never touched, the total perceived value of the large smoothie is still reduced by 10. But if the smoothie is perfectly mixed, and you divide the smoothie into two cups, the 1-orange-sized smoothie in each cup has its perceived value only reduced by 5.

      If the mixing is improper, i.e., if you just glue a devalued orange to an untouched orange, then a viewer will perceive the devalued orange part of the glued-oranges as having less value than the untouched orange part. This also means you can hide the perceived value decrease by putting a shell around the devalued object. Cover a devalued object with paint you have not touched, and its perceived value has no magical reduction as long as the paint covers up the object. If the paint is scraped off the viewer will once again see the inside object with magically reduced perceived value. (And by clarifying this point I just realized you can make lots of money simply by devaluing items before buying then selling them after painting them.)

      Gases can also have their perceived value reduced, but the magic works by sight. That means invisible gases, like  those in normal air, can't have their perceived value reduced, because the viewer doesn't see the gases there. 

      There are other limits on the devaluation: If you touch an object bigger than you, you only devalue a you-sized portion of the object centered around the places you touch. So no devaluing the entire planet or entire atmosphere. And no matter how much you devalue an object, there's a limit to how much disgust a person can feel. You can't give people brain damage from feeling too much disgust, though you can make them freak out by surrounding them with utterly disgusting things and preventing them from escaping.

      > In any case, I believe it would practical to live a (relatively) normal life somewhere in the far north where it is common to wear layers of clothing year-round. Simply put on a morphsuit and bundle up on top. The morphsuit is disgusting, but does not make the clothes disgusting. As long as the morphsuit is covered, you blend in just fine. 

      Yes that would work. Though it would probably be much easier to get a job you can do at home without ever meeting people face-to-face, like writing computer programs or doing youtube videos and so on. (Because the perceived devaluation does not work through screens.)

      > As for profit, it would be as simple as keeping a variety of containers with various devalued substances within, such as cash, precious metals, and so on prepared in advance. Whenever you need what you want, simply display and offer to take what they have off their hands. 

      Might not work for cash (seeing a disgusting credit card won't make you throw your own credit card away), but the general idea is sound. "Carry around expensive easily devalued objects and make people throw theirs away" would work on several objects. Though you might not want to do this too often, otherwise people will start thinking of you as that weird guy who keeps carrying disgusting things around.

        Nice. Building on your "paint shell" idea, you could make a veeeeery tidy profit as a flipper on various things, houses would probably take too long to get enough you-sized portions devalued unless you specifically just focused on the first room a buyer walks into and leaving them so disgusted they refuse to look at it any further.

        Alternatively, by walking around barefoot on lots for sale for several hours per day, you can eventually make the land so unappealing to anyone that you can buy it at a pittance, after which all you need to do is remove and replace the topsoil.

        Another fun career would be to work as a hypnosis aversion therapist or whatnot, by simply showing them the thing they don't want to do anymore. Smoker wants to quit? Make his favorite brand of cigs look utterly disgusting. The kind but potentially dangerous (in unintended consequences) method would be to let them keep the devalued item as a "totem" in case they ever slip up. The profitable method would be to only show it to them during your sessions to keep them coming when their perception of its value eventually normalizes.

    I would use it on those physical Bitcoin tokens or a printout of a bitcoin.  Save the environment some wasted energy, especially since I don't think there's a way to lower the value of one without getting the rest.  If you could short them you could make quite a lot.

      Not sure this will work out, because the devaluation only works on people who see the item, and not through a screen. Bitcoins are used all over the world, so you either need to invest a lot of effort flying around the world and showing off various devalued physical bitcoins or settle for removing physical bitcoins from just a few communities.

    Because your skin coming in contact with yourself is a virtual inevitability, this effectively reduces it down to "you have a sight-based re~~p~~*v*ulsion field. Munchkin it."

      ```
      Yes, something like that, with the addendum that objects that you have touched continue to have reduced perceived value even when you leave the area.
