  I'm not sure what Harry is playing at, setting up a story here. Or really, *why* he's setting up a story. Voldemort is dead. The Death Eaters are dead. Dumbledore is stuck in time. Hermione has been returned to life. Harry has the Philosopher's Stone.

  So what's the purpose of putting on this big, elaborate lie? To hide the Philosopher's Stone from those who would want to take it from him? To hide the fact that he's a murderer (even if it's justifiable)? To hide the fact that he's at least partly Tom Riddle?

  He does all of this without really having an internal monologue of *why* he's doing it. And if this weren't so close to the end of the story, this is the sort of thing that I would expect to backfire horribly.

    > To hide the Philosopher's Stone from those who would want to take it from him? To hide the fact that he's a murderer (even if it's justifiable)? 

    Yes, and yes. The authorities would definitely want to take the philosopher's stone from him, and the dead death-eaters had friends and family that will want vengeance. Taking credit would hurt more than it would help.
    ```

    - u/Escapement:
      ```
      Yes. If it's Tom Riddle's fault, that's better than it being Harry's. Would possibly be a good political move to set up the Muggleborn immortal witch as the next Saviour of the Wizarding World, too.
      ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        It fits the narrative.

        "Voldemort, whilst experimenting with dark and terrible magics with Hermione, forgot to consider one important thing- love. She exploded him and his death eaters, ending his terrible threat. Thanks Hermione for saving the wizard world as Harry did once. Now, on p3 see what the Weird Sisters have been getting up to in Bulgaria."
        ```

        - u/Escapement:
          ```
          I think the idea will be "She exploded Voldemort, and he *obviously* had some incredibly dark magic that linked his follower's lives to his own so that they couldn't betray him." Or something similar - after all, the wounds to the DEs won't mass explosions, like at all.
          ```

          - u/kaukamieli:
            ```
            But they didn't explode when "Harry killed Voldie few years ago."
            ```

            - u/PeridexisErrant:
              ```
              Because he wasn't truly dead that time, duh. /wizardingpublic
              ```

      - u/tacticaltunic:
        ```
        I was under the impression that he was setting up Quirrel, the one everybody believes is David Monroe, as the one who killed all of the death eaters and Voldie. No idea what he was going for with the hands around Hermione's neck.
        ```

        - u/Iconochasm:
          ```
          Voldemort was in the process of choking out the mysteriously resurrected Ms. Granger when the awesomely badass David Monroe took off his hands with a Cutting Charm.  Plan fails utterly if anyone thinks to Priori Incantatem.
          ```

    Also, to give Tom a chance to grow up normal. If the Wizarding World knew that V wasn't really dead and this other guy is a mindwiped V, they'd try for vengeance, kill him themselves or otherwise treat him in such a way that he'd go Dark due to a lack of other options.

    EDIT: And what would Harry be without a Dar- an apprentice?

    >He does all of this without really having an internal monologue of why he's doing it. And if this weren't so close to the end of the story, this is the sort of thing that I would expect to backfire horribly.

    Therefore, it *will* backfire horribly.
    ```

- u/TheThorgram:
  ```
  That philosopher's stone is a really convenient way of disposing of anything you don't want hanging around... corpses, toxic waste, really any incriminating evidence. Transfigure something into a pebble, make the transfiguration permanent with the stone, throw the pebble away.
  ```

- u/2-4601:
  ```
  I wonder who Harry will allow to know the truth - certainly he can't let it be public knowledge for fear of biasing Riddle again, but it would do the next generation a disservice to deny them the truth. Maybe he'll tell Dumbledore as a backup (in case the immortality-for-everyone plan doesn't work out), and ask him to let visitors know it after Riddle has either died or grown into an ethical person.
  ```

- u/linkhyrule5:
  ```
  ... Is it bad that, on a reread, I'm now sad about losing out on Quirrell's loot?

  There was a big bunch of Volde-bits in Quirrell's pockets, and who knows how useful or rare they may be.
  ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    And besides, figuring out what's cursed and what's not would be *fun*.
    ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:
      ```
      I think you mean !!Fun!!, as in /r/DwarfFortress
      ```

      - u/Esparno:
        ```
        Welp I've been triggered.  

        I've been able to keep away from the Matrix code for awhile but its back down the ~~rabbit~~dwarf hole I go.  Strike the earth!
        ```

  - u/Salaris:
    ```
    Someone still needs to go back and loot the Elder Wand.
    ```

    - u/sephlington:
      ```
      Also, the line of Merlin, which is currently sat there too!
      ```

      - u/Salaris:
        ```
        Good call.
        ```

- u/ajuc:
  ```
  If you have immortal unkillable superpowerful evil wizard I'm not sure making him insane is the best solution.
  ```

  - u/JackStargazer:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure they mean 'insane' in the sense of 'no conscious mind, catatonic, no control of bowels' and not in the sense of 'utterly and completely irrational and hallucinatory'.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I know it wouldn't fit the narrative, but I was hoping for a certain kind of outcome. When the chair was created I was seriously hoping for a moment when Harry would hide Quirrel, sit in it and call people to him. Voldemort is apparently dead, the death eaters are dead, Hermione is alive. His most potent enemies are destroyed and his friend has been resurrected

  By this axe I rule. Kiss the ring of the new dark lord, which ironically would be the old dark lord. Bluff your way into supremacy.
  ```

- u/Mr_Smartypants:
  ```
  What I want to know is why he had to go back an hour in time.

  He's already doctored the crime scene, and set off the explosion to get everyone's attention.  Why go back?
  ```

  - u/Farmerbob1:
    ```
    My best guess is that he went back to warn Dumbledore that he was going to lose in the mirror, and keep him from investing his entire being into the defense.  Dumbledore's loss in the mirror wasn't clearly obvious.  It could have been faked.
    ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    He implied he would be out of magic for an hour. Presumably he needed more time to do magic.
    ```

    - u/Mr_Smartypants:
      ```
      Possibly, but EY did say this in the /r/hpmor thread:

      >  I think the one that impressed me most was precommitting to cause an antimatter explosion unless Time-Turned help appeared - since the explosion would be visible from the Quidditch stands, and thus that would make the simplest timeline no longer be one in which Harry never reached the Time-Turner.

      Suggesting it's not just recharge time.
      ```

    - u/Mr_Smartypants:
      ```
      Ah, out of mana.
      ```
