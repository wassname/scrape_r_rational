## Self-Indulgent Self-Insert RatFic: First Book complete

### Post:

I've just finished my first draft over at [GDocs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU8o3wSAiufh-Eg1FtL-6656dNvbCFILCi2GbeESsb4/edit?usp=sharing). After writing over 4,000 words a day for over a week, I'm going to take a break for a day or two (there's a new Harry Dresden novel out) before I start on the next arc.

Looking for comments, editing, and other suggestions before I start posting chapters to a more permanent home.

Also looking for suggestions on good places for public posting - I just might be able to get away with calling it a Transformers/Multi crossover on FanFiction.net, but that seems a bit like cheating.

  I'm going to try [wise reading](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1w4llw/by_request_two_kinds_of_involved_responses_to/) while reading this.

  >A Wise Reader is not someone to tell you what to do next--it's someone to tell you what you have just done. In other words, you want your spouse or friend to report to you, in detail and accurately, on the experience of reading your story.

  >The Wise Reader doesn't say if your story is "good" or "bad." He doesn't say if you have too much dialogue or if the characterization is thin. He simply tells you the honest experience of reading the story.

  >The key to understanding when a comment is Wise Reading or something else is to realize that a Wise Reader can never be wrong. A Wise Reader is reporting their feelings. A Critical Reader or a Helpful Reader can be wrong.

   So I'm going to spell out what goes in my mind while I read this. Some of it may sound trite of obvious because I'm a bit simpleminded at times, and I might not offer much critique because I'm easy to please, but whatever. Me not being a Native English reader might affect my understanding of some of the sentences.
  ______________________________
  The metatext reminds me of how Blindsight begun, and I think it's pretty elegant and an intriguing addition. I think you could remove the "metatext description" from the final version, it feels a bit redundant.

  The beginning is very exciting because it brings you straight into the action. I'm confused and want to know more. I can't quite follow this sentence:

  "Thinking about that used up enough of my cognitive resources that I didn't even try to figure out how concerned I should be that I was hallucinating a pink-furred rabbit-woman puttering around at the head of my bed, and was barely able to pay enough attention to the fact that she was naked to try to remember the more aesthetic details when I could properly appreciate them..."

  Playing around with the Darth name feels kinda childish, but fun at the same time time. I think it gives a bit not-so serious fanfic type of first impression of this.

  I like this type of thing in which the reader knows barely more than the protagonist. The dialogue is interesting and easy to follow. I felt like the protagonist is probably modelled after the author?

  Haha, I could guess he woke up far in the future, but didn't guess that the hallucination is real, this twist was nicely handled.

  Oh, escalation of weirdness. Nice.

  The infodump on the attributes of the furry thing was a bit boring, but okay and necessary. The having to pay debt-you-haven't-personally-taken thing reminded me of Hanson's em world which is a nice realistic tough.

  Updating on future's state of the world and physics - really exciting! I like that it pays attention to hardness and realism, and it's almost as plausible as it could. Some good hedons in here.

  The story seems to move on with a solid quick pace and there's new worthwhile information at every turn. Adventure!

  "It was certainly a far cry from having a worldwide array of weather stations and supercomputer analysis of trends for a ten-day forecast." This sentence was a bit hard to understand at first, but I got the general idea after the following sentences gave me context.

  The description of the early travelling was easy to read and quite fun. I was a bit confused what "demon" meant in the context, but it seems it was supposed to be that way. I began wondering why all these people are so poor and thought I had missed some information, but then the protagonist started wondering the same thing and all was well.

  Okay, I'm now at the point where the pepsi robot gave Scorpia to the protagonist. The story has been pretty chill so far, which on the other hand means that I haven't felt much tension. It's not necessarily bad though, there's the same chill vibe than in the first chapter of Accelerando, but maybe a bit less intense. Or maybe I'm just in an apathetic mood, who knows.

  Her stay in Dogville is not very extraordinary, but still kinda interesting. I like the mystery development around some of the unanswered questions about her revival.

  Okay, now I'm at the part where she stole stuff from bikes. The story's been very straigthforward, solid and easy to read. There isn't that much complexity or weirdness compared to other similar stories, mostly it's pretty simple action with some unique things here and there. Mostly it feels like an ordinary engaging adventure in a landscape  littered with many concepts from LW meme space and as such it's good. I haven't read that much amateur writing so I wasn't sure what it would be like, but I guess I can now see the difference between that and the writing of experienced and well-published sci-fi authors, I can't quite put my finger on the specifics though. It's not *bad*, it's just different. Maybe there isn't as much subtlety when describing events? Sometimes I feel like events don't happen as naturally? Like I said, I'm not sure about the specifics of  this feeling.

  Okay, now I became a bit tired and didn't finish the story in its entirety. I was left at the part where he was supposed to deliver the sealed envelope. The general impression is that it's straightforward, good quality and easy to read.

    > wise reading

    Or as I might start calling it, 'golden feedback'. :)

    > The metatext reminds me of how Blindsight begun, and I think it's pretty elegant and an intriguing addition. I think you could remove the "metatext description" from the final version, it feels a bit redundant.

    I'm guessing that by these, you mean the 'died and didn't know it' line and the 'unreliable narration' bit? If so, makes sense.

    > The beginning is very exciting because it brings you straight into the action. I'm confused and want to know more.

    A classic piece of plotting advice I decided to explicitly follow: "Start with an earthquake and work your way up to a climax". 

    > I can't quite follow this sentence:

    I have a tendency to use too many sub-clauses and over-long thoughts; I can probably tweak that line a bit.

    > I felt like the protagonist is probably modelled after the author?

    The protagonist is explicitly myself, if I'd gotten hit by a truck instead of started writing a new story. (The titular 'S.I.' can refer to 'self-insert', among other things.)

    > The story has been pretty chill so far, which on the other hand means that I haven't felt much tension. It's not necessarily bad though, there's the same chill vibe than in the first chapter of Accelerando, but maybe a bit less intense. Or maybe I'm just in an apathetic mood, who knows.

    Hm... this suggests to me that I've been implicitly aiming for a feeling of blue-sky, distant, calm rationality instead of pulse-pounding in-your-face emotional responses. Being more consciously aware of this when I'm writing it could be useful, especially for those moments when I want to break the pattern.


    > straigthforward, solid and easy to read. There isn't that much complexity or weirdness compared to other similar stories, mostly it's pretty simple action with some unique things here and there.

    Hm - I suppose since the first part was mainly a travelogue, 'straightforward' is to be expected. I do have some plans on cranking up the weirdness in Book Two, and doing so even further later on; so I can take the first part not seeming especially weird as a good building block.

    > I haven't read that much amateur writing so I wasn't sure what it would be like, but I guess I can now see the difference between that and the writing of experienced and well-published sci-fi authors

    I'm not sure that my writing should be taken as an exemplar of amateur writing - but if you ever do get closer to putting your finger on the difference, I'd appreciate a heads-up. :)

    > Sometimes I feel like events don't happen as naturally?

    This comes close to a writing issue I know I have. Often, I decide on a plot point I want to have happen, and then work my writing to arrange for that point to happen as naturally as possible; but I need to get better at this.


    > straightforward, good quality and easy to read.

    Better than any of the alternatives I can think of. :)

  This is actual original fiction, of good quality and length, so I recommend just keeping it in the doc until you can do this *properly*; a custom HTML page at some random free host and downloads in various Ebook formats.
  ```

  - u/DataPacRat:
    ```
    I've got datapacrat.com under my dominion, so I can stick any custom HTML pages I desire there. (And occasionally do, such as a page describing a [Completely Useless Calendar](http://www.datapacrat.com/calendar/).)
    ```

      ```
      oh, I'd forgotten that. That even better, by far! Perfect, obvious choice to do that then.

      Dont forget to throw together some CSS for it, I might help if you don't know how.

        I'm a plaintext sort of guy; I actually learned to touch-type on type-writers. I instinctively write italics like /this/, due to 1980's-era ASCII BBSes; and can handle basic HTML including italics tags. I've never gotten around to learning CSS.
        ```

        - u/ArmokGoB:
          ```
          I don't mean doing tons of formatting on the text itself, just choosing decent font and colors and margins and such. The way most browsers interpret plain text without it is awful. Maybe even making it simply look *like* typewriter would fit. if you send me the HTML source I'll see if I can throw together something extremely basic, although it will probably still look like shit, at least it'll be readable.

          edit: just something as simple as this in the <head> will make it a lot more interesting than NOTHIGN:

              <style>
              body{
                font-family: "Courier New", Courier, "Lucida Sans Typewriter", "Lucida Typewriter", monospace;
                background-color: #445;
                color: #fff;
                padding: 40px
              }
              </style>
          ```

          - u/DataPacRat:
            ```
            I'm currently writing S.I. in the form of a plaintext file, including italics like /these/, which I've been copy&pasting into GDocs for other people to read; no HTML currently exists.

            As for what to make it look like, I do have one bookmark I archived for if-and-when I ever did get around to trying to formatting text to look non-awful: [Butterick's Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/). The points in the [summary](http://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html) seem to be at least as good an approach as any other I've found.
