  Makes me wonder if there's more Eika. I don't believe the entirety of their species were confined to those two clans.

  Just binged this series.

  This is some serious rational shit right here. Fucking amazing read.

  It rivals the top of the other stories here, like MoL.

  Damn I want to read more.

  Thanks for posting.

      Oh god... I dunno. The whole thing was so good. Setting up a goddamn university was pretty good IMO. I can't wait for them to be visit the king and for the Morey/Cato letter stuff to go down.
