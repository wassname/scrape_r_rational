  Silly me, I thought it was the killing curse...

    The killing curse only work on things with a brain. Maybe boggarts don't have one?

      Getting line of sight to a boggart for the AK might also be unwise, I'd guess.

  Alright, here's mine:

  He snuck in the troll by transfiguring it and having it hidden on him when Dumbles hooked him into the wards.  The troll could bypass some of the wards because it was technically also a defense professor.  (Amazingly, the troll was only the third worst DADA professor in hogwarts history)  

  I'm confident enough to give that one **70% probability**

  Anyone else got any predictions?

    Could the troll enter Hogwarts really fast? Transfigure it into a bullet, shoot it into Hogwarts via sniper rifle, rematerialize. The troll was only outside the castle, if I remember correctly.

    Hmm, perhaps he snuck it in as a graded exam.

    I'd give it no more than 10%, because I'm pretty sure it wouldn't work (the one who stands in this circle), the risks if something went wrong, and the fact that QQ/LV/DM/TR has far better options.

      Sounds like the two of you have a bet, with obvious schelling point of setting the odds on the bet at 3:2.

        Aside from my no-gambling-real-value policy (happy to, say, post a "you were right" message)...

        A schelling point is not particularly relevant to this; what we're after is the geometric mean ([~one to four odds](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=geometric+mean+0.1%2C+0.7)).  In the absence of stakes, I'm happy just to read and see if I was right :)

            Deal.  I'll spread comments out through a thread in relevant places too, which will make it about four times by work as well as wordcount.

            This is the fourth:  You were right.

            I want to grumble about the distinction between "standing in a circle" and "being a false tooth in a circle", or maybe the risks of inserting a transfigured object into your mouth (let alone an adult mountain troll)... but ultimately, you were right and I wasn't.

            Definitely an interesting post if we're designing a high stakes prediction market, but given that I've already offered a ratio and don't particularly care if this is a fair bet I might not go for calculus to redo the offer ;)

  Harry did get Cedrc's help after all. The reason he hasn't thought about it, and the reason why we didn't see anything between him wondering what to do after receiving the letter and showing up at the 3rd floor corridor, and the reason he seems so uncharacteristically unprepared, is that he had Cedric obliviate himself of that information.

  Low confidence, but possible.
  ```

- u/CMEast:
  ```
  I think the 'troll' is a hint. Eliezer plans for Voldemort to kill Harry and he'll then transfigure himself to look like Harry, and turn the original Harry-body into a Volde-corpse. Dumbledore will show up and think he's got the storybook ending he's been looking for. 'Harry' will rule magical Britain as Quirrel desired, with Hermione at his side. THAT is the final troll.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    It's a safe bet that Dumbles knows about the stone and it's powers. I don't think he would be fooled so easily.

    Also, QM is not going to attempt to kill Harry. I strongly suspect that his overall goals are not evil per se; its just he is willing to sacrifice pretty much anything in pursuit of those goals. Harry not being one of those things.

  I wonder how Parseltongue reacts to recursive statements or statements which are neither true nor false?
  ```

  - u/Pluvialis:
    ```
    I think the best way to describe the parseltongue restriction is that **you can't say something you don't think is true**. If you don't believe what you're about to say is a true statement, you'll find you can't say it, or it comes out how you believe without your intention.

    While you're speaking parseltongue, there's a magical effect on you that temporarily prevents you from wanting to say anything false.

    Whether you can, with practice, get around that to any degree I don't know. Harry has accidentally said things more frankly than he meant while speaking parseltongue, but perhaps if you're used to doing so you can still word things in a deceptive way without lying. I think that would take skill, though.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Takes some practice, like in Wildbow's Pact.
      ```

    - u/dalr3th1n:
      ```
      If there is such a way, I'm sure Quirrell would know it.  I'd express some confidence that he is using Parseltongue to mislead Harry.
      ```

    - u/AtoningUnifex:
      ```
      Commit to making a statement, then obliviate your memory of whatever information would make that statement a lie.
      ```

  - u/Sparkwitch:
    ```
    The trouble, I'd guess, is believing them intensely enough to say them. I could say, for example, "this statement is false" because I can believe in a definition of false which includes things that are never going to be simply true.
    ```

- u/puesyomero:
  ```
  the parseltongue truth restriction seems like a great hurdle but i have a few ideas to work around it . He keeps asking if tom has already betrayed him, but is it really betrayal if you are acting on what you think is the best interest of the person despite what he thinks? moreover harry could doublethink himself into accepting they are both the same person thus one can not betray oneself. any guesses on what the real solution is?
  ```

  - u/qznc:
    ```
    Parseltongue is explicitly designed to prevent doublespeak. I think the only solution is speed: Betray and finish him fast enough.

    Getting the time turner for an unsupervised second would be enough for example. Although it makes for a crappy ending. At any point, Yudkowsky could just write "Suddenly Voldemort was shot from behind" and then explain how Harry got his time turner an hour later.
    ```
