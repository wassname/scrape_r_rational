  ```
  Yeah, Catherine's court isn't turning evil at all. I don't know why the Grey Pilgrim is even worrying.
  ```

  - u/Razorhead:
    ```
    To be fair casual assassination of enemy factions was a thing in all noble courts over the centuries.
    ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    I mean the first prince made her rival drink poison so......
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      True, the continent they're on has pretty low standards anyway.
      ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  The worldbuilding in these bonus chapters is amazing. Really makes you feel that the world is actually *alive*.
  ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  Thief being from a noble background makes a lot of sense, now that I think about it.  I should have guessed.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```

    ```
