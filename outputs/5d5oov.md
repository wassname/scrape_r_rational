## Trying to fix medieval Europe

### Post:

I was almost sure I'd seen this discussed in here before, but use of the search function hasn't turned up anything. So! Here's the question: a time traveler from modern times has been sent back to Bronze Age England. They don't have any technology with them; only knowledge. Using that and the resources available to a random person in the Bronze Age, how can they optimize the world? 

Sanitation is probably the obvious one, along with "don't make drinking vessels out of lead". What are some other options?

  Edit:

  The first question that you have to ask yourself is, "What's wrong with medieval Europe?" Slavery and pseudo-slavery to start with, high infant mortality, low life expectancy, death to random illness, quick spread of disease, horrible treatment of women, horrible treatment of anyone poor, lack of literacy/intellect/rationality, political instability, unjust rule hereditary rule ... I think that's fairly good as a starting point.

  But I would be very cautious about something like introducing hygiene and pasteurization, because plummeting infant mortality rates and wildly increased life expectancy *probably* lead to bad outcomes if they don't come with attendant advances in agriculture to feed all those people. And making it eight times more likely that someone will survive an amputation probably means that there are a lot of amputees going around ... in a world whose social safety nets I don't trust to handle the influx.

  In other words, I'm skeptical about handing out scientific knowledge like candy. Yes, it's pretty damned easy to make an electromagnet, or generate electricity using a water mill, or calculate longitude and latitude, or whatever, but in terms of *actual results?* That's a big question.

    While it wouldn't neccesarily fix medieval europe, handing out science like candy would make a terribly fascinating setting. Imagine this traveler has a lot of scientific knowledge but is completely lost in politics/economics or trying to implement safety nets-- it would create a very interesting world.

      Low culture high science. That kind of hypothetical earth would probably end up looking a lot like the techno-barbarians of Warhammer 40K, future technology being used to enforce archaic social systems.

        Isn't the system in 40k portrayed as being absolutely necessary to preserve humanity?

          That's what the people on top say.

          In the worlds ruled by the Imperium, yes, but there are still hundreds of feral worlds that fit the archtype.
          ```

  The "technical" term for "fixing medieval europe" is "uplift", I have seen it discussed in quite a few worldbuilding wednesday threads, though google is failing me at the moment.

  Here's another thread that may be relevant:

  Not exactly rational, but there's the 1632 book series. It's about what happens when a 1999!W.Virginia town gots magically plopped into the middle of the 30 Years War. The Author recognized that eventually his historical schema would make the series non-rational, so he regularly collaborates with other writers and cannonizes fanfic. 

  It works.

  There's no top-down optimization of a world, but you do get to watch a slow and juicy yankeesque tech/cultural innovation diffusion into renessance europe.

  Do they have the knowledge of the local language? Because that's extremely vital to actually doing anything.

  Reddit's search function is useless. The best way to search for something is to use Google.

  [A Google search for `medieval site:www.reddit.com/r/rational` reveals several relevant threads.](https://www.google.com/search?q=medieval+site:www.reddit.com/r/rational)
