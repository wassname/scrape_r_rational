## [Challenge][Prompt] You find an oracle that will answer twenty questions with perfect omniscience ...

### Post:

**Write me some flash/short fiction.** Here is your prompt:

A person (or persons) acquires/finds/steals **[an oracle](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Oracle_AI)** which can answer a **limited** number of questions with perfect (or near-perfect) omniscient knowledge.

What are the best questions to ask given some system of values? What interesting answers might the oracle give? What limits does the oracle have in place? (*ex. the oracle cannot answer nested questions, or counts nested questions as being multiple questions, or must compress their answer to something that can be expressed in 15000 characters of English, knowledge of the future is ruined by asking questions about the future, etc.*) How do people react to this certain (or near-certain) knowledge, or the possibility of acquiring it?

Your choice of first or third person. Your choice of what form the oracle takes (*ex. Mayan artifact, artificial intelligence from the future, creepy doll, strangely ageless boy in a Tibetan monastery, government research project, etc.*). Your choice of which of the above questions (if any) to answer. **Optimize for an *awesome* and *interesting* and *clever* story** rather than one where a character wins everything forever (though maybe those goals won't be in conflict).

The winner, as decided by reddit "best" sorting at the end of a week, gets **a month of reddit gold** from me.

Edit: Congratulations to /u/xamueljones!

  I bit my lower lip in worry as I stared at the paper with my Question. It wasn't fair. Every fairy tale I had ever heard of always, *always*, **always** had three chances for the protagonist. Three wishes, three quests, three trials, three, three, three...

  I had the chance of a lifetime to have any possible question answered Truthfully. Not the truth were you are 99.99...% percent certain with a lot of nines trailing off with a only small niggling doubt that you *might* be wrong, but a Truth that couldn't ever be false. A Truth so self-evident that if reality contradicted the Oracle, then reality itself was wrong. The magic of the Oracle allowed visitors to convince others absolutely the Truth of the Answer to their Question. No one could lie about their Question and what the Oracle told them for their Answer.

  And I only had one question I was allowed to ask the Oracle.

  Oh well no crying over fantasies that won't come true.

  I dropped the paper into my Bag of Holding as I glanced up. The temple doors remained closed and the sun was almost at its highest peak. I would be entering precisely at noon and be the only person admitted in for the day. I looked at the List hanging above the doorway:

  1. You get only one question. Stop asking for a repeat!
  2. Yes only one question. Go away!
  3. No you don't get any refunds. How do you refund a question anyway!?!
  4. Be polite. This is common courtesy. If you are getting an Answer, then you could at least be polite to the Oracle!
  5. Got your Answer? Then go away!!!

  I got the impression that a lot of people tended to be rather annoying about their Question.

  I looked back behind me at the crowd of people waiting. Well 'crowd' was a poor word. Perhaps an ocean of people? The city was called the **Filthy Ocean** for a reason. I was just glad to be out away from the smelly, disease-ridden line I had spent the past three years working my way through. You had to keep a sharp eye out for anyone willing to cut you out of the lines. Literally in some cases as I eyed the nearby graveyards.

  It was no wonder that people were always so selfish about their Questions. With only one question allowed per person and with the enormous cost of waiting in this potentially lethal line, people were cutthroat about their Question. It was amusing how even though the Oracle didn't charge anything, the price of waiting in silence was still high enough to keep people away and to madden the ones waiting to the point of paranoia. No wonder people rarely asked selfless questions. They always asked for something to make them richer, more powerful, or something to get ahead of the rat pack that was life. I must be insane to be wasting my question like this after sinking years of my life into this task, but at least I'll be done with the lines after this. That was the important thing.

  *OH*

  The door just creaked open a crack. It was my turn.

    Backstory:

    I imagined a medival world where anyone could ask the Oracle any question they wanted, but only once in their lifetimes. The conditions...would be horrendous as the population density would be extremely high. No one would be able to force their way to the line without a bloody massacre and there are multiple factions in the area who would band together against the hypothetical threat.

    Money wouldn't work either since no one has the wealth available to bribe enough people to leave after waiting months to make a difference. In addition, no one is allowed past the first tenth of the line without waiting in the line itself. There just isn't enough room!

    The Temple of the Oracle is wholly self-sustaining for this reason and therefore has a catapult with disposable parachutes to help visitors get past the crowd when leaving.

    Don't forget the chances of an epidemic killing off the people and the difficulties the people face in bringing enough food and supplies to last through the line. It's not a good thing for this world that Bags of Holding (from DnD) exist.

    Of course I then started thinking about the game-theoretic strategies behind what Questions could be asked to give one an advantage. It became very likely that people would rarely ask questions not immediately relevant to themselves and the Oracle's power would go to waste. Hence the story of someone who hopes to improve things for the better by 'wasting' a Question to let others know the truly best possible Question to ask...

      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:

        Sure would: It would cause other people to ask similar questions. One question more or less between benefit and humanity if you have a line of about three years already coming in does not matter.
        ```

    - u/kaukamieli:

      Should just ask for best way to benefit humanity or something. That way you get something you can actually act on.

    Sucks for him that he won't get a chance to ask his question upon receiving the answer :/ unless he deduces that murdering the oracle would benefit humanity most, now that would be an awesome scene

      ```
      As the wrinkled, elderly man whipped out his blade from a very well-hidden, yet uncomfortable place on his body to stab the Oracle, the temple guardians smoothly intercept the strike and snaps his neck like a twig.

      As they drag his miserable carcass for disposal, the insects concealed all over the body squirm out to infest the temple unseen with disease and rot.

      .......

      If it's for the sake of humanity, I will sacrifice my lowly life and *especially* dignity for it. Of course, someone's got to train people into being absolute fanatics hell-bent on eliminating the unholy Oracle. That's a job, I'm willing to devote myself to! Hmm...it seems like they fumigated the temple. Oh well, let's send in the next suck...er...fanatic in!
      ```

      - u/Mekanimal:
        ```
        love it, although I do feel it would be better narratively if the oracle had been waiting for you the entire time, for the first time asking a visitor a question instead of asking, 'are you capable of doing what must be done?' before embracing her and sliding the blade through her ribs
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          Hmm....well Plan A, B, C, D, E,....., X, Y, Z and all the other letters no else uses, are all a bust. That Oracle is good! Too bad I can't actually get back inside since the Oracle was the one who told me about her danger to humanity.

          [*steeples fingertips together*](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FingerTenting?from=Main.ClaspYourHandsIfYouDeceive) *while glaring at temple*

          Ah, screw it! I'm waiting in the gods-damned line for the next few years. I'm sure that I can think of something on the way!

          *Years Pass By*

          Finally! I'm here. Just one more person in front of me and then it's my turn! Who knew pretending to be an identical twin would work? Oh well, I have my trusty stabbing knife with me.

          Hey, what's going on with the guy ahead of me? It looks like he's tenderly hugging the Oracle and he's whispering softly 'Don't worry it will all end soon, my beloved.' I wonder what's with the gurgling sound I'm hearing....Man they really should clean up the tomato juice on the floor. It looks like the Oracle spilled a lot down the front of her dress.

    - u/xamueljones:

      True that's a better question than the one I used, but I'm assuming that the Oracle will answer the question as intended by the asker. Otherwise, there wouldn't be such a high demand for the Oracle to create the situation in my short story.

  The Oracle was powerful.  The Oracle was omniscient.  The Oracle did not tell you what it *thought* was true, to the best of its knowledge, or as far as it knew, or anything else.  It just told you what was irrefutably *true*, so that anything it said, you could trust to be a *fact of the world*.  It did not give probabilities, it gave full and complete certainty: P(thing the Oracle says) = 1.0, unable to be contradicted by anything else in the history of everything ever.

  "What," I asked it, "Are you going to say next?"

  And that's how we lost that entire planet to a Reality Breakage.  The lesson, kids, is not to violate the laws of thermodynamics by trying to obtain infinite information!
  ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    And the Oracle replied, "this."

    Which, to be fair, was true.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Damn.  I should have written, "What are you *not* going to say next?"
      ```

      - u/FeepingCreature:
        ```
        "Any sentence but this one," the Oracle answered. Then smiled. And added, "I can do this all day, you know."
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          The Oracle has proven itself genuinely clever, and it will take *original research* for me to come up with an infinite-information Goedel Sentence to paradox-attack it.  If the Oracle's mind is *really* well put-together, there will be no sentence driving it to attempt to achieve infinite information at all, at least, no sentence it would *understand* as anything besides pure chaos.

          I remember what this reminds me of, and leave.  *Quickly.*

          When I get home, I write a letter to the editor of the newspaper, declaring that two hours locked in a room with the Oracle should be used as a punishment for violent criminals.
          ```

          - u/xamueljones:
            ```
            What does this remind you of?

            - u/None:

              Well crap, I should have made something up.
              ```

              - u/xamueljones:
                ```
                Oh. I thought you were referring to a UFAI or something similar to CelestAI where the Oracle is very good at twisting your words to mean something completely different and convince you that it was what you really meant all along.
                ```

                - u/None:
                  ```
                  No, I think the rules for the Oracle specify that it follows your words as you meant them.  I do imagine it's being disturbingly tricksy with your questions, though, as Full Information is half the superintelligence superpower in the first place, and because frankly a lot of the kinds of questions people *think* they should ask a Prophetic Oracle are the ones were they'll be more disturbed than satisfied by the answers.  Even if the Oracle's being *nice*, as *we* interpret "nice", it's going to conceal a lot and trick a lot, because just giving things away isn't really safe with people who don't have some analogue to the [Litany of Gendlin](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Litany_of_Gendlin).

                  I mean, maybe it's me being stuck on this "rationality" kick, but it seems to me that when people *really want to know*, they just investigate, or pay someone else to do so, but when they want someone big and important-looking to tell them It's a Grand and Valuable Mystery, *then* they consult a Prophetic Oracle.

  Alright, what's the first thing you do when you have twenty questions from an infallible Oracle? What's most advantageous, given that I have nineteen other questions? Or, maybe, what pair is most advantageous?

  "Do you only answer yes/no questions?"

  "No."

  "How does your power work?"

  "My answers must be true in such a way that they're true in the future."

  Hmmm... so the Oracle chooses self-consistent timelines instead of mutable ones? Alright, I could ask how to bring a good timeline about. How many questions did I have now?

  "How many answers do I have left?"

  "Eightseveneightseveneightseveneightseveneightseveneightseveneightseveneightseveneightseven - "

  Shit.
  ```

- u/noggin-scratcher:
  ```
  Would the following be considered cheating?

  "Your omniscience allows you perfect insight into me; my current state of knowledge, my personality and values and desires... within whatever constraints you must abide by in terms of answer-size and complexity, what is the contents of a data packet containing the information I would find most valuable?"

  ...oh hell, I got a little carried away with the beginnings of a response before finishing reading the post and failed to notice that this was a writing prompt and not a brainstorming question.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Well, to help you write a story - what is the most interesting "hook" you can imagine that follows from that question? If the reply is something like:

    > Answers are constrained to full English sentences shorter than 140 characters. The world ends in 59 minutes contingent on your inaction.

    Or like:

    > The optimal course of action to maximize your values is for you to immediately call 1-800-555-9678, inform them that you have the oracle, leave the oracle where it currently sits, and self-terminate in the most expedient manner possible.

    If you need to add constraints to get a better story, do it. If you can't tell the story that would interest you with an oracle that can do coherent extrapolated volition, then make it unable to do that.
    ```

  - u/Turniper:
    ```
    You probably want the context of that information too.  It does you no good if an oracle gives you your soulmate's telephone number and you buy a lottery ticket with it.
    ```

- u/DCarrier:
  ```
  "You're really an oracle?"

  "Yes."

  "And I get how many questions again?"

  "Twenty."

  "Interesting. So they don't have to be yes or no questions. Would you mind writing them down?"

  "That's fine."

  "So, how many questions do I have left?"

  "Sixteen."

  "I just need one. Write down the answer on my hard drive, in the file 'answers.txt". What string do you get when you append all the answers to all the questions I will ever write in 'questions.txt' in the order I write them?"
  ```

- u/davidmanheim:
  ```
  The premise is intrinsically broken, but the questions should be easy...

  Extrapolating my volition in a coherent fashion,  what actions should I take now and in the future to achieve my extrapolated goals?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Better: What answer you could say in this situation would maximize ~~my coherent extrapolated volition~~ the number of paperclips?

    OP: Sorry, having our character win everything forever is too fun. (Although I can well imagine this kind of question would cast us into the kind of slavery that [HPMOR 119](#s " Dumbledore") was under for a long while. Coherent extrapolated volition != volition, and knowledge of a happy ending after the hardship of the story wouldn't detract too much from it.)

    More problematic might be that the author couldn't *actually* know a true Oracle's answer. The Oracle's inevitably resulting fallibility might at some point be discovered by the protagonist, so never mind, this is a good plot point too.

  Finally, after searching for so long, I turned the corner to the chamber of truth. Inside, atop a carved alter inlaid with large, striking gems, sat a typewriter. It had a cracked beige plastic exterior which still bore the remnants of a sticker indicating that it was on sale. This was strange, given that descriptions had been found preserved on a papyrus dating back to, at least, the rise of the greek empire. After locating mentions of its location in a medieval manuscript, a few archeologists set out to track down the location mentioned. My companions had, unfortunately taken ill from the local fare, leaving me, their local guide, to take a look while they recovered. 

  From The Typewriter extrudes a piece of paper covered in latin, greek, and other unidentifiable pictograms. The paper itself looks like something one would buy at a store. Driven to see whether the legends are true, I begin to type a message, oblivious to the question of how the clearly type-cast pictographs were created by a regular qwerty keybord.

  Inspired based on a book I'm currently writing:

  Mordred returned to the temple of the Fates for the first time in ten years, the memory fresh in his mind of the day Pan took him as an apprentice and he met his brothers Fenrir and Jormungand. Knowing that the Triptych were technically his family he decided against trying to con the Fates, too much time with Pan had taught him the consequences of interfering in the realms of the other gods. Instead he chose to ask one singular question that would allow him his free will.  

  "What course of action must I take to ensure my life remains my own, free from the interference of the Triptych, Clothos, Lachesis and Atropos?"

  Upon receiving his answer and deliberating on it within the temple for the rest of the day, he left and proceded to do the exact opposite of the answer to his question.

  Because seriously, who asks an oracle of the Fates for advice on how to leave their realm and actually follows it?

  Pan had taught him well.

  "Will I be the top comment of alexanderwales' reddit thread in a weeks time in order to win a month of reddit gold?"

  The words swam into being, black ink blots slowly forming into five words: "Better not tell you now".

  "Darn you oracle and darn the fact that you have your own value system!"
