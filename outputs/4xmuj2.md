  ```
  A sudden, but not unwelcome update)

  It's "practice", not "price" though.

    ```
    The author wrote "price" himself on /r/hpmor. It's probably to indicate it's nature as an epilogue. It also reads the same but slightly different, although that might just be me or the time delay. Without insider information I'll predict you could also consider this a very very short sequel.

  I was grinning by the end of the update. Great to see it's "part 1"!
