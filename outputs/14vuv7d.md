## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Looking for rational fiction from a dictators point of view. Maybe something with Tropico or Far Cry undertones but grounded understanding of politics and economy. Doesn't have to be complete but preferably 200k words or longer with solid world building and a egoistical protagonist prefered. Basically a novellized "Dictators Handbook" (already read it)

    Rational empire-building / empire-management fics are as rare as a unicorn (in that IMO, it doesnt exist, feel free to correct me). That genre either they go exceedingly power-fantasy or they get bogged down in interpersonal "romantic" relationships as to never go anywhere. Or worse, transform into a harem fic whose MC is trying to rival Ismail Ibn Sharif for prolificness.

    I can't recall any story I've read that manages to fulfill your requirements off the top of my head. I have some fics that check off some boxes but none that's "rational" unfortunately. I'm trying to find that white stag myself.

    If you want decent politics, I would recommend [Surviving the Succession](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50194/surviving-the-succession-a-transmigration-fantasy) but the MC isn't in the position of building anything. Everything is about Chinese imperial politics though.

    Along the lines of a builder fic, I sorta recommend [Demesne](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne) which has been recommended in this subreddit various times although there's no economics and the latter half gets bogged down in the trenches of romantic relationships. Not of the FMC surprisingly but of the supporting MC with his harem, I found myself skipping entire chapters of that nonsense before I just stopped reading the fic entirely. And the plot moves slower than tectonic drift.

    The only empire-builder I am still reading these days is [Dust in the Gears](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dust-in-the-gears-gearsofwar-rwby.101000/) a crossover of Gears of War and RWBY. I have absolutely 0 exposure to either source material so I can't vouch for its accuracy but the story is like a Humanity-Fuck-Yea except it's Gears of War into RWBY. I don't recommend it on its rationality however but it's better than some other examples I've read.

    On the note of dictatorial / authoritarian empire-builder fics, I have not read a democratic empire-builder. Perhaps the parliamentary politics are a bit too hard to put into enjoyable writing or the factionalism in authoritarian regimes can be used as a substitute but I would like to read a fic where the MC is trying to canvas for votes to become Supreme Leader. We have plenty of TV shows about it, particularly American ones, but no serial fictions.

    If you can ignore the occasional rough spots, I'd argue that [enlightened empire](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20920/enlightened-empire) is easily one of the best kingdom building fics out there. 

    The story is extremely long, brilliant in the worldbuilding, and takes thing in a step by step fashion in showing actions and their consequences. The way politics, economics and warfare are depicted in how they impact the world is extremely well done.

    It starts off really slow with the MC building an organization away from his homeland, but the themes of politics, economy, actions and consequences are all well modeled and written.

    Also here's a[ link to an old thread on kingdom building uplift fics](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/d6v9ty/any_good_suggestions_for_rational_kingdom/) that may have some gems that people have forgotten.

  I've been enjoying reading, [Shogunai](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/shoganai-an-ignoramus-si-in-naruto.1085793/#post-91761813), a naruto fanfic where the MC is an orphan boy a year older than Naruto. The mc is a "friend insert" SI where they've awaken knowledge of the outside world knows Naruto is an story that does exist, but lacks actual knowledge of the story. Outside of knowing that Naruto is the main character, he has no knowledge about important plot info.

  The SI part of the character is also done quite well in that they're not a person who's been overwritten by the SI's personality. The writing on many occasions more so comes across as a child given memories of an older person. Slight spoiler: 

  >!How the SI has spent countless hours in their free time trying to determine their parentage and why they're doing it is not something that an adult in a child's body would necessarily care about. The reasons they're pursing it comes off more like the actions of an orphan child looking for some sense of family, a legacy, knowledge about themselves.<!

  The story is seemingly rational with the SI doing their best to navigate this world they have little knowledge over. They're also trying to learn what they can with what little resources and power they have, trying to optimize for what they see is the skills that they are best suited for. In the case of a person with the memories of another world Genjutsu allows them to utilize their creative advantage over other specializations. The scaling is done well and characters are quite well fleshed out.

    [Sanitize](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize#google_vignette) is a very good Naruto fic. Not exactly martial arts heavy but lots of discovery and politics. The main character is a doctor for a small village that begins to interface with ninja and act as a neutral healer. Some soft magic and chakra discovery towards the middle.

      I've read Sanitize, one of my favourite Naruto fanfics. It's the kind of story that will only work in fanfics, the contrast between violence and conflict of the world outside our MC's life and the small but tangible progress she makes towards improving everyone's lives was nice. Some top-shelf storytelling.

      I'm 21/36 chapters in, and I'm going to gently de-rec this. It's not terribly written, but the author states they're "trying to avoid the genius/Mary-Sue SI trope" and then creates what is very much a Mary Sue.

      She has >!a super special blue flame jutsu she invents at ~9 years old and is casually one of the clan's most well-known and impressive combatants for it, makes extensive changes across the village to the point she's casually the hope of the vast majority of the village without even trying - reasonably simple changes, that no one else makes because ??? - and at one point straight-up invents a new form of magic out of literally nowhere so she can cure herself of crippling poison.!<

  I've read up to chapter 150 of [Violent Solutions](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52324/violent-solutions) after that post last thread and I really like it so far but I do have some issues. Interesting world, the mc has a purpose he's working on achieving, side characters have depth and the mc itself is fun, the action is well written and very visceral. 

  But the antagonists so far are really boring. I hope they end up with more depth later. I hate when gray/black morality protagonists always have to fight against grayer and blacker antagonists. I also really don't like the language stuff despite the writer clearly being really into it. Fake languages are something that's cool in theory, but in practice it's really boring and I skimmed past the first dozen chapters that were focused on the him learning the language. Also the character that was introduced in the second volume is very questionable. In general the way the protagonist chooses his party members doesn't make much sense, and it makes even less sense with her. But whatever, I like her archetype so I don't mind it that much.

  I've also read a few litrpgs a while back. And the first is [Owlnother World](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43693/owlnother-world) which I've read up to chapter 195. It's about a girl who is isekaied as an owl and the world she's in has magic that's heavily inspired by Thaumcraft a mod for Minecraft. Overall I like it, but the pacing and the structure of the story is very obviously not planned at all. Like the mc makes friends with all kinds of characters, but none of them are very interesting. And then the story is bogged down for the next 20 chapters while she helps them. The fact that she doesn't have a goal of her own that she works towards is one of my biggest issues. Also despite thaumatergy being insanely dangerous she just shares the knowledge of it to anyone she meets. There's no way that won't come to bite her in the ass later. Overall it's cute. I like the MC, I like that she's still an owl and the author said she'll stay that way. Her powers are really cool. In prog/litrpgs the most important part is the protagonist and I do like this one. 

  The second is [Misadventures Incorporated](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/44024/misadventures-incorporated) and I've read 113 chapters of it. So far it has a very well structured world with plenty of depth and mystery to it. Claire, the MC is great, I love characters like her who are really messed up. Overall it doesn't really have any major cons except for one which is really bad. It has probably the worst side characters I've ever seen. I'd rate it 5/5 just for how annoying they all are. It's amazing. It feels like they're all supposed to be tsunderes and they keep bullying her and I guess it's supposed to be funny? But I just think it's incredibly cringe. And they're all annoying for unique reasons too. Like one guy is obsessed with catgirls, and another thinks he's an isekai protagonist. Also she has a fox as a companion who I also find incredibly annoying and from what I've seen she will remain a her party for the rest of the story. I'm not really a fan of comedy in litrpgs/progression, but I really hate it here. Which is a shame because I really like the world and I would like to see more of it but I cannot stand reading it for any longer.

  Third is [Primal Hunter](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36049/the-primal-hunter), which I've caught up to now. It's my favorite litrpg/progression story, and while it's not perfect, it's close to my ideal progression story. Pacing is a huge issue for me in these stories. So often you end up with non-stop action which does get tiring after a while. What's the best way to overcome that? Give the MC a skilling side profession to work on the side. And I really like how alchemy is done in this. So far it's not quite as engaging as something like I Shall Seal The Heavens, but it's still pretty close. 

  And while it does have interesting side characters who do their own things, it's not bogged down by their povs. Jake is the protagonist, and it is his story, and so I don't really want to spend the next 10 chapters reading about someone else, but at the same time, if you focus purely on the protagonist the world can end up feeling empty. I think that Primal Hunter balances this really well. And the various events that Jake is involved with are connected, and foreshadowed, it's not the Jake just stumbles into it one after another. 

  The biggest issue is that there's really no overarching story. But while that is the case, I don't think it's really possible to have one in a long term prog story anyway. Like a lot of Chinese stories extend it by just having it be an endless princess is another castle type story where every time the protagonist reaches a goal it moves further way from him. Or it's endless escalation where every time the MC defeats an antagonist he has an uncle who'll come after him, and then that guy also has an uncle too and it just keeps on repeating.

  Review / rec for [*Violent Solutions*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52324/violent-solutions).


  TL;DR: (IMO,) It had too many criterial disqualifications to count as a ratfic. However, as non-rat-fiction it's still worth being recommended. Mainly due to its fight scenes, worldbuilding, character designs, non-cliche genre / format, and dialogue.

  ---

  ## Pros / Cons:

  ### PROs:

  • characters (unless their actions are being shoehorned to railroad)

  •• dialogue

  ••• language-related elements, to the point of keeping track of which words prot should know by each chapter

  • took care to not sacrifice its integrity for the sake of being more advertiser-friendly, although I think some plot developments were dropped for the fear of being cancelled at various stages of dissemination (from platform to audience)

  • worldbuilding, prose, physics simulation and related technical lingo, magical system and theory

  •• a magical system good for constructing mods to it by other worldbuilders. Though without the final limitation of spell- crafting / learning being revealed so far, it''d be too easy to explain how almost any spell or magical ability would be justifiably achieved rather quickly within the current system.

  • fight scenes, fight tactics

  • it's complete — what's been written so far can be treated as a complete, standalone story

  • it's free — the entire length of the story is freely available so far

  • an interesting prot — raised / indoctrinated to be ruthless, gradually becoming more self-asserting and empathetic. Somewhat felt like a weird mix of [*Annihilation Core*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/58068/annihilation-core) (short, dead) and *Reverend Insanity* on  ~~steroids~~ gummy bears.

  • author notes


  ### CONs


  The whole story had a certain videogame-like logic to it. I.e. in order to advance on the main questline, prot had to unlock and complete objectives sequentially. This was especially noticeable during new zone "unlocks" (zone exit points, zone changes); and at times character interactions were locked / frozen until prot was done completing the current major quest objective. This also manifested as situations in which prot was able to achieve some more-beneficial and less-risky result X, but instead focused on the quesline-appointed objective Y instead. 


  *(__spoilers__ for the entire story follow)*


  Some examples of [X] v.s. [Y]: •[harvesting the *extremely* expensive blue leafs, selling them, then using the money to get himself top-tier equipment, mooks, a personal caravan, etc] v.s. [trying to earn the 'needed' money through the mandatory quest(s) — same with many other neglected money-earning strats that should've been easy and low-risk for someone with his abilities; •[sneaking in/out of the city using various jutsu, OR traveling from the current city to the next all by himself, OR avoiding villages altogether and heading through the wilderness directly to the final destination] v.s. [focusing on the questline-appointed current objective to be 'granted permission' to leave city / join caravan / etc].


  #### The rest in a list form: 

  • lack of agency — prot was placed inside the setting after a highly accurate, god-tier predictive power was used to estimate which specific initial conditions would lead to the god's desired outcome. All the actions by prot that followed were thus not actions of a 'free' agent, but 'actions' of a high-quality circuit-board element that was being installed on a circuit (so to speak). 

  •• A plot device like this could also be used to explain away any number of ludicrous beneficial accidents or coincidences (of which there were ~5-10).

  • unfulfilled premise-promise: the premise is that prot is an indoctrinated war unit that'll prioritise task completion above all else. However, even making allowances for the psychological changes towards being more empathetic, his actions often didn't match his backstory / character sheet.

  • stupid decisions, actions, inactions, as well as out-of-character moments or incongruences (mostly ordered chronologically)

  •• [global] the setting-dwellers' choice of weapons (esp. weak bows, knives, etc) didn't make much sense given everyone's strong regen abilities, which even got highlighted by prot. •things like blunt weapons, shields, throwing nets, poisons, toxins, bioweapons, tamed beasts, and living armors were severely underrepresented (or outright nonexistent) •prot himself didn't consider making for himself experimental living armor through the entire story.

  ••• same with locks, barriers, and measures for restricting and incarcerating targets

  •• given how regen is available to everyone, it's strange that the majority of the humans weren't JoJo-levels buffed

  •• [prot] prot was given the task of reaching the target, not reaching it quickly. In this sense, all the risks he took for the sake of saving time were jeopardising the objective. And given how objective-oriented and patient his backstory was painting him to be, it didn't make sense for him to rush and blunder so much.

  There is also an interesting comparison that can be made with xianxias. In xianxias, prots are mostly ruthless, but their ruthlessness isn't that of a rabid animal (disregarding the outraged-young-master cliches): it's directed to achieve specific results. Here, prot's motivations, urges, and 'principles' could change from one action to the next. 


  Similarly, xianxia characters often are forced to act ruthlessly and take risks because taking a small — or at times even extreme risks — is still the *less* risky or most optimal action to take in their current circumstances. E.g. because they're forced into a precarious position, because they're nearing the end of their lifespan (or facing some other deadline), because other major players are actively targeting them as prey, etc. And again, in contrast: here prot had all the chances of slowly and steadily gathering resources for the task that's seemingly his number 1 priority and discarded that chance again and again for no good reason. And at other times, had a chance to solve a problem peacefully (and more optimally), but went with the more violent option.

    I guess I appreciate the detailed review, but damn, this format makes the cons look *much* heavier. Conservation of detail.

    CONS:

    * Missing obvious strategies (selling blue leaf, sneaking out of cities) in favor of plot-approved ones (“mandatory” quests)
    * Lack of prot agency due to god-tier precognition
    * Indoctrination premise takes a backseat without really being justified by character development
    * some glaring stupidity:
    * * regen-heavy setting should have completely reshaped arms, armor and tactics
    * * prot rushing objectives for no reason
    * * prot keeps misjudging risk and making stupid plans and leaking info
    * * other characters keep letting him get away with it
    * * lampshading “irrational oversight” doesn’t make it better!

    So I guess I’ll give that a miss.

      Thanks for the feedback. Some 'disclaimers' / thoughts:

      1) This opinion (#jrelrlk) is primarily intended as a review, and only secondarily as a recommendation. The rec-elemet's intended purpose is mainly to underline that I'm not *un*-reccing it, and that the story still has merit.

      2) My reviews generally have a tendency to be skewed towards pointing out the negatives rather then the positives. Conservation of detail doesn't necessarily apply.

      3) The survivorship bias effect — there are stories much worse than e.g. *VS* that get recommended here, but because they're so bad, usually I end up not reviewing them at all. Similarly, the ones that are good enough / too good may not get reviewed in this format either (even if they have some plot-related problems too).

      4) Whether or not the story'll be 'good' for someone may end up being a matter of preferences. E.g. if someone was more interested in characters and character development than plot-related aspects of the story, they may've ended up enjoying this story despite all the things mentioned in my comments.

      5) Finally, I think this story may be interesting from the worldbuilding / story-writing perspective for those who're interested in creating a similar, but better work.

      (Just wanted to clarify my stance somewhat.)

    ```
    ••[prot] killed a guy who hadn't even noticed him yet — supposedly being an 'infiltrator'-qualified unit but defaulting to this didn't make much sense.

    ••• looted that guy's stuff, entered the nearest village while wearing those — one would think he would've been aware that the villagers should have a high chance of recognising the stolen gear, but no

    ••• when given a mission to search for that guy later on, brought his remains back in ~2 days — granted, this one gets explained in AN, but even that explanation was somewhat lacking since asking himself the basic question of 'how will I explain how I found it so quickly' should've made him realise the flaws of his plan.

    •••• also lied saying he found the remains under a tree for no good reason — telling the remains were found in a scavenger nest would've at least made it more believable (probability-wise), not to mention all the left-over signs that the remains had on them from being in the scavenger nest for so long

    •• [prot] decided to fight 1 civilian, 4 trained / experienced mercs, potentially an entire village's worth of people (some of which had poisoned blow-darts) all at once — or, rather, decided that chances of getting free and escaping alive through such a fight were higher than being sold as a semi-intelligent exotic pet to a random merchant, biding his time, and arranging to escape later

    ••• the only reason this worked out for him was because 1) he deflected the darts by unexpectedly / intuitively activating a mana shield, an ability he wasn't suspecting he possessed; 2) the villagers decided that *not* killing the extremely dangerous and unpredictable creature — one that had just solo-killed an entire group of people — while it's unconscious is the better option.

    •• [the villagers] I think the villagers — esp. the village chiefs — acted stupidly for their position by forcing a direct conflict with someone as OP as prot. More likely, they would've either pretended that they believed that he wasn't the killer, agreed to treat the matter as already settled by their prior agreement (esp. since they themselves have attacked / enslaved him too), secretly paid him some money to convince him to leave before publicly making an accusation against him, or at least just exiled him.

    ••• Similarly, it didn't make much sense for them to be physically present during the attempt to imprison him.

    •• [prot] stayed and fought for no reason instead of just breaking through the encirclement and running away. 

    •• [Rehv / Rehv followers] had that annoying 'antag is trying to kill prot but also being careful to not try too hard, lest they accidentally succeed' thing. 

    ••• This plot device also got used to excuse a number of blunders or apparent perception filters by antags.

    ••[antags] most antags / opposing forces consistently failed to detect / recognise prot despite his rather unique appearance. Would've made sense for them to capture anyone even remotely matching his description, being ready to the costs of false-positives, rather than to let him go.

    •• [prot] 1) gave up on eating human meat just after one negative physiological reaction 2) his body wouldn't have had such a reaction in the first place. And even if it had, it wouldn't have been powerful enough to be impossible to control / train out of — especially given how powerful his ability to control other bodily reactions (e.g. pain response) was.

    ••[prot] poisoned an entire building before first making sure the target's even inside

    ••• "I didn't like thinking about the irrational oversight. The more I recall my recent actions, the more irrationality I find."

    •• [prot] dismissed way too much info just by deeming it as local superstitions, even after being proven time and again that it's not. Happened especially often when magic was concerned. Likely because the setting's magical system would've made it very easy for him to unlock many powerful jutsus early on and then stomp his way to the endpoint while killing most of the story tension.

    ••• existence of 'gods' — i.e. powerful beings that commoners perceive / interpret as ones

    ••• after encountering fire magic, failed to experiment with magic in general to try creating his own 'spells' for quite some time. Even when he did, it was a peace-meal thing. When he should've obviously had potential for much more. 

    •••• Even when he learned that other jutsus exist, failed to get a list of commonly-used jutsus and/or try to learn each from a random close-by practitioner.

    ••• when he learned that an OP antag used to eat parts of a living person to gain power, failed to connect the dots that such behaviour could be responsible for that antag's vast mana reserves

    •••• even later on, after gaining definite awareness about possibility of gaining extra permanent power / mana through consumption of human body parts, still failed to investigate / experiment in this direction 

    •••• later on still, when having direct access to mana-booster items, persisted to fail to consume them in small doses to increase his permanent mana capacity. • "... just as it was last time, you lack in the most important area: Raw power" – antag

    ••• failed to experiment on brains in general, e.g. to find out whether it's possible to make the target agreeable (e.g. to extract info) by incising certain parts of the target's brain or disabling them with electrical impulses 

    ••• didn't even try to replicate the metal-balls-as-ammo trick

    •• [prot] infoleaking

    ••• had a habit of often explaining his secrets to random people for no good reason

    •••• 1) kept explaining the logic behind the jutsus he came up with, depriving himself of competitive advantage against potential antags. 2) similarly, after learning that jutus can be reverse-engineered by being witnessed, didn't treat his new discoveries as secret ones to only be used against those who're definitely going to die. 3) Gave away the secret of pretty much how to become super-OP to one sidekick's business-magnate father. In a manner that would definitely end up getting leaked. All these will result in opponents globally, gradually rising in expertise and threat level. •“Your patron has provided you with knowledge that humans do not yet have [... you] foolishly spread it, lessening your relative power and gifting us with a greater understanding of magic.” [...] I found myself realizing that the effects he was talking about might be accurate, if only in the long term.

    ••• kept killing people in signature moves that only he could use (e.g. brain-frying)

    •• [prot] accepting the fetch-deliver quests from Koyl's dad didn't make sense — he was already promised the reward he was seeking. From his PoV at that time, it would've only created risks for him and little benefits.

    ••• same with the package delivery quest — he was already promised the caravan transport, he didn't have to perform any further tasks by that point to gain that service. Especially tasks that would incapacitate both him and his companion for pretty much the entire travel duration and for which he would end up with unknown packages placed inside his body by an untrustworthy person.

    •••• during this journey, at several points deliberately knocked both his companion and himself unconscious for long periods of time, while having no one trustworthy nearby as backup. This when the very previous journey ended up in a clusterfuck because he remained asleep at the wrong moment.

    •• [antags] for not using blue leaf (and other similar weapons) vs prot — not counting the initial villagers, only 1 guy used it, and only after prot's successfully learned how to counteract it

    ••• [prot] for not proactively designing some counter-measures against blue leaf (before getting a relevant jutsu)

    ••[prot] killed someone inside the city when needing experiment material instead of finding someone in the forest or on the roads

    ••• killed in the first place instead of just 1) hiring someone to 'sell a kidney' 2) provoking a fight and taking out the mana-kidney from the defeated opponent, etc 

    •• [prot] way too often allowed himself to be potentially trapped in an unfavourable environment. 

    ••• Examples: 1) "surrendering" to the guards of a city that's already known to be controlled by hostile cultists. 2) when being trapped underground, instead of e.g. making handholds on a stone wall and then climbing to the surface, allowed himself to be led even deeper into the tunnels and be surrendered by two colonies of intelligent ants that've previously demonstrated an ability to kill / dismantle a person within seconds / minutes.

    •• [prot] I think it took way too long for prot to figure out that ants are being used to spy on him.

    •• [global] the setting's monetary system didn't make much sense. The more money prot became capable of getting per unit of time, the more expensive consumables became. It gave off some bandits-in-daedric-armor vibes.

    •• [antags] recurring trope: prot made a deal with someone, that someone decided to be stupid and renege on their end of the deal for no good reason, prot took what he's promised by force.

    •• [antag] Awptheyn (the rich cultist) demanding to be left alone with a cultist-hating 'terrorist'

    ••• prot agreeing to it

    ••• Awptheyn trying to hit on her / grope her while alone with her

    For those who're looking for something similar to read, check out [*Dark Skies*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807/dark-skies) by Tigersight. it has some thematic similarities to *VS*, has ~~234 chapters~~ ~1M+ words written so far, and is supposed to return to WiP status sometime later (this year?). 

    I'd say it's a technically higher-quality writing compared to *VS*, although both deserve interest / attention.

      I tried and mostly liked Dark Skies but I eventually dropped it for two reasons

      - The protagonist is insecure to a painful degree. Like sure, she's a lobotomized child-soldier magical combat slave and all, but the level of "passive voice" is grating

      - Glacial plot pacing. 

      Then again, the last time I read this was a couple years ago, so maybe it's improved?

      Chapter count is meaningless in my opinion; I've read web novels with less than 500 words per chapter, so it's hard to infer story length by chapter count. For others, the story has a bit over one million words. 

      I'll check it out though, thanks for the recommendation.

  Light rec for [Magic is Programming](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/69938/magic-is-programming). Guy gets isekaied to a fantasy world where  dungeons grant wishes and everyone respawns after death. Also, magic is programming. 

  I say light rec because because the writing is pretty plain. For example, all that’s known about the protagonist’s life on Earth, 28k words in, is that he was a programmer and that he played computer games. However, I recommend if you liked Delve, because it kinda feels like “Delve but faster and better” to me. It’s even got the >!”turning your soul into a computer”!< thing going on!

  The world doesn’t seem to be LitRPG, but it seems to be heading in that direction.

    I mean, that's still more than we know about the Delve protag...

      I don't think that's entirely fair. As I recall it we learn a number of things about the protagonist's backstory in Delve (went to college for programming, dropped out due to a family issue, worked in construction). I might be misremembering or conflating with something else, since it's been a long time since I paid attention to Delve, but the issue with it is less the protagonist being undefined and more him being the least interesting thing in the setting, coupled with a plot that moves glacially.
      ```

      - u/brocht:
        ```
        I mean, sure, I'm being a little tongue-in-cheek. The details you mention are all so vague as to be virtually meaningless, but perhaps it is still more than the story OP mentions. For what it's worth, I really have no memory what the Delve OP's life was like whatsoever, beyond a vague 'did some programming' reference.

      I'm really disappointed in the magic, I was expecting him to essentially build a hardware layer in his soul using the principles of digital logic design (like, who needs _ten_ soul structures when a single NAND gate factory is functionally complete?) but instead it's just "wish for cool features and get it".
      ```

      - u/Charlie___:
        ```
        Personally, I was hoping for spell construction that uses legit programming problems / solutions. I want the protagonist to explain to the foil what a hash table is, before using it to acquire cosmic power :P

  i see people reccing naruto fics in here all the time. what are the naruto fics with well-written naruto/hinata ship?

    Honestly this seems like a question better for /r/NarutoFanfiction 

    There's a few actually, "rational" or even rational adjacent naruto fanfiction and so people generally bring up those few when discussion comes up. Of those I honestly don't remember the ships of any of them, not because they have no romance, but because if they do it's often such a minor plot component that it's forgettable. If the relationship pairing is an important component to the enjoyment of the fic than this probably isn't the place to find many recommendations.

    Here are couple links to the common discussions that have happened in the past:

      Hey boss r/NarutoFanfiction is permanently locked in protest of the API changes and never coming back. Reddit no longer has a dedicated fanfic sub for Naruto.

        Wow. 

        Absolutely insane how power obsessed mods are that when they dislike changes made to a platform they don't own, they don't just leave their mod positions and leave the sub, but instead lock out the entire community from the subreddit. The level of ego and narcissism.

        With that said, you could probably request to mod it on r/redditrequest and if they give it just open it up or if not just make a new sub. I'm pretty sure r/narutofanfiction was a fairly active sub there are lots of people like you who would want to see a place for naruto fanfiction on reddit in 2023 and onward.

          I made the request of another sub with a similar name and no activity and was denied already. They said I do not have enough mod experience. I'm hoping someone else tries.

    The ones I've read that were actually good are The Waves Arisen and Time Braid. 

    The Waves Arisen was probably written at least in part by Yudkowsk, isn't super long, but quite good. I'd highly recommend it. 

    Time Braid is... good, but has a lot of weird sex and rape stuff that, in my opinion, really detracts. The author's kind of a pervert. But, if you can overlook or get past that (or enjoy it, I guess, if that's your thing), the overall story is quite good and has strong rational elements.
