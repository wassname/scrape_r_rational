  Inspired and took a stab after dinner. I am not a poet, and all oddities can be explained by reference to the most convenient rhyme....

  If you wonder in Canterlot

  The spell that feeds the rowdy lot

  No pony sweats to break their back

  To work the hoe without a slack

  All crops as live ere turn to rot!

  What can keep the ponies fed

  Soundly sleeping in their beds?

  “Widgets!” the purple pony declares

  (“Pardon my mentor could not be there

  Opportunity cost can be so tough

  But Perhaps her assistant will know enough

  To satisfy your questions”)

  “Yes widgets and watches and wrenches and more

  Parts and pieces you’ll lose on the floor

  Tiny and light like a whipped cream soufflé

  Gone forever, you’ll just have to pray”

  Sample this piece, she says, and she thrusts into your hands

  A curious contraption the texture of sand

  “In water it magicks—it’s a salt for bath!”

  You nod politely, unsure of the path

  Of this twisted pony’s logic.

  “Canines eat by doing dog tricks,

  Cities nourish from the same store

  By building for less and selling for more

  Canterlot is fed on…on…bath salts!

  And wrenches and watches and widgets galore”

  A flaw in her spiel you note with trepidation

  For fear that this pony will burst into flammation

  But reason compelled you, you must, you will

  Ask how this can be true for Ponyville

  Which sends its food to Canterlot

  And reaps in return what the city wrought

  One must win and the other lose

  This the dismal science has proved

  “Not at all, dear pony,” she says with a laugh

  “Don’t you know the world is quite vast?

  Each pony unique in their own way

  Endowments and goals, only they can say

  Trade butter for guns and both ponies gain

  We know because neither pony refrained”

  The excited look in the econopony’s eye

  Gives you pause, and you begin to shy

  Away from her and toward the door

  And leave her study forever more

  You cough and stammer a hasty goodbye

  But to her books she’s returned and pays you no mind

  Songbirds sing as you breathe clean air

  The sun hangs loose like it just don’t care

  You buy an apple, so fresh and firm

  Tastes twice as sweet knowing how it’s earned

    Do you literally only write things with ponies in?
