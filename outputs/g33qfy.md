  > "Children!" shouted Mr. Bucket. "Ignore the two potatoes on the floor! We are not here for them."

  This work is a masterpiece of our time. I am in awe that of all the possible times I could have existed in this cosmos, I was so fortunate as to do so at the same time as this fic.

    I walked directly into that line, face-first.

    That line straight up reaped my expectations.

    After reading that line, I couldn't stop laughing. This fic is so genius.

      The potato was bare, but for one potato. You expect the line is just a ridiculous way of saying that there are zero potatos. It is not.

      >The Abstraction Room was as barren as the Potato Room, with a one potato margin of error.

      The potato room had 1 potato and nothing else. A "one potato margin of error" means there might be one more potato, or one less potato, than the estimate.

      This seems like a roundabout way of saying "zero potatoes", like so many other things in the story ("I am as far off the ground as something one meter above the ground!")
      ```

  - u/JesradSeraph:
    ```
    Nonsense. You exist at all the times and spaces where there is a consciousness, which is also all the times and spaces where and when this fic could get written.

    It was inevitable.

  Oh no. 

  >"These powers are real and all you need to do to get them is only focus on one thing."

  and

  >Mahuika vaped.

  Tide is boned. Mahuika has a years-long headstart.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Mahuika does have a years-long headstart on *her* power, but the requirement to focus only one thing prevents the ability to develop more than one psyker power. So if Tide is lucky enough, then she might have a favorable match up with mind reading against Mahuika's power.

    I also hope that by specializing into *only* Mahuika rather than the more vague and general subject of vaping, Tide's power will be more powerful due to being a more narrow domain.
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      God it's so fucking weird that all it takes is ending this chapter with a segment about developing psychic powers over time and focus, and this sub is already debating "Who Would Win?" speculation in the comments and comparing psychic powers.

  >"My mom likes literature. My dad likes science. When I was little, I loved the ocean, and I still do. But they always… they always tried to make it about what they liked. My mom wanted me to appreciate it from a literary perspective! My dad wanted me to appreciate it from a scientific perspective! I didn't care! I liked it both ways, but they didn't listen to me when I said it. They didn't fight about it, but they were always trying to make it about something bigger. I didn't want it to be bigger! It's the ocean! What's bigger than that?"

  I'm happy you're here, writing this story for this subreddit. It doesn't have to be any bigger than what it is. The science parts and the literary majesty were really cool. But it's enough. 

  >"I have no idea what I'm doing," said Tide. "JUROR is right about how he does it. I hate dealing with endings."

  >She smiled. "But I liked the attention. Mr. Bucket does too. I don't think he believes what he says. He might believe that he believes that, but he doesn't. He just wants to speak. The content doesn't matter."

  >"I vape," said Mahuika.

  >"We're the worst ones," said Tide. "Having nothing to say, and saying it."

  <3

  The Omelas reference, man.  And the fact the last child to be eliminated always seems to be in this room. Also, Bucket is probably lying about the stroke. This room clearly vinegarizes people and things.

  (Vinegar is an essential component of pickle brine, too. Hmmm.)

    wow yeah, I'm being exposed to new levels of meta with each comment.  Didn't even think about the "literature vs science" metaphor for rational fic itself.

          the technical power of Henry Sugar was to "see through thin objects" like cards.

          The characters in the stories are just seeing through the "paper" - the pages of the story - or out of the screen:  through the fourth wall.

      I'd say Keerthi was still a Walker-Away From Omelas. She tried to give up her shot at the factory to free a single tortured soul. (And in a way, she did.)
      ```

      - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
        ```
        The ones who walk don't free the child. They simply reject a paradise built on its suffering.

        Keerthi definitely rejected Wonka's paradise
        ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Tide is more like someone who tries to get elected in Omelas really

  > "Children! No need for pretending anymore, we know what this is! I am going to leave you for an amount of time, you can choose for how long. When one of you has had enough, click your heels together three times, and you will have a chocolate stroke. The other child will win. Goodbye."

  That moment when the guy who spent an afternoon pretending he wasn't trying murder you goes "Screw this, this is too much effort. I'll just shoot you instead."
  Reminds me of the end of *The Cabin in the Woods*, actually.

  Every time I think this fic couldn't get more insane and great, it manages to top my expectations in the next chapter. I really can't wait to find out what happens next.

    ```
    I think we need to at least consider the possibility that this was the ending.

      I swear to fuck if this is the ending
      ```

      - u/throwaway234f32423df:

        I'm just thinking about chapter 1

        >the_ladwhocan: It doesn't even have an ending. I'm not kidding. It ends in the middle of a long run on sentence making fun of how fat she thought Augustus was.

        son of a bitch that was the ending

  Considering how getting high on drugs can lead to out-of-body experiences where one views reality as false, a single world out of billions, viewing higher dimensions, or similar surreal experiences, I conclude that Mahuika gained the ability to be aware of being a character in a story.

  She then capitalized on being a seemingly one-dimensional character to preserve the mystery surrounding her so that she would survive until the very end. After all, no character can die until they get a turn as the 'protagonist'. I'm basing that bit on Cleo in chapter 5 who died after we saw her spend time thinking and making wishes.
  ```

- u/immortal_lurker:
  ```
  This is probably the best fic I've ever read in terms of keeping me on the edge of my seat. I have no idea how its going to end. If all the children are secretly alive, or if even the winner gets killed after inheriting the factory. I can think of so many different endings.

  Charlie is only giving up the factory because he wants to escape and do something else, but there must always be a chocolatier in the factory, and you can't end the curse until you pass it on.

  All the children are secretly alive, and Charlie is offended that anyone thought otherwise. Or he reveals that everything horrible was a lie, this was all some fucked up test of character to see how they would handle a clearly evil demi-god.

  Lee survived, and is gathering the other contestants plus the down room slaves for a revolution.

  Tide unlocks psychic powers and banishes Mahuika to the shadow realm. Mahuika reveals that she has had psychic powers all along, and banishes Tide to the shadow realm.

  Tide reads Mahuika's mind, realizes that she could never destroy her for moral reasons, and surrenders.

  Tide realizes that psychic powers aren't real, she just went insane after a year with only Mahuika and two potatoes for company.

  The story just ends right here, chapter 19 is never published.

  I would care about each of these endings in a different way. I'm looking forward to seeing what the ending actually is.

  Tide is Mathilda’s daughter ?
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    Who, the Matilda who was adopted by one Miss Honey? No, you're confused. Tide's mother is renowned author M.H., creator of the acclaimed *Little Matador.*

    - u/vimefer:
      ```
      Matilda Honey ?

      Little Matador is an anagram of Matilda Rotated.

  I've just read the title and I'm immediately going to say that the Abstraction Room is a *very* powerful name. Now to go in!

  ```
  from the wiki on henry sugar:

  " The story is considered to be mildly satiric of Dahl's critics, who  would sometimes nickname him the "Master of Nastiness". Here, he gives a  happy ending, and even gives a sweet and rather anodyne name to the  protagonist. "

  is this chapter a message to critics?
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    > Here, he gives a happy ending

    That's not how I remember the story ending, though? I thought it ended with him looking in the mirror and his x-ray vision showing a fatal blood clot slowly travelling to his heart.

    Am I thinking of a different story?

    EDIT: Ah, a quick google shows that was a '[fake, literary ending](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O_fUTisv7xoC&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=%22What+could+a+small+dark+lump+be+doing+inside+the+vein%22&source=bl&ots=kGbl2RT-Xj&sig=ACfU3U3ecPSAUehE24o4ogEZA_fEInRfKg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwji8ayf_O_oAhVwURUIHWuDB_UQ6AEwAHoECAQQKw#v=onepage&q=%22What%20could%20a%20small%20dark%20lump%20be%20doing%20inside%20the%20vein%22&f=false)' with the 'real' one being happier. I'm sure it says something that it's only the darker one that sticks in the mind.

  Tide has lost the question marks.  It's all over for her.

  ```

- u/XxChronOblivionxX:
  ```
  It occurs to me that Tide just mentally distinguished between the **Charles** Bucket of today and the **Charlie** Bucket of the past. Adds another check mark towards the idea of this not being the original, that the real Charlie killed himself in front of the crowd.
  ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  Chapter 19 be like:

  She vapes.

- u/OnlyEvonix:
  ```
  when Kireethi got it I realised Mahuika would win as she is the ideal child, even Bucket's most roundabout and rigged plots would fail in the face of Vaping perfection.

- u/throwaway-ssc:
  ```
  Rereading chapter 16, I changed my mind about something. Not reading closely, I assumed that Charlie killed Wonka. But now it seems almost certain to me that whatever or whoever rejected the fuel killed Wonka, not Charlie. Maybe that was already obvious to you all. Probably at least one other person missed it.

  Some of the weirdest, funniest and most original stuff I’ve ever encountered, I’m certain the next chapter will be as hilarious as it is horrific.

  I predict, inasmuch as this is a prediction, that the true eldritch abomination will be the friend we made along the way

    I predict this is the end of the story, like so many of JUROR's masterpieces.

      Holding out for the double-bluff never-ending story, personally. There's been too many moments already perfect for a Juror-style
