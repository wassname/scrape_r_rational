  [Mr. Yudkowsky's recommendation](http://i.imgur.com/Kx6UTpF.png) ([source](http://archive.is/ci6mk)):

  > It's amazing how much of a difference it makes when all of a story's characters, in passing, have the ability to access elementary rationality skills. It makes them so much more real to me; they can reflect on what they're doing, not just be tools of the plot. This story took a while to get up to speed and quality, but now I'm at the end and I'm like AAAAAHHHH I NEED MORE HOW DO I GET THE NEXT CHAPTER.

  > Rough summary of 'hook': Our Earth is the future of Middle-Earth, and then a Silmaril is found during a fracking operation.

    Yeah I found it there too, read 4 chapters so far, looks amazing.

    If it wasn't written by Yudkowsky himself, it's definitely by someone who's read him.
    ```

      Also appreciating the author's general life experience and sense of humour in this. The suicide themes are pretty strong though so heads-up to anyone who's dealing with depression or suicide at the moment.

  Read This!  Some Yudkowski-ish author tracts on game theory but this is a great read.  It is an even better read if you enjoy the concept of bound rational agents, or have read the Silmarillion.
  ```

    ```
    Or if you've read Children of Hurin, and given The Silmarillion a red-hot go but found it very dense, heh.
    ```

  ```
  How much LotR knowledge is prerequisite? Will I enjoy it if I know essentially nothing of Tolkien?
  ```

  - u/darkflagrance:
    ```
    The story seems to tell the inexperienced reader everything she needs to know about the characters and their backstory, and most of these characters had much less development in the source material anyway, so they're essentially completely different characters as depicted in this work.
    ```

    - u/thecommexokid:
      ```
      I have now read 10 chapters (as well as some of the Wikipedia page about the *Silmarillion*), and I disagree with this assessment. Coming from a place of absolute Middle-Earth ignorance, the Elf half of the story is very difficult for me to follow. But for now I'm enjoying the story anyway!
      ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    I had to google the [Oath of FÃ«anor](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Oath_of_F%C3%ABanor) at one point and click a few of its hyperlinks. But even that was fully explained later on, if you don't mind being in the dark for a few chapters.

  Maedhros, you *idiot*.  The Wise of the third age knew better...

  Anyway, I'm already looking forward to the sequels, feat. ocean drilling and Elon Musk :)

    ```
    I'm not sure that he's done the game theory accounting right; doesn't he know that the Jewels are already accounted for? One that they captured a decade ago, one that was in S. Dakota, and one that is on Venus? I'm inclined to think that he's being actively manipulated by the DOOM here. Which is frustrating, as a reader. It's like Shard Shenanigans. (Spoilers there, i suppose)
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This is great! Did you write it?
  ```

  - u/ToaKraka:
    ```
    I am not a writer.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Well thanks for bringing it to our attention, anyhow.
      ```
