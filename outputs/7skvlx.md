  > “Bonding time with Black,” I said. “I assume some form of murder will be involved, possibly also a chilling speech on the nature of power. As prelude to further murdering.”

  Gods Above and Below what other story can you get *that* good banter?
  ```

- u/Yes_This_Is_God:
  ```
  Oh goodie, father-daughter bonding time.

  (Also, pretty sure Black is trying to set up a potential transition for Cat here by dying to save her or something.)
  ```

  - u/Nihilvin:
    ```
    Diabolist's third aspect is Claim. That doesn't bode well for Cat when Warlock already pointed out her weakness to anyone who can tinker with souls.
    ```

    - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
      ```
      Ooh, maybe diabloist claims control over Cat and has her kill Black to become the next Black Knight.

      Seems appropriately tragic.
      ```

      - u/Nihilvin:
        ```
        Im thinking this is what the story is leading to as well
        ```

    - u/werafdsaew:
      ```
      I don't think Claim is the right aspect; it seems to be an aspect for gathering raw power.  Bind is though, since it has already shown to work on fae.
      ```

  I dont like cat losing her agency, is weird after she was raised into a power of her own to see her turning into a minion once again.

  also I love Archer: 
  >“You have the weirdest relationships with people,” Archer muttered. 


  The conversation with Black was hilarious. was almost like they were saying: 

  >"this old school villains, so quaint," 

  in a extremely posh british accent.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    My now you've mentioned it Rowan Atkinson in his blackadder persona would make for an excellent depiction of black. Just the right combination of sophistication and scathing
    ```

- u/Iconochasm:
  ```
  >and the hordes of the dead were no match for two Named at the peak of their transient power.

  Is this a hint that Adjutant is a transitional name too?
  ```

  - u/sparr:
    ```
    I think "transient power" just refers to Named who get stronger for a limited amount of time during a heated battle, particularly using short-duration or limited-use combat aspects.
    ```

  - u/TheEngineer923:
    ```
    Implication is that Archer is as well. I don't think Adjutant or Archer is transitional Names. However, given how the theme of student surpassing mentor is apparently being played out, Adjutant might just transition to Captain and if Black's succession plan is to succeed that will undoubtedly draw the ire of the Lady of the Lake and the Sovereign of the Red Skies. 

    Who knows? Maybe EE is planning on telling a Narrative where The Woe has to choose Cat over their mentors/parental figures ending with each of them having to kill their mentors and possibly claim their Names. 

    It would fit the theme nicely of the New replacing the Old. Captain's death proves that the Calamities' time are done. 

    Fore what follows a Calamity? Woe.

  I'm glad we're getting right into the thick of things. Kinda hoping there's not too many hoops to jump through before Cat gets to meet Akua in person, everything else would feel like filler.
