## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [The boy who fell](https://www.boywhofell.com/comic/ch00p00) is an enjoyable web comic about a kid called ren who gets draged down to hell and has to fight in a grand tordoment in order to return to the human world. The art is very good for a web comic as well, on par with most professional manga, and in the later chapters are even coloured. While it's not really rational there are some good puzzles and clever bits in there. It's also one of those stoys that treads the line between dark as fuck while still haveing a fun and upbeat tone. 

  [A miracle of science](https://project-apollo.net/mos/mos000.html) is another great webcomic. In the world of the future, where Science Related Memetic Disorder is a condition that turns people into mad scientists, the story follows benjamin prester who tracks down and deals with mad scientists and his new partner in the form of a body of the hive mind of mars. It's main problem is the art is a little janky but if you can look past that it is a great read.

  [Beginner guide to the end of the universe](https://mspfa.com/?s=132&p=1) is the best MS paint Quest I have ever read, especialy at the beginning. I don't wan't to say too much as that would spoil it.


  So I while ago I read [Puella Magi Adfligo Systema](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/puella-magi-adfligo-systema.2538/) a shity SV quest that starts of good and then very quickly just becomes boring. The main thing that stuck me was how, at times, the main character comes across as a delusional benevolent psychopath. This was the most interesting part of the story to me. Her way of negotiating with people she disagreed with was telling them that she is right and they are wrong and, due to how powerful she was, they would join her, which renforced her delusion. All of this was due to poor writeing but it got me thinking of [Taint](https://lsdell.com/table-of-contents/) and [A Prison of Glass](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-prison-of-glass-worm-cyoa.486424/) both of who feature likeable nut jobs as the protag. Do you have any recomandations for stoys with slightly insane but likeable main characters.

    [Seventh Horcrux](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux) is about Harry Potter's consciousness being replaced by Voldemort's when Voldemort cast the Killing Curse, and from there pretends(poorly) to be not-Voldemort.
    ```

    - u/Palmolive3x90g:
      ```
      Seventh Horcrux is dope, both funny and inteligent. Though I wish it didn't stick so close to the standerd story so much. The whole time I was reading it I was just waiting for it to go completly off the rails and it never did.

        How can a story in which the main antagonist and the main protagonist have become the same person remain on the rails of canon??

        Can you spoil me per PM on how he made the end of book one work? I don't think I'll ever read it myself since it wasn't my thing when I tried reading the first couple of chapters.

          > How can a story in which the main antagonist and the main protagonist have become the same person remain on the rails of canon??

          By the same mechanism most "alternate character interpretation" fanfictions do it: a bit of contrivance. The same happens in "Oh no, not again!" (Harry's 20-something mind travels back to his 11 y.o. body), "The Arithmancer" (Hermione is a genius of maths and thus spellcrafting, and effectively becomes the protagonist of the series) and "The Changeling" (Ginny Weasley is sorted in Slytherin). In all these cases you'd expect major divergences but the plot beats instead end up remaining more or less the same. It works better for comedic/parody stories IMHO because it's never about finding it all believable, in fact the contrivances themselves can be funny if lampshaded.
          ```

        - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
          ```
          SPOILERS:
          So basically Harrymort hears the philosopher stone is in the mirror and goes down to get it. Quirrel is already there and tries to attack him but Harry instantly kills him and Harrymort obsesses over the fact he'll get in trouble. Dumbledore later tells Harrymort that it is fine that he killed Quirrel because he did it out of love to a confused Harry.

          This bit is funnier cause when they meet again in the 4th book the resurrected Voldemort is pissed that Harry killed him while Harry says it isn't his fault since he didn't k ow Voldemort was possessing him at the time.

          If you read five chapters in it really gets funny but I understand if the humor isn't your cup of tea.
          ```

          - u/Bowbreaker:
            ```
            Wait, so >!when Voldemort attacked baby Harry he copied his mind onto the baby instead of directly possessing it? And his original still became a spirit roaming the Earth/vicinity of his Horcruxes?!<
            ```

            - u/DrMaridelMolotov:
              ```
              yep basically Harrymort is a horcrux that gained consiousness and Voldemort the original is still out there. Later on he says he made the horcrux because it sounded cool and was in his arithmancy phase so made 7 horcruxes. He never read the directions or warnings.
              ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Here's a few that meet the funny insane character requirement(warning - many are incomplete or dead):

    [super minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) is a good ongoing fiction, defining his insanity without going into spoilers is hard but I can say it is pretty funny.

    [I Just Love Killin' (Worm/Rick and Morty Crossover)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-just-love-killin-worm-rick-and-morty-crossover.446513/) I think this one was funny? can't remember. Good regardless, and while the main character isn't insane, the alien in her head is.

    [A Dalek Lantern (Doctor Who/Green Lantern)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-dalek-lantern-doctor-who-green-lantern.225074/) again, can't remember if this was funny or not, and the main character isn't really insane, just an alien. Still good regardless, though it is incomplete and hard to navigate.

    [A Young Woman's Political Record (Youjo Senki/Saga of Tanya the Evil)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/page-151#post-55238560) I think this one is kinda niche, but I enjoyed it immensely.

      I loved it as well. You might also like another Tanya fanfic, [The Leader](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12429349/1/The-Leader). IMHO, A Young Woman's Political Record is more true to the original material and better written, but there's significantly more content in The Leader. Both follow separate paths, but towards the same end.

    Thanks for the recommendations! I've decided to give reading a webcomic a go, the images are loading a bit slowly would this just be due to my poor internet connection? Or is there a way I can reduce quality of images all have them all load while I'm reading the first page? I'm reading the boy who fell. Thanks

  So yesterday I read **[The Simulacrum](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum)** on Royal Road, our protagonist Leonard wakes up with amnesia and then does his best to rationally figure out the slightly odd world he finds himself in.

  Light spoiler description would be >!Leonard quickly learns he is the idiot friend of the protagonist in a harem romance comedy. The world closely follows narrative tropes from the genre and he uses his genre savviness to avoid awkward situations that typically arise out of these stories, and figure out whats going on and why he is there!<

  Mild spoiler description >!Leonard begins to trip some romance flags and ends up inadvertently in his own harem romance comedy situation by accident!<

  Heavy spoiler description >!Turns out he is actually in a supernatural shonen harem romance comedy, so add magic battling stuff too. Also Leonard has random superpowers too!<

  Overall I recommend the story it has a *mostly* rational MC that was interesting and funny enough to keep me engaged through all the current chapters.
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    One downside to The Simulacrum, post first interlude (about halfway right now): >!it eventually seems like the main character starts acting like a stereotypical dense romantic comedy protagonist. It's not handled particularly well by the author so far, but the main character does note that he's aware of people's feelings for him; I think what's going on is that he just doesn't want to deal with it. However, I would have preferred that he take his own advice and deal with the burgeoning situation with the mature approach that he normally advises other people take!<

    Aside from that, it's definitely worth reading; it's like the best fanfic of a romcom that never existed.
    ```

    - u/wertwert765:
      ```
      I completely agree, that's why I said *mostly* rational. >!Even when he becomes aware of it he just continues to act like a stereotypical protagonist and it feels silly to in one breath be talking about harem romance comedy tropes, and then in the next engaging in those exact tropes!!<

    Seveneves by Neal Stephenson is this, but I caution you that the printed volume contains one and one-third books, the latter third of a book being unfinished. It mostly serves as an epilogue to the first book, wrapping up worldbuilding details and providing the "a thousand years later" view.

    Weird one, but have you read [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/) by Wildbow?  
    The inciting incident is that Rose Thorburn, lawyer and inhabitant of Hillsglade House, dies. The residents of Jacob's Bell have been waiting for this for a long time, because they hope her heir will sell the house, allowing the town to expand and finally prosper.

    Blake Thorburn never expected to be named heir, since Rose specifically stipulated that one of her granddaughters would inherit. However, when his cousin Molly, the first heir, is murdered, he is next in line.

    He soon finds out his grandmother was not *just* a lawyer, and her... other occupations has made her - and now him - a lot of very powerful enemies.  
    >!Turns out she was a Demonologist. And now scorcerers, Chronomancers, Enchanters, and Fae are out for his blood.!<

    It's not... *too* rational, but in a believable way. People sometimes behave according to certain stereotypes, because the universe literally rewards them for doing so.

      I have, at least large parts of it. Pact was enjoyable for the most part but there were parts that I had a difficult time following. It have some great moments.

      It isn't really what I was looking for with the request though as the society doesn't as much change as it already is different but just secret from the rest of the world.

  I'm looking for recommendations for (mostly) pop-sci books in Russian (translated or otherwise) for my grandpa, whose primary interests are in space and cosmonautics (a few more details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/etu2s/i_was_born_in_shchigry_ru_in_1932_i_worked_as_a/)). Would also be happy to accept fiction or other non-fiction book recommendations -- probably sci-fi, preferably, but fantasy, romance, etc. also work, so long as they're good. Translated web-fiction would also work, but would be less preferred -- he doesn't care much for e.g. the sorts of themes liked by this sub, and webfic generally lacks the polish of professionally translated / edited works. 

  Specifically, this is all part of daily "homework" I assign him. On my daily walk into work, I'll call my grandparents up for a 10-20 minute chat, and to keep things fresh and interesting, I've stipulated my grandpa has to read each day a handful of pages from one of several books of my choosing. These tend to be translations of English books I read and enjoyed in highschool, since later reads are more specialized and niche, and he's very well read wrt the Russian "Greats" so anything I can offer there would be old hat. I think it's maybe been helpful in keeping keeping his mind sharper; hard to say... (he's in his 90s... I also make him solve mechanical block puzzles, assemble lego figurines (e.g. the recent Saturn V one), and so on, and otherwise he keeps fairly active with gardening, walking around a lot, etc.). Books that I've gotten for him so far include:

  **The Martian (Марсианин)**

  Stardust (Звездная пыль)

  The Martian Chronicles (Марсианские Xроники)

  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Автостопом по Галактике)

  The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (Ресторан у конца Вселенной)

  The rest of the HGttG, I think (Автостопом по Галактике. Опять в путь)

  The Ancestor's Tale (Рассказ предка)

  The Demon-Haunted World (Мир, полный демонов : Наука - как свеча во тьме)

  **Contact (Контакт)**

  A Briefer History of Time (Кратчайшая история времени)

  The Selfish Gene (Эгоистичный ген)

  XKCD's What If (А что, если?...)

  Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (Вы, конечно, шутите, мистер Фейнман!)

  Surface Details (Несущественная деталь)

  Dune (Дюна)

  Red Mars (Красный Марс)

  Blue Mars (Голубой Марс)

  Green Mars (Зеленый Марс)

  **Cosmos (Космос: Эволюция Вселенной, жизни и цивилизации)**

  Pale Blue Dot 2E (Голубая точка. Космическое будущее человечества)

  Bolded entries are ones he's especially enjoyed. 

  Also, a specific book request: I tried yesterday to find a translation of Mary Roach's "Packing for Mars", since I think it'd be right up his alley (I've not read it, though). I think the Russian translation is Обратная сторона космонавтики, for some reason. Can anyone find me a lead (I'm not super familiar with the Russian-speaking internet, and I know there are Russian-speaking posters here, in case some have inroads to possible options)? Either a (less-sketchy) place where I could buy it to ship to a US address, or a digital file (sorry if the latter request is not allowed, mods! Unfortunately, grandpa's vision is failing, and he's way too pigheaded to 1) wear any of the reading glasses I've bought him, 2) use any of the magnifying sheet's we've gotten him, 3) use any of the e-reader or tablet's we've gotten him that let you arbitrarily magnify text. So despite having purchased all of the above, I've now taken to just printing them out blown up 3-5x and bound in large 3 ring binders. For a physical book, I'd probably just order it to myself and then digitize it :S. Let me know if I should remove the sentence before the parenthetical pls).

  Also, on a related note, he requests that I watch movies / television shows he's enjoyed in exchange. However, my wife's Russian is pretty poor (she's learning it well! but not yet fluent), and I don't have time to watch them without her, so we need versions with English subs/dubs. I'm generally decent at locating these, but can't seem to find a good copy of "The Adjutant of His Excellency" (Адъютант его превосходительства). There's a good Russian-only copy [up on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZODLHs6LNoE), but the auto-generated subs are pretty bad. Any help would be appreciated!

    Have you guys read non-Russian greats? In particular, Polish sci-fi/'hard fantasy' authors that I'd expect to have good Russian translations:

    - Stanislaw Lem (I don't think he had an unimpressive book)
    - Jacek Dukaj (Other Songs was translated as Иные песни; I don't know if Ice was translated, quick google only finds Ukrainian and Bulgarian releases ;/)
    - Janusz A. Zajdel (Limes Inferior, translated as Предел)

    Also, I bought an audiobook reader for my granpa a while ago, as his eyesight is also going. Not sure how good/available russian audiobooks are... But there's simple readers out there like Ace Milestone that can be used by feeling alone.

  - u/RetardedWabbit:

    You could read "On the Orgin of Species" for pop-sci, the examples he uses are fun to talk about and some of the theories seem absurd now.

    Sci-fi:
    The "Ian Cormac" series by Neal Asher might be of interest for sci-fi, it has the most interesting "progenitor" space race I've ever read and a solid universe with only two major setting weak points in my opinion.

    I personally haven't read them but I've seen a lot of recommendations of "The Expanse" series here as a harder sci-fi series.

    Question: Have you read any cold war veiled books with him? There's a lot of literature of that's much better done than Animal Farm but feature similar underlying themes of west vs east and capitalism vs communism. I'm not suggesting you do this, just wondering.

    Your relationship with your grandfather seems awesome! The most important predictors of elderly quality of life are socialization and exercise. Mentally challenging tasks are great, and gardening is fantastic since it combines exercise and responsibility. 

    The only thing I would add is to make sure he's drinking enough water and encourage him to eat fruit, it sounds silly but water is a major nutrient of concern for elderly populations. High coffee consumption is correlated with good outcomes if he's a coffee drinker(hydrating, socializing, caffeine, and antioxidants are some theorys why). Fruit is a big one also, keeping nutrient and calorie intake up in the elderly is difficult since chewing and taste get worse with age. You might try some different fruits with him for fun, it's amazing how many different ones you can find at specialty/ethnic stores and older generations appreciate it even more.

      Thank you for the recommendations! I'll give them a thought, although I think a Pokemon Fanfic hardly seems appropriate for his interests... ;p it's been a while since I read the original, and I'm not sure how much he actually enjoys biology (he had to drop Ancestor's Tale a few hundred pages in, and iirc didn't care much for The Selfish Gene, and those are written explicitly for perhaps-not-quite-lowest-common-denominator popular audiences).

      I have not read any Cold-War-themed books with him -- it's generally not a subject we talk too much about. I'll take it under consideration, too.

      >Your relationship with your grandfather seems awesome! The most important predictors of elderly quality of life are socialization and exercise. Mentally challenging tasks are great, and gardening is fantastic since it combines exercise and responsibility.

      Yeah, he's very active for his age -- 5-10 years ago he was actively deteriorating -- turns out due to multiple fractures of his hip/femur. Some surgeries later and he's up and about again, walking miles each day like it's nothing (although with occasional dizzy spells / falls -- nothing too damaging yet, thankfully).

      RE: other healthy habits -- I try to bug him to eat better (esp. a diverse array of high-fiber veggies), but living in another state I can't exert too much control over his diet, and while grandma cooks a decent variety of food for him she's not at all keen to argue with his personal dietary decisions either (which otherwise consist of bread, butter, and pigfat (salo)).

    I can't help you with the literature stuff, but I might be able to help with the subtitles! I use https://www.opensubtitles.org/ , but I'm not sure how much Russian content it has subbed on there. I don't know about windows but on Linux it's a VLC plug in so you just open VLC and click "download subtitles" and then it downloads the subtitle automagically, and often it's already synced (though you can sync it manually). Otherwise, have you considered a VPN and Russian netflix?

  I've just finished reading [Event Horizon Book 1: Autumn's Frontier](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11015476/1/Event-Horizon-Book-1-Autumn-s-Frontier), part of a series of fanfictions that explore the idea of a lot of fantasy properties existing as different planets in a system that gets eventually explored by future humans. This one focuses on the Game of Thrones world (the others are Lord of the Rings, Warhammer 40K, and I think Avatar TLAB). It's nice and introduces some interesting deviations from canon as well as a light satire of colonialism, but the writing is occasionally a bit eyeroll inducing (specifically, the many 20th and 21st century pop culture references that you wouldn't expect to appear so much as they do), and unfortunately, the series as a whole is incomplete and seems abandoned.

  This has awakened my interest though - are there any other good recommendations about **modern/sci-fi military forces and magic fantasy empires** interacting? Preferably complete, and preferably about interesting, balanced interactions, not just "tanks roflstomp everything". Either fanfiction or original works.

    https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-king-in-the-long-night-asoiaf-got-stellaris-uplift-project.578392/

    It focusses much more on character interactions and not so much on "tank stomp", and is fairly well written so far. The sci-fi forces operate under real constraints and limitations, have actual motivation and are fairly well fleshed out. 

    That said, they're not the nicest bunch around, which by GoT standards makes them real stand-up people.
