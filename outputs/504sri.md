    I have a question. I keep seeing references to a plan to create Village Hidden in the Heavens or something like that and I was wondering if you (the GMs) were thinking of adding it to the threadmarks as one of the omakes. Because I think the plan itself is interesting enough to be included in it's own right.

    Other than that, wonderful job writing this story! ;)

      There's a link to it in...I think it's ChronOblivion's sig. Otherwise, just use the search tool.

      If you give me the link to the relevant post I'll threadmark it once LeechBlock lets me back onto SV.
