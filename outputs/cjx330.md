  *Donjon* (Worm OC, Seattle) has returned with Aftershocks 2-1! A week later, Carmilla is still settling into her new home and new role as a superhero. Sorry for the long delay, I'm afraid I wasn't quite able to keep up my writing pace once I ran out of backlog. But fear not, more Donjon is on its way.

  I don't know why this is getting downvoted. I'm glad to see Carmilla back in action! And always happy to see more of Gasconade. Never thought about using his power to eat more snacks without getting full, gotta say it would be nice having him around for that reason.

  There's a lot of smiling back and forth during their conversation, it gets pretty repetitive.
