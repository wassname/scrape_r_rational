  Just to make sure everyone's aware, since it's the first chapter this month there's a bonus chapter [Interlude: Miraculous](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2019/06/03/miraculous/). They usually get their own thread and is linked to at the end of Interlude: Repurpose.

  >“Yes,” the Dead King whispered fondly into his ear, “now show me what it is that she’s planning. Show me what the Intercessor seeks, Hierophant.”

  Fuck, what a cliffhanger!

  Edit: I think that Tyrant's weapon only looks like a sword because we're seeing it through Saint's eyes.

    Cat calls it Hierarchy. That's the nickname of Demons of Order and they fit the later observations of Masego about faith and laws so, yes, it's likely not a sword.
