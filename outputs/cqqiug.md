  So this has been in my reading list for a bit, where I frequently passed it over for other works because of the cover. By which I judged it, yes. Anyway, this story is very, very good. It tells two stories, one of the main character’s rise to power and inevitable fall, and then another where he starts to build up from almost nothing once more. The really interesting parts though, at least for this subreddit, are the experiment logs every few chapters, which pose such questions as: given the ability to reduce any substance to the components that you personally find valuable, how do you best use it in your goal to kill an immortal, nearly unkillable king and master of dark magic?

  This story updates at a ridiculous rate, but it does have some flaws. The author doesn’t seem to know the difference between “it’s” and the possessive “its” which really annoyed me, and has a tendency to break dialogue up into several paragraphs for no good reason.

  That said, this gets my mark of approval.

      Not completed. Contains 94 chapters, with one more every day. Was updated literally just now.

    I keep seeing it in the featured column but haven't had a chance to read it yet.  I might start on it this weekend.

    I'm usually the guy who wouldnt touch MLP with a 10 meter pole if you paid me a million bucks to do so but your description intrigued me. Hopefully it isn't as bad as I fear it may be.
