  Related: does anyone have a list of movies and television shows that got the science right and didn't include magic? _Firefly_, for instance, has some handwavy ultra-cheap space ship propulsion that makes it economically viable to transport cows between planets that already have livestock, which puts it around the One Big Lie mark, but then [Serenity](#s "it adds in River's abilities, which would require all humans to have empathic radio broadcasters, certain planets to be covered in recording devices that record and repeat major emotion spikes forever, and River to have the only receiver in the 'verse. (And then using that for targeting for her preternatural firearm abilities seems kind of trivial.)").

    During the 2012 Maya doomsday hype [NASA had some kind of conference where they made a list of the most plausible (and implausible) films.](http://news.moviefone.com/2011/01/03/nasa-names-most-realistic-and-unrealistic-sci-fi-films-of-all-ti/?_r=true) Here's their list:

    1. Gattaca (1997)
    2. Contact (1997)
    3. Metropolis (1927)
    4. The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951)
    5. Woman In The Moon (1929)
    6. The Thing From Another World (1951)
    7. Jurassic Park (1993)

    It's was relevant to the 2012 hype because the movie '2012' was the most unrealistic movie according to them. Here's a list of the most unrealistic ones:

    1. 2012 (2009)
    2. The Core (2003)
    3. Armageddon (1998)
    4. Volcano (1997)
    5. Chain Reaction (1996)
    6. The 6th Day (2000)
    7. What the #$*! Do We Know? (2004)
    ```
