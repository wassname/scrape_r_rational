- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  I like the culture/structure of this Evil society a lot.  More, I think, than I did when it was seen by Catherine on the outside looking in.
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    I agree. I really enjoyed Akua's insights into the broad picture; especially how they contrasted with, and built upon, the views that we'd already seen from both Catherine and Malicia.

    Also, Akua now confirmed with a new name -- Diabolist!
    ```
