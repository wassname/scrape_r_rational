## [Q]What is your flair and why did you pick it?

### Post:

This isn't strictly related to rational fiction, but I'm constantly wondering about people's flairs and this would be the easiest way to find out what they mean.

  My flair is based on Anathem, by Neal Stephenson (which probably barely misses the mark for being rationalist fiction). In the universe of Anathem, the people who do science live secluded in buildings resembling monasteries (called concents). The important monk-scientists are called Saunts (similar to religious Saints) and the really important ones have concents named after them. I picked this particular concent because I didn't feel like picking the one the main character is from or the one that studies combat and warfare.

  I chose to represent Anathem because Neil Stephenson is probably my favorite author and Anathem is one of those books where you want to live inside its universe. The idea of being grouped together with a bunch of people who are really interested in knowing more things and being intelligent was really appealing when I read it. (It still is, but things got better after reading HPMOR.)

    Similarly, the Procians are a school of thought in the Anathem universe. The prime ideological conflict in the book is the Procian vs Halikaarnian split, which basically boils down to whether you believe that platonic objects/concepts "exist" or not (for an underspecified definition of the word "exist").

    The Procians get rather (unfairly, in my mind) vilified in the book, and portrayed as less interested in truth and more interested in the appearance of truth (which, pretty funnily, makes them better ambassadors to the world outside the concents :P). 

    So if I had to pick my position here, I'd probably have to _lean_ towards not seeing the necessity of platonic forms to exist - they're collections of structure that we stumble upon when trying to make predictions about the world, but the map is not the territory - but this isn't a super strong belief or anything. I pretty much picked my flair pretty just to be contrary :P

    _uh I mean_ - I picked my flair to impress upon everyone the importance of _not_ vilifying ideological opponents. Yea. That's totally it.

  I chose this because it was one of the only ones I recognized, besides the HPMOR and Dune ones, and I have the HPMOR one on that subreddit, and I thought Dune was incredibly overrated. A Gary Stu and illogical prophecies that practically omnipotent MC does a pathetic job of attempting to avert. I really loved the Young Wizards series also, way back when.

  I picked 'The Laundry' because I like the Chtuluesque Laundry Files books, and there wasn't a "Writes Fantasy to Indoctrinate your Children" tag.

    > I like the Chtuluesque Laundry Files books

    That makes two of us. 

    Lovecraftian setting makes math and CompSci sound awesome yet terrifying, and they indeed are awesome yet terrifying. Also, real-world references, existential horror, great opportunity for in-jokes and fragile world on the brink of tentacled doom from alien dimension which no human brain is able to comprehend.

  ~~The Culture~~ Aspiring polite hegemonizing swarm, because while Banks missed it, every trans-humanist's ambition should be to survive long enough to become something at the level of a culture **mind**.   (If you've not read banks the polite is the difference between foglets and aggressive hegemonizing swarms aka grey goo)

  The one published author who I've seen catch a glancing blow on the objective, was DKM with *the beast* a AI extension the protagonist had in *AI war*.

  ~~To show my Reddit ignorance, how do you customize flair?~~

    I like culture ship naming convention more then our current naming conventions. They are a lot better in a world with the internet. Like correct horse battery staple.

    "with dread but cautious optimism" is what I decided on.

        It's notable, for CS geeks like most of us, that in the culture ships have interesting names, and people's names double as addresses.

  I made the Discworld post for this subreddit, and am currently marathoning through the series again. I have read more than 30 books in the series more than once, mostly four or more times. The few I haven't are the most recent few (Unseen Academicals onwards).

  Even then, it was a tossup between this and a Culture ship name. Iain Banks has the best names for anything in the Culture's ships - see [the wikipedia list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spacecraft_in_the_Culture_series) for the complete list. I almost tried to make a 'best of' list of names, but stopped and deleted it when it hit more than 10 entries - seriously, those names are amazing.

  My flair is based on the title I acquired after posting [Quantifying Magical Outputs](/http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/13o8ik/quantifying_magical_outputs_using_star_wars_and/) and [Determining the Mechanisms Behind Apparation, Time-Travel, and Transfiguration](/http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/13okoq/determining_the_mechanisms_behind_apparation/) in the same day. They were some of my early posts on reddit, just when I was starting out, so I really put my all into each of them but wasn't really sure exactly how they might be received.  So when I saw that not only were my postings well received but Yudkowsky [commented](/http://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/13okoq/determining_the_mechanisms_behind_apparation/c76e83s) approving on one of them *and* I had acquired this new title in recognition of my efforts.  

  I had never looked into "flair" besides choosing to join Dragon Army and hadn't really looked any further than that.  Even after I learned how to make custom flair, granting me a near infinite number of possibilities [[CITATION NEEDED](/http://xkcd.com/285/)], I could not help but retain it.  That title now fundamentally represented my ability to attain things with a skill and quality that distinguished me from the people around me.

  And I freaking *loved* that.

  So that is while never really got around to choosing flair all that much, that is the reason I have seen fit to retain and reiterate it and plan on doing so now and into the future.
