  This is lots of fun so far. Only complaint would be how Hermoine's total ignorance of her classmates' expectations seems a bit forced - her emotional intelligence is also sometimes quite high, and I'd rather it was just pinned down at a little below normal.
  ```

  - u/turbinicarpus:

    I had a similar sense.

    My headcanon about the early-canon Hermione is that she was unaware that she was antagonizing people with her behavior: the reason she broke down when Ron called her a "nightmare" was that she had thought that she and Harry and Ron were, after all their shared experiences, friends. Suddenly, she discovers that she's been antagonizing them all along, and she doesn't quite understand what's wrong with her and how to fix it. *That's* why she spent the afternoon crying, not because she is particularly fragile nor because Ron is a bully.

    In this fic, she *can* tell that some of her classmates resent her help (but does it anyway), and she understands and interprets her classmates' (both Ravenclaws' and Slytherins') reactions when she covers up her notes, and games out the possibilities. (For example, she asks herself how they might react if she tells them that it's the teacher's orders.) That already makes her more emotionally intelligent than her canon counterpart, IMO.

    In canon she seemed to have average to a little above emotional intelligence.

  [](#s ""An example," the Professor continued, accustomed to this reaction. "A fellow student during my own time attending Hogwarts attempted to - outside of class - Transfigure a pair of rocks into earrings for herself, that glowed with blue light. Some of you might be concerned about what happened to her earlobes when the Transfiguration wore off-" several female students winced, "but Untransfiguration is accommodating. That is to say, a Transfiguration itself, when properly reverted, will generally not cause harm or changes to other things as a result. So in that sense, her attempt seemed both innocent and successful. It was not." The Professor paused for effect. "The next day, most of her hair had fallen out. The day after that, she fell deathly ill. It was clear she'd been cursed or poisoned somehow, but even after it was known to be the result of proximity to a flawed Transfiguration, no remedy attempted could halt the progress of her condition. A boy she'd...spent some time with grew similarly ill. She died after lingering quite painfully for another two days, though the boy eventually recovered. To this day, we still do not understand precisely what happened." She let this sink in, then leaned forward, and her voice gained intensity.")

  [](#s "Kind of obvious what it is. Interesting inclusion to the story.")
  ```

  - u/Kodix:
    ```
    Yeah, I thought that was a really neat thing to include. Particularly since there really *was* a time when a muggleborn student might've thought to do that.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Wait, where did she *get* irradiated/radiating rocks?
    ```

    - u/daydev:
      ```
      She transfigured them. Presumably, Moira knew about glowing radium paint, but it was at the time when the dangers of radiation were badly understood. The text even mentions infamous watch dials.
      ```

- u/OffColorCommentary:
  ```
  This is a lot of fun, I'm looking forward to more updates.

  I know it was intentional on the author's part, so this isn't a criticism of the work itself, but Hermione's attempt to explain radioactivity was cringe-worthingly bad.  There are rocks that glow and make you very sick if you spend too long near them.  The reason they make you sick is very different from any usual reason, so there was a long gap between knowing about the rocks and knowing that they were dangerous.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    You could even get a little closer to the truth:

    "There are rocks which give off a harmful radiation.  Radiation, in this context, refers to a kind of light that is similar to but different from heat -- it's invisible, and you can't feel it.  Radiation is harmful to humans."
    ```

    - u/OffColorCommentary:
      ```
      That's pretty good too.  My original take on it was going to actually explain some of the science, but I realized that it wasn't necessary to convey the meaning.

      "Muggles have discovered that matter is made of tiny building blocks we call atoms.  There are about 100 types of atoms, which we call elements.  The higher-numbered elements are generally much rarer, and many of them are unstable.  The unstable ones gradually fling away pieces of themselves; gradually but still violently.  Some of those pieces are safe and look like glowing, and others are invisible and really dangerous if they hit humans."
      ```

  - u/MadScientist14159:
    ```
    At least seeing that it was hard to put in 16th Century terms got Minerva to take it seriously.
    ```

- u/Kiroto:
  ```
  Sooo. 

  About that [door riddle](#s "A man leaves his first son 11 knuts, his second 8 knuts, and his third 10 knuts. What was the man's profession?")...   Anyone figure it out? I've got nothing, save to call him a 'knutter.'

      [](#s "Well that's annoying. Apparently 'riddle' means 'pun'. Here's my riddle: which would win in a race, a car or a ball of glue? The glue, because cars have different speeds but a ball of glue is stuck fast.")
      ```

    - u/daydev:
      ```
      Or maybe [](#s "Death"), and the sons are [](#s "Peverell brothers")?
      ```

    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      I'm not sure about this, since Hermione thinks she heard something similar in the Muggle world. I wouldn't be surprised if it were the real answer, but I would be disappointed.
      ```

      - u/Zephyr1011:

        [](#s "The author has confirmed that it is the correct answer. They compared it to another riddle, which seems likely to be as follows, and exists in the muggle world:
        A man gave one son 10 cents and another son was given 15 cents. What time is it?")

        [Answer](#s "1:45, since a quarter to two, ie. a quarter in total was given to two people")

          *flips table*
          ```

        - u/RMcD94:
          ```
          Goddamn I hate those kind of riddles.
          ```

  - u/daydev:
    ```
    The narrative suggests that actual quantities are important, but I don't see a way to transition from quantities to profession other than through pun.

    But I got nothing, the best I could think of was 'leven-ate-ten' -> Ob-livin-a-tor, but that's extremely tenuous.
    ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    If we take it literally, [](#s "that all the father has is 29 knuts"), perhaps the answer is [](#s "beggar").
    ```

- u/FeepingCreature:
  ```
  :puppy eyes: More? Please?
  ```

  - u/turbinicarpus:
    ```
    Put those back in the jar before you damage them!

    But, I agree with the sentiment. Frankly, I've always thought about HPMOR that if you want a rational! protagonist in the HPverse, Harry requires a near-complete rewrite of his personality and natural talents, whereas Hermione requires but a few tweaks. (I do understand why LessWrong went with Harry. He had didactic goals that took priority over everything else, and the audience for Harry as the lead will always be bigger than the audience for Hermione as the lead, at least outside stories that are primarily romance.)

    ```
    I'm working on it, honest!

  Lovely moments which make me smile.
