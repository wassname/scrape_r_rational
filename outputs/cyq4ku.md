## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I've been kinda binging on Royal Road recently and found some decent stories I think this subreddit might enjoy. In a semi-random order:

  [Defiance of the fall](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/24709/defiance-of-the-fall). LitRPG and Wuxia combined into a weird whole. Earth suddenly gets included into a cruel, callous, interplanetary gamelike System that values only strength, usually induced by adversity. Our protagonist lucks into an unusual advantage immediately, but by the very nature of the system said advantage comes with corresponding challenges.

  Fairly well written overall, no major grammatical issues. Characters feel like individuals and have at least some depth to them (in spite of how it might appear at first). A fair amount of enjoyable progression porn that doesn't necessarily feel cheaty or unearned by the protagonist. Author is writing full time and updating daily, with a large backlog of chapters (that's also accessible via patreon).

  [The Gam3](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/1193/the-gam3). LitRPG. Decent writing, but nothing amazing - still better than much of RoyalRoad. The main character is thoroughly flawed and makes a lot of mistakes that are acknowledged as such. All of the characters have alright voices and characterization, but it's not that deep. I found the overall story to be rather engaging in spite of the flaws and frustrations. Is complete and has an ending I found satisfying, although it's blatantly obvious a sequel is intended.

  [Chimera](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20364/chimera). An average modern salaryman was reincarnated as a monster in another world! Except not really. It takes a long while for the human memories in the chimera to really have any effect. For the most part the protagonist has an alien, animalistic mindset that's only slightly influenced by the human memories. Essentially progression porn with no game elements. Sparse updates, but the story's still active.

  [The Power of Formations](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21450/the-power-of-formations). A random peasant happens to be very talented in a branch of magic that's essentially a mix of real-life electrical engineering and software engineering except with magical effects. Lots of references to real compsci concepts, but sadly doesn't really reach anywhere near the real potential of the concept. Definitely don't take the story too seriously, but it's a fairly fun romp. Story seems dead, but the last few chapters are a decent stopping point.

  [The Perks of Immortality](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21623/the-perks-of-immortality). Quite a weird LitRPG with an unusual system. The main character can gain mildly useful perks, but at a very high personal price. Much more subdued progression porn than the usual LitRPG fare. Most of the fun in this one for me was just following the poor, tortured MC finally start succeeding, as well as the overall mystery of the plot. Story updates sparsely, but it's alive. 

  [Metal and Magic](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21323/metal-and-magic). Follows the story of Candle, a noble girl with no magic in a world full of it, and ostracized for it. No game elements, no gamification whatsoever - reads very much like a standard fantasy novel. Good characterization, good writing, interesting worldbuilding. The magic system is not all that exposed as of yet, but the author claims to like hard magic systems and it shows. The main character has some personality flaws, but nothing unexpected from a teenage girl. I found it to be a very enjoyable bildungsroman. Story is very much alive and updates something like two or three times a week.

  [The Law of Averages](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20101/the-law-of-averages). An average salaryman is transported to another world, one with superpowers! Sorta. Another story that focuses more on characterization and plot than any sort of gamification elements, and it's all the better for it. Has some humor and wacky hijinks, but it mostly plays itself straight. Good writing and characterization. Releases once a week.

  [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) in spite of the uninspired name and amateurish cover, actually pretty good (I guess it's second most popular for a reason, huh?). Another "unusually strong alien being slowly joins humanity" story, similar to Chimera. If you like one, you'll probably like the other. Updates twice a month or so.

Is complete and has an ending I found satisfying, although it's blatantly obvious a sequel is intended.

    I disrecommend this, especially on the /r/rational subreddit. The main character doesn't just "make mistakes", he holds the idiot ball in a death grip so tight I actually wondered if the author was attempting to portray a character with serious mental disabilities for a while. It's pretty much the antithesis of the sidebar definition.

    Super Minion on the other hand is very good, and features an AI (with a physical albeit shapeshifting body, not an infomorph) getting free and blending into a superhero setting. I'll be taking a look at Chimera!

    I'd add [Supervillainy and Other Poor Career Choices](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22653/supervillainy-and-other-poor-career-choices/chapter/397913/chapter-fifty-one). It's about a extremely capable engineer in a post apocalyptic world with a *very* Worm-like power system.

  Probably a bit late posting this, seeing as it's technically Tuesday now, but I figure I'll give it a shot and if I don't get anything there's always next time.

  I have a few requests. The first is: What are your favorite dungeon core stories? I've read [Dungeon Engineer](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25361/dungeon-engineer) up to the current chapter and loved it (it's what sparked my interest actually) and I went looking on Royal Road and found [Blue Core](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25082/blue-core) which isn't quite as good but I still thoroughly have enjoyed (be warned, has some (well written, imo) sex scenes). Besides those two though, I've looked around and haven't been able to find anything that is both decent and not dead, so any suggestions you have would be great.

  I'd also like stories that are focused on progression of a society. Civ builders. Focuses on tech and infrastructure and political reform and progress. I don't even know where to start looking for these, and I'm not sure I've ever read one. What I want might not exist, but I figure if any community could point me to something like that, it's you guys.
  ```

    ```
    For the first: [I Woke Up As A Dungeon, Now What?](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-woke-up-as-a-dungeon-now-what-dungeon-worm.620521/) is a crossover with Worm. Taylor from post-canon finds herself controlling a dungeon in a fantasy world. It's the only one of the genre I've ever read, though.

    For the second: [A Hero's War](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2826/a-heros-war) has perhaps the worst title of a story I've ever liked. Characterization of the main character is severely lacking for the first few dozen chapters, but fits with the rest of your requests and eventually does get better in how it tells us about Cato.
    ```

    - u/water125:
      ```
      Thank you very much. I should've expected Worm to do something like that. Now I've just gotta go finally finish Worm so I can read it!

      Edited: A letter
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Oh. Yea, the story contains *major* spoilers for the end of Worm. Definitely finish that first. How far along are you?
        ```

        - u/water125:
          ```
          A long time ago I read up to >!The middle of Echidna rampaging in the city!< but I fell off of it for awhile, probably cuz I skipped Simurgh  arc and therefore didn't have the necessary characterization to appreciate the Travelers. Stupid idea to skip it, but I was desperate for more Taylor.

          More recently I've been reading on and off again. Currently I'm back up to >!Shatterbird being about to scream in like 5 minutes and Taylor needs to run real fast to save her dad!<.

      - u/Lightwavers:

        Both the recommended stories are bad in new and terrible ways. The first one is less awful, since A Hero's War quickly becomes unreadable due to the sheer irrationality of the plot and characters. I recommend trying them both out, but don't get too invested as they get progressively less interesting as they go on.
        ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    I'm surprised no one has suggested Dungeon Keeper Ami to you:
    https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/
    There's several other places to read it if you search but SV seems convenient for multiple chapters.

    It's about Sailor Moon's Ami waking up next to a dungeon heart with a computer watch and progresses from there. Requires no background knowledge, I've never seen the show and I've picked up enough from this fic alone to enjoy it. It features some fun characters, interesting mechanics like munchkinning what dungeons value vs not(cheap electricity, high value of diamonds), and is overall rational if I recall (I haven't read the beginning in forever). It is also has currently progressed to her kind of controlling her own nation and managing large amounts of citizens. 
    It's ongoing but currently updating very slowly.

    Also "Blue Core" Warning: 
    Blue Core features coerced tentacle sex and "breeding" as a core mechanic the protagonist quickly uses. There's some attempts to call it consent but they're not convincing to me. I'd strongly recommend avoiding it unless you're into that, it appears to be a significant part of the dungeon game system.
    ```

    - u/water125:
      ```
      Thanks for the rec. I'll have to check that out. 

      I'm actually caught up to the current chapter of Blue core. The tentacle stuff is fine with me. I can see why you would call out consent problems, and in the real world I agree, but I think most people have lower standards in fiction. I'd probably have more of a problem if I couldn't see in both character's heads and know that they both have the best of intentions.

    You're not late; people usually use this thread until Friday or Saturday.

    You might like [Dungeon Heart](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/10881/dungeon-heart), but it's not complete and not likely to ever be.

    Most dungeon core stories I've read are decidedly average, to the point where they don't stick out in my memory. Some links you may find useful:

    [The Abyssal Dungeon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21045/the-abyssal-dungeon) is great. Usually I have problem reading LitRPG for being too gamey, i.e. status screen and hoards of abilities, but this one fix that by not focusing on the former, and have the former deals with creatures instead of abilities, specifically ocean lifeforms! Instead of a damp and dark cave filled with ghosts & goblins, it's a colorful coral reef filled with seahorses, starfishes, sea snakes, and lots of fishes, most being a magically enhanced version rather than a mundane one. There's also aquatic wyverns, sea serpents, kelpies, etc. And as the dungeon grows deeper, the biome became more varied... oh wait, I didn't realize the "not dead" qualification. Still a good read tho, in case you haven't read it.

    For the other category, [Release That Witch](https://m.wuxiaworld.co/Release-that-Witch/) is a very enjoyable One-Man Industrial Revolution wish-fulfillment. [Maoyuu Maou Yuusha](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/maoyuu-maou-yuusha/) focuses on economy, while [How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom](https://j-novel.club/s/how-a-realist-hero-rebuilt-the-kingdom/) focus on social reforms, both I have some problems with, but they seems to be pretty popular, so it's probably just me. The anime [Log Horizon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon) is also really great.

    If there was a isekai version of Dungeon Engineer with an intellectual protagonist, check out [Second Life as the Sister of a Goddess](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26977/second-life-as-the-sister-of-a-goddess).

    The MC was a 60-something year old fitness instructor before being reincarnated as a non-human (avoiding spoilers) baby. Instead of engineering and terrariums we get neuroscience and developmental biology, along with magic and mythology.

    The story is extremely well written so far, however the pacing is somewhat slow, with occasionally multiple PoVs of the same events. I do think it's slow because I'm comparing it to other isekai stories that skim through early life, and it would be better enjoyed with an open mind.

  How and where do you find new things to read?  

  www.fimfiction.net is an excellent website for fan fiction, with a great rating system, featured system, tags, and a really nice 'also liked' system.  It's biggest caveat is that its currently limited to MLP fiction, though the site's developer has expressed a desire to make a general version of the site.

    Copying from the last time I answered this question:

    Sorting by popular on novelupdates, royalroad, and the various writing forums (sufficient velocity, space battles, etc.).

    Sort by number of reviews on fanfiction.net / fictionpress. If you have authors you like on those sites, I've found some good stuff by going to their personal Favorites page. (This works well on Literotica if you read smut, too).

    Look at recommendation threads in r/hpfanfiction and r/narutofanfiction if you're into those fandoms at all.

    Examples on TV Tropes' pages.

    Find a work you like on Amazon and browse through the "other people bought" suggestions.

    For Netflix/Amazon, there's apps like Flickmetrix.

    It's been a while since I sought out anime, but I used to use Anirec.com which looks like it's now anime-planet and still has a recommendation system. People write out what they think is similar about the recommended series so you have an idea if it's what you're looking for.

    Like anime, I don't read much manga anymore but I've always found the ratings on Baka-Updates to be pretty good ([stats page](https://www.mangaupdates.com/stats.html?period=month12)). Lotta light novel crossovers get rated highly, though.

    People make some good lists on Goodreads, including top picks for genres you're fond of. The sidebar giving recommended "if you liked..." on that site has never been very good for me, though.

    Can be fun to browse r/booksuggestions.
    ```

    - u/meterion:

      I'll specifically endorse the method of finding one story you like, then looking at that author's favorite stories/authors. It's almost always a guaranteed way to find good stories on fanfiction.net, especially underrated gems that are too short or niche to show up on review/favorite count filters. Building up a network of author endorsements and slowly revealing how certain stories get favorited by a lot of authors you like is almost like a game in its own right.

    What do you recommend from MLP stories? I only seen one episode, but  read some very good sci-fi  crossover with MLP and want more, without any genre limitation, but still  story should have some rational type qualities, or be near.   For now my tbr contains   'The Moon's Apprentice', 'Hard Reset' Series and  'Seeking Power'. Sadly i not remember, what I read before.

  I've recommended [World of Prime](https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime) series here before, and I'm reiterating and maybe even re-doubling that rec now that the 5th and final book in the series was  released last month. It was by far my favourite book in a series where every book was better than the last. 

  The series starts as a pretty standard portal uplift fantasy, but it differed just enough from the mean that it kept my interest until it could start setting itself apart with its snappy dialogue, tight plotting, and great, expansive setting. Unlike most of the shitty books in this genre, the story got more interesting the more power the MC got, because the world is written as being nuanced and morally complex place rather than being a simple playground for a power fantasy. 

  The last book blew my mind with the way that the scope and scale just kept getting larger and larger. I remember I checked the progress on the book and I couldn't believe that I was only halfway through, that there was still so much left left after *so many* things had already happened! It kind of vaguely reminds me of the Golden Morning arc in Worm, of the final, ridiculous showdown in Gurren Lagann. Not in content or even tone, just somewhat in the sense of escalation. 

  The caveats are: The covers are hokey and pandering and offtone, particularly the second and fourth books. Try to get past that. The first book has bad pacing, and a very slow first act. The prices for the books are a bit higher than I feel is right for the genre and how long the books have been out. And finally, the fact that it ends so conclusively that it eliminates the possibility of a another story in the setting(this one is both good and bad).
  ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    Posting for balance:

    The first 4 books felt like >!a particularly Republican one-man-industrial-revolution, in a "if we just give everyone enough guns feudalism will sort itself out"!< sort of way. It's rational enough overall to keep you going, and develops just enough balance / nuance by the end of each book to suggest a more complex world and society than first presented; but that just makes the last book feel like that much more of a letdown. Never mind the pacing shift, the tone is all over the place; I mean, seriously, >!kidnapping alternate-Stephen-Hawking so he can fly a nuclear submarine through the sky!<? If anything it just feels like >!the author suddenly got bored of the whole series and wanted to bring it to a swift conclusion, taking the mickey out of anyone who got much invested in it in the process.!<


    TLDR: YMMV

    (edit: for those who, after the end of book 5, liked the setting >!with respect to what the "gods" turn out to be!<, I suggest trying out Trudi Canavan's Age of the Five trilogy, which has consistent pacing and tone throughout. For extreme contrast to the >!feudalism will work itself out if the populace could be armed so they can get rid of the pesky nobles!< thing, try the Strugatski brothers - Prisoners of Power, the Kid from Hell, Hard To be God etc).
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      When I was reading the last book, I kept thinking, "I totally love this, but I could also see how it might feel like a total departure." The alternate Hawking just barely worked for me, it's a little over the top. I'd still second the recommendation of this series pretty heartily. The prose is on point, some great characterization for something like this, and the POV of a fairly reasonable person in consistently overwhelming and escalating circumstances drew me along.
      ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    I just finished the first book and idk if it was worth $10. The whole series is $10 each, that's like $50 for everything. 

    That being said I thought it was kinda fun how the author twisted around D&D 3.5 until it was nearly unrecognizable.

  May i ask for a recommendation for an uplift or industrial revolution style book.
