## [Weekly Challenge] "The Chessmaster"

### Post:

## Last Week

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3e98lr/weekly_challenge_rational_horror/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Rational Horror". /u/JackStargazer is the winner with his story ["The Real You"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3e98lr/weekly_challenge_rational_horror/ctdhyex), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/JackStargazer! (Now is a great time to go to that thread and look at the entries you may have missed, especially the late entrants; contest mode is now disabled.)

##### This Week

The prompt for next week is "The Chessmaster". This is the character with layers upon layers of deception and backup plans for when the backup plans fail. Sometimes, being the chessmaster means sacrificing a few pawns. Other times, it means recognizing which piece is really the king. For more, [see the entry at TVTropes.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster) Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, August 5th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given a week in advance.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Week

Next week's prompt is "Clones, Clones, and Clones!". Whether through literal cloning, time travel shenanigans, or multiplication superpowers, one person (or multiple people) ends up with multiple copies running around - perhaps with divergent goals.

**Next week's thread will go up on 8/5.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

    This is publishable quality!

      That's high praise coming from you E.Y. Thanks! :)

      Also, I have a question. [](#s "Who did you think the Chessmaster(s) of the story was?")

    A great story. (found it through EY's post history, not surprisingly) Thank you so much for writing it! I hope you'll publish this one and many more after it.

    Found one typo, "we can get going Gavin" - comma missing.

    It would've made a fine beginning of a fine novel. Or, rather, as someone Gavin-like might've put it -

    Too bad it probably wouldn't make a novel. The protagonists are too powerful; nothing could ever be a challenge for them. Indeed. Such a pity. Sigh. I could be a good beta-reader for that one, too.

    Ok, that was damned brilliant.  And just a touch sociopathic :-p.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:

      Thanks man! :)
      And I feel to be a proper chess master, at least when it comes to dealing with humans, u have to be at least a little sociopathic. Otherwise you have a board full of kings and anyone could checkmate you

        There's an appropriate quote from *Shinji and Warhammer 40k* about that, actually.  Something like, "So make them your knights, bishops, rooks, and queens!"

    I really enjoyed this! 

    Just to give some constructive criticism, it seems a bit unlikely to me [](#s "that a sufficiently advanced government wouldn't realize that having an agent focused on the hatred of an individual, regardless of that individual's role, would eventually cause complications as there are still distinctions between what would most harm the individual and what the individual loves. Although I suppose a lot of it could also be credited to Lux's inexperience as well. Overall though, a very good read. I liked it a lot.")

    Also, you seem a bit late to the party, what happened?

      I'm not a very fast writer, I'm afraid. ^^'

      I'll concede it's got its flaws.  Some of them are born of the fact that I was trying to recycle the plot of another story of mine into a different sort of setting.
      ```

      - u/Kishoto:
        ```
        Flaws or not, it was still a great read. I only pointed out those flaws because I was trying to contribute. It was pretty damn good, imo.

    I've never really watched Dr Who, but I feel like you did a great job here justifying how he can save the world so often while still appearing so personable and casual.

    That seems to be [a Worm reference](#s "Contessa").
