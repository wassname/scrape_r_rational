## [Q](Dark/Squick/Real Life Consideration warning): Damn. "Parasyte" and abortion.

### Post:

Rational question/thinking out the anime:“Parasyte” situation. 
Background: alien parasites eat a humans head and have"The Thing" like morphing powers, they can only feed on real humans to sustain themselves. They cannot survive without eating humans. A lot of "humans are the real monsters", human life vs animal life, hunter and prey themes. 

Terror Source: In the third episode "Feast" a female alien argues that she is "human" as herself and another alien had sex and she became pregnant with a (normal)human baby.

Horrible horrible logical question: If she could subsist solely by having sex then consuming her baby would you consider her evil? 
I'm really mixed up about this as my knee jerk reaction is yes, shes literally a baby eating monster, but I see this as a contradiction with my views on abortion(pro choice).
Thoughts?

Edit: This situation is assuming that the aliens have an in built unfixable desire/need to consume living human beings, and that they would be willing/able to consume normal food to create those humans.

  wow so much is wrong with that question! first thought was "but that's Matrix-movie termodimamicaly imposible!!" then "that's a mighty small predator niche!" and third "is it wrong I thought all of that before considering the ethics of baby eating?" :P  anyway after that train of thought i remembered the protagonist and his infected sidekick's parasites don't need to eat humans as they (as parasites are wont to do) receive nutrients from the snatched body with one exception in the manga. even if it was the case of some nutrient or whatevs unique from the human body, morgues, cemeteries, and hospital waste bins are more ethical and easier sources. problem is they are alien intelligences with a different morality and are heavily implied to be earth's biocontrol response to human polluting.

    Haha in hindsight I should have realized that I was assuming she would be eating normal food to create the baby, catch-22 there. Hypothetically though, if eating the babies satisfied her in built desire to eat living humans and she ate regular food to create them would you be ok with this?
    Edit: Could it be that they need some sort of human brain biomolecule? This makes their drive to eat heads counterintuitive but could be a reasonable explanation?

      I suppose a disclaimer is in order: I thought the Bad End of Three Worlds Collide was acceptable. As long as the babies could be eaten early enough (Preferably before natural birth), I would be willing to consider a peace. Icky, but then Thai people are like the nicest people I've met, and most of them think it's perfectly fine to poison wild dogs or swerve to hit them with your car for fun.

  Well, pro choice people generally support abortion before the baby has a brain.

  If she eats the baby after it's born, then she's evil.

  If she eats the baby before it's born, I'd be very confused about her anatomy.

    Some mammals can reabsorb fetuses during stressful times (like harsh winters). It's not impossible to eat your unborn baby...

      Can *humans* do that?

        See Vanishing Twin syndrome:
        >Vanishing twin syndrome is when one of a set of twin/multiple fetuses disappears in the uterus during pregnancy. This is the result of a miscarriage of one twin/multiple. The fetal tissue is absorbed by the other twin/multiple, placenta or the mother. This gives the appearance of a “vanishing twin”.

        Plus, you can just eat the stuff that you abort out of your womb. I think your own placenta would count as "human" for these extremely dubious purposes. You could also eat your own period even without pregnancy.
        ```

          Eh, if your own placenta was edible, then there's no reason that the aliens shouldn't be trying to eat individual body parts instead of people as a whole.

          ...What the heck did I just type?

        Not exactly *eating*, but before birth I absorbed my twin (sister, we think) through the side of my left foot - and had to have the residue surgically removed when I was twelve.

        Freaky but true.
