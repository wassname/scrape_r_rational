## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Is it just me, or has the amount of dystopian fiction vastly increased over the past ten/fifteen years? 

  If so, what is a good explanation for this trend?
  ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    Armchair psychologist answer: In rich countries, inequality is increasing and showing absolutely no signs of nearing an equilibrium, leading a sizeable chunk of the population, including lots of people with degrees and the inclination to write, to think about (perceived) mounting injustice on a large scale. The market also responds to readers, and when society seems unfair the prospect of great upsets, like a zombie apocalypse or president Trump, has a lot more draw than when the economy is booming and there's enough hope to go around.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      That is very plausible. In principle, something like this is potentially testable: one can see whether the amount of dystopian fiction increased in past periods when the economy did poorly, or perhaps in past periods when measures of inequality increased.
      ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Are you sure that this is true? Depending on your age, job, lifestyle, or some other factors, it might be that you've started reading more books over the last five or so years. When someone starts reading more books, certain types of previously unnoticed books turn out to be more common than you thought and only when you search for the books does the actual quantity becomes obvious.

    It might also be because of books like the *Hunger Games* and other writers are futilely trying to cash in on the popularity.
    ```

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    Well, for one thing the amount of every type of fiction has vastly increased over the past ten/fifteen years. In other words the pie is bigger, therefore every slice is bigger. How sure are you that the percentage of dystopian fiction has also grown when compared to the total amount of fiction?

  Just found a cool and morbid app called "how many saturdays."
  The basic idea is that it figures out, statistically speaking, how long you'll live, and then gives alternative measurements for the time. 
  There is something profoundly disturbing about watching the number of lightning strikes until your "death" go down that quickly.

    I just came back from the movie and couldn't get all the nonsense out of my head, so I ended up writing [this](http://pastebin.com/ukQ752Y7). If you like nitpicking dumb movies to death, you're in luck. 

    (SPOILERS, obviously.)

    Edit: [Mother Jones](http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2016/03/batman-v-superman-but-its-actually-glengarry-glen-ross-and-they-fight-over-the-good-leads) wonderfully summarized what I tried to detail:

    > It is incomprehensible! Nothing makes any sense! We all understand that plots in these movies don't make sense. Of course they don't. That's standard. But in this movie nothing makes sense *on a scene level*. In a lot of movies that make no sense on a plot level, the person will say, "I am going to rob this fruit store," and you can quibble about why a person would rob a fruit store, but the characters in the movie accept it and go about robbing the fruit store and we go along with it. They have conviction and authenticity and they really try to rob that fruit store good, even if we in the audience think they are being ridiculous for robbing a fruit store, because when it really works, it doesn't matter. In *Batman v Superman* the characters say, "I am going to rob this fruit store," and then go into the fruit store, throw fruit in the air, paint the walls with fruit, pay for the fruit, use the fruit as puppets in improv comedy, have a dance party with the fruit, build a home in the fruit store, burn the fruit store down, exit the smoldering husk of the fruit store and announce, "I robbed the vegetable store."
    ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Take a drink every time something about a scene doesn't make sense. Bring several bottles.

    Seriously, pick one character, *any* character, and pay attention to what they're actually doing. Their motivations and decisions are a maelstrom of nonsense.
    ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    Spoilers for the entire movie.

    The characters were dumb, the plot was dumb, and the choices for what to include and what to exclude were dumb.

    Batman is "the greatest detective in the world" and he didn't do a database/google search for "White Portuguese" when he hears it? (Also, he just does a search for that text string, instead of a white person from Portugal when he gets the files.)  Also, encryption doesn't work like that.  He would be lucky to get 1% of the way to cracking commercial grade encryption in a year, never mind breaking it overnight. Also, also, what was with that bug thing?  Was it just jam-packed with micro-SD cards, so that he copied *all* of lexcorp's files onto it?  Lastly, the random prophetic dreams were dumb, both that they existed in the movie, and that he completely believed them with no more evidence.  Wait, one more: He put the spear far away from the prepared fight zone, and *luckily* the fight ended up there just at the right dramatic moment.

    Superman was dumb.  After the massacre at the start, he never told anyone that he didn't do it, and that they were killed by bullets.  He didn't stick around after the senate explosion to clear his name either.  When Lex tried to force him to kill Batman, he decided to recruit him instead (which is good).  The first thing he did upon *meeting* Batman is shove him across the roof, and he didn't even mention any plan to recruit Batman to him until he was almost dead.

    Wonder Woman shouldn't have been in the movie, she was completely pointless.  STEALING A COMPUTER FILE DOES NOT DELETE IT!  Why didn't *she* use the spear, instead of the person it was specifically designed to kill?

  Why don't any Naruto stories include (or even mention in passing) the characters actual strength training?

  Ever since starting working out and reading about how humans get stronger, it's been bothering me that all of the physical training described is basically just running and basic exercises. Any ninja village should generally be producing Olympian-level gymnasts. They should train like our own gymnasts, in addition to all the other ninja skills, not do push ups, pull ups, and sit ups for their whole lives. 

  **TL;DR: All ninjas should train like Gai and Lee to be any stronger than the general population, but no one does.**

    > Why don't any Naruto stories include (or even mention in passing) the characters actual strength training?

    Probably a combination of three things:

    1. The kind of people who write fanfiction aren't the kind of people who tend to be athletes, so they don't know about these types of strength training.
    2. Strength training is a lot less interesting to write (and read) about than kewl jutsu and sparring.
    3. Ninja Magic.
    ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    Just by practicing martial arts can one become stong; if you need to suspend disbelief, assume that most ninja become stronger through rigorous taijutsu training.

    If you're going to go down the rabbit hole of real ninja training, then they should have academy classes on learning to walk like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LHzj3MosKs&feature=youtu.be&t=112).

  *What are your favorite blatantly-agenda-pushing books?*

  I've enjoyed reading many propaganda pieces. *[Atlas Shrugged](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/662)* (objectivism) and *[The Jungle](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/140)* (socialism) are two of my favorite stories (I've read the latter on four separate occasions, IIRC), and I also greatly enjoyed *[The Fountainhead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2122)* (objectivism), *[The Iron Heel](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1164)* (socialism), *[The Shape of Things to Come](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29966)* (socialism), *[Black Beauty](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/271)* (animal rights), and (of course) *[HPMoR](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108)* (rationality). I just finished reading *[The Profits of Religion](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/16470)* (socialism), and liked it a fair amount.  
  (I probably should get around to looking up some fun religious or reactionary texts...)

  ---

  On a related note, Project Gutenberg has [a nice archive](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5050) of past State of the Union Addresses made by Presidents of the United States. They're surprisingly interesting to read. For example, at the close of 1859, Buchanan spoke, not only about slavery (including [the possible purchase of Cuba from Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostend_Manifesto)), but also on a possible military restoration of order to [chaotic Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_War) and [an Opium War treaty with China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tientsin), among other items. Likewise, Theodore Roosevelt's first address in 1901 started with a panegyric to his [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_William_McKinley) predecessor and an assertion that "anarchistic speeches, writings, and meetings are essentially seditious and treasonable", before moving on to discussion of [trust-busting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Trust_busting) and how immigration standards should be tightened (including a reinstatement of [the Chinese Exclusion Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act)) to keep out people "below a certain standard of economic fitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with American labor"--i.e., willing to work for too-low wages.

  Also, a lot of the older language takes two or three attempts for a modern reader to understand! A mind-melting sample from Washington:

  > Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I saw with peculiar pleasure at the close of the last session the resolution entered into by you expressive of your opinion that an adequate provision for the support of the public credit is a matter of high importance to the national honor and prosperity.

    I found The Fountainhead very enjoyable and pretty seductive back in college. I made several facebook posts that in hindsight are slightly cringeworthy. It also made me read Atlas Shrugged, which swung me back further left than I started to being a left edge social democrat. I strongly recommend people read them in that order, since Atlas Shrugged is very easy to put down if you didn't just finish the much more reasonable sounding The Fountainhead.

    *Starship Troopers*, recommended if you want to pass the ideological Turing test for military authoritarianism (or if you just want good military scifi).

    (I have not watched the much more popular movie it inspired. I'm told it's a parody/criticism of that ideology, which honestly doesn't sit well with me even though I don't share it. "We'll take the good bits of your work and use them to write propaganda against your ideals.")

  It was very gratifying that so many people from here played through my [MYC/CYOA](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4augy6/c_i_finished_making_that_cyoa/), and I thank you for it. Some of the feedback made me rethink a few details about the book world and not just the MYC. It was also a big relief that /r/rational, for all that half the characters were geared toward world domination, did not on a cursory readthrough identify (what was meant to be) the most cheatingly broken power combination. Since the books will dole out the mechanics of magic much more slowly and interspersed with misinformation than the MYC, I take that as a good sign that one of the central mysteries of the books will not be *too* obvious.

    Use Lasting Copy on a slave, so that their soul is ruled by your own mind and will. Then have that slave sacrifice their soul in the Tower of Souls for an instant of power. Repeat indefinably until you rule the world. Ta-da, you win!

    Is that the cheatingly broken power combination?
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      Nah. Anyone sacrificed to the tower is sacrificed after the full ensemble of Black master mind readers have had their turn with them, and time magic is employed to make sure they can be killed for as long as possible during the fast ascent to 'maximum power'.

      I realize that every single power can be analyzed more fully than the description provided in the MYC, but on the whole more info is provided there than for any power shown in the book world. As with HPMOR, I'm sure all the main points will be speculated upon for the book world (If I can gather the readers), but my 'bragging' is really just relief that it's not *too* obvious. The first book is about non-magicians finding Evil Hogwartz/Moria capitol. The second is Harry Potter & Company exploring Moria & Hitler Socrates Dystopia and finding the Tower. Book three is largely written and is about the rest of the (Dark age) world realizing someone found future tech. Books 4-9 is Wheel of Timey. Book 10 will be my own, probably inferior, Silmarillion & Memory of Light meltdown + hopefully rationalist apocalypse.

  Pretty tiring week. Got disappointed with the ending of Boku dake ga inai machi / Erased which I had recommended on this sub. I'm thinking of what decisions the protagonist could have done to turn it into a rational fic.

  Also think about what would be a good condition to stop traveling back. I'm thinking that if I had Revival I would try to trigger it consciously but end up traveling back again and again trying to get even better outcomes. I'm not sure at which point it would stop being a blessing and turn into a curse ala Groundhog Day.

  On a professional note, I'm stuck on how to encode data on a spiking neural network. I understand that they're encoded by the time of spike but still I'm not sure how to decide what's the time window to evaluate or if its continuous. There isn't much about spiking neurons from what I've seen. My current goal is to model a simple AND gate using integrate and fire.

  Also had fun with the Tay bot. Made one for myself and currently learning NLP to try and improve upon its responses. That and the A Third Option fic will probably take some time until I make my research on the material.

  Also see a lot of good fics posted in here but find it difficult to browse them. Are they being indexed or posted in some other rational site? And any good rational fantasy fics you would recommend?

  Question to all you writers: 

  How do you *do* it? Not the writing process, but the actual act of putting your work up on the internet for everyone to see? I guess this also applies to anyone who puts anything they made up.

  I recently put up around 8k of "fanfiction" for an internet forum quest I'm part of. My hands were shaking when I hit the submit buttom. Would they like it? Would they hate it? Why? Which parts? Were the parts I liked the good or bad ones? Should I have proofread it more? What if the only comment I get on it is a request for a spellcheck?  

  Sometimes I wonder why I even put myself through this. Then I remember my previous fanfic, only 4k words, that got around 50 likes (which isn't bad for that forum). Honestly, that one was trash, and I wish I could delete it, but I feel like I would be disappointing everyone who liked it. 

  Also the fact that we get inquest bonuses for each omake we do.
  ```

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    Well it started out because I was having fun writing things, and if I'm going to have fun writing things, I might as well also enjoy having the largely positive experience of internet feedback. I'm always up for a good debate, and having a dedicated readerbase to have that debate with is quite nice. Also, if I write something and keep it to myself, then that's one person who has had a positive experience. If I write something and post it then that's (by my current best estimation) a few thousand people having a positive experience, which is better. 

    Also I get to roll around on a big pile of likes and follows like some kind of literary dragon. As things progress though I'm starting to have expectations of myself, which is leading to a reduction in writing quantity and a reduction in growth of quality. If only they were so easy to banish.
    ```

    - u/Cariyaga:
      ```
      For what it's worth, good sir, this individual quite appreciates your work and has since you first started work on RtDoF, so don't worry too much about quality -- you've improved a lot since then, but even at the start of it, it was quite enjoyable to read.
      ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    For me, personally, I find the feedback (mostly in review form on FF.net or comment replies on reddit) to be sort of like cocaine. After any new post/chapter, I'll almost obsessively check said sites and my email for comments and drink in any and all feedback like a hit of the good old nose candy.

    In hindsight, that seems completely unhealthy. Don't be like me. -_- 

    In all seriousness, it's just part of the fun. You have to enjoy writing at least a bit JUST for writing's sake, but putting your work out there and hearing what people think about it adds a whole new dimension to it all, and it helps you improve as a writer. As an example of something I learned via feedback from the public, I overuse commas. Like by a ridiculous amount. But it's something I never really noticed while writing or proof reading. But, now that I've had it pointed out to me, I take steps to avoid it. 

    So yea, idk. I think it's sort of nerve wracking to put yourself out there, but the rewards seem to be worth it generally. (Although, obviously, YMMV depending on a variety of factors such as your target audience, the fandom/genre you're writing in, etc.)
    ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    If, once finished with editing and proofreading, you're dealing with unrealistic hopes that war with self-criticism that shouts, "Worthless shite!" at odd intervals, take a look at your past stuff until either your expectations become more realistic, or your emotions calm enough for you to comfortably think, "It's not worthless, but it's not good either.  Good enough that it won't get much better at my current level of skill and with the amount of time I'm willing to put into it."  The former condition is healthier, but the latter can serve as a stepping stone.  You'll still feel nervous once you see a reply, but with experience that will fade.  Doing a [research](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+receive+constructive+criticism) spree might also help.
    ```

  - u/TaoGaming:
    ```
    I write when the ideas flow. You do need some thick skin, in particular just accept that most people won't comment and may not even thumb up /like the work.  Most reviews are "I liked the first X chapters but this detail was stupid."

    The tension is that if you feed off the good reviews the bad ones will stick in your craw. 

    Still, I recommend you just do it and see if you like it. 

    Even if I never write again, the knowledge that I cranked out a long story in a short time (even if I accept all the criticism ) is nice.
    ```
