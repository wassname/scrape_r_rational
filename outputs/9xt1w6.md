  Oh hey, I forgot about this one. I wonder how far it's gotten since I stopped reading.

  Oh, it's dead. Well fuck.
  ```

    ```
    It's dead, Jim.
    ```

    - u/LMeire:
      ```
      Why did you tag it "Work in Progress" if there's clearly no work being done?
      ```

      - u/erwgv3g34:
        ```
        Because there's no tag for "Dead", and tagging it "Complete" would have been a blatant lie.
        ```

          Petition to make [DEAD] a tag?
          ```

            I don't think that we need one. That said, a [DEAD] tag would be clear enough if someone wanted to include it in their post. Tags aren't really regulated. (I don't think that it's common enough to for us to put it in the sidebar, especially because people rarely post abandoned works.)

            That would kinda be unnecessarily unappealing imo. Why put off new readers?
            ```

              If you are maximizing for number of readers, then sure. If you are maximizing for enjoyment then I think its better to let people know in advance so they can decide for themselves how upset they are going to be if the story stops at an incongruous point.
              ```

                Perhaps something like Discontinued then.  The poster can always say it  advance after posting. A lot of really great rational fics haven't been completed, it's sad to think that I might not have gotten to know them in the first place if I saw the Dead tag and decided it isn't worth my time to invest on. And who knows, seeing an influx of interest the creator might even get set out on continuing the story again. I feel it is detrimental overall to discourage people from possibly reading something they might love.
                ```

                  ```
                  Maybe [DIS] for discontinued to keep consistency with the previous tags?
                  ```

          I don’t mean to be rude; I’m genuinely curious:

          Why post it?
          ```

            I enjoyed this fanfic a lot, and I recently came across it again. It hasn't been posted in 4 years, and the sub was a lot smaller back then, so I decided to repost it. That's all there is to it.
            ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          Huh? I've always had to manually write the tags in as part of the title. Couldn't you just type \[DEAD\] or something like that?

          I've even typed in \[Comedy\] when I posted about a joke challenge '\[Comedy\] Piss off /r/rational in on sentence. Go!'
          ```

- u/Timewinders:
  ```
  I actually posted this link here 4 years ago when this sub was still pretty new. I don't think it's updated since then though unfortunately.

  ```
  Was awesome but it's sadly abandoned.
