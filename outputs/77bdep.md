## [Biweekly Challenge] Slasher Movies

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/749k9r/biweekly_challenge_scp/), the prompt was "SCP". Our winner is /u/vi_fi, with their story, ["Uncanny Abyss"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/749k9r/biweekly_challenge_scp/dnwk8w9/). Congratulations to /u/vi_fi for their fourth win in a row, which leaves one win more for to join the illustrious club of the super winners!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be **Slasher Movies**. The general formula for a slasher is that there's a nigh-unstoppable menace, or perhaps just a psychopath, who goes around murdering either teenagers or young adults one-by-one. Classics include the Nightmare on Elm Street series, the Friday the 13th series, and the Halloween series. Deconstructions include the Scream series (less so in the later installments) and to some extent Cabin in the Woods (though that one was more horror in general). Feel free to go in whatever direction you'd like with the prompt, but let us know if you're using an established universe, unless it's important to the story that we don't know. Remember that prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, November 1st.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be **Worm**. [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) is a completed superhero web serial by Wildbow; I would expect spoilers in the challenge, and maybe avoid it if you care about those. Worm fanfiction is quite popular, and the work itself is very popular within this community, so hopefully that won't be a very large barrier to entry. As always, prompts are to inspire, not to limit, so if you want to write your story about some obscure side character, an original character within the world, or even outside the canon of the serial, feel free to do that. This challenge is at least partly due to the start of sequel to Worm, due soon.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 11/1.** Please private message me with any questions or comments. The companion thread for recommendations, ideas, or general chit-chat [is available here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77biwk/challenge_companion_slasher_movies/).

    Interesting.  From the timing (Edit:  and how well [](#s "their violent actions flowed together")), I'm assuming that [](#s "Ai was the original source of the computer doom.  I'm fairly curious about whether Ai or the narrator was the original 'seed' (of insanity), or whether both were acting as puppets by a third party.  If Ai or a third party, the narrator presumably selected ahead-of-time according to suitability.  If the narrator, maybe deliberate retooling of Ai during a state of insanity, or maybe a gradual transference/transmission/contagion of subconscious insanity to her, potentially prompting self-modification later.  Or incomplete self-modification in reaction to his actions/mental state...  either way, I'm setting my headcanon to having every one of those remembered 42 instances of 'profit' as actually being another settlement wiped out and looted!  Whee!").

      That's some interesting speculation.

      > [ ](#s "Ai was the original source of the computer doom")

      This would necessitate Ai communicating with the asteroid quite some time before the protagonist reaches it, as it is silent when they arrive. Of course, transmitting at light speed would enable that...

      > [](#s "I'm fairly curious which of them was the original seed")

      Whoopsie. Originally, I intended for [](#s "Dave's and Ai's issues") to be quite separate ([](#s "remember also that Ai's issues are heavily hinted to be alien in origin, while Dave is just mundanely bio-engineered")). I mean, given your theory as stated above, it would make sense for both to be related, and I generally think it elegant if all themes of a story spring from a single idea, especially in the case of short stories...

      ... I'm never quite sure whether to be happy or sad when a reader's headcanon is better than canon.

      > [](#s "instances of 'profit'")

      Not sure about that one. The prediction Dave makes is rather small in scale, and "profit" from a single prediction would therefore often be something far, far smaller than [](#s "an entire settlement being wiped out.")

      Thank you for sharing your thoughts! That gave me some much-needed motivation to go back to writing *Worm* fanfics for the next challenge...

        Thank you for your feedback on my thoughts!

        [](#s "'quite some time':  Checking, the can't-trust-the-computers person doesn't mention how recently it happened, let alone that 'an indeterminate time' had passed before then.  We know that the central computer is dead by the time that the narrator arrives inside, but all that we know before that is that Ai says it's dark (not responding to signals) which could easily either be 'someone using an non-automated radio to constantly manually send out frantic distress signals, but I'm not aware of them at all', and/or (my preference) 'I'm opening communications and infecting their systems with the kill-virus now... (and not telling you)'.  --To rephrase, there's no mention of visual indication of strangeness before landing, and he only has Ai's word for it that it's truly silent when they arrive.")

        The [](#s "'profit'") matter doesn't have anything else backing it up, just that I enjoy imagining it that way.  I suppose [](#s "it hooks into my Ai-origin imagining in that if they're doing this at all (concerted), this probably isn't the first time, and it would be odd for them to be spending so much time on other things, rather than going straight towards a base from day 1, then from base to base (with the narrator under the delusion of doing a normal humans-largely-uninvolved job) (Ah, though it's entirely possible they did a normal job at first, before switching their main pattern after Ai got turned weird unconsciously or intentionally)").

        I'm happy that my thoughts were thought-provoking!

        I had assumed the silence was another lie/detection failure by the AI. Totally plausible that it communicated with them and was totally aware of the situation, but chose not to tell him to engineer its goal. Afterall all his information is seemingly mediated by the AI....
        ```
