## [RT] Super hero story by Eaglejarl

### Post:

Anywho Eaglejarl is writign a rational superhuman story, storms give people superpowers but also can mutate them and any animals or objects they touch.

He is posting chapters on his mailing list. There is catch though, every chapter link last about 2 days and then is deleted, being then only available on Amazon for purchase.

In case you've missed it here are the chapters in unlisted pastebin dumps and his mailing list. Check it every day, I almost missed the second installment.

Part 1

Just to remind chapters are free in 1-2 day period after posting and then it goes on Amazon on sale.

### Comments:

  ```
  This, uh, is kind of a dick move man. The whole reason he's doing it this way is because Amazon has strict rules about having that stuff available elsewhere, and he's a regular here so he wouldn't even be able to argue he hadn't been aware of it.

  You could be putting him in a very awkward legal position.
