  Damn. It's been too long since I last saw this fiction grace our subreddit. Better reread then.

  I read to about chapter 18 before and just re-read the whole thing. This latest chapter feels much higher quality than the earlier chapters. Author, I think youâ€™ve improved over your hiatus! The writing was less flowery and the entire scene felt more lucid as the chapter ties in and builds on previously mentioned plot points instead of introducing new conflicts or time-skipping to the middle of an unrelated scene.
