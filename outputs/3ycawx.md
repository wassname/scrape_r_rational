  If you figure out why the site breaks for you and I can fix it in some straightforward way, let me know.

    It seems it's just my ISP being dumb. 

    Love your work btw, keen to read more.

    I read Sympathy, and a friend and I are curious as to what the ending means. Could you clarify?

    >You aren't, today, but if she bravely restrains one more sniffle of misery -

    >Well, you like being happy, too, don't you?
    ```

      I'm not sure what about it is ambiguous?  The second-person-narrated character is succumbing to temptation.
