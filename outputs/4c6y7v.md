## [BST][Q] How would magic change society?

### Post:

I guess this is kind of the opposite question from one that I saw on this sub a while ago where the op was interested in limiting a stories scope so he didn't get overwhelmed with change. I want to look at what would happen if magic suddenly got introduced to humanity under the following conditions.

* Inherited: not everyone can do magic not even most
* Overpowering: a single mage could comfortably take out an entire nation of non mages
* Better: mages are smarter and faster than there non-mage counterparts.

I think the most important part of this scenario would be the ration of mage's to non-mages. If almost everyone is a mage things would probably be fine. There would be some adjustment as certain parts of our conventional society became no longer necessary and others grew to replace them, but ignoring what might be a violent transitional period everything would end up mostly the same.  On the other end we have a situation where mages number in the 100's in which case we might just end up with them going off somewhere and keeping mostly to their own company. The bad zone in my mind is between 1 and 80 percent of the population as mage's. Here we get violence and quite likely a certain amount of displacement of the current power groups.

  Specify your magic. Teleportation circles and creation of pocket dimensions are going to have different effects than say, giving everyone a death note.

  Even if everyone was a mage, the ones who can mindrape other people into doing their bidding, stop time, and tell the future have huge advantages over the ones who can only fireball or shoot lightning. Old privilege and hierarchy will be completely overthrown by the new order.

  It depends on how homogeneous the magic is.  Are the powers unique to the individual (most superhero settings) are there several sets of powers (Avatar, Mistborn) or else is there only one type of magic (Harry Potter, Ra, and many others)?  

  In the first option, individual mages would become literally irreplaceable in many places.  For example, a weather-controller could produce billions of dollars of economic gain, but also a huge upheaval when they die or retire.  

  The third option is just a special case of the second, where n = 1.  They could become another force in the economy, like plumbers or doctors.  If one fire-mage quits/dies, then you can just get another one to replace them.

  It might be worthwhile to read [Ra](http://qntm.org/ra).

  The introduction to Larry Niven's "Theory and Practice of Teleportation" is also useful.

  This is a problematic requirement. I don't think you'd end up with any kind of surviving civilization if any significant number of people got that kind of power, right off the bat. Each mage would be an existential threat, and even with only a hundred or so the odds of at least one going off the deep end just gets too high. This is the Marvel/DC universe, except without the plot holes that keep the supervillains super-dumb.

  That is essentialy one of the possible routes of technological singularity. Transitional stage would likely  be chaotic, but stable state unpredictable in principle.
