  Feels like the end of the Book. Or at least getting rather close.

    ```
    I have the same impression.

      ```
      I thought there were only 5books planned?
      ```

      - u/thebishop8:
        ```
        That was the original plan, but that got derailed. These threads talk about it a bit more.

          Iâ€™ve been dreading the end of book 5 thinking it was the end, this is a massive relief
          ```

        ```
        i think you are more correct then you realize, "were" is the correct terminology since one book got split in two making the series 6 books rather then 5.
        ```

- u/BaggyOz:
  ```
  Breaking a truce that was traded for seems like a surefire way to open yourself up to a drow shaped Consequence. That seems to be the only unknown unknown the Dead King is dealing with.
  ```

  - u/thebishop8:
    ```
    I don't think he's breaking the truce he made with Cat, I think he's just decided that he isn't going to try signing the Liesse Accords or seek peace with the Grand Alliance.
    ```

        ```
        It wasn't clear, but I got the impression the remainder of the 3 month delay is "the shiver before the blade claims your neck." So he's not breaking the truce.
        ```

      - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
        ```
        I was confused by the wording but I think what it means is this: a truce implies they are a threat, or in some way equal, or can restart a fight they can win. He views the truce not as any of those things, but as a stay of execution.

        So he won't move his forces forward, but when he does he'll steamroll them regardless of what they have planned.
        ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    We already know he doesn't move his armies forward from the chapter where the truce is made. It says so explicitly and in a way that implies they wait exactly 3 months and not a moment more
    ```

- u/cyberdsaiyan:
  ```
  Even now we know not what the Dead King wants. Dominion over all those who live cannot be an objective for the dead king, as along with his advance, heroes against him will inevitably spawn. The more land he takes, the more the story turns against him. He cannot appear invincible, yet if he advances now without Malicia being the light that the story shines on, he will be.

  And so we come to his parting lines. The man who leaves **nothing** for providence to shine through is now taking a risk. A calculated one, but a risk nonetheless. Why now? What chance does he have now that might not come again? And towards what end? Everyone is asking about what the Bard wants, but what does the King of Death want?
  ```

  - u/HPMOR_fan:
    ```
    His main objective seems to be to keep existing, which means foiling the Bard. So he wants to destroy the Bard's ability to manipulate the world into attacking him for as long as possible. That's my take at least.
    ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      That was Catherine's hypothesis before Tyrant's whole trial. Now we know that Bard tried to get the Dead King out and end him with the weapon. DK found out early, and he sued for peace halfway. If his goal is to continue existing, even after the weapon is non functional he would still sue for peace. Because invading more than he has done in his entire history would be the start of a story. A dark story of death ravaging the lands, and the band of heroes emerging from that crucible would be able to end him with the force of the story alone. Hence why he called this a risk. He wants something else.
      ```

      - u/Azzazeal:
        ```
        We have no ideea if the weapon doesn't function. The dead king doesn't sue for peace because we wants to destroy it and not risk it. That's the reason for war the tyrant gave last chapter.
        ```

        - u/cyberdsaiyan:
          ```
          If he wanted to destroy the Weapon, he would never have sued for peace initially. The weapon was a check that the Bard wanted to use to permanently kill him. Now the heroes don't *know* how it will act if they use it, so they will be reluctant to use it.

          I think there's something down south that he wants to get his hands on. Potentially in dominion lands. The hint with the Grey Pilgrim's origin was a blatant one. Previously if he had continued conquering, the Warden of the West would be forced to use this Weapon and that might have killed him. But now that the weapon is sort-of out of commission, he feels that he has some leeway to conquer until the place that he wants to find.
          ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    I think his point is that the Bard missed her one shot st killing him and her plan won't work anymore. 

    As for what he wants,  probably to kill all humans  since he rules  corpses.
    ```

    - u/cyberdsaiyan:
      ```
      > I think his point is that the Bard missed her one shot st killing him and her plan won't work anymore.

      Imagine a villain saying that : "Haha, foolish heroes, your only shot at ending me is gone! This is my victory!"

      What do you think happens next?
      ```

      - u/LordSwedish:
        ```
        On the other hand, leaving once the heroes have lost their main weapon and letting another generation take a swing at it seems equally dumb. The bard just lost her trap, either he waits and lets her make a new one and try again, or he takes the opportunity to try to win.
        ```

        - u/cyberdsaiyan:
          ```
          See, that's the thing. Evil doesn't "Win" in creation. Good Guys Always Win. Black held off the tide that came against Praes for 20 years with his conquest, and yet Callow is no longer under Praesi occupation.

          Catherine is very good at twisting stories, and even when she kept winning, she did have to deal with a lot of losses as well. Also helps that she is no longer named.

          I definitely think that this is a "chance". A potential win for his "Step 1". He can conquer deep enough in order to get something that he wants, potentially from Dominion lands (the hint at Grey Pilgrim origins was also given). The conquest might all be towards that end.
          ```

          - u/LordSwedish:
            ```
            I think there's another rule that's even stronger than "heroes always win" and that's "villains always believe there's some way for them to win" even if their victory condition isn't total domination.

            The Dead King knows that the Bard will always try to kill him and that one day she will succeed if allowed to keep trying. He waits for a perfect moment to counterattack, but if he doesn't take those perfect moments he has resigned himself to lose and die one day, something he is incapable of doing.
            ```

          - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
            ```
            Good doesn't always win. Black thinks that is true, but it isn't actually true.

            Evil has plenty of complete victories. Praes' continued existence is proof of that. As well as duality-led governments overseas.
            ```

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
    ```
    His ultimate goals remain a mystery, though it seems to center around escaping the Gods constraints, but his immediate goal is pretty clear: he wants to remove any potential threat. The Bard's plan failed and the Choir of Judgement is either temporarily or permanently knocked out of the game. Not to mention Malicia needs him more than ever and has convinced half to League to side with her. If he waits, he might never get another set of circumstances so heavily weighed in his favour.

    A new opponent *might* appear, but the current crop is too far below him to be any real threat. And if he waits, he only lets his enemies grow stronger or the Brad to come up with another plan or Judgement comes back in force. And he might become the "ultimate" villain, but between him and Malicia he'll also have killed enough people that there won't be enough people left to oppose him ever again.

    It's a risk, like he said, but a calculated one.
    ```
