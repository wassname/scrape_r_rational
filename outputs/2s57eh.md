  I'm not 100% sure it would be that easy. D&D gods might as well be aliens, at least the ones that did not ascend.

  We literally watched Herrun be intelligently designed in the last book. Standard evolutionary pressures and psychology have no reason to apply.

  Also, this world appears to have greater than 86,400x our current worldwide death flat rate. This means either there are a whole lot more sentient beings in the world overseen by Death, or they die hundreds of thousands of times more often.

    Well, she was pretty much built out of the personalities of everyone who took part in the ritual, so it's not too crazy to think she'd have a reasonably near-human psychology. That said, I don't think it would be that easy to get into a goddess's pants like that. It's still a plausible enough scenario that it didn't break my suspension of disbelief.

      Good point.  Although the **vast** majority of her personality is derived from Loki, who was never mortal.  The number of secrets he donated outmasses all others by multiple orders of magnitude.

      Of course, all gods are built from the stories told by mortals, so it's reasonable to think that they all have at least certain touchstones to human psychology.  I'm not sure that "women dig powerful guys" is one of those touchstones, though.

        She could also be playing one level above him and it was all an act. On second thought, this is the most likely scenario.

    There's a reason for that. Don't worry. It'll be addressed.

    EDIT: While I didn't do the exact math, the death rate DOES seem unusually high, even for stupid world, huh? ;)

    The population density of the underdark might explain it, but I'm guessing this is a did not do the math case.   Either way the chapter was fun.

  Going to start posting it by its title (like so, above).

  This is chapter 2 of the 2YE spinoff I posted a while back.
