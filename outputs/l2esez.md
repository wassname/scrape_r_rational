Pyrebound is a hard high-fantasy serial that's been going for ... crikey, two years now.  I plan to finish in ten more updates, but that's what I thought five updates ago so don't believe me, I'm full of crap.  Anyway, the world is modeled somewhat after the ancient near east, and I delve heavily into the nitty-gritty of worldbuilding in terms of the effects magic and magical disasters would have on economics, politics, culture, and what-have-you.  If this is new to you and sounds interesting, the first update is [right here](https://pyrebound.wordpress.com/2019/01/17/one-a-child-of-the-hearth/).  Thank you!
