## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

    In my current fanfic, as I don't know any japanese beyond the standard weeaboo lexicon, I just choose names of japanese voice actors pretty much at random. In previous stories, I liked to use random name generators even for the main characters.

    If depends on what you're doing, but I find [Behind the Name](http://www.behindthename.com/) to be a fantastic resource, in part because it gives you a crap ton of information about the name and a ton of possible variants. Also, [a random name generator!](http://www.behindthename.com/random/)

  GMing a Pathfinder campaign where all of the PCs are different kinds of magical engineer turns out to be a good way to force yourself to internalize scope. For instance, the scope of how much of various metals exist within a given mountain, when your players have invented mining-snake automatons that can burrow through solid stone faster than a man can sprint and hunt metal by magical scent. Or the scope of the shaped-charge explosion that results from filling a shipping-container-sized extradimensional pit with gunpowder and flying it into a dragon's lair. 

  I'm simultaneously proud of and horrified by my players. I tossed a buffed 12-headed cryohydra at them and they wrecked it in basically a single turn. The five CR 14 Furnace Golems they fought right after didn't fair much better. Golarion is doomed.

      They actually went out of their way to piss off some dwarven ghosts of various sorts - one of them even got possessed for part of that encounter - but they came prepared with ways to give all their weapons Ghost Touch. 

      They're already building megastructure fortifications for their favored cities and prospecting the nearby planets/moons for exotic minerals. 

      I'm going to have to break out the gold dragons with brutal precommitment strategies, Simurgh-grade divination plotters, fractal living spell swarms, <REDACTED, as at least one of my players may read this>, and relative-to-orbital-velocity-reference-frame teleport bombardments at this rate.

        Ah.  See, the real problem with campaigns at this level is that there's no real way to challenge them without simply killing them.  I'd say let them enjoy the full OP absurdity of the campaign, and then see if they'll go for a "gentlemen's agreement" to tone it down for the next one.

        Here's a quick fix: steal their ideas. Have an enemy wizard encounter them, preform some kind of scanning spell, then flee. After an appropriate number of days, he shows up copying whatever tricks they were using at that time.

        No competent magician will miss or fail to create a chance to spy on even more competent magicians.

  I'm glad that we were able to get a Wednesday World-building thread. I find many of the stories on the subreddit to be confusing or lacking context (summary, like "since last time" for quick catch-ups, or a "Harry thought he was a normal boy until... something something wizards and witches are real!" to give me a teaser of the stories) so I wasn't finding any creative outlet in people's threads of their online novels.


  ----


  It's just nice to be able to let loose some creative thoughts and discuss various worldbuilding concepts with other people. We needed a place to discuss things like "What if people could double jump in reality?" or "What if we could fly but that would still be a form of exercise?", and judging by the 90 comments in the thread, it seems like people have responded positively to the thread idea.

  I hope from it we get some more stories based on personal headcanon and concepts.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    One of the risks of brainstorming like that, which I hope people will keep in mind, is that *sometimes* talking about those things saps the creative will to actually write them. I know I have a few ideas in draft that I would never get back to if I let them out of their box; it would just be a thread of "there are robots and wizards and vampires and they're all fighting each other and Bill Gates is there too" ... and that would be it, because I would have mined the idea out and all that would be left is the sometimes-tedious part of painting by numbers.

    (I don't think I'm unique in this, but your mileage might definitely vary.)
    ```

    - u/Dwood15:
      ```
      I suppose that's one way of looking at the situation, being from an author's perspective. I'll admit that the way the sub is set up, I'm mostly a consumer here, looking for a place to interact with others more and because of that, I invite you to look at this in a different way.

      There are some like you who like to write, where discussion of their ideas can be demotivating to writing their stories, those who will write their stories regardless of discussing their ideas, and another category of people who just like discussing worlds with different rules and laws. 

      I think this thread will be beneficial because you'd be providing the third group of people a place where they can discuss their ideas and hopefully take them into the authoring stage. At the very least, it's one more avenue for people to bounce their ideas off and gives people like me a place to contribute more often.

      Perhaps you could draw some of the concepts into the weekly competition threads, so that people could be encouraged to write based on the worlds/concepts discussed?

      Edit: Anyway, thank you for not shutting the idea for the thread down. I appreciate it. :)

  [Mr. Yudkowsky on the point past which "canon" pieces of fiction become "fanfic-tier"](http://i.imgur.com/CBbClJl.png) ([source](http://archive.is/gO8u9))  
  It's kind of interesting to consider how the different pieces of a fictional universe might overlap in weird ways, depending on their levels of mutual consistency and interrelation. If all works purporting to represent *Avatar: The Last Airbender* are all just distorted reflections of [the same "One True Canon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms) that's perfectly rational and internally-consistent, can that "true canon" [be extracted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem) by somehow averaging the reflections so that their distortions are canceled out?

  [A 1916 description of a hypothetical invasion of the United States through the Atlantic coast](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52038) (69k words, including endnotes and Project Gutenberg stuff)  
  I get the feeling that it's a piece of anti-isolationism propaganda:

  > “Now, Congressman, the only way for an inferior army to accomplish anything is to refuse battle until the chances are as favorable as they can be made. The inferior force must retire before a superior. It must force the invader to follow till he is weakened by steadily lengthening lines of communications. His difficulties of food-and ammunition-transport grow. He becomes involved in strange terrain. Last but not least, he gets more and more deeply into a land filled with a hostile population. But if we must defend a specific place at all hazards, then we must stand and give battle—well, it will be only one battle.”

  > “You mean—?”

  > “I mean that such a battle is decided already. It was decided years ago—when the country refused to prepare.”

  > “Good God, man!” The Congressman wiped his forehead with a trembling, fat hand. “I can’t go back and tell my people that.”

  > “You’d better not,” said the General, grimly.

  From the same source, [a 1920 advertisement brochure for a gyroscopic compass](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52053) ([more information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrocompass)):

  > If you were to conceive of a compass which would be free from all the troubles and errors found in most compasses, which would relieve you of all the worry and care the present compass requires, a compass which would be accurate and reliable, a compass which would be the Ideal Compass under all conditions, you would undoubtedly conceive of a compass that had the following characteristics:

  > 1\. It must point True North.  
  > 2\. It must free you from the necessity of making calculations and corrections.  
  > 3\. It must free you from compensating the compass for errors.  
  > 4\. It must free you from the burden of swinging the ship, or otherwise taking the deviation of your compass.  
  > 5\. It must not be influenced by inherent magnetism of the ship.  
  > 6\. It must not be influenced by any change in the character or disposition of the cargo.  
  > 7\. It must not be influenced directly or indirectly by any temperature changes.  
  > 8\. It must not be influenced by the roll or pitch of the ship.  
  > 9\. It must not be influenced by any weather conditions.  
  > 10\. In the event of failure, or error, it should give instant warning.

  > The Magnetic Compass does not point to True North, it points to Magnetic North, which is about 800 miles from the True North Pole. The Sperry Gyro-Compass, which is not a Magnetic Compass, and is not affected by a magnetism of any sort, and derives its directive force from the earth’s rotation, points True North. It does not point to the Magnetic North Pole.

    I think if you follow Eliezer's logic, then you have to *also* posit that there are works of fiction written by fans as sequels to existing works which are *not* fanfiction, either because they don't attempt to reinterpret or remix the original (that is, they attempt to stay as true to the author's original as possible) or because they don't use any of what we might call "fanfic tropes", whatever those would be.
    ```

  - u/gbear605:
    ```
    > can that "true canon" be extracted  by somehow averaging the reflections so that their distortions are canceled out?

    In my opinion, no. If this were true, the "true canon" for most fiction would be much more based on slash than the original work was.
    ```

    - u/captainNematode:
      ```
      Agreed, there are consistent biases in fanfiction, with certain tropes appearing more often than others. If all fanfictions were random, symmetric deviations from canon, you could perhaps somehow average them together and estimate the original work with some degree of precision, but fanfics are far from symmetric and random. 

      As for Zach's question in the OP, I'd say that what is canon is defined by the author, who in turn has the ability to retcon the original, existing canon in favor of a new one, or otherwise create an "alternate canon". I also suppose the creator of a work can be a *fan* of their own work (as google defines *fan* as "a person who has a strong interest in or admiration for a particular person or thing", with synonyms: enthusiast, devotee, admirer, lover; supporter, follower, disciple, adherent, zealot; expert, connoisseur, aficionado), but to me "fan" connotes admiration *of another*, so unless the original author has amnesia or dissociative identity disorder or something they wouldn't really be a fan, which'd be a necessary condition of producing fanfiction.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        On the other hand, you can write fanfiction without being a fan of the thing you're writing fanfiction of. I think most people write when they're writing about something that they enjoy, but I've definitely sat down to write fanfic because I detested the original and wanted to fix all of the things it did wrong (though I never did finish my Terminator: Genisys fixfic).
        ```

        - u/captainNematode:
          ```
          Hmm, true, I guess fixfic, hatefic, revengefic, etc. could all be considered subcategories of fanfiction, and the fanfic author needn't be a fan. Though would it be fair to say that in the fixfic you wrote you were a fan of the premise of the original work, just not its execution? Or was it a "love to hate" sort of thing?
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            Usually it's because I disliked something that was core to the work to such an extent that I wanted to write a critique of it in the form of fanfiction. Or I thought the themes were dumb and wanted to change those themes into something else entirely. I think it's the impetus that makes people leave ten page reviews for things that they didn't like; it's not so much that they love to hate it (though they might), it's that they came away with a bad taste in their mouth. Sometimes that's just because of execution, but it's often because of deliberate choices on the part of the original author.

      On a similar note, I was once working on world building for a multiverse in which all fiction actually results from psychic inspiration leaking from adjacent worlds, thus justifying all those stories where some guy jumps between universes and by some bizarre coincidence finds himself in a book universe.

      Then I realized the... implications. There would have to be a LOT of reaaaaly smutty universes around.

        It's a seventy-year-old series, any given episode is guaranteed to be flatly contradicted by *something* in its history. Comic-book series work under the same constraint: single episodes/issues/stories are always consistent, metaplot arcs are fairly consistent, but there's no coherent canon that ties the entire thing together.

    Check out the *[Undertale Prime](http://raggedjackscarlet.tumblr.com/post/135533951313/a-remake-without-an-original)* theory.

    Undertale makes use of a lot of fanfic tropes despite not actually being fanfic of anything. The author of that post - which I won't summarize here - imagines what the "canon" to Undertale's "fanon" would be like, and reinterprets some perceived plot-holes in that light.

    It should go without saying that that is just one of the many many bizarre edge cases that you can encounter when trying to create a formal definition of the "is fanfic of" and "shares a canon with" relationships. Such a formalisation can never exist in a coherent way.

  Just finished watching Erased. Spoilers follow, read at your own digression.

  The ending sucked. Some people complained about episode 10, but that was pretty much fine. 11 & 12 though... They sucked. To have the main character go into a coma as a means of time skip is bad. Yeah, time skips are very hard to pull off correctly, but it was still a cop-out. The whole ending felt rushed and anti-rational. He never took what's-his-name on, except for that very last scene. It was like, "reveal!" And I was like, "since when did he become an unreliable narrator."

  Also, it violates Yudkowsky's rule, "If you give Frodo a lightsaber, give Sauron the death star." The MC (I'm bad at names) doesn't use his power to its full potential; he doesn't come close. And, his enemy is some serial murderer? And you missed a ton of important clues that could have easily led you to the murderer? Plus, he didn't tell anyone about his power. I thought that he would've almost immediately after going back. Or tell his other smart friend. He only kinda reveals it at the end.

  This story has such potential for a rational fiction. Whether you start from the beginning or after the murderer reveal, it doesn't matter. The story, although filled with tension, felt wrong in ways because the characters were dumb. Yeah, a moral of the story is to put trust in your friends, but still. Even after he goes back the second time, he didn't tell anyone.

  UGH! I'm sorry, I'm just frustrated. The story feels like a draft for a better story. The ending at least. Although I hear it's better in the manga, he still does the coma thing. That's bad in my book. Oh yeah, especially at the end, he implies that if he dies, he'll come back because of his power. Then why didn't the author have him just and come back at the murderer reveal? Because it would ruin the story by having him being rational? Well, he would still have to figure it out, especially without evidence.

  I feel like many authors don't want to ponder out what would actually happen sometimes, and want to leave it closer to what they know. Reliving out your life is hard to imagine, so boom, cop-out to the coma. [Worm Spoiler](#s "Don't know how to lengthen things out for your deadline in the future? Have a really crappy time skip where it seems like the characters are in hibernation and forget each other when they get out.")

  It's just awful. Tell your mom about your power, test out of shit, and get a headstart on your life. And, if you want to be a true rationalist, take advantage of your rewind and invent/invest in new technologies. You know stuff from the future. Use that jump to make your life and everyone else's better. Even if you're that young prodigy who was great at drawing. You have a freaking jumpstart in life. The problem is how that fits with the story: it doesn't. So everything's awful.

  I know I will be thinking about what a rational fic will be like. There's a tiny chance I might write some (I took a writing class last semester, but I'm busy, so it's hard).  If anybody knows of any good erased fanfiction, that'd be great. Thanks for reading my rant. :D

  I have a *qualified* anime recommendation.

  Maoyuu Maou Yuusha. It's about a destined hero who ventures forth alone to vanquish the evil demon lord and bring peace to the world. When he reaches her (After about two minutes), she tells him how the war against her demons is the only thing keeping the human nations from constantly warring among themselves, and here are the economics of it, and the politics, and the history, and it's similar on the demons' side of things. So instead of trying to get one side to win and enslave the other species, why don't we use our powers to secretly cooperate and try to set up long term conditions for peace with these interesting new crops I found? And this 'vaccine' against small pox, and these inventions that will make life easier on farmers and-

  It's basically a cookie cutter /r/rational Fantasy premise, and the hero soon agrees.

  Unfortunately, while the premise is great, it's only one season, and they still manage to squeeze in 50% filler and big boob fan service everywhere, and some things still happen just because the plot demands it, like the demon lord taking several months off from plotting for no apparent reason other than that it would have been too easy otherwise.

  So it's a qualified recommendation. If you don't mind/can stand excessive fan service and a hero who panics whenever a woman shows interest, and you are alright with 50% filler, then it's pretty neat to see a secret hero/demon lord alliance manipulating the economy and working behind the scenes to take the world out of the dark ages.

  Spice and Wolf does economics better, but is not otherwise rationalist. Good romance though.

  So I'm reading about relationships and marriage for this biweekly challenge and I wondered what's the best method to raise rational children. One thing I asked for example is about horror stuff.

  Would it be better to talk logic with a child and teach it to not fear the darkness and the unknown and rather look at it with curiosity while avoiding exposure to supernatural/horror topics? Or would it be better to expose it to a bunch of horror topics so that they become desensitized with them in the same way butchers and surgeons become desensitized to seeing blood?

  I wondered this due to the idea that organisms that don't interact with certain aspects of the environment tend to fare poorly due to lack of experience. Thoughts? Are there any known books or methods for raising children according to rational values?
