## Is there an inverse version of The Metropolitan Man?

### Post:

Basically a story where there is an uber-rational version of Superman and how that would play out.(Preferably including all the other characters.) Most people think that Supes is too strong of a character to do that with and would break the setting, but there are certain forces, entities, and mundane dilemmas that would present a problem even for someone with his powers/skill sets. Chief among them being other aliens, the emergence of meta-humans, non-human races/civilizations native to earth, and just magic in general(that more than anything else can really stump most versions of him).

I know that it wouldn't really be Clark Kent anymore, but the same is true of Luminosity, Naruto: The Need to Become Stronger , and even The Metropolitan Man and those are good stories regardless.

  I started writing one, which was meant to be a companion piece to Metropolitan Man. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time to write all the things that I want to write, and I don't have a good grasp on the actual *plot*; the opening chapter is about what changes Clark from wanting to be a reporter from wanting to be an effective altruist, and the subsequent chapters take place some five years later when Man of Steel Incorporated is selling contracts for his time in order to make the most money (which then gets funneled into the most reliably effective interventions).

  Possible plots that might develop from that:

  * Superman is using virtually all his time in order to do the most good, at the expense of his mental and social well-being, which he's been pushing to the breaking point because so much depends on him, and "the plot" descends from that.
  * Some bad actor (potentially Lex Luthor) gets within Man of Steel Incorporated's decision loop, either to extract value from Superman, to sabotage him, or something else, ideally with parallels to the ways in which capitalism can undermine concerted efforts to do good.

  The problem is, I don't particularly like the idea of Superman facing metahuman threats or other aliens, I like the idea of him facing coordination problems, immoral businessmen and politicians, and perverse incentives. There's a bit in what I've written that gets to the heart of what I find most compelling about 'rational' Superman, which is that airlines will pay him to go check on an airliner that's lost signal, which is almost always a false alarm, utterly unheroic, but dictated as necessary by the insurance companies due to the enormous cost that would be incurred from an aircraft actually crashing. So Superman spends his time checking in on aircraft, fixing undersea cables, lifting satellites, etc., all while feeling unfulfilled by any of it. There's an inherent tension between 'doing the most good' and 'feeling satisfied by do-gooding', because these are different things.

  (Saying this here because there's almost no chance that I'll actually finish writing it, and hopefully someone can make something of the ideas.)

    It seems like him engaging in any kind of money-raising venture would be pointless. Couldn't he single-handedly kickstart the asteroid-mining industry and produce enough mineral wealth to overwhelm the entire world economy overnight?

    Just thinking as I type here, any rationalist superman story where he doesn't have villains or similar roadblocks is essentially going to turn into a project management fantasy- how to get the most utility out of a single human being, with typical human needs but virtually no physical limits + the ability to fly? If I were Superman in this case I'd immediately try to come up with a committee or something with absolute authority govern my time on the assumption that doing it myself would be less optimal, and probably self-destructive as I wouldn't take time to rest. But how would it be selected, what kind of tensions would it cause- what can you do without creating a dependency on your existence after you're dead?

    Superman's concept of "Doing good" would probably be so far removed from any ordinary human standard that it doesn't really look recognizable to us. Instead of running insurance claims, I'm thinking "Repositioning the earth to solve global climate change" or "Subsidizing the construction of the first extra-earth colony with nearly free/un-weight-restricted space launches." Humanity's primary problem would stop being... well, any of the current existential threats, actually- it'd just switch to "Making more supermen" and then ultimately "Policing the supermen we have created."

      Yes, the second chapter is all about superhuman asteroid mining, and most of what you're saying is the case; Superman doesn't make many decisions on where he's going or what he's doing.

    These themes are similar to what I've been starting to explore in The Maker's Ark and beyond in the Doc Future series, for Flicker and the Volunteer: How do they deal with things like a whole society that for three generations has internalized the idea that 'Nothing *really* bad will happen because the Volunteer will stop it'--and he has to stop because of injuries that won't heal if he doesn't.  Interesting stuff.

      I really liked your latest chapter, by the way. Flicker's clearly at her breaking point, and it felt very humanising.

    The thing is, he eventually has to notice that the immoral businessmen and politicians and the like only exist insofar as *he* allows them to.  As an invincible* weapon of mass destruction, Superman is, will he or nil he, the Emperor of the World.  Everyone who lives does so only with his implicit permission; he possesses all the coercive authority of the state, unified and unchecked.

    So, eventually, everything becomes a question of how Superman chooses to use the power of being the embodiment of all government.

    This is pure ideology. How about instead he finds the hundred richest people and throws them into the sun?

      Nah, difficult to get access to their assets that way, and you need substantial assets to provide incentives to keep people doing the ops and social/physical infrastructure work when you’re not present.

      Not to mention being terrible optics and getting public opinion arrayed against him. If you want people to cooperate with you in making the world a better place, it’s probably worth your while to avoid overt reminders that you are a horseman of the apocalypse who could end the world or murder any number of anyone you want, whenever you want.

        > difficult to get access to their assets that way

        It's actually not, you just threaten to throw their heirs into the sun too.

        Why would public opinion array *against* the guy killing all the most evil parasites?

        The conceptual point here is that effective altruism is the refuge of an alienated and powerless samaritan who can't help but exist under late capitalism, but Superman doesn't have that limitation. He can singlehandedly do what would actually take mass action.

          Oooh, excellent, I'm sure more violence will get the public on your side

          > Why would public opinion array against the guy killing all the most evil parasites?

          Because they're generally against vigilante killing

          > He can singlehandedly do what would actually take mass action.

          There are certainly things that would normally take mass action that he can do, but he cannot do all things that would normally take mass action. For example, getting people to cooperate and be kind is difficult to accomplish via direct application of newtons.

            What do you think the ratio would really be if, say, the Waltons got killed? Would coltan miners cry for Micheal Dell or Sergei Brin? Would all the people Berkshire Hathaway has robbed of their homes and livelihoods be upset to see the last of Warren Buffett? Or for that matter the people of Nicaragua whose families were killed by right wing death squads funded by Coca Cola, of which he is the largest stockholder.

            Supes could even branch out a little, deliver Kissinger to Hanoi and Bolton to Baghdad.

            A good first step on getting people to cooperate would be abolishing the global economic system which explicitly rewards and empowers the most uncooperative, unkind, and antisocial behavior.

  I feel like Strong Female Protagonist fits the bill here, in a way - its not the character of superman, but a young woman with the "superman-package" of powers (flight, invincibility, super strength) who tries to figure out a way to improve the world after realizing that "beating up bad guys" is not the optimal approach. There are other elements in there, but this is a major theme.

  SMBC has a [Superman comic](https://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305) that kind of meets that request? It's not really rational Superman as much as a rational society that leverages a suggestible Superman to greatest effect. It seems Superman is the only superpowered person in it, though.

    Like in most superhero stories. :D Only Spider-Man/Thor/Superman/Flash/etc can save the day! Even when it's known that lots of friendly superguys live in the same stupid city.

  Superman Red Son is one of the most famous superman stories of his near century of comics and it basically follows that. 

  Arguably most of the bigger superman stories are of rational superman, except he has decided that directing humanity himself is not much different than, say, helping the native Americans by converting them all to Christianity and accelerating their tribes through an industrial revolution.
  ```

- u/TaltosDreamer:

  Too strong? I disagree. Almost any character can be compelling and challenged if you show them dealing with the things they are not good at.

  The problem is that most people write about powerful characters by either giving them problems they can easily solve or they take away their powers and give them a problem they could have solved if only they had their powers.

  A rational story would be fine if someone sat down and went about it intelligently.

  Edited for clarity (I did not intend to sound negative towards the original poster)
  ```

  - u/kaukamieli:
    ```
    But the more power you give a character, the harder you make it to yourself to write something compelling. It's not that there couldn't be a good superman story, it's that it's hard to write one.

    I've been cringing hard watching three seasons of Supergirl and I'm now at fifth season of Smallville. It's just so dumb, how they don't just use their superspeed to just beat pretty much all opposition in a fight before they can do anything.

      I am thinking about writing a few fanfic superman stories to illustrate my point. I have 3 story directions already. I will share them here if anything comes of them.

      Most authors go at things in a purely X & Y direction, I prefer to put Z into the mix
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        It's a bit of a cliche to say this here, but if most authors do X and Y but not Z, there's probably a good reason for it, and it's not "well, they're just not clever or creative enough to think of Z."

          I didnt say anyone was more or less creative than anyone else. It isnt my place to decide that and I don't care all that much about where I stand compared to others, I just work at being creative myself...and I also disagree that there is usually a good reason for people not writing something a particular way.

          There is usually a reason or reasons, but that doesnt mean they are automatically good ones (though plenty are) and sometimes the reason is people didnt think of it at the time.

          For instance, Superman is usually written in certain ways because his stories do not sell as well when written in other ways. They also have other characters that fulfill certain types of stories, so there is no need to write Superman stories outside his general tropes as long as his stories continue to sell. Those are good enough reasons for his writers (and fairly compelling!), but are not terribly relevant for this discussion.

    I feel like all of the ideas in that thread are overcomplicated.

    It's the size of a baseball, being thrown with normal human strength.

    He can move an arbitrary distance in the time it takes to leave her hand.

    She has her hands *straight out in front of her*, not in any good position to throw.

    That ball of kryptonite is the only thing between him and freedom: Mercy is standing in an *open doorway*.

    "Dodge" and "use Lex as a human shield" are both strategies that seem much smarter than "go through the wall."  And neither requires superhuman abilities: major league hitters dodge 100 mph fastballs regularly.

        He had time and power enough to dive through a lead-lined wall.

        Surely he had enough to take a body-width step to either the left or the right.  Or to jump over her and the kryptonite.  Or to inflict enough pain/damage to her hand to make her drop the baseball.  Or to interpose Lex between them, at an angle to direct the ball into a corner.  Or the desk, or the chair.

        Yes, having the kryptonite near would have weakened him, slowed him.  But all he needed to do was clear the room - once out, the shielded nature of the room itself would protect him - and he would have been safe. The wall just seems like a strange option to take when there's an open door as an available choice, if he retains enough power to go *through a wall*.
        ```

        - u/TheAzureMage:
          ```
          Going through the wall is a reasonably decent kind of thinking, though. If the kryptonite is in the doorway, making another doorway is a decent solution. Even the fic recognizes that it's not the \*only\* solution, but ultimately, Superman merely fell victim to overconfidence, and in a fairly believable way. He didn't know that Lex had learned how to make more kryptonite, so he probably didn't view a lead lined room as posing any reasonable threat.   


          Making her drop the ball would not necessarily make going through the doorway safe. If he were vulnerable in that close of proximity to it, it would be reasonable to suppose that Lex had positioned additional traps there to capitalize on that.

  Question: Can one write an optimistic, hopeful Superman story while still being rationalist? Because it's...I like The Metropolitan Man, but it's kinda sucky that the one rationalist Superman story was the one where not only did Lex Luthor win, but Superman was hinted to be a mentally broken man.
