## [Challenge Companion] The Mentor

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread to [the weekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7z8jb8/biweekly_challenge_the_mentor/), post recommendations, chit-chat, ideas, brainstorming, etc. here.**

  The recent challenge themes were all very, very good. If I hadn't been extraordinarily busy recently, I would've submitted way more stories, because those themes all deserve to be illuminated from multiple angles. (For example, I have a half-finished story for Infighting in which eight Cedrics Diggory rob a casino in Vegas. Well, maybe I'll finish it for a future challenge.)

  Thank you for your excellent work in providing the prompts. It is much appreciated.

    Thanks! I've been running the challenges for almost three years now, and have been trying to not have it as one of the things that gets put on the backburner, which it does from time to time.

    I'm trying to think of what I want to do for the three year anniversary, which will be 6/17/18 (but probably not actually that, because it doesn't fall on a Wednesday). "Nothing" is certainly tempting in its simplicity, but if not nothing then maybe a showcase of the 'top' winners or something from all previous ~80 challenges.
