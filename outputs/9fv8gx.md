## Magic: The Gathering does rationalist flash fiction? (Warning: New set spoiler)

I was tickled by this flavor text on a card from *Guilds of Ravnica,* the latest MTG set. There are hints of something like AI suppression-for-the-sake-of-safety here, or of any other X-risk precautionary principle. (Lazav also demonstrates the precautionary mindset on [another card](https://scryfall.com/card/gtc/189/psychic-strike?utm_source=mw_MTGWiki).) And of course, we have one of the most rationalist TV Tropes, [Evil vs. Oblivion](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilVersusOblivion).

For context: Lazav, quoted here, leads the Dimir, a guild of spies in a city of specialized professional guilds. The city is being slowly infiltrated by a psychic dragon of multiverse-shaping power, whose machinations are normally beyond the bounds of humans to detect... but if you stop *every* plan, from every one of the other nine guilds, that starts to matter less. The Dimir were villains in previous sets, but they'd rather rule their city than see it fall in shame to an outside power.

I can't think of any other flavor text that tells quite as satisfying a story, but perhaps y'all have some ideas?

    I'm also a fan of Feldon of the Third Path's flavour text, but you need to have read (and should read, regardless of familiarty with MtG lore) *[Loran's Smile](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/lorans-smile-2014-10-27)*, before it's particularly impactful, so it's not really flash fiction in that sense.

      The flavor text of Tethmos High Priest is fantastic for this sub. "Death is tyranny. Like all tyranny, it must be opposed."
      ```

  While we're sharing rational MtG, [this short story](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/experiment-one-2013-02-18) was inspired by HPMOR.

  Sometimes, to work around a malevolent superintelligent entitiy/AI, you have to get creative and find a side-channel to communicate through.

  It is also a D&D setting now!
