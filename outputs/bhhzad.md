  This is fucking amazing. She wove them all into a Gordian knot and made her victory into the only knife that can cut it.

  Oh this chapter. This chapter. This was amazing. Just flat out amazing. But let me explain the highlights 

  First of all, kairos is a combo of traitorous and irritant reincarnated, mixed the spirit of goblin kind and just a *dash* of kids show villainy, and then let loose on creation for belows eternal laughter 

  Second, looks like everyone was right, it is the dead king hijacking heirophant, personally I was expecting some sort of demon for now and then the dead king takes full control, but this is fine (insert dog in fire meme here) 

  Third, cat had that moment of satisfaction every great schemer has at one point or another. The satisfaction that your plan has come together even more perfectly than you expected 

  Fourth, I am *extremely* curious as to what kairos planned to do with a hijacked half hell/half Arcadia shard, other than invade the hobbesian hellhole the dead king has cooked up, along with what the heirarch could do in the serenity, as frankly that many people learning the truth, plus his (most likely named) revolt aspect equals quite the interesting turn of events 

  Fifth And Finally, cat, the pilgrim, the rogue sorcerer, the saint, and kairos all in a heroic band will prove to be extremely interesting and fun to read. I expect betrayal, heroic charges, redemption, and of course typical antics that come with kairos being in the general area 

  Also the slight pause after the first story was perfect 

  Also also this killing a god thing is partially a reference to that old phrase "be they gods or kings or all the armies in creation" is it not?

    I don't think he was speaking of using it against serenity, I think he wanted to physically *crash* it into Serenity.

      >And what was the next step in your master plan?

      Crashing this demiplane... With no survivors!
      ```

    - u/magna-terra:
      ```
      Well obviously, and crashing into the serenity means he is invading it
      ```

      - u/Allian42:
        ```
        I was thinking more along the lines of "obliterate the place so that only  a smoking crater remains".
        ```

    I'm still on the fence about that one. Neshama infecting Zeze with jsut the right ideas and mysteries through his own memories echoing in Arcadia would be quite the amazing time paradox, for one. Or maybe it was a very long-term dormant trap, laid in wait for the right circumstances, in which case the Woe's visit North triggered the deads' invasion ?

    I still think Mazego is aware of at least some of this, and has a plan of his own.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      It's mentioned by Wekesa and his other dad that he has plans like this all over the place, even in this chapter Kairos mentions that this happens if you read the entire Kabbalis book of darkness.
      ```

      - u/vimefer:
        ```
        So, memehazardous triggers and traps.
        ```

        - u/Razorhead:
          ```
          Well, a meme spreads, or at least tries to. This is more a cognitohazard.
          ```

          - u/chaos-engine:
            ```
            I believe the term is "infohazard"
            ```

            - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
              ```
              Nah, cognitohazard. Cognitohazards are dangerous to know, infohazards are dangerous to communicate (eg Actual Canniball Shia LaBeouf).

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  'the desperate trick of a fox chewing through its own foot for fear of the night':  should that be 'trap', as in Dune's Humanity Test?  ('An inhuman would chew off its own limb to escape a trap, whereas a human could reason, endure, and fake death in order to surprise and kill the trapper')

  It's unclear how chewing through your foot could be relevant as a 'trick' when faced with night, compared with as a trick for escaping when you've been caught in a trap (such as the Dead King's).
  ```

  - u/CapnSmurfy:
    ```
    It's a reference to Larat. She refers to him and the Winter Court as foxes chewing of their foot, as the Winter King harmed himself and winter to escape the endless cycle of seasons that was the Fae courts.
    ```

- u/swaskowi:
  ```
  Iâ€™m kind of floored at the last paragraph? Do we have any context or foreshadowing for exactly what that entails and why cat knows it?
  ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    Larat is a treacherous lieutenant that wants to have power. So Cat's gonna give him power and turn him into a god and tie said Laratgod to the shard of Arcadia. Then she's gonna murder Larat for being a treacherous little lieutenant. Then she's gonna use the corpse to go to Keter.
    ```

    - u/notagiantdolphin:
      ```
      With Larat as the Prince of Nightfall, it even gives semiotic weight to them later turning it into the Drow Homeland and using it to cap Keter and the Serenity with a realm of eternal night populated by demigods and a real one.
      ```

      - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
        ```
        I very much doubt that anyones going to want to give the race of murderpriests an entire shard of arcadia to live in. 

        My bet is that Cat haggles Pilgrim/Hasenbach into giving them some Principalities bordering the Kingdom of the Dead (Maybe Hainut/Cleves but more likely Hannoven/Rhenia/Bremen+maybe Neustria)
        ```

        - u/MultipartiteMind:
          ```
          Mental image:  "Out of political considerations, the European Union will now be evacuating France."
          ```

          - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
            ```
            As of the prologue the border north of Hannoven had already fallen, and since Hasenbach decided to send what she had available to reinforce cleves/~~hannoven~~Hainut instead there are only garrisons stopping the march south on the western front.

            Additionally, all 4 principalities on that front are Hasenbachs, so if the drow reclaim it in the war and say "this is our land now" there are going to be no other princes demanding their lands back, and very few soldiers/refugees to put on public pressure.
            ```

            - u/MultipartiteMind:
              ```
              Good point, thank you!
              ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          She already explicitly said she's giving them Keter, not any part of Procer.
          ```
