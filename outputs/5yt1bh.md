## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You've been given access to one trillion USD-hours to dispense with as you wish. This is a unit representing the product of a person's anticipated lifetime earnings (in 2017-equivalent USD, and without removing expenditures, and using a relatively generous interpretation of "earnings" -- if some religious leader has taken a vow of poverty and refused income, their lack of explicit earnings doesn't grant you access to arbitrarily large amounts of their time) and a measure of time representing their undivided attention. This is to say that you can hold any number of people's attention for some amount of time, with a total budget of one trillion USD-hours. For example, you could use this to have a nice, short chat with Bill Gates and Warren Buffet, or advertise Pepsiâ„¢ products ad nauseum to the entire population of some poor, small country, or give a series of short lectures to the Pope, or anything in between. 


  No living person is off limits -- you can choose world leaders, Nobel prize winners, titans of industry, etc., but the "power" has no *magical* component -- you can't designate someone through definite description alone ("the person or people who will give me the most money, in expectation"), nor find persons whose location is currently not known to you, nor use it to see the future by predicting people's lifetime earnings -- it's a rough, but usually quite good extrapolation that could well be wrong, nor pull someone from the brink of death, nor interrupt anything important (the attention would be given through the standard channels, which would just happen to work out very seamlessly, so no using it in small bursts to, say, sabotage professional athletes' performance and make bank betting on sports games). Their "undivided" attention is still subject to their own, normal limits, and doesn't bestow on them extraordinary concentration or anything. Otherwise, you can talk to them about or present to them any information you want and have available or ask them any questions  you want, and they'll listen attentively for the required time, but they still might react negatively or refuse to answer you. You can't use this power to do anything otherwise illegal, or I suppose you can, but it would still be illegal and you'd still face the normal repercussions. Your safety is ensured fairly well, though, if you want to chat with someone especially dangerous.

  You can divvy up your trillion USD-hours however you want, to as many people you want, for as many times for a given person as you want, with one additional limitation -- you can't "hold someone's attention" for a period of time less than one minute and greater than eight hours for any given day, so no significantly hampering people with repetitive microbursts of required attention (see the "standard channels" condition above).

  Who do you talk to, and about what?

    So what would the hourly rate of someone horribly underpaid relative to their importance, like the president, be?
    ```

  - u/buckykat:
    ```
    Make a fully vertically integrated company, hiring everything from miners and lumberjacks to accountants and engineers. Subcontract out some of the magically-paid-for time to generate cashflow while the rest source the materials for, design and build my ~~skull adorned volcano~~ moon base.

    Other than trying to trying to use this ability to influence the world (I would probably use this power on someone else in order to get them to come up with a plan for how to best use it for influencing people) the best application would seem to be for coercion.                           
    Sure you may have limited time when it comes to someone with very valuable time, but other people don't know that. So just use this ability for several hours a day on Warren Buffett, being as unbearably annoying as you can possible manage until you can convince him to pay you a substantial amount of money to _not_ use this ability on him. Rinse and repeat with other billionaires until you are yourself extremely wealthy.                   
    Then I guess work with some experts on figuring out the best ways of using your ability to convince influential people. For instance if you could keep yourself level headed in the face of madness and avoid disagreeing with him too much you might be able to substantially influence Trump (hell Thiel seems like he may have figured this out).

  1. Vampires need to lethally drain at least one human per month to survive.
  2. They have hypnosis and superhuman strength sufficient to easily overpower and drain even small groups of humans without difficulty.
  3. All vampires are sociopaths. Most are sadists. They retain the original human's knowledge, skills and intelligence.
  4. Vampires can choose to have their victims rise from the dead as a vampire within a 24-hour period. They're not compelled to co-operate beyond natural self-interest, but they're not compelled *not* to cooperate beyond natural self-interest.
  5. The usual vampire weaknesses (mirrors, garlic, sunlight etc.) are sufficient to unerringly identify vampires. Weaponized and used tactically, they're effective enough that 5-7 trained, armed professionals can put down 1-2 vampires in a fight.

  Vampires are *currently* rare enough that the masquerade has remained shakily intact up to this point, but there's at least one group of vampires planning to use their exponential growth and superpowers to take over the world.

  What do you do

  1. as a vampire?
  2. as a random human?
  3. as the (human) President of the United States?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    Can hypnosis be detected? (How do we know the president isn't a thrall?)

    Is it 2017? (How does the masquerade survive dashcams/CCTV?)

    As a human/president, when do we find out about the existence of vampires?

    Is the lethal drain magical? Natural scientific inquiries are whether they can drain chimps, whether a fetus per month might be enough, and whether they might be able to survive on donated blood.

    Why would garlic not give the war to the humans outright? Put garlic in everything. Build with garlic. Weave garlic into clothes. Or maybe it isn't that strong, if garlic bullets only produce a 5-7/1-2-ratio.

    Depending on how unfiltered sunlight needs to be, a satelite with a mirror might act as an orbital sunlight cannon.
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      Hypnosis is strictly short-term.

      >Is it 2017? (How does the masquerade survive dashcams/CCTV?)

      Yes, it's 2017. 

      The masquerade has only survived this far because it's really easy to just go up to someone's house and kick the door in, so there's little motivation to attack people in public (and a person being beaten up using superhuman strength is hard to visually distinguish from a person being beaten up using merely exceptional strength and skill.) There are occasional slips where e.g. someone is photographed not casting a reflection.

      >Is the lethal drain magical? Natural scientific inquiries are whether they can drain chimps, whether a fetus per month might be enough, and whether they might be able to survive on donated blood.

      Yup, it's magical. Chimps don't count, neither do partial drains, stored blood, or predeceased victims. 

      ... I'm going to rule out infants, simply because it inevitably produces boring and unethical ideas. The cutoff for counting as a valid victim is seven years.

      >Or maybe it isn't that strong, if garlic bullets only produce a 5-7/1-2-ratio.

      Yup.
      ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        The "you can only go into a home if you're invited" rule doesn't exist?

        From what condition do drained victims die? Their blood is gone? They crumple to dust and blow away? I am of course trying to see whether it is possible to recover from experience in a prepared modern hospital.
        ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    As a vampire:

    Try to stay far away from the Takeover Group. Plan in accordance with the principal that the masquerade will be broken (because it will) and vampires will be near-exterminated as soon as military forces figure it out and start issuing the right equipment (which it *will*).

    Try to develop a good reputation as a philanthropist, and survive off people who are unlikely to be missed (and, if possible, who are nowhere near to my official address).

    --------------

    As a random human - continue as I do until I hear about the vampire invasion. Promptly panic, stock up on garlic, and eat a lot of garlic. Try to avoid vampires where possible, but be prepared to call in the police in case of suspected vampire activity.

    --------------

    As a human President - these humanoid creatures are a clear and present threat to the people of my country, and, furthermore, to my own life and sanity. Ensure first that the Secret Service is properly trained and equipped to deal with them.

    Then ensure that the army and police are properly trained and equipped.

    Then reassure my people that the problem of these terrifying humanoid abominations is well in hand. They're all clearly enemies of my country, and as such, any within my borders will be swiftly destroyed. (Other countries will no doubt manage their own security).

  You are an Edward-Snowden-style character at an informal dinner party with a number of journalists, government employees, and counterintelligence agents. You have six floppy disks, encrypted, and a piece of paper containing the encryption key for the disks. You need to make sure that the information on the floppy disks gets to a reputable journalist.

  Assume that the party is held in a standard 2br apartment, and is equipped with all the stuff you would expect to find in a young professional's apartment.

  How do you safely and secretly convey the floppies and encryption key to the journalists that you have decided are reputable?
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Do the people in the room know either that you want to leak information or that one of their number wants to leak information, or is everyone going in blind? Do the journalists know that someone wants to leak and nobody else? The journalists and the cointel agents? What is the topography of knowledge here?
    ```

  - u/FishNetwork:
    ```
    Can you expand a little on the challenge?

    Some journalists have PGP public-keys on their [author bio pages](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/julianborger).  You can use [online tools](https://sela.io/pgp/) to create an encrypted message from that.

    Drop the output into Pastebin, and you just need to give the other guy a super short link.

    Even if you're spotted passing the other guy the link, the opposition won't be able to read it.

    -------

    If you want to get really fancy about it, put your disk data into the [Hidden volume](https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Hidden%20Volume) of a VeraCrypt file.

    Fill the public volume with something plausible, but not super-illegal.  Like, make up a story about how your defense contractor boss is giving kickbacks to the government guys so he can embezzle money.

    Then, your PGP-encrypted message is:

    > The details about the embezzlement story I mentioned are here: https://dropbox.com/public/abcdef 
    > The password is the name of that song we both liked.  Lower case.  No punctuation.

    Then, when talking to the journalist, you give him the link, a song, and a second password that unlocks the hidden volume.

    That setup should be extremely secure.

    To get any actual content, the counter-intelligence guys would need to compel the journalist to give up the link AND his private PGP key AND disclose the song you'd talked about.

    Even then, they'd only see the fake story you guys made up.
    ```

    - u/Gurkenglas:
      ```
      There aren't that many songs, once they see the pgp cleartext they can just try all songs and see what produces readable output.

  You have x-ray glasses that let you see through one layer of something (a shirt, a door, a bag, etc). How would you use them?
  ```

  - u/Gurkenglas:
    ```
    A contraption of mirrors can send the same ray of light through the glasses multiple times. Might this strip away additional layers?

    A model that might describe how this works is that each photon that hits a barrier is replaced with an x-photon which has no effect on matter except xray glasses, which turn them back into photons (from which energy? perpetuum mobile?). The only problem with that is that [quantum physics gives us a way to tell whether two states of the universe are equal](http://lesswrong.com/lw/ph/can_you_prove_two_particles_are_identical/), even if they might only differ in the direction an otherwise undetectable x-photon might fly into.
    ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    Seems like it could be good for diagnostic purposes (at least if the "one layer" for a human isn't just a single layer of the epidermis, though even then that could be good for skin cancer), but there's a limit to how many people you could diagnose even if you had medical training and a steady supply of patients.

    How does it interact with transparency and reflection? You might be able to use it to get a look at the interior of stars or other planets in the solar system, though how deep "one layer" goes there would be highly ambiguous.

    You could become personally rich by cheating at poker or blackjack, though if somebody ever thought to check your glasses you'd be screwed. Win too much too quickly and you'd be very likely to find yourself down one pair of magical glasses.

    That actually brings up another point; is the x-ray effect only one-way, or can everyone else see the inside of my eyeballs? You'd assume it functioned as normal glass the other direction, but you never know.

    Also, do you *have* to see through one layer of everything? That'd make it potentially very difficult to navigate. You'd need to be constantly removing the glasses to find your way, and get used to seeing people's musculature all the time (or whatever constitutes "one layer").

    There's probably a research use for it, but it seems like using your eyes would generally be inferior to other imaging techniques in a research environment.
    ```

  - u/boomfarmer:
    ```
    What is defined as a layer? Is a woven cloth one layer, or is the outermost thread of its weave one layer? Is a jacket made of an outer cloth and an inner cloth one layer of clothing, or could you see through only the outer layer of cloth? Does coating something in paint count as a separate layer?
    ```
