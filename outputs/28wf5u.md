  Did... did you just make me enjoy the "how to catch a Pokemon" tutorial? What hath science wrought!

  But seriously, the descriptive language in that scene was wonderful. Well done.

  Hey all, welcome back! Here's the longest chapter yet, and happily still in line with my aim of one chapter a month. As usual, any and all feedback appreciated, there or here. Enjoy!

  Since the author asked me to, I'll post my review of the most recent (ninth) chapter of Pokemon: The Origin of Species, so they can address the issues in a more generally-feedback-friendly environment. 
  Please keep in mind that this is my very first post on reddit. I had and still have an irrational and severe dislike of this particular social network (the irony of admitting this in /r/rational is not lost on me). Furthermore the review was intended for ff.net and thus is more in line with that particular community's style and sensibilities, or at least as I see them. And lastly, prior to this quoted review I had already reviewed twice on previous chapters, which may account for any inappropriate joviality.

  > The development and coding of machines is… troublesome. It implies a lot, really, though I expect your version to give certain allowances to. For instance programmers need to have some programming language that interferes and overlaps to a sufficient degree with the digitisation issue of pokemon. Though that can simply be a case of "round shape fits round hole, regardless of tools used to get round shape". Hopefully that simile isn't too crude… Regardless, another point in that is the testing procedure. Programmers need to have a reasonable facsimile of pokemon code they can test their prototypes on, or have some back-up measure of the real pokemon code, otherwise they run the danger of seriously endangering the well-being of the physical pokemon. That of course assumes Pokémon has a more serious pokemon cruelty and testing lobby and policy than ours compared to animals.

  > And now that I think of it, this brings up another thing I always wondered: Do pokemon replace animals, or do they expand the world by a totally different offshoot of biology and evolution? There are some serious implications in both, really.
  Take the first case, for instance. Our understanding of evolution (mark the lack of capital E) implies that humans could be a special case of pokemon, once one applies Occams razor with enough rigour. Effectively supplanting the animal kingdom with pokemons. Which still raises a lot of questions of biology, like plants, do they Evolve? How does pollination work, or are all the colourful flowers a mere side effect and not an attractor of pollinators? If pokemon are pollinators, there's the size issue, for instance… 

  > The second case, pokemon being a different line of creature with regular animals also inhabiting the world, on the other hand raises the question: Where do they come from? Why the parallel development to regular animals (similarities to regular animal species like dogs, bisons, birds, jellyfish, …)? Is the whole Pokémon world a case of second civilisation after the first that created pokemon crashed apocalyptically? 
  A point I agree on with Blue and Red is the age issue. Personally I'd wait for the children to turn thirteen, I guess, since at that stage in their (psychological) development two years can be a lot. I wonder, though, if 15 is their age of consent – they can buy houses and enter contracts unsupervised? If so… well, you could always say the Pokémon world has years with about 400 days instead of the usual 350. That way they'd still be around the nominal age implied, but be just a tad in physical capability and mental maturity in the bell curve we have in mind, but still perfectly regular in that of the Pokémon world.

  > The psychoanalysing rule made me laugh out loud :)

  > I wonder if you'll apply the easy storage and/or transport technology you just demonstrated (the acquisition of the gas masks, delivered by pokeball derivative technology) to the world and economy at large. Easy transport of goods probably the world over is intriguing, especially without the whole consumption of fuel demonstrated. Though the whole process is probably powered by energy, and that might as easily be the biggest coal power plants ever built; it wouldn't fit the utopian streak of the story, though.

  > In regards to the insulated shoes… those I assume to be more prevalent due to a higher chance of electrical mishaps in Pokémon, simply by the abundance of electro type pokemons, but I wouldn't be surprised if insulated over-shoes, like socks for shoes or in the style of crampons, were widely sold. It's much easier to add to your equipment, especially in warmer climates, than an extra pair of shoes.

  > The bottom-up approach in planning to use his flute is very Red, while the middle-out or top-down seems very like a Blue thing to do, so congratulations on gibing your characters enough characterisation by now to allow me make such a judgement. Another thought comes to mind, though: the command versatility of songs versus the song likeness of commands. In both directions it can become very atonal, or very pretty, and everything in-between.

  > Just now I've been wondering, if you will in-or have already excluded the game mechanic of spending pokeballs, regardless of success in capture. I understand the need for the game mechanic, but can also see at least one technical option that could adapt that in-universe. Like a charge for instance, which is spent by trying to capture a pokemon. If it breaks free, the charge is still spent and the ball needs to be recharged in a pokemon centre. The Containers wouldn't have the same disadvantage since pokeballs are the specialised case, with specialised requirements, whereas Containers recharge by using the temperature gradients between storage and exterior or something like that.

  > The abundance and willingness of concussive stunning of pokemon is a bit worrisome, I have to admit. Sure, slowing a pokemon down by exhausting it is one thing, but Hamato swinging the weedle into a tree trunk could have easily caused a retardation or worse in a real animal. But I suspect pokemon are hardier than comparable animals (which in turn could ties into the "humans are pokemon-ish" hypothesis).

  > As always, this has been a very enjoyable read, and continues being a fine case of world-building :)

  I assume I will edit this post to rectify any quoting and formatting error I made.

    I tend to think of Reddit as a microcosm of the internet at large - there are some incredibly cool people doing excellent things, there's a bulk of normal folks reading/viewing and discussing, and there's an unpleasant undercurrent of trolls with a variety of bigoted views that they have the freedom to air under cover of anonymity.

    /r/rational is thankfully much more the former than the latter. So... yeah, welcome, we don't bite.

    Quite the detailed review, you make some good points.

    ```
    Oh wow, didn't realize this would be your first post :) Welcome, and hope your Reddit experience is a good one; the key from my perspective is to just subscribe to the good subreddits, and, as usual on the internet, ignore the trolls.

    On to the questions!

    >Programmers need to have a reasonable facsimile of pokemon code they can test their prototypes on, or have some back-up measure of the real pokemon code, otherwise they run the danger of seriously endangering the well-being of the physical pokemon. That of course assumes Pokémon has a more serious pokemon cruelty and testing lobby and policy than ours compared to animals.

    There absolutely exists a regulatory body and safeguards in the pokemon world to ensure that some programmer trying to make a quick name for themself doesn't test their code out on live pokemon without meeting some quality assurance standards. The computational power in the pokemon world is immense, so their modeling systems tend to be pretty realistic: most of the catastrophic errors that might occur from editing a pokemon's biology would be caught fairly quickly when testing in simulations.

    All that said, there definitely exist those who are willing to cut corners and fly under the radar to speed up the process, thinking little of the well being of the pokemon involved. These people are unlikely to be sadists, and more likely to simply view it as an extension of the usual scientific testing on pokemon to advance our understandings of biology and medicine.

    >And now that I think of it, this brings up another thing I always wondered: Do pokemon replace animals, or do they expand the world by a totally different offshoot of biology and evolution?

    Pokemon have completely replaced all non-plant life on earth. I can't say anything more than that without giving away the plot, but evolution by natural selection did indeed occur on earth at one point in history, and still does: it's simply no longer the sole means by which new species arise.

    >If so… well, you could always say the Pokémon world has years with about 400 days instead of the usual 350. That way they'd still be around the nominal age implied, but be just a tad in physical capability and mental maturity in the bell curve we have in mind, but still perfectly regular in that of the Pokémon world.

    Honestly, the way I see it is that a world as dangerous as pokemon, pretty much everyone is a few standard deviations more intelligent, creative, physically capable, and mature than the average person in our world.  Everyone else would have died long before the technology to capture and train pokemon became widespread.

    >Though the whole process is probably powered by energy, and that might as easily be the biggest coal power plants ever built; it wouldn't fit the utopian streak of the story, though.

    Pokemon are by far the greatest source of energy in their world: their physics are not our physics, or at the very least they're capable of bending them enough that a small rodent can create thousands of volts of electricity over its lifespan.  But they're also a bit more progressive, so renewable energy is the norm pretty much everywhere.  I don't know that I'd call their world "utopian," what with monsters running around leveling cities every other year, but it's definitely more technologically advanced in any number of ways.

    >In regards to the insulated shoes… those I assume to be more prevalent due to a higher chance of electrical mishaps in Pokémon, simply by the abundance of electro type pokemons, but I wouldn't be surprised if insulated over-shoes, like socks for shoes or in the style of crampons, were widely sold. It's much easier to add to your equipment, especially in warmer climates, than an extra pair of shoes.

    I was actually thinking of this, but the idea was just to use the insulating shoes as a replacement.  Anything as optional as crampons or socks would need to be worn all the time while in the wild so you'd be ready at any moment, which is far less convenient than even carrying around an extra pair of shoes.

    >I understand the need for the game mechanic, but can also see at least one technical option that could adapt that in-universe. Like a charge for instance, which is spent by trying to capture a pokemon. If it breaks free, the charge is still spent and the ball needs to be recharged in a pokemon centre.

    Personally I've always seen it as a purely game mechanic that pokemon can escape from their balls once captured at all. When inside, they're transmuted into energy and data: either the ball should be able to hold them, or not.  Stronger balls are capable of storing larger pokemon, or pokemon with more energy, but unless you try to use a pokeball on a snorlax or something, the balls won't break.

    > But I suspect pokemon are hardier than comparable animals (which in turn could ties into the "humans are pokemon-ish" hypothesis).

    This, and the medicine of that world is far more advanced :)

    As always, thanks for the questions, and glad you enjoyed the chapter!

But they're also a bit more progressive, so renewable energy is the norm pretty much everywhere.

      Please excuse my nagging, but I base this on having some expertise in this regard: it is easy to produce voltage, since it is simply a measure of differences in electrical charge. Static electricity for instance can easily go into the hundreds of volt of charge. 
      A more apt way to describe the power generative capabilities of Pokemon would include other units, like Joule and Watts (with the former simply describing spending/converting the power of 1 Watt for the duration of 1 Second).

      If pokemon are truly the biggest source of power in the Pokémon world, wouldn't that require huge farms of them, with subsequently larger farms for feed?
      I can reason, of course, there being a more decentralised system of power distribution, which would cut on the size necessary, but the humane treatment of the pokemon would require them to be given the chance to rest, have free days or days off during mating season, and more. 
      Let's speculate:
      We assume a pikachu can produce about 300 Watts steadily, for about four hours a day, without exhausting the individual. For a twenty-four hour cycle we need six individuals. If we furthermore assume greatly reduced power consumption (say a magnitude) compared to the US, then each citizen still needs half a pikachu, times six (to cover the day), times two (for off days, safety margin, …), giving us six pikachu for each person. 
      I gather by your statement that the capability of pokemon increases more on an exponential or logarithmical curve than a geometric one? That'd still cover a lot of pokemon that'd need to be tamed and given incentive to work.

      This whole conjecture by me supports your handling of the insulated shoes, though :)

        ```
        Why does everyone assume *electric* Pokemon would be used for power generation? Those'd be the *easiest* and *first* but the concept of a *power plant* is that it uses heavy equipment to convert from one form of energy to another. 

        What you'd use is whatever Pokemon have the greatest power output. Fire Pokemon can boil water. Most water Pokemon can create it and might do so at the top of a tall tower. There are plenty of super-strong, telekinetic, and huge-and-doesn't-need-food Pokemon to basically turn cranks. Some plant Pokemon can cause absurdly fast growth of biomass from nothing and you could just burn that. And this is not getting into what the weirder and more abstract attacks actually are, but since the creation of mass has already been shown there's almost no upper limit.

        And then there's the possibility, if containers actually DO turn matter into energy, of turning random rocks or seawater or something into energy and just discarding the information, using it directly for power instead.
        ```

        - u/Laborbuch:
          ```
          You raise a very good point, Armok. 

          Why *not* use all kinds of pokemon supplied, available energy? Ignoring the matter-energy-transformation for now, the very first argument for limiting power generation to electric pokemon would be efficiency. The electricity supplied by pokemon is already easy to handle and convert, whereas indirect means need to be converted into a transferable kind of energy – most likely electricity. If all things are being the same in pokemon matter/energy generation capabilities, electric kinds would have the simple advantage of having no or at least fewer losses to incur in the harvesting process. 

          That is not to say such round-about ways weren't used in the history of Pokémon. The time of steam and coal? Water and fire pokemon working in concert. 

          But the matter generation might be an issue, once pokemon are around long enough. For ball-parking, let's take water type pokemon of all kinds, make them roughly equivalent to dogs and do some back-of-the-envelope calculation: 
          80 M dogs in US
          mass  about 22 kg
          water generation capability is higher than actual use, so… say their mass a day on average. 

          80 million * 22 kg (for density of water this equals 22 litres) = 1760Ml

          1760 Megalitre, or 1,760,000 m^3 .Huh, I'd have expected more than a field of 1 square kilometre filled up to 1.76 metres with water. Even if water types provide 100 times that as an aggressive guess, it'd still be be less than 200m deep. Over time, though… in a year the volume of the conservative guess would be 2/3 of a cubic kilometres (aggressive: 64 km^3 ). Make that ten-thirtyfold to account for the whole world and we're in the region of 6.4 km^3 (conservative) to 2000 km^3 (aggressive; that's Lake Superior every sixth year, or the Black Sea every 283th) per year. And who knows when Pokémon replaced the natural wildlife. 10,000 years ago? 
          Conservative would make that ca. 1/8th of the Black Sea. But looking at the aggressive guess would make that an amount comparable to 1.5% the volume of global sea water. 

          So. A lot of matter. Sorry for going off on a tangent.

        Using pikachu may have been a bad example, since it's a mammal and thus easier to empathize with. Not to say that they wouldn't be used for energy if needed, but most electric farms in the pokemon world would use lower order pokemon like voltorb/electrode and magnemite/magneton, which are much less intelligent and easier to care for.

        Not to say it's necessarily always humane to round up thousands of voltorbs and treat them like living batteries, any more than the way we treat cattle in our world is, but for better or worse, they also see the "manmade" pokemon (pokemon that only started appearing after manmade objects they mimic, which would include things like trubbish) in a more proprietary way, easier to rationalize using as they see fit.

          (…)

          > the necessary number of electric pokemon per person also skyrockets. (by rp20)

          The intent of my guesstimating was ball-parking the amount of pokemon needed to get some reliable power supply running. To compensate for a significantly higher energy consumption, as per matter-energy-transformator requirement, you could simply adjust for a magnitude, and ballpark it back down by using less humanly empathised pokemon like voltorb. Add to that the assumed differences in power generation capabilities of the various kinds of pokemon and it might come back down to comparable numbers once taken both changes into account.

          It might even be more feasible to use higher tier evolved pokemon since they may supply or generate a more steady flow of electricity while being less active, reducing the strain or or need to actually work low-tier pokemon for comparable results. If this were true, it would decrease the net strain on pokemon as a whole; lower numbers providing equal to or more power at less discomfort. 
          At the moment I'm thinking of the needs for the infrastructure to accommodate pokemon generated power, and the feeling I have based on my experience doesn't look good. I am assuming the world hasn't the tech to capture lightning effectively? Because that is what I always assumed most of the electro attacks to be, something akin to directed lightning. This would still require enormous voltages to bridge the insulating air. Interestingly enough a solution arises addressing both the necessary voltages as well as aiming such attacks: ionisation. A tunnel of ionised air greatly reduces the required voltage; it can be induced by various means, opening up the aiming; it is a step ahead of the actual lightning, making it possible for pokemon to seem to avoid the lightning while they actually flee the ionisation trail. Though it doesn't need to be ionisation, actually, any means that reliably reduces the voltage needed to crack the insulation between pokemon and target is game.

          To address rp20, the pokemon might be the necessary step needed to accomplish the future technologies. Coal power was the easy step for us to take from which we might feasibly gain the means to an effectively unlimited power source (at least for the foreseeable future). In a sense like an exothermic chemical reaction, with coal and generally current power generation providing the initiating energy and once we have bio-power and all the other renewable energy source the reaction is self-sustaining.

            This is a good point, as there are definitely pokemon capable of calling actual lightning that would be a huge boon to energy production with the right technology to harness it. Most electric attacks are not nearly as powerful as a lightning bolt, but the more evolved pokemon could definitely use that as their major contribution to energy productin.
            ```

            - u/Laborbuch:
              ```
              That harnessing would still require tremendous technological effort. In our world one of the impossibilities to do that is the unpredictability of lightning strikes, in power range, location and other parameters; those would obviously be less / not relevant for tamed pokemon.
              Of the top of my head I can only think of one method to effectively utilise lightning as a power source, and that is indirectly. If it were used electrolytically with specifically chosen reactants the products of such reactions might react back to the original reactants (releasing heat, for instance). You'd have a double loss to energy transfer in this case (lightning+reactants to products, products to reactants+energy), sure, but it might work, depending on tech level. 
              A more physical approach might be charging the biggest capacitor ever and gradually using that charge. This is more of an engineering problem than a scientific one.

              Be that as it may, I actually thought in a different vein. I remember in the anime at some point they stuck suction caps to Pikachu's cheeks and it might have powered something, but I'm not sure. This illustrates my idea quite well, though; you don't need to use lightning, unless the pokemon physique is bizarrely off-charts. It ought to suffice to drain the charge off the pokemon as it builds up. Like I said in my previous comment, the pokemon attacks seem to be mostly lightning, so constituted of high voltage with decent amperage. I deem it unlikely pokemon are capable of instantaneously generating a charge of that magnitude, or always keeping one handy. (This is of course an assumption I make based on my knowledge of biology, which makes it biased in regards to pokemon biology.) More likely than not they build up the charge as needed, the energy being supplied by their body by metabolites. As those get used up, the pokemon fatigue. 
              If one can train the pokemon to build up a low charge, one their metabolism can keep maintaining even once we drain it, we're set. It might even be a relatively level of voltage thus produced, though it would still need to be smoothed for consumer use and such.

              And since I am already on the topic, let me speculate further on the electro capabilities of pokemon.

              Based on my assumption before (building up a charge as needed instead of maintaining one at the ready) I assume to be two-three kinds of organs in of note in electro-pokemon: a charger and a container and a preparer. 
              The charger would, as the name implies, supply base voltage and amperage, or in other words, power the process actually giving the electro-pokemon their unique capabilities. It is connected to the next organ by something highly conductive. 
              The container would be the biological equivalent of a hybrid capacitor / inductor. It would hold the charge supplied by the charger. It's make-up would require an insulating tissue on the outer layer that would protect the pokemon from its own charge. 
              The preparer might be close to the container, but has to be at least connected to it in some facility. The reason for this is the function it fulfils: It reduces the (electrical) resistance to the target, or increases the conductivity, it's really all the same. It might be some kind of string that'd ionise the air around it (high-frequent voltage changes, for instance, or some highly ionising reaction with air, …), to name one example.
              There are multiple ways to accomplish either, really, and for the most part I'm talking about function, not mechanism of those organs. 
              Furthermore it can be taken for granted electro-pokemon have either a highly conductive exterior, making electrical attacks ineffective; a highly reduced amount of electrolytes or other physiological means to deal with electrical charges (my favourite); or something different.

              Based on this speculation I might actually speculate further (this is bat country, I know): The capacity of charger and container might correlate with the natural environment and behaviour of the pokemon in question. Herd electro-pokemon like magnemite would be weaker, since they could voltron their defence capabilities (highly conductive skin?). Pokemon in (predatory) packs would be intermediate (using electro attacks for hunt, to defend hunting grounds against rivalling packs, …). Pokemon living mostly solitary lives I would place highest in capability, simply due to the danger, using electro as defence and offence for that having to gap the biggest distance by their attacks.

              Aaand reading on Bulbapedia on Jolteon just implied every cell taking part in the build-up, making at the very least the charger organ nothing more than intellectual navel-gazing. Oh well.
              ```

It might even be a relatively level of voltage thus produced, though it would still need to be smoothed for consumer use and such.

                This makes good sense, and fits in game terms of pokemon running out of "PP" or energy for their attacks

                They should also be able to safely store that charge between uses: otherwise the amount of time it would take for a pokemon to charge up a small thundershock might be prohibitive for combat purposes.

                >Aaand reading on Bulbapedia on Jolteon just implied every cell taking part in the build-up, making at the very least the charger organ nothing more than intellectual navel-gazing. Oh well. 

                Hahaha. Don't worry, I've had those moments at least a dozen times already :P This is ridiculously tricky work, and there are still many pokemon I haven't figured out how to handle rationally (pokemon that come in bunches, for example, like exeggcute) without contradicting established rules.  The creators of pokemon were notoriously thoughtless and haphazard in their handling of their world and how it works, and there aren't even any attempts at canon answers to most of these questions, let alone bad ones.

                That said, your examination shouldn't be considered a waste, as I still find discussion on these issues interesting and informative :) My expertise is in psychology, and I'm simply an eager student trying to cobble together the most rational answers I can when it comes to biology, chemistry or physics, so it's much appreciated!

                  Well, I didn't address this since I forgot to, but the container I thought of being, well, multi-storage to a degree. Not many, but a few. It would be evolutionary consistent with the way our muscles work, and the fuel supplied to them (there are some, all running parallel with different efficiency peaks at different times). I thought they'd have about one or two instant charges in the container, by then the charger would start up supplying enough power and they could use charges with relative abundance, but after a minute you'd note their increasing breathing and the frequency and power level would decrease, but remain at a balance.

                  You'd simply want to have a power you're capable of and rely on to be on your beck and call instantly. Electro is a major investment, biologically speaking, so they'd have some measure for instant access, I guess.

                  I have an idea on the communal individuals, as self-contradictory those seem to be (two cases: Rat-king; true individual, apparent commune), and might be able to advise you with the consistency and science issue of the biological side, if such is wanted. Keep in mind though, that I don't have my degree in biology, yet.

                    Exeggcute are distinct organisms. It's okay for them to be psychically linked, but there's mention in canon of them leaving and joining herds.  So it's not like they're all biologically twins for the pokeball to be willing to count them as one. And it can't be a matter of mass, because six exeggcute weigh more than two pidgey. It makes absolutely no sense that pokeballs treat exeggcute as one being.

                    So far, I think I'll have to ignore the mention of them each being unique individuals for it to make any sense.

                      After having thought a bit on that, I can hazard a guess what *might* work. 

                      But first, why would you think the identical sextuplets not being reasonable? Say their biological make-up requires the offspring to be sextuplets. Only due to the herd issue? Those herds might simply be a stage in their social development leading to mating, their puberty, so to speak. Exeggcutes disbanding and joining different herds or groups would make sense from a genetical and biological standpoint.

                      The thought I originally had was more in line with social insects, though. In bees for instance workers are more related to other workers than compared to actual sisters and even less to drones. (That's due to a quirk in genetics)
                      Based on that I speculated for the sextuplet group to be something akin to a swarm without a queen. 

                      Looking at the canon (according to Bulbapedia) that doesn't seem to be the case, though. I'd have to buckle down something fierce to figure out a way to fuse canon and biology, really.

                        Maybe their genetics shift to match the herd they're in? So they mix herds, lay a new egg, and then over time the genetics of the entire herd stabilize into a new one?
                        ```

                          That is a good idea, but genetics don't shift on an individual level, at least not on an appreciable level. And canon says the reproduction/evolution cycle is something like this:
                          Exeggcutes gather to a congregation of six. For fun reasons, let's call that group an orgy. Expose the orgy to a leaf stone(*) and the orgy evolves to a singular exeggutor with multiple heads. I suppose at least one head is formed at this point. More heads grow gradually and once of sufficient size they drop, forming the single exeggcutes. 

                          By that description the heads and exeggcutes can be likened to seeds, actually. If we spin that further, it would be feasible for the exeggcutes to be haploid seeds, whereas exeggutor have a hexaploid genome. Essentially the whole stick would be akin to plant species with an alternation of generations, in this case with exeggcutors being gametophytes (*n* chromosomes) and exeggutors being sporophytes (*6n* chromosomes). 

                          (The telepathy issue though… I'd personally disregard that for the most part. Have the exeggcutes talk in poke-talk with each other, like the heads of the adults do. I'm not sure if I would allow for telepathy in Pokémon at all, but can see why you'd go that route. In that case I'd limit it to the associated types, though.)

                          If we go by my proposed explanation… the herds would be the natural state of exeggcutor behaviour, I think. Looking for mates, the chances are higher in such big groups to find the five fitting to the individual requirements compared to solitary movement. There's also the safety issue, of course. The orgy (i.e. 6 exeggcutor communion) would work as a, well, sub-herd, or trial relationship. A pre-stage, to work everything out biochemically. Add a leaf stone and the conception stage takes place, forming exeggutor. It also instantaneously forms new seeds (= heads), probably with other personalities than those forming the original orgy.

                          (*) Leaf and other evolutionary stones might work by supplying a mineral that activates very specific enzymes (or supplies building material for these) in the pokemon body, triggering the evolving step.

                            The canon lifecycles are a bit weird, since most organic pokemon basically just comes from eggs, but I'm definitely not sticking to that. I like your proposal a lot :)  They're going to be telepathic in the most basic sense: very hive-mind. No pokemon are as smart as they are in the cartoon, and the psychic ones basically can share emotions or very basic impulses.

                              I have to disagree in some capacity with you. Yes, the life cycles are pretty weird (which is me at least using a stand-in for more drastic language). Yes, telepathy screw with a lot, which is the exact reason I don't like that ability in pokemon, because it is obviously high-grade nonsense. Bad writing, in a sense (*). But I always tok the eggs to be a general term more than a biological one – it oughtn't be eggs per se, but rather a catch-all name for prenatal stages of the pokemon in their development.

                              (*) For that reason I want to point out that aptly reading body language and non-verbal cues in species are essentially the same as empathy (on a same species level) in the sense it is understood in science-fiction, or at least something like Star Trek. Counsellor Troi had the magical ability to discern the emotional state of beings, or communities, of species she didn't know. Great. But for same species specimen regular individuals will work fine to tell you that, based on analysing a furrowed brow and curled lips showing teeth, the human in question is very likely angry.

                              Be that as it may, I don't intend to keep you from writing – I certainly know this conversation, while interesting, for me at least cut into my schedule in a not wholly unwelcome manner. Not to say I didn't enjoy the time spent speculating on the biology of pokemon (I *really* did), but there are other things in my head, begging to be put into reality. So I'l cut back a bit and only check back once a day. Hopefully.

                              ;D

                                Yes, they're definitely not "eggs" in the sense that we use the term.

                                >Yes, telepathy screw with a lot, which is the exact reason I don't like that ability in pokemon, because it is obviously high-grade nonsense.

                                What makes a telepthic link more valuable than simply super-powerful observation and empathy is that a telepathic link could work over long distances, or when not able to visually observe the other person.

                                As much of a headache as it might be, psychic powers are kind of a big part of pokemon. Not just telepathy, but also things like telekinesis. It's one of the major types of pokemon in the world, and removing or re-interpreting it to not be what it is would be like EY turning leglimensy and occlumensy into just reading faces for HPMOR, or for Alicorn to remove Alice Cullen's ability to see the future and soften it to just "calculating probabilities."

                                For me the goal of rationalfic isn't to remove fantastic elements: it's to make them as realistic as possible while staying as true to the source material as possible. Obviously there's some subjective wiggle room there, but the golden standard is that the "magic" is understandable and consistent.  What goes to the chopping block are those things that are completely irreconcilable with logic or good storytelling, and I don't think telepathy quite meets that mark.

                                  Oh, that's not what I meant, not at all. Telepathy and other psychic phenomena being a thing are one of the building blocks of Pokémon and you don't remove stones in the foundation of your building if you don't want to risk it all coming loose and crashing down.

                                  No, I (personally) would have limited psychic moves to pokemon of that type, though the move shadow claw being available to charmander certainly implies there not being any real objection. But in the case of exeggcutes, well… I don't see a reason for the orgy to be telepathically linked when their growing forms talk to each other (while still connected to exeggutor). I occamed their telepathy, so to speak.

                                  Anyway, I wouldn't try to remove the mythical chakra from Naruto, for instance, since it is a much too ingrained concept to that universe and removal would screw up everything that world is about. Though playing and trying to come up with solutions or theoretical foundations to the actions shown would certainly be interesting – the same you do with your story and Pokémon, really. 

                                  And to re-iterate from my previous comment: I really liked speculating on the biology, so of course you're free to use my speculation as you see fit. (And even if I didn't give my assent, it's all fan fiction, either way.)

  I was wondering if you would restrict Pokemon to four moves like in the games, or allow them to expand their movesets like in the anime?

  You seem to have many of your ideas based off the games, but part of me feels like that would make the story less flexible

  Thanks and I've been waiting for this to come out for a while. You do some great work.

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    The way I see it the move restriction is entirely a game conceit, for tactical reasons more than anything, so I have no intention of restricting pokemon moves to four :) Charmander isn't going to forget how to scratch an opponent just because he learned how to use flamethrower.

    That said, there might be a "core" set of moves that most trainers use for their pokemon as a matter of what's reinforced the most often.  How wide a pool that is depends entirely on how smart the pokemon is (so how many commands they can remember) and how dedicated the trainer is (for how much effort they put into the training).
    ```

    - u/Ccnitro:
      ```
      That helps a lot. What you said actually makes a lot more sense than my thought process, as a Pokemon wouldn't have partial amnesia from learning something knew. 

      The thought occurred to me when reading about the Shadow Claw TM and I was thinking if as the moves got more advanced, the weaker or simpler moves would just be forgotten. But thank you, and keep up the great work.

  I really enjoy this fic. The discussions and worldbuilding to make the Pokemon world more rational are really nice to see, and my only complaint is having to wait a month for each chapter :)
  By the time you're done, a few years might have passed, and that's presuming you only do Kanto.
  That brings up a good point, actually. Will you do the other regions, with either the current MC's or the game MC's as protagonists?

    Thanks, glad you're enjoying it!

    Hopefully at some point I can speed up my writing table, but right now most of my time is taken up by work, a novel I'm hoping to get published soon, and a board game that I'm trying to get on kickstarter.

    So far I've only got a rough idea of a story for Gold/Silver, using that game's MCs as the main focus, but as for Hoenn, the events of Ruby/Sapphire apparently occur at the same time as Red/Blue according to a number of sources online, so there may be some overlap there :)
