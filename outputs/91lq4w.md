## Dynasty's Ghost Chapters 4 - 7; Rebels Can't Go Home Chapters 1 - 11; Extra Recommendation

### Post:

So this is a bit of a grab bag. [*Dynasty's Ghost*](https://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/19159/dynastys-ghost), the web fiction I mentioned two weeks ago, is proceeding apace, and, taking advantage of how far ahead I worked on that piece, I've begun a second web fiction on r/HFY called [*Rebels Can't Go Home*](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/8yvx4a/rebels_cant_go_home/), which features a hunter-gatherer teaming up with an expeditionary force that came from the stars. I also wanted to continue the pattern I set up last time, and suggest a rational-relevant web fiction I had absolutely nothing to do with. Consider [*Conquest*](http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Fanfic/Conquest/index.html), a Star Wars/Star Trek crossover that explores differences between those universes at some length.

Finally, to make this post more applicable to r/rational, I had a bit of fun writing some discussion questions for posted chapters of *Dynasty's Ghost* that involve analysis of character choices. Reading them (under the spoilers) might make the web fiction more interesting.
