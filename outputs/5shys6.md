## [RT] [HF] [D] Mother of Learning : Unresolved plot points 2 - resolve harder

### Post:

A while back I made [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4991lv/rt_hf_d_mother_of_learning_unresolved_plot_points/), making a list of things that have been mentioned, but not yet resolved/used in the story. I think it's time for a new list like that. We can also see what has been resolved since then.

Resolved:

* Aranea treasury still hasn't been opened; Now opened!

* Grey hunter was never killed; Murdered, packaged and sold for potion materials.

* Zorian didn't sign an apprenticeship contract with any battlemage; All availible secrets have been stolen in the last update if my memory serves.

* Time research facility wasn't assaulted yet; They make good use of it now.

* Veyers Boranova's foreshadowing finally got it's share of attention. 

* Akoja said she wanted to tell Zorian something- presumably just that she has a crush on him, but who knows?; Solved!

* The Sovereign Gate - mentioned by Vani, presumably a metaphor for a previous time loop. Could it be a real physical gate activated at some point by Zach?; Gate found and used.

Unresolved:

* Familiar bonds were mentioned, but Zorian still has no familiar

* Grey hunter eggs were never stolen and nothing was done with them(Silverlake/familiar bond/something else); This is probably quite close to being resolved.

* Potion that gives soulsight was not discovered/made/used; However, Zorian did make a lot of progress in that regard, and soul magic in general has been getting a lot of use.

* Zorian didn't contact the healer-empath

* 3-eyed white wolf hasn't been killed yet

* Zorian still doesn't use firearms(except for that one time he shot RR), even though they were mentioned a bunch of times as a good anti-mage weapon and he even bought a rifle that one time

* It was mentioned that Zorian doesn't wake up at the exact start of the time loop, and nothing came of it.

* Mystery not resolved: why do certain Ironbeaks hate invaders? This one could be an important clue.

* Estin's ability to move earth and other bloodlines.

* In the beginning, Zorian mentions he always wanted to see the engine room of a train

* Zorian's father has never appeared in the narrative, but was described, same as Damien

* Why did Sudomir have an undead dragon?

* Living metal rounds haven't yet been used by the protagonists.

* What was the full story behind the ghost serpent? How did the previous loopers "cause it to fall"?

* This quote: "The time travel spell was powered by love, of all things â€“ what kind of magic was that?" didn't get resolved yet.

Obvious major plot points related to Keys that determine where Z&Z might go next:

* Zorian's brother never made an appearance (the powerful one); They are currently working on getting to Koth, and I am betting he will be closely involved in finding the key (if he doesn't have it already)

* Key in the Royal treasury will require a mix of sneaking around and blasting to hell and back. Personally, I think they should involve Xvim and Alanic in this.

* Key on QI's head will require either sneaking (by finding QI before the invasion and catching him off-guard), or serious blasting (probably something alike that coin trick Zorian once pulled, except scaled upwards by a factor of 100). Former solution would likely involve simulacrums infiltrating the cult, while latter would be centered around Kael and serious spell formula work.

So, thoughts? Is there anything you know that I have missed?

      Remember the mayor? He experimented in shifters/soul magic and used a human soul to bond with a wolf. Its not like other wolf shifters who turn into wolf and have inherited some wolf intuition.

  Others include:

  - Temporary markers. Possible connection to Red Robe gaining loop access?
  - Zach's amnesia + compulsion(s).
  - Zenomir Olgai the polyglot. Why did speaking with him get Zorian assassinated? Is he a cultist (and how much does he know), or did he pass the info on to the wrong person (and presumably get himself killed too)?
  - Zorian's unresolved hurt re Taiven, which almost put a lasting wedge in their friendship.
  - Curing Imaya. Or perhaps she will adopt one of the shifter children whose parents couldn't be saved?
  - The Immortal Eleven. Their existence was confirmed on the blog - they made themselves a potion of endless youth - but details restricted for plot reasons.
  - Did Zach have deeper reasons for killing a dragon, not just "because I can"? He doesn't seem to have discussed the details of his victory with Zorian, which would seem odd if he did it for bragging rights.
  - Plus, of course, major plot points like, How can both of them get out despite the fact that Zorian's original body already contains a soul? Is Red Robe really Veyers? How can they stop the real invasion, which will add a horde of summoned demons to everything else?

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > Temporary markers

    You know, Zorian and Kael discussed a while back (chapter 39) how Red Robe could be looping, and Zorian dismissed the idea that he could be implanting memory packets in Zach, since he's active at the start of the loop, without any apparent intervention from Zach.

    Temporary markers offer a potential explanation for this. What if RR was compelling Zach to place a temporary marker on him as soon as the old one broke down?

    It's not entirely clear whether the temporary marker means you get a total of 5 resets/six months, or six resets/7 months, but either way, on his final iteration, the temporary marker has presumably dissolved, so there's theoretically no reason he couldn't be marked again. Being a soul mage and all, he might even be able to hurry it up and wipe a marker that was about to expire, ready for a fresh one. He could thus achieve continuity between one temporary marker and the next.

    This could explain his bathroom assault on Zach. The events of chapter 26 made Zach aware of him, and aware that he's an enemy, so RR wasn't able to surreptitiously approach him to get his marker updated any more. Probably he was running out of iterations, and made a final attempt to regain control of Zach, but the boy got away, so he escaped before his marker broke down.

    This theory doesn't explain why the Guardian would think he had a Controller marker and let him out. On the other hand, the Guardian gave a bit of a non-answer when asked about whether RR had a Controller marker, as if it was restating an expectation rather than an observation - a bit like when Zorian asked it how many people were in the control room, and it replied that "Only the Controller can reach this place." I wouldn't be surprised if there was some way it could be fooled.
    ```

    - u/Cheese_Ninja:
      ```
      Zorian thinks that with RR being a non-empath, RR's unstructured mind magic was very limited in what it could do to Zach. Searching for information (such as about the aranea), erasing Zach's memory of Veyers, and placing a compulsion to dismiss mentions of Veyers should be his very limit.  RR shouldn't have the capability of compelling Zach to do something as complex as give him a temporary marker. (Something Zach himself doesn't know how to do, that very likely involves a degree of soul sense, which Zach had apparently never developed.)

      So, I've got a newish Red Robe that isn't total garbage. I mean, it still has a lot of bad points, but that's kind of unavoidable. Felt like putting it down somewhere before the new chapter comes out in case I'm right about anything.

      So I think RR cheated or gained his marker some other way, but it still must have been different from Zach and Zorian's, since he never used the locator ritual spell to find Zorian. I still don't have a good theory on the how for this, but I think it required knowledge of the loop/marker/Sovereign's Gate that no modern mage had.

      So it might sound dumb that my current RR theory (Is this my 3rd or 4th now?) is that RR is Veyers. Or rather, partially Veyers? 

      The whole "experimental ritual to awaken his bloodline" thing probably either directly exposed him/his soul to takeover/fusion by another, more ancient being, or just made him very vulnerable to such an attack. Maybe it was something like a Soul Bond with a powerful ancient Fire Elemental? 

      What other reason does RR have to prioritize the erasure of Veyers from Zach's memory above all else? 

      Could part of the reason the 1st Arc spend a few chapters on Soul Bonds because it would be relevant later? Perhaps Veyers' unstable behavior in the past years was because of a foreign influence upon him that grew stronger as time passed. This could also explain how a Veyers!RR would have the skills and knowledge necessary from the beginning of the loops.

      It also explains why Veyers got thrown out of school and seemingly disappeared without a trace conveniently just before the loop began. Not!Veyers somehow triggered the early activation of the Gate and ensured his own marker's existence. He couldn't simply kill Zach, because Zach was still the true Controller, and necessary for the function of loop. 

      And something that always bothered me was Zach's disappearance in Zorian's loops 2-7, and recently how similar it was to Veyer's own disappearance, which makes sense if RR kidnapped an unconscious Zach at the beginning of each of the loops and used some sort of trick to keep him unconscious for the remainder, but was unwilling to that on his own in every loop because the risk of causing an early restart was too high.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Red Robe doesn't necessarily have to plant a complex compulsion in Zach. He could just plant a suggestion that he is "perfectly normal, nothing to see here," so that he can approach Zach every six months and dominate him. Domination doesn't make any lasting changes, so the marker might well ignore it, especially if it's unstructured. And Zach appears to have some weak compulsion on him, to dismiss the topic of Veyers, so we know RR can do that.

        That would also explain why it broke down: a mere suggestion wasn't enough to overcome Zach's suspicion once he knew about the existence of RR, and particularly once they fought. If RR could have wiped his memories, things could have stabilized, but the threat of the aranea meant he didn't hang around for that, and then Zach started protecting himself from divination. RR still ambushed him in the places he knew Zach might go, but both attacks failed, and then, I suspect, time was up. So he got out while the getting was good.

        Veyers does fit the theory well in general. If you want someone to completely ignore you, then making them completely forget you is a good start. It would especially make sense for Veyers, being Zach's enemy. But I don't think soul bonds will let you loop. They're just not that rigid a connection IMO.
        ```

        - u/Cheese_Ninja:
          ```
          So then for loops 2-7 do you think that RR had to allow Zach to awaken to refresh the temporary marker? That's about the time limit for a temp marker.

          I don't think that a soul bond itself would let RR loop either. I just think the only beings with knowledge about the Gate and capability to insert themselves into the loop would be from at least several hundred years ago and more powerful than Veyers himself. I think the makeshift ritual to awaken his bloodline exposed him to such a being, possibly in the form of a soul bond.  Just plain Veyers shouldn't have been competent enough to become RR.
          ```

- u/ODIN_ALL_FATHER:
  ```
  I have a theory on RR=Veyers that didn't seem to have a good place to post and this seems like a good place!

  In the first few loops Zach is missing, not just missing but no one can find him including his caretaker and a meagerly skilled Zorion. Then much later we find out that when interacting with the sovereign gate (SG) that the avatar can pull souls into the SG for safe keeping. Thus I think what happened to Zach was that the SG was keeping his soul with the gate while it self-repaired the damage dealt by the lich. Then it didn't bother to create Zach's body since he isn't a copy and it would just die without Zach's soul to inhabit it.

  This applies to Veyers because I think when Veyers convinced the SG to let him leave it no longer had a reason to create Veyers's body for the same reason it never bothered to create Zach's.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure that excluding an unnecessary body is *more* effort than just faithfully reproducing the template. Because the aranea bodies still get created.

    If Veyers is RR, then I'd say that either his body is now a soulless husk in some out-of-the-way location (wherever he was when the loop started, which no-one seems to know), or he specifically altered the template to exclude it. Which both he and the Guardian had no reason to do, both expecting the loop to collapse upon the Controller's exit.

    If Veyers is not RR, his body might still be a hidden husk, or he might be alive and held by the cult or something.
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  > Potion that gives soulsight

  Not possible inside the loop, *but* blood magic is capable of copying such abilities from another person (like Kael).

  > Familiar bonds

  Too dangerous for a Controller. Zach would probably trip the reset, and Zorian might damage his marker further and stop looping. For the same reason, they shouldn't try to become shifters.
  ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  We still don't know why Zach has abnormal mana reserves, with inhuman size and yet decent control.
  ```

- u/Sidereal529:
  ```
  Fortov. In any given timeloop, Zorian has *never* tried to save him during the invasion. Maybe things will get better between them after Zorian encounters Daimen.

  Nice work on tracking these plot threads \^.^
  ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  > Mystery not resolved: why do certain Ironbeaks hate invaders? This one could be an important clue.

  There was some info on that somewhere around assault on the zombie mansion. I remember Sudomir holds their hatchlings hostage and uses some domination spells on the alphas, so I inferred that if Zorian mind controls said alpha it resets Sudomir's control and their true intentions are revealed. However most of the ironbeaks are not in the know and don't hold a grudge against invaders.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > if Zorian mind controls said alpha it resets Sudomir's control

    Not quite. The iron beaks are smart enough to understand a hostage situation, so they all hate the invaders, but they're not smart enough to realize that their leaders are subverted, so they generally play along.

    There just happen to be a few individuals that are independent-minded and/or bloodthirsty enough that when Zorian suggests actually attacking the invaders, they run with it.
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  Maybe Zorian's forays into making transformation potions?
  ```

- u/SpeculativeFiction:
  ```
  I've just reread most of mother of learning, and it's been mentioned that the school dance was basically an excuse for an important meeting between different nations, but we never really found out exactly what is was.

  The planar alignment doesn't seem to be it. I wonder if the old alliance of Eldemar was tentatively being slightly reinstated, which is part of why the Ibasans attacked early?

  As for the identity of Red Robe, the Simulacrum idea has merits, but also issues.

  Problems:

  1) Red Robe made a simulacrum of himself when he killed the Aranea, which seems like it might not be possible for a simulacrum to do.

  2) He was explicitly "bloodied" by a group of students, and simulacrums don't have blood. It *could* just be a figure of speech though.

  Merits:

  1) Zach, the man so desperate for company that he tried to convince hundreds of people in Cyoria he was a time traveler, *supposedly* thought little of the Simulacrum spell. This really doesn't make sense to me--it feels like his memories and inclinations have been edited.

  2) A simulacrum theoretically wouldn't need a marker to be pulled back through the time loop. It should already be connected to Zach. The author has been very careful to not really have Zorian experiment with long-lived simulacrums, or whether they get looped with him.

  3) We've been shown that Simulacrums can diverge from their creator pretty early, and told they may go crazy and try to murder/replace them.

  >Zorian's father has never appeared in the narrative, but was described, same as Damien

  He sort of does, after Zorian was attacked by the Sword Divers web, he was bedridded for three days. His father apparently sneeringly called him his "Fainting son", but it wasn't directly shown.

  I also have a theory about Zach's reserves. We don't necessarily know he had them before the loop--his memory is edited and spotty, and he could have just had marginally better reserves than average, and been lazy like Benisek.

  The time loop can copy souls, apparently. Why not copy the soul of the original looper 6-10 times or so, and merge them all together? This would expand their mana reserves dramatically without crippling their shaping ability, and additionally fulfill the purpose of making the looper stronger.

  I can't think of anything else that explains his ludicrous reserves that have no attendant loss in shaping skills. 

  Zorian might theoretically be able to double his reserves by merging with his original self's soul once he escapes the loop.
  ```

- u/abcd_z:
  ```
  A minor note, but will we ever see a three-eyed wolf?  In Ch. 5 Zorian mentions that his dreams are often full of weirdness like talking birds, floating pyramids, and three-eyed wolves.  Empaths are supposed to have the occasional  prophetic dream, and we've already seen a talking bird and a floating pyramid (of glass marbles, under Xvim's tutelage).

  Edit: we've seen the talking bird, not the 3-eyed wolf.  My bad.
  ```
