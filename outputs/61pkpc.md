  So, the rules of narrative are in full effect here, right? Malia won the placebomantic duel because she had a cooler speech and origin story than Dylan's. Then she died anyway because Erica had her own dramatic, defiant moment that acted as the culmination of her personal arc. Given that narrative logic is king in this chapter...can we pretty much assume that Mark, the one guy whom we didn't actually *see* die, miraculously survived?

  Also, a lot of people have theorized that Robin West is TOK. Does the reveal that she is in hell--or at least that she was at the time of Malia's birth--joss that theory? Is it possible that she escaped? Does anyone remember what the timeline was re: when she died and when TOK showed up?

    To be more specific: Malia won because she managed to present herself as an underdog. Dylan's story makes him come off as a spoiled brat. Given his mastery of the narrative, I'm surprised he didn't realise it.

    Now that I think of it, it looks to me as if he actually *wanted* to die. Remember when he swore the oath to Mark? He didn't hesitate *that much*, and it may have been mostly to maintain character.

    Wait... don't we know someone who's tried that before...?

    > “Would you like to get this over with and kill me now?” he asked. “Or do we have to do it the hard way?”

    Wait, wait...

    > “Good,” said Thamiel. “I like deals. But just so you know, my BATNA is **killing you, wearing your body like a suit, and slowly poisoning the lives of everyone you have ever loved** until they scream for death.”

    Wait, wait, wait...

    > And all my life, I wanted, needed, to convince people that the world was on fire all around them. **Well, now it’s the apocalypse, and I couldn’t be happier. And before I walk into the flames with a giant grin on my face**, I’m going to kill the figurehead of the old order, Ms. Follow-The-Rules-And-Ignore-The-Human-Cost herself. So come on. Give me your best shot.

    Wait, wait, wait, wait...

    > And as the flames climbed high into the night
    >
    > To light the sacrificial rite
    >
    > **I saw Satan laughing with delight**
    >
    > The day the music died

    So here goes my crackpot theory: Malia's story is true. Thamiel was inhabiting Dylan's body, and wanted to die and get back to Hell; but he also wanted to bring Malia back under his control. For some reason Dylan/Thamiel couldn't just assassinate her on his own; but when he met Erica, he realised she would be capable of doing it. Everything went just as planned.
    ```

      ```
      Great point about Malia being the underdog! The Dylan-is-Thamiel theory seems farfetched--I'm not convinced that Thamiel couldn't just kill himself, the reason he wanted Uriel to do it was to make him use up divine energy--but hey, we'll see.
      ```

      - u/___ratanon___:
        ```
        After helping Robin summon Thamiel, the real Dylan Alvarez, curious to know what she wanted, decided to summon him on his own. The summoning ritual trapped Thamiel in Dylan's body. Or something.

        Yeah, it is somewhat far-fetched. But still, there's something fishy about Dylan being defeated this *easily*.
        ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      Haha! The thought that Dylan = Thamiel has occurred to me too. Several times. One is a powerful psychopathic terrorist with mastery of names and a talent for lying. The other is also a powerful psychopath who inspires terror with a mastery of names and a talent for lying. Something about the way he manipulates good people into doing evil things on his behalf and being stuck serving him whether they want to or not...coincidence?
      ```

      - u/LeifCarrotson:
        ```
        Nothing is a coincidence.
        ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Not necessarily. TOK is supposed to have returned from the dead, right?
    ```

  - u/ForgottenToupee:
    ```
    Robin died, TCK died a year later to TOK. I don't remember when TOK showed up exactly though
    ```

    - u/CeruleanTresses:
      ```
      The timing might just work then, assuming that TCK died not too long after TOK showed up. All we know is that Robin was in hell up to a year after Malia was born. If Malia was born right after Robin died, then Robin could still have returned from the dead as TOK shortly after Malia left Hell. Or am I missing something?
      ```

      - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
        ```
        What you're missing is that time is wonky in Hell, so it's actually *easier* to make it work out than you're suggesting.
        ```

        - u/CeruleanTresses:
          ```
          Do we have confirmation of Hell's time-wonkiness? That would definitely make things easier, yeah.

    I feel like the Evil Deontologist from the same strip would fit in very well in Unsong.
    ```

    - u/tokol:
      ```
      Yep, utilitarians are all making compromise with sin after all. I think the philosophy joke is that an Evil Deontologist is the same thing as an absolute Deontologist.
      ```

      - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
        ```
        Neah, I think the joke is the same as for the Evil Utilitarian - she's seeking out situations where her moral philosophy produces results contrary to strong intuitions, rather than encountering them unintentionally.
        ```

    - u/___ratanon___:
      ```
      Isn't that basically what Erica is? 'They enslave their children's children', ergo destroy the institution that helped making the defeat of Hell possible.
      ```

- u/chthonicSceptre:
  ```
  In accordance with the prophecy, Erica slays Malia Ngo, and in placebomantically appropriate fashion to boot.
  ```

- u/MaddoScientisto:
  ```
  So wait

  The woman who controls the most names in the world and wanted to do good just got sent to hell

  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
  ```

- u/callmebrotherg:
  ```
  I don't know how to feel about this chapter. to be honest. 

  I feel like we've recently gotten a couple of backstory things (e.g. Malia Ngo and part-demons) just thrown at us without sufficient buildup. Maybe it'll make sense in the end, but if there's an eventual rewrite of Unsong then it might be good for some of this stuff to be more spread out.
  ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  I want your opinions, please. Do I start reading Unsong now, or wait until the book is finished? What would you choose?
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    You would be starting close enough to the end to still have the story fresh in mind when it ends, and would be able to partake in all the sweet speculation. Not much reason to wait.
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Start reading last week.
    ```
