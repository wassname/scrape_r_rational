  I loved how the memories act as a deadman's switch! You can't screw the Ensi over or the next one will know you did it, and he'll have the power of the pure to wreak his vengeance.

    There's one unknown: it hasn't been disclosed how the pyre chooses its next candidate in a vacancy, or if it's truly random.  It could, potentially, randomly pick Etana or some other diehard aristocrat.  Of course, this is highly improbable, given the ratio of elite, non-castrated men to ordinary working-class schlubs.  They'd have to either get really lucky or have the pyre show really perverse priorities.  They do not have cause to feel lucky lately.

  Our Ram is a little political philosopher! Love the chapter.

    I do appreciate the continual feedback--not that I need flattery or anything, just because it gives me data to work with.  Otherwise I'd be operating in a void, with no clue if the story was going off the rails.

      If you have any questions about how the chapter lands with me, I'm only ever a DM away.
