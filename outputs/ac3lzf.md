## Name some books which cover a lot of information ground like HpMor.

### Post:

HpMor while being a work of fiction is almost like a non-fiction work of science education book. This is primarily accounted for by the "rationality" of it. What are some similar works which cover a similar breadth of science?

Note: I think what I'm trying to ask is reading which books will also significantly educate me on science (If I diligently investigate what I don't know from the material) while also being entertaining.

  It's hard to recommend fiction books that will teach you science, because often the science in even "hard SF" books was speculative or wrong on publication or out of date now.

  I would suggest Blindsight by Peter Watts (a lot of cognitive science/neuroscience content) or Anathem by Neal Stephenson (although that has more maths and philosophy content to do with Platonism than science).

  A lot of Greg Egan's work is very heavy on science content, and in particular Incandescence verges on being a physics lecture in fiction form. He even has material explaining the science and maths behind a lot of his stories on his website. Some of his later work was kind of heavy going for me, but you will definitely learn a lot if you follow it all up!

  A lot of older hard SF is really space opera with a veneer of science. I guess A Mission Of Gravity by Hal Clement holds up if you ignore the biology.

    (An absent-minded Blindsight question:  >!Who poisoned the pseudo-captain vampire?  I recall that he began dying epileptically, and the protagonist thought that a character expected to mutiny had sabotaged his anti-epilepsy medication, but then a later twist reveals that the expectations of mutiny were only the protagonist projecting his own dissatisfaction--so, who sabotaged the medication..?!<)

    &#x200B;

    ...now remembering various moments from that...

    Protagonist:  "I've thought of an unintuitive implication of the prisoner's dilemma in respect to benefits and disadvantages of telling others one's birthday, namely that only by not telling others one's birthday can one identify genuine interest in celebrating one's birthday."

    Reader:  "Hmm, a fun-to-think-about line of thought, but I note that even if someone goes out of their way to learn your birthday they could still just be being conscientious or want to make themselves look more likeable by going that far, and even if you tell others then both you and (more) others could enjoy the celebrations taken part in."

    Character A, in romantic relationship with protagonist at the time:  "I'm going to laugh at you without suggesting any alternative line of thought at all."

    Character B, later:  "I'm not going to suggest any alternative line of thought at all, and if I were character A I would have immediately terminated our romantic relationship without suggesting any alternative line of thought at all."

    Reader:  "..."

    ...Maybe that actually stung because it puts me in mind a conversation I had once, where I mentioned a trolley problem to someone I was having a pleasant conversation with and the person suddenly started cursing at me (repeatedly saying that I was saying bovine excrement, less politely) without giving any explanation...

      In fact, all of Watts's work is pretty hard SF with an emphasis on biology, with some crazy speculative flourishes at times.

  ```
  Pretty much anything by Neal Stephenson will involve some serious deep dives into story relevant information, be it ancient Sumerian mythology, cryptography or orbital mechanics. Anathem is probably the densest with this.
  ```

  - u/Tinfoil_Haberdashery:
    ```
    You're the second person to suggest Anathem but to me that seemed like one of the most plot-oriented, least information-dense of his books (except maybe Snowcrash). Cryptonomicon and Seveneves both seemed way more focused on real-world science.
    ```

    - u/LazarusRises:
      ```
      Cryptonomicon is definitely more informationally dense, but some of Anathem's physics, math, >!multiverse theory!<, ethics, epistemology and engineering scenes are truly inspiring and educational. Not to mention the setting-specific horticulture, anthropology, local history, theology, martial arts, music theory, etc.

  * Anything by Greg Egan
  * Most if not all things by Neal Stephenson
  * On the fantasy side, the Cosmere cycle by Brandon Sanderson - his magic systems (there are MANY in those books) have interesting limitations, are internally self-consistent, and several tome-sized books in, we're just beginning to get a sense of the underlying structures of anything.
  ```

  - u/Zephyr1011:
    ```
    The Cosmere seems very much not what OP is looking for. It's good at explaining the constructed magic system in a lot of detail, but not for explaining science/ideas that actually correspond to the real world.
    ```

    - u/quark_epoch:
      ```
      Is it a lot of speculative science, or rooted in hard-proven facts?
      ```

      - u/Mablun:
        ```
        Think of it as taking place in an alternative universe with different underlying physics, including magic. The magic is self-consistent and rules-based much more heavily than in most fantasy novels, but it doesn't have anything to do with the real world and doesn't really teach the reader anything. Sanderson believes, rightly I think, that authors should only use magic to solve problems insofar as the careful reader could have figured out the magic was capable of solving it and why. So he doesn't have a deus ex machina problem that I've seen in other fantasy novels where the hero gets stuck in an impossible situation and all of a sudden their magic takes over and just wipes out an enemy legion or solves some other insurmountable problem that you didn't know it could.
        ```

    - u/ABZB:
      ```
      Ah - I had misunderstood the OP - I had understood the request as being in the sense of "works that have in them what amounts to textbooks of their world, like a science textbook", not "has in them information pertaining to our world in actuality".

      > but not for **explaining** science/ideas that actually correspond to the real world.

      Yes, though if you understand basic physics, it's nice to seem them integrated a little. Like m\_1\*s\_1 = m\_2\*s\_2.

  I'm not sure how you'd like it but I would recommend a series of books written by Terry Pratchett, Jack Cohen, and Ian Stewart called "The Science of the Discworld". There are 4 books and each is about 1/4 humorous Terry Pratchett story and 3/4 scientific essay (I find it hard to describe but these sections are meant to teach and explain - mostly to scientifically competent and intelligent audience). They cover everything from the beginning of the universe, the appearance of life, the nature of humanity, the scientific method, evolution, infinity, quantum physics, ecology, and astronomy, a little bit of everything scientific really. Although it is only partly fictional story and mostly non-fiction that weaves in and out of the narrative. I don't know if that is what you are after but its the closest thing I can think of.

  [Shoulders of Giants](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/11371/shoulders-of-giants/) has a protagonist whose power is the ability to instantly learn and contextualize all the knowledge in any book he touches.

      I've just finished catching up to the end of the story. It suffers from a major flaw (in my opinion), which consists of existing in what I'd refer to as an American-movie world.

      It doesn't feel like a world that is lived in. It feels like a world that exists entirely to be looked at from the outside. A world in which a student association has access to mind-control drugs and several decisions are taken on the basis of Rule Of Cool instead of Rule Of Practicality.

      Aside from that, and a couple of logic errors*, it's a pretty neat story, though.

      (*The most egregious is that GORGON's anti-qubit plan is going to lead inevitably to massive trouble if *any* way of defeating her foresight ability is at all successful - but with a modicum of thought, OAT can very easily use a qubit-based strategy to completely dismantle GORGON's anti-qubit plan.)
      ```

      - u/VanPeer:
        ```
        Valid criticism. Truth is it is basically a story wrapped around concepts I find cool. This leads to a 'movie world' that is not immersive. This is apart from own shortcomings as an author.

        I might have painted myself in a corner on the qubit plot line. Need to think about it more. Also, I constantly violate the cardinal rule of rational writing: bending character actions to fit the plot :-)

  * Every book by [Daniel Suarez](http://daniel-suarez.com/) does an excellent job of taking at least one potential upcoming technology (AR, CRISPR, drones, etc.) and explaining how it could / will be integrated into our future lives in a realistic techno-thriller manner. Daemon + Freedom(TM) changed my life.
  * [Rainbow's End](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004M8SR2O/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) is a great look at how Augmented Reality will be integrated into every part of our lives.
  * Potentially Bug Park and The Fear Index?

  Quicksilver and the rest of the Baroque cycle by Neal Stephenson. It is set in the 1600s. The characters in the books use real scientific and economic methods to achieve their goals.

  Recursion by Tony Ballantyne.

  The plot isn't all that great, but I recommend it to people simply because of how many neat concepts it touches on. Tulpas, trusting trust, self-replicating machine, emergance of strong AI, Utopia nanny-states, simulation hypothesis, etc. It covers a lot of ground.

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

    Any examples? I can't think of anything outright *wrong* off the top of my head right now. The worst bit is perhaps the one about the 'timeless' representation of physics being presented as the 'true reality', not because it's necessarily wrong but because it's just one of EY's plausible pet theories pushed as if it was proven fact.
    ```

    - u/AnimaLepton:

      A lot of the social psych, for starters. One that sticks out to me is the Robbers Cave experiment around chapter ~30. This setup of the experiment was presented completely incorrectly in-text, with incorrect conclusions drawn from it. Another example is the bystander effect- it applies specifically to *individuals* in emergency situations, whereas the text attempts to use it to describe behavior on a country-wide scale for long-term issues. And it doesn't apply in situations where the individuals attempting to help are putting themselves at risk, like children facing a troll or untrained combatants facing a terrorist attack. These are basic concepts in psychology, and are far less useful models when you take them outside of the bounds where they were tested/observed.

      There's also a lot of bad Bayesian probability/reasoning.

      More generally, I don't like it being referred to as a "non-fiction work of science education," since it doesn't really educate you on how to "do" science. The parts where things are actively being tested are good, and there are some fun concepts (i.e. sunlight in acorns -> potions on the fly), but a lot of them are Harry thinking really hard about something, making a hypothesis, then just assuming that it's correct. Word of God says that Harry was actually wrong about some of those hypotheses, but that's only brought up in external discussions and Harry's false theories are never addressed in the story, so functionally there was no difference. The aforementioned potion thing is a fun idea, but IIRC the "carryover" of magical meaning concept isn't even hinted at earlier in the fic, unlike Taure's Victoria Potter series where a similar underlying concept is gradually introduced to the reader.

      I'm not especially familiar with physics beyond mechanics, E&M, and basic quantum physics related to optics/physical chemisty/biology, so I can't really speak to any of the timeless physics stuff.

      Not saying HPMOR is a bad fic, or that I didn't enjoy it. But it's definitely not a great place if you're looking to actually learn the concepts (especially if your first exposure to them is incomplete and uses bad examples)
      ```

      - u/JohnKeel:
        ```
        Also, fun fact: the famous Robber's Cave experiment was the second attempt. 

        The first experiment by the scientist behind it had the two groups getting along as good friends, and was never published because it didn't show what he wanted. The second experiment didn't manage to create tension without assistants (not the boys themselves) stealing/vandalizing from both groups and blaming the other group in front of the kids involved.

        Nah, I get it. Honestly while I got the general idea I didn't keep to mind most of the social psych stuff anyway, so no harm done here I guess. As for Bayesian reasoning... it's all about your priors, really, so ultimately it's just a way to express systematically a way of reasoning, but in all situations in which you can't actually put numbers to things it's not exactly a rigorous tool. Just a rule of thumb, basically.

        About the bystander effect, I guess the terminology was wrong, but I get the idea that was meant in the story - the whole "*someone else* will do something about it" line of thought that ends up in no one doing anything. I suppose it's not the most accurate use of the notion, but I can see how one sort of makes you think of the other.

        The timeless physics stuff, as I said, isn't something that for what I know is *wrong*. But it's a theory. Not unlike if Harry had said he needed to think of strings. Strings are something physicists talk about, not complete nonsense, but neither they are remotely proven and they have competing theories.
        ```

        - u/EthanCC:
          ```
          The big deal with the Bayesian theorem is that it gives a mathematical explanation of how scientific reasoning arrives at the (p<0.05) truth. You can't plug numbers into it because most of the time there is no calculable prior, but you don't need to; it just shows that what we already do with the scientific method increases or decreases the probability of a hypothesis being correct. So the Bayesian theorem itself isn't the rule of thumb, the scientific method is, the theorem is what happens "under the hood". This is kind of controversial in philosophy of science (obligatory Feynman quote in the replies) last time I checked. It's not some huge revelation that shakes up how we do science, it says "Oh, that's why it works".


          LW doesn't really go over that, or how science works in practice. Which makes sense since afaik most of the writers aren't practicing scientists. That one short story EY did about students in the future figuring out a grand unified theory in a few days because you only need 5 minutes for a good idea and they thought outside the box was particularly insulting. 


          HPMOR focuses on the wrong stuff if it aims to teach the scientific method, as well as referencing stuff that is outright wrong or unproven. It's okay as a work of fiction, as long as the protagonist and author tract don't turn you off, but it's not a good teaching tool except as a way to get people interested in learning more.
