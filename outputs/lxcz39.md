## March Genre Fiction Challenge

### Post:

It’s that time again!! Ready to stretch your creative muscles and write some genre fiction?!

For the month of March, your challenge is to write a LYRIC POEM.

A short description of the genre:

>“A lyric poem is short, highly musical verse that conveys powerful feelings. The poet may use rhyme, meter, or other literary devices to create a song-like quality. Unlike narrative poetry, which chronicles events, lyric poetry doesn't have to tell a story. A lyric poem is a private expression of emotion by a single speaker.”

More info and examples here: [https://www.thoughtco.com/lyric-poem-definition-examples-4580236](https://www.thoughtco.com/lyric-poem-definition-examples-4580236)

Now I know what you’re thinking: poetry?? How can writing a poem *possibly* help me earn money, which is the whole point of all creative endeavors?

Well, my friend, there are two reasons: 1) Poetry helps to practice being both descriptive and concise, which improves all your writing and 2) If you write a really, really amazing poem, then who knows, you might get to [perform for the president](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/20/politics/amanda-gorman-inaugural-poem-transcript/index.html) :o

Guidelines:

• There is no set word limit. Write and post as many words as you like! 

• You’re encouraged to include rational elements in the fiction, but the main challenge is to write an enjoyable genre fiction. Everything else is gravy.

• Post your work as a comment to this thread, which can include a link or the entire story (if it is flash fiction). PM me if you want me to post your work anonymously.

• Last day to post is March 31st!

Optional prompts:

I'm also thinking that if this contest runs all year, I'll create an archive of all our 2021 genre fiction stories. It would be sort of like a rational fiction anthology. :)

That's all guys! Start writing!

  I live, I die, I live again,

  forever stuck, November, ten.

  My plane hijacked by a group of men,

  I live, I die, I live again.

  &#x200B;

  I live, I die, I live again,

  Loop'd twenty two minutes of pain.

  not landing but blown up instead,

  I fight, I die, I live again.

  &#x200B;

  I live, I die, I live again,

  my mind can barely take the strain.

  Keep trying every stratagem,

  Plane blows, I die, I live again.

  &#x200B;

  I live, I die, I live again,

  hijacker stabbed in the vein,

  reaching to snuff the bomb and then..

  A blast, I die, I live again.

  &#x200B;

  I live, I die, I live again,

  try maybe talking sense in them,

  their empty stares laugh at me and,

  I fail, I die, I live again.

  &#x200B;

  I live, I die, I live again,

  Flight Marshal's name was Jimmy Glenn,

  Hijackers shot him in the brain

  I cry, I die I live again.

  &#x200B;

  I live, I die, I live again,

  trying to crack a window pane,

  diversion fails and though glass rained,

  they win, I die, I live again

  &#x200B;

  I live, I die, I live again,

  Id rather have my whisky gents,

  Feel free to blow us up when can,

  I drink, I die, I live again

  &#x200B;

  I live, I die, I live again,

  if plane took path most turbulent,

  would wires of the bomb be rent?

  I think, I die, I live again

  &#x200B;

  I live, I die, I live again,

  A clever plot, and luck insane,

  a certain cellphone number gained,

  I smile, I die, I live again

  &#x200B;

  I live, I die, I live again,

  Idea formed, a message sent,

  the pilot takes a hint, loop spent,

  I WIN, I live, I laugh, the end.

    Well, they say you never see something genuinely new, but “action movie time loop story in poem form” might actually be a first.
    ```

  - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
    ```
    That was brilliant and I hope you have somewhere else to post it where people can admire it.
    ```

      ```
      Wow, a praise from Eliezer Yudkowsky himself, that is more of a reward than I expected
      ```

  Portrait of Suffering

  She lingers with the broken  
  The despondent and the damned  
  Each step is cowled in silence  
  She dares not raise her head

  Robed in grey, her hands  
  Are clasped in constant prayer  
  She's unobtrusive, yet  
  You'll always know she's there  

  All will shun her presence  
  But those who seek her find  
  In anguish she is peace  
  And rest for weary minds
  ```

  I really like this. A good twist on a form poem. Expresses your story well, the repetition creates a rhythm, moves the reader on through it.

  ```
  Rage builds, pressing my brain's inner wall:  
  the urge to avenge you, refusing to stall.   
  And as none struck you down (our loss cancer's theft),  
  I won't taste revenge until I've murdered Death.  

  The foe is collosal, its power unmatched--  
  I can't claim revenge by sword or by hatchet,  
  but scalpel, perhaps, can provide me intel.  
  To conquer my foe, I must needs know him well.

  Study his methods, surpassingly subtle,  
  his arguments always beyond our rebuttal,  
  but tut, 's his advantage not singular still?  
  His time can't run out, ours inev'tably will.  

  But evit I must, it's the goal of this game,  
  To see the scythe-wielder be finally tame.  
  And as humankind's been compared to a flame,  
  I dissect respiration to further my aim.

  Oxidative damage grinds me like a mill,  
  Free radicals taking their wage to the till.  
  As nothing is free and I've no time to muddle,  
  I drop nanite and compound into petri puddle.

  At last I find one that makes telomeres swell,  
  The sick and the aged begin to feel well.  
  I brew it by barrels, my plot finely hatched--  
  the bug in our bestial code finally patched.

  I feel at this point like I've got nothing left,  
  and stare wild-eyed into the face of Death.  
  As though I've won the game, he stoops down for his ball,  
  but I snatch it and say, "not 'til I've rezzed them all."
  ```
