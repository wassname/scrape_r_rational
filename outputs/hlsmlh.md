  This deserves a lot more praise and analysis than I can do at this moment but for now I'll just point out something I haven't seen anyone mention, which is that Jim Davis's last name would be seen backwards when viewed through the fourth wall by a fictional character in a universe created by him. I'm pretty lost about the Kings/Creator lore for now.

  It's a pretty goddamn on-the-nose allegory. That's not a criticism, that's just a statement of fact. Online we don't have the experience of touching each other, we can't hug or kiss or fuck or fight through these screens. We can just travel or congregate (unless we're targeted by Screamers who care more about hurting us than we do about maintaining group cohesion.) Or we can abandon all pretense of logic and good faith and just start saying the most expedient thing at all times. YYyyyup. This... sure is online discourse in 2020.

  Phenomenal work. IOU 2 literary analyses.

  Edit: I remembered a story with a similar timeline, [Been A Long, Long Time](https://archive.org/stream/Fantastic_v20n02_1970-12_LennyS-cape1736#page/n85/mode/2up).

    > which is that Jim Davis's last name would be seen backwards when viewed through the fourth wall by a fictional character in a universe created by him. 

    That's actually the first thing I thought of when I read the story, and I was initially thinking that the arrangement of the towers would somehow end up referencing the arrangement of panels in a comic strip or something.

    ```
    I couldn't quite crack the K/C either, however, given that Savid (Jim Davis) is either a King or subordinate, it's pretty obviously something to do with [comic syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_strip_syndication)\* (Davis's hidden mysterious bosses who never explain themselves to the public) even if you don't recognize the names [King Features Syndicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Features_Syndicate) or [Creators Syndicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creators_Syndicate) (presumably). That sort of out-of-universe connection is what he did in _Fudge Apocalypse_ for the pickle too, IIRC.

    Their real world relationship doesn't match up, though (Creators overthrew King, so to speak, not vice versa), and neither employed Davis/_Garfield_, who worked for [United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Feature_Syndicate). So I'm not quite sure how it goes.

    \* One could also note that all of the bad parts of Mondays - like the repetition, immortality, neuterness, boredom etc - are all apt descriptions of the sort of comics that syndicates praise for their safety & eternal revenue stream, and contradict all artistic value...

    (My headcanon for Sivad's question's purpose is that he inflicts this afterlife on a captive audience to force people to read _Garfield_ and try to interpret it; the multiplicity of interpretations and perpetual disagreement, even under ideal circumstances like billions of years to debate it, proves the artistic value of _Garfield_ after all. Once the question is resolved and dead, so too is the value of Mondays for him.)

  The story of a warlord in Mondays might be interesting. 

  The chief problem is the stupidly large scale of Mondays. If anyone decides they don't want to be found, it will take a *very* long time to find them. Any attempt to coordinate runs into the problem of the draw distance. Signals only hop one tower at a time. 

  Compared to that, recalcitrant targets that you can actually locate are easy. They can be stripped of their supports, bombarded with screamers, analyzed and bribed, or have their loved ones located and used against them.

  Its also totally unknown what minerals are available underneath the dirt, or if the dirt has any useful clay. Given the general despair of the setting, I'm assuming none and none.

  So the only manipulable resources are grass and dirt.

  Tracking humans via footprints left in the grass is conceivably possible.

  It might be possible to get roving bands weaponized hunter psychologists to track and forcibly convert runners.

  I'm picturing a long, spindly empire, with most its population made of thin arms of small squads of people manning grass fires slowly sending clear text messages back and forth. the arms move frequently to accommodate the needs of the hunter teams.

  Its still going to take a *really long time*. There are large groups of people who are willing to scream for a million years just for the sake of griefing. If one of them decides to run west for time T because fuck you, the search for them will take on the order of k\*T\^2, where K is probably larger than one. This continues until the limits of the walls, which no one has hit in a billion years.

  They are going to be stuck for a while.

    There's one solution I can see: the books don't reset. So, what you can do is leave messages with books, convince everyone to answer through cult wars, and if you manage to both answer it and get it wrong then you have a record of what you did last time. But yeah, it is definitely a long game.

        Yeah, but you want a strategy you can convince people will work. Books provide an obvious mark on the landscape that provides legitimacy to your cult, as well as an obvious shortcut to getting both the correct answer and the correct strategy the next time around.

        The books provide a ritual for people to focus on when they aren't indoctrinating other people into your cult.

    There's something oddly nauseating and resigned about it. Like the writer's mind just views the whole world in grey scale. The ending (for me) had this pessimistic feel, "Well we might as well sit back and read Garfield for eternity until all that's left us is a husk."
    ```

- u/-Vecht-:
  ```
  This was fun to read, but ultimately flawed in a way that makes the conceit nonsensical. 

  The story introduces and plays with the idea of numbers so great as to be functionally infinite to human minds, yet they're treated as mere props and window dressing. The plot is a plot of decades at best, and is artificially stretched to "millions", "hundreds of billions", and timescales comparable to the heat death of the universe, all without any thought as to what it would actually be like for anyone to live through it. This is not what eternity looks like.

  The PoV character describes a handful of "interesting" towers and people as if, having traveled that long and seen so many, those occurances wouldn't be better described as frequencies. They encounter people willing to scream for a million years just to troll people, but people who have companionships lasting hundreds of billions don't consider the idea to "just wait for them to get bored and leave" when the time you have to wait is, functionally, an eyeblink in comparison to the length of your latest conversation. So many things *should have happened* in these eons, and yet didn't.

  The story does a good job of revealing a certain flaw of human nature. Yes, humans will argue anything ad nauseam, and divorced from consequences, will do things such take novel positions just to stand out and be unique, spin up webs of belief to justify not changing their mind, and get fed up and break things out of spite (or just troll people for the lulz). It can be difficult to coordinate around anything when there is even a modicum of uncertainty.

  But you will have a hard time convincing me that, among all possible failure modes, *this* is the one that arises in the face of eternity.

  Humans are not this dumb, nor are they so interesting as to be capable of exploring the nuances of a single line of thought for a million years, much less a *billion*, much less timescales comparable to the heat death of the universe.

  Just as the screamers get bored and carry on, so to would everyone else. Even given the conceit that it's an unsolvable problem (as if even in the Mondays, someone wouldn't have thought to treat it like a logic puzzle and get people to coordinate around *that* after wasting so much time arguing about whether yes or no means anything when it's literally keeping you all from going to paradise -- or even shifting to try and make progress on understanding human psychology and why such patterns emerge in the first place!) -- even then, eventually people would *also get tired of the question*. Not just a few. Absolutely friggen everyone!

  Okay, so you can't touch and can't have sex and can't hurt each other and can't ever die, yadayada. Yes, and? It sucks, but after miserating over it for basically eternity, you'd think someone would have the insight that you don't need an externally imposed, rubber-stamped, This-Is-What-The-Creator--Themselves-Intended paradise to be handed to you in order to have a fulfilling existence. You can in fact just do it yourself! You literally have all the time in the world!

  Fun premise, good writing, very entertaining. But I'm not reading a story about humans.

    What kind of paradise you imagine people could make out of nothing but grass, mud and Garfield books? Time isn't a magical solution to everything in absense of any useful resources. There's no material for almost anything to happen, except for maybe some origami art, using the books pages. Also you could probably weave the grass into some kind of a shitty rope, but then what?

    Even going inwards instead of outwards with building paradise and trying to wirehead yourself buddism-esque way doesn't work, because it's impossible to go insane in Mondays (the story even mentions people who tried this approach and failed at it).

      > What kind of paradise you imagine people could make out of nothing but grass, mud and Garfield books?

      You still have a brain, no? And access to some fraction of approximately 1/7 of all the humans who ever lived. That's a lot of brains, and I hear you can do pretty interesting things with them. Some people even claim they might be the most complex things in existence (I personally think those people might be underselling existence, but who am I to judge?).

      > [...] but then what?

      Sounds like a fun and fully recursive problem. I do enjoy a good challenge!

      ---

      If that's not enough to hint at what I'm too lazy to elaborate on in this comment, this is where I [obnoxiously quote LW at you](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nCvvhFBaayaXyuBiD/shut-up-and-do-the-impossible) in passing while offering a deep insight. Unfortunately, I'm also too lazy to think of a suitably deep insight. I suppose "I respect your right to be upset at not having a definite final happy ending, but don't tell me what I can't do with my immortality or where it has to 'end up' to be worth it" might suffice?

        Just for fun, I figured I'd take the quickest crack I feel like I reasonably can at constructing utopia within Mondays:

        >I can remember everyone I have spoken to since I have come here and all the conversations I have had in enough detail to recreate them perfectly in my head.

        Here's our keystone. Everybody has nearly perfect memory.

        Suppose for a moment that two chess enthusiasts meet, and they want to play chess, but they haven't any pieces. However, they both have perfect memories and understand the rules of chess very well. This is sufficient for them to play chess. [In fact, this is sufficient for simulation of arbitrary universes.](https://xkcd.com/505/) (If that level of granularity is unrealistic, crunchy tabletop campaigns work too.) Screamers cannot permanently end these universes, either. Since they remain perfect in memory, the best the Screamers can do is pause execution, and if someone has a sufficient mental grasp of the universe they're imagining, they may even continue execution while cut off from others. This is all very wordy to say that given infinite time and no need for food, sleep, or shelter, humanity would invent an infinite number of imagination games. (To quote [the Garfield strip in which we learn the events of the comic are all in fact delusions within a dying cat's mind](https://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1989/10/28), "An imagination is a powerful tool. It can tint memories of the past, shade perceptions of the present, or paint a future so vivid that it can entice... or terrify, all depending on how we conduct ourselves today...")

        Virtual currencies are even possibly feasible. Can Sivad be used to get answers to arbitrary math problems or to pass messages to other people in Mondays? It seems unlikely, since the universe of Mondays seems to be designed to discourage communication outside one's own bubble, but if he allows access to any shared information of any kind, it could essentially create arbitrary additional layers of reality, and if he allows arbitrary mathematical operations, he may even be able to offer encryption services.

        One thing I'm curious about that I don't see addressed much in the story is the idea of people congregating. It seems like people mostly wander around freely without any reason to gather in one place, with only the Screamers bothering to coordinate at all. So, hypothetically, any number of people could occupy the same physical space. It would be an interesting game (and therefore something that people would likely try) to see how many people could hold one book at the same time. After all, people are able to interact with each other through physical objects. What would happen if thirty people all held the same book with both hands and, holding onto it as firmly as possible, took off sprinting North? Would they be able to accelerate the book faster than they normally move, and thereby, accelerate each other? What if that number went up to a hundred people? A thousand people? It might be a way to try to reach a wall-- gather everyone in a tower who wants to go North with you, ride a book north to the next tower, repeat. If you can get up a good amount of speed, start stopping at every other tower so you don't have to stop as often (then every third tower, etc.) At that point, even if you lose people occasionally, you should still bring a good bit of novelty to the towers you travel to, and if you can get the book travel meme to spread, you might be able to use it to travel more easily around Mondays later on, once you've traced out the perimeter. (after all, any time a sufficient number of people all want to go the same direction, they'd just self-coordinate around a travel book. Yes, some people would scream or try to interfere, but they'd be outmuscled by sheer volume.)

        Edit: I had a couple of other thoughts. For one, Screamers can be countered by plugging one's ears with grass and inventing sign language. In fact, to disorient the Screamers, they could join in on the screaming, and just abandon sound as a communications channel.

        Another thought I had was the possibility that eventually, once the book meme spreads enough, an anti-travel-book meme might arise, and people might gather to pirate books whose only purpose is seeking out and taking control of other books to interfere with people's attempts to travel.

        Hmmm. it's not a septillion years' worth of worldbuilding good, but I would be interested in hearing some stories about a contingent of people trying to reach the northern wall by riding a Garfield book. They'd only stay on the forefront of the meme's light cone until somebody puts together a faster book and catches up to them. Then once the meme has caught up to them, it's a giant game of tag with an unknown and fluctuating number of players. Or... a marathon gauntlet.

        Heck, once book piracy emerges, you might wind up with anti-pirate books. Enforcers around the center of Mondays who hunt down any book who's interfering with the use of travel books.

        Actually hold on books are a scarce commodity suddenly and nooooow you've got the basis for slavery and capitalism and wars and heists (the books don't regenerate, right? so factions would start stockpiling books because eventually only the factions with the books can travel...)

        So, to extend things to their logical conclusions, at some point somebody in Mondays might sit down and describe a long, involved, complex story with hundreds of protagonists and millions of plotlines to someone over the course of several centuries, followed by a cryptographic signature spoken aloud character for character then verified alone with Sivad, after which point the client gives payment in the form of three Garfield books, whose value is that it 1. is a scarce good and 2. allows any old horde of humanity to travel at a reasonable pace elsewhere in the world to catch up on the highly valuable stories there.

        It's not sex, drugs, or rock n' roll, but it's something to do. I wonder how large a choir could be assembled in Mondays. They could all stand right on top of each other and try to harmonize and compose and sing a song together. Well, hmm, everyone's voice sounds like German purring, but there is air (they puff it out their noses while they read Garfield at the end) so presumably vocalizations are possible and I don't think musicality is explicitly outlawed by Mondays' physics.
        ```

        - u/XorolaVenter:
          ```
          Now that's good stuff.

          I'm not sure I'm convinced that just imagining stuff happen, without any external stimulus (since the narrator in the story is able to distinguish between memories and events, there has to be some noticeable distinction between what people there imagine and what is really happening), would be sufficient to make it into utopia, but then I remember [a Terraria player spending years entertaining themselves by imagining things the game can't feasibly support happen](http://i.imgur.com/Y17qMMp.jpg) and, in general, people who are really into roleplay and yeah, for sure it would be a paradise for this kind of people at least.

          Virtual currencies are possibly feasible, yeah. I guess they could be used in exchange for stories and to facilitate the creation of more stories.

          I don't think communication through Sivad would be possible, the form it takes seems to be everyone's personal delusion and it avoids disclosing most of the info about things happening in Mondays.

          The book travel idea is interesting. There isn't much to see in the world of Mondays, but it could cut the time needed to find everyone (though it sounds to me that the bottleneck is convincing people to take the same side on the question).
          ```

          - u/gryfft:
            ```
            I admit that imagination games are a bit weak, but considering the immortality and absence of any need to worry about resources, I figure it's around ~17776 levels of finding things to do with isolated immortal existence. And, I think the power of [imagination](https://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1989/10/28) in Garfield being what it is diegetically, Sivad would need to nerf the pleasure derived from imagination pretty hard before Mondays could be considered a net negative. (But it could well be that part of "not letting people go insane" includes being simply unable to suspend disbelief or achieve any level of immersion in any form of storytelling, depending on how hard Sivad is enforcing the hell dimension aspect.)

            Edit: Just read the link, and hm. I was excited to see another example of somebody getting much more out of a video game than people usually do, but the casual racism ruins it for me. (Yes, I know, 4chan, free speech, but this isn't 4chan and it doesn't make me feel great when I see casually racist stuff anywhere near this sub.)

        Waving your hands around and saying "brains are magic though, surely they'd come up with something in billions of years" is fine and all, but its not really an interesting answer.

    >much less a billion , much less timescales comparable to the heat death of the universe.

    Hundreds of billions is not timescale of heat death of the universe. Timescale of heat death of the universe is ten in power hundred (plus minus  fifty), or possibly much more depending on the model.

    Generally I agree - that kind of system would be ruled by statistical physics - switch to paradise is kind of inevitable if system is not hardcoded to avoid it. It should happen even before everyone brain would become random generator of electrochemical signals.
    ```

  - u/LupoCani:
    ```
    This criticism is essentially a statement of fact - "given this premise, X would not happen, Y would" - which seems to me a strange thing to be confident about.

    Yes, people would tire of the question, but they would tire of everything else about Mondays too, and wanting to get out, question-related problems is the sensible thing to focus on. Humans aren't infinitely stupid, but we *are* bad at coordination, and _total_ coordination gets exponentially harder with billions of people and no fast communications. Whether you can have a fulfilling life given eternity, grass and other people seems like a longstanding philosophical problem, with strong arguments on either side.

    Which of these forces would win out? I don't know, and I certainly don't expect my guess to be better or worse than that of the author, or that of anyone else without relevant experience, which I'm not convinced exists.


    Another angle - even if I were more confident in whatever opinion I held, I'm not sure I could hold this against the story. It wouldn't make it a story about not-humans, it would make it a story about humans, presenting an opinion contradictory to mine about how humans are. So, while I might then *disagree* with the story, it would hardly be nonsensical because of it.

  The answer is NO by the way.

  \> There is a series of comics less than year before the comic in question where Garfield awakens to find himself living in an existential nightmare, Jon and Odie abandoned him and he starves in an empty house and pretends everything is ok.

  Sorry for this imperfect quote, can't copy from [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net).

  Anyway - the rest of the comics happen inside starving Garfield's brain, so nothing really happens, so the answer is No.

  Would someone mind explaining the ending? Is the point of view character implying that those people are some kind of zombies or are stuck in a endless loop of reading? I interpret the ending to mean that you could convince and sync everyone in Mondays except these kind of people, but I don't understand why. Is it because some people are happy there and wouldn't want to leave?

  Is there a clue from the fact that 1 other day hasn't been collapsed yet?

    > Would someone mind explaining the ending?

    A common theme in the strips is Garfield saying "I hate Mondays", which is a really strange thing for an unemployed literal feline to think. However, given the name of this particular purgatory, it's almost certainly a feeling shared by most other residents.

    Thus, after having found (perhaps) the seven people in 1/7th of the entire population of humanity who actually *enjoy* Garfield, the punchline to the story itself is "I love Mondays!"

  for its length this story is doing so so so much? It reminds me a lot of 17776 or some of Ted Chiang's short stories (and presumably lots of other stuff) where it lays out an absurd premise and then super efficiently explores how people realistically react to it. Some spoilery thoughts:

  * >!the towers seem analogous to forums/threads or (more likely) Discord servers/channels, with the screamers being trolls etc etc!<
  * >!this isn't the main thrust of the work, which instead is using the never-ending hell that is Garfield as... a never-ending hell!<

  The narrator refers to staying in some places for millions of years. Now, surely there are some people who enjoy Garfield; by all means. But to read the same limited corpus of comics, over and over again, for *literally millions* of *literally years*? No; come on. Even allowing for one-seventh of humanity being within Mondays, that is not within the limits of human psychology.

  Nonetheless, the story is good enough that it inspired me to look for a weakness, which is the mark of skill for any dystopia.

      Additionally, at some point a sixty-strong band of Screamers is going to find that tower, get up in the Readers' faces, and scream at them for a million years. I think that even those few humans capable of enjoying a Garfield comic for more than a minute or so would find that this treatment interfered a bit with their reading.

      But the idea that the most important question in my existance is also the dumbest, combined with it being the ultimate group project- a legion of people who all have to agree on the same thing, with the added caveats of being impossible to tell who might be defecting just out of spite, or hiding just to be an ass.

      It's a weird, pointless hell, with heaven right there. There's no reason things should be that way. They just are, and you might never be able to fix them.

      I mean, sure, it's funny that the ultimate meaning is whether or not Jim Davis got an Adult Swim tier potty humor joke into the milktoast world of newspaper comics, but imagine living it.

  The following is almost a stream of conscious as I read this story, writing basically what I think as soon as I read it without reading the rest of the story. I write this after reading the story just to show you how natural gaze's world-building is and how coherently it follows through. 
  >!
  >If one runs in any cardinal direction from a tower at a fast pace

  Is there a magnetic field then?

  If not how do you know what a cardinal direction is. Without the sun for orientation cardinal directions will be significantly less useful, only those with compasses can use them.

  Also the choice of "first floor" instead of ground floor suggests that this land is not European (0 = ground is used in the United Kingdom, most European countries, Mexico, Cambodia and former British colonies.)

  If the bedrooms are not decorated how do people know they are bedrooms? Or does a bed not count as decoration? What about wardrobes or en suites? The lack of kitchens or farms or washing machines or bathrooms suggests that these people need no food and excrete no substance but do sleep. 

  If the book is indestructible I suspect its use in construction or science to be useful. 

  >It is impossible to see two at once from the same location. 

  The obvious question seems to be reflection. If you look at one tower then raise a mirror to occupy only part of your field of view what do you see? If you close one eye and bring the mirror to occupy all of the other eye you should see the tower in the mirror right? Then if you reverse eyes you will see another tower. 

  Also it says always exactly one, presumably this isn't true if you look at the sky, or the ground, or close your eyes, or are blind, or look in between the towers.

  Monday as the second day instead of first day of the week is uniquely American I believe. I don't understand why he says human name though. "Monday" is hardly a human name it's an English name. Surely people who arrive will be speaking different languages. After all in Chinese and many other languages Monday = "first" + "day". 

  >There were never children in Mondays. Those who die before the age of sixteen are sent immediately to the shared paradise.

  So murder all children is the moral suggestion for the pregame life? If you could communicate with them that is.

  I'm happy I managed to predict the inability to excrete just from the absent description earlier in the text. That's why you really have to comb gaze's stuff. Everything is there or not with a purpose. 

  >We do not and cannot speak any language from Earth. I once knew English and some Portuguese, and I cannot remember how to speak either. The language on Mondays sounds similar to German, I am told, but it involves frequent purring, which we are all innately capable of. Strangely, it often takes newcomers minutes or hours to first notice the switch.

  If you do not remember how to speak it do you not remember things like the name of Monday after all German starts the week on Monday and has a ground floor of 0 not 1. If you can compare the language to German it would seem to me it would require some sort of processing. 

  With the Garfield books are the names translated or in English? Again this would seem like a clue you could garner about the language. 

  Regarding the answer it seems obvious to me that even if the character did consume dog semen it would take multiple days to produce and print a comic so the comic released upon that day would obviously not have been on the same day so the answer is no. There's also the greater question that no date applies to a comic since it was released on that date doesn't mean the character existed at that time. 

  Also the culture clash from 200,000 years of homo sapiens has to be great. Even if you can't hurt people you can emotionally isolate them and attack them in other ways. Humans are social creatures and having 10 people follow someone to harass them seems to be unavoidable. 

  Abandoning the conversation to leave for the next tower seems unproductive. Isn't the point to convince everyone at one tower to vote one way? The way doesn't seem to matter since Sivad is willing to disclose information about the previous vote (that it didn't happen). Plus 50/50 better than 0 odds. Arguing whether it's right or wrong seems really dumb. Just keep getting everyone to agree on one vote and then reset memory do it again. Flip a coin to choose what side. This way eventually you'll get out even if it takes a few attempts. Though in general I don't think it's possible to get everyone to agree and such an endeavour is pointless as there will be people with mental health issues incapable of changing their vote. 

  Screamers! This story is excellent at foreshadowing and following through on premises. 

  I don't get the ending joke sadly but nice story anyway.!<

      That's the situation, but I'd say the "joke" is that at the end he asks those people how they feel about Mondays and they reply "We love Mondays!"  Which is, y'know, the opposite of Garfield's catchphrase.

      - u/CeruleanTresses:

        I thought it was that they hated Mondays, and this causes the narrator's revelation that the problem is unsolvable because Garfield is some kind of deity or arbiter of reality, and he "hates Mondays" and doesn't want the people there to escape. I might be reading too much into it, but one mark against the idea that the complacent Garfield-readers *themselves* are the immovable obstacle is that there must be people who are content to read Garfield all day who died on other days of the week, but there are other days that managed to move on to the paradise. The one thing that we know is unique about Mondays is that it's Mondays, the thing Garfield hates.

    It's not. Not sure why you think it would be unique American.

    Traditionally in both Judaism and Christianity Sunday is the first day of the week. According to both religions, God created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th day, which is the Sabbat, which is Saturday. Christians moved their holy day to Sunday to celebrate Jesus's resurrection, but still recognize Saturday is the 7th day.

    I don't know when the shift to seeing Monday as the first day of the week happened, but it must have been in relatively modern times.

  I initially fell into the dog urine camp, because having never smelled much of either, I expect dog urine to smell and taste worse, and thus to motivate a stronger immediate reaction from Jon. Dog urine makes sense with Liz's remark because a common pregnancy test is to look for hormones in the urine; thus, she means "You have just consumed the urine of a bitch whom I have ascertained is pregnant."

  However, perhaps this does not hold water, or other liquids. Odie is assigned male gender; if this matches the dog's biological sex, then *he* cannot bear puppies and would not be tested for pregnancy. If Odie is physically male, then he would be the most likely source of dog semen in the exam room; although I don't believe expressing semen is a typical part of a veterinary check-up. Perhaps he's being bred?

  If on the other hand, Odie is biologically female and fertile, she may be the recipient of an impregnation or the provider of urine intended for a pregnancy test.

  If the liquid is *from* Odie, then female Odie implies urine and male Odie implies semen.

  If the liquid is intended *for* Odie, then Odie must be female and it's semen.

  What fraction of dogs have an assigned gender (including name, pronouns, fur decorations) different from their biological sex? If Odie is (say) 5% likely to be misgendered, then Jon might be too naïve to know whether his dog is a boy dog or a girl dog. However Liz, who has inspected Odie all over, knows for sure (but may maintain Jon's ruse out of politeness).

  (Also yeah, Odie was Lyman's dog at one point. Lyman was totally Jon's boyfriend, at least according to my half-sister. (It was the '80s, we were bored.))

    Nobody knows English in Mondays. Its kind of hard to figure our how they would experience the name Sivad, and how they experience reading the words Jim Davis in the comic strip or remembering the name from their time on Earth. Still, I think it's plausible they wouldn't be able to tell.

    Maybes that his name is Davis backwards means the true answer is opposite from common logic, and therefore Jon didn't drink dog semen.
