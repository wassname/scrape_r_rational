  Hazou a cuteh. Nice relaxing chapter, and perhaps the team meeting means we'll soon be moving the plot forward.

  Or alternatively, this quest is now a harem romcom.

    ```
    The players have been voting calm-and-relaxing plans recently, so the plot isn't being driven from that direction.  The team has only been in Konoha a little while and the NPCs haven't really had a chance to react to them, so it's not being driven from that direction either.

    One of these two things will change soon, but it will probably be another couple of updates since I didn't manage to finish this plan.

      Right, I didn't mean to complain; it hasn't grown tedious yet.

      Apparently "don't know from" is a [New York yiddish thing](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/220193/meaning-and-derivation-of-so-and-so-would-know-from-x). TMYK

  I notice that Radvic's omake is not in the threadmarks. Sorry to be a nitpicker if you /u/eaglejarl already noticed that.

  Hm... 

  I know very little about Naruto, but did watch one of the films (at the insistence of a friend) and didn't see anything interesting there. Would you still recommend this to me, or is it more of a "If you like Naruto then you'll like this, but if not, then you won't" thing?
  ```

  - u/oliwhail:
    ```
    I'd almost say I recommend it specifically because you didn't find anything of interest in the original - a world full of people being thoroughly uncreative with amazing magic powers? Of course you didn't care for it.

    But what if people *were* being creative? And what if the world was on hard mode to keep them from winning instantly? And what if they decided they were going to win anyway, by bringing about uplift of the entire human race, and were fighting tooth and nail to try to accomplish it?

    **That's** Marked for Death. Obviously if you hated the whole "some humans have bullshit magic chakra powers" premise in and of itself, MfD won't appeal to you. But the characters and the world and the writing and the commenting community are amazing, so if the premise doesn't immediately drive you off I'd strongly encourage you to give it a try, at least up until the point where we met Kagome.

    ```
    I don't think there's anything from canon that you need to know.  In fact, aside from the geography and the names of a few characters there isn't a lot of canon left after we started trying to make sense of things.
    ```
