## 2020 Books in Review / Book Roundup

### Post:

I figure we all share at least some degree of taste in our books, and frankly, with 2020 having been the year of being stuck at home, maybe a lot of us could use a consolidated new-reading-material thread.

This thread is for things you read in 2020. It doesn't have to have come out in 2020, but you've got to have read it in 2020. It can be paper books, audiobooks, ebooks, web serials, manga, whatever! People are encouraged to also mention why these things in particular might be of interest to the posters here at /r/rational.

  **Web Serials** (books in a different comment):

  I re-read **Unsong**, which remains probably the best web serial ever written. Fake, glorious Kabbalah, incredible biblical puns of extraordinary awfulness, obsessive and human characters, a sysadmin angel, the end of times, and the greatest notarikon reveal I've ever seen.


  I re-read **Lady Knight Volant** (featuring Protector of the Small's Keladry of Mindelan), which remains probably the best fanfic ever written. Enough people asked whether the author was Tamora Pierce herself. No; it is not. Also it has some sequels, which I read. LKV specifically is about Keladry building her holding; at first to protect the refugees she's assigned to shepherd, and later building it into a glorious fortress-steading in the face of adversity.


  **Katalepsis** is the best ongoing web serial on my list. Sapphic romance, friendships through trauma with traumatized people, mental health, a great vast all-seeing eye that screams hyperdimensional mathematics into your brain until you bleed out from your ears, it's got it all.


  **Ward** by Wildbow (the sequel to his debut, Worm) wrapped up. It's amazing how much the fanbase hated this serial. He started his new serial, Pale, which is set in the same setting as his older Pact but with a totally different cast of characters (and is much less bleak). It's much more cerebral than Worm, I think. I really liked it. I really liked Victoria's struggle with trying to figure out how to be the person she needed to be, and how to figure out who and what she wanted to be.


  **Just a Bystander** is a serial about a student going to the Mage Academy learning to deal with the fact that he's gotten wrapped up in some gosh darn Chosen One prophecy, and he does not approve.


  **The Wandering Inn** is an extremely long (7ish million words and going!) slice-of-life litRPG story. It starts out pretty bad, so if you're giving this serial a shot, you owe it to yourself to read until the chess match happens, at which point if you still don't like it put it away and don't come back. Pirateaba (the author) publishes more words of web serial than anyone else writes of fiction, we're talking like 50k words a week. On update days, I don't need anything else to read while I do my morning cardio. It's not particularly rational, though there are characters (Saliss!) who are standouts in terms of having a clear internal narrative that drives them to behave the way they do. It is, however, extremely long, so it's got that going for it.


  **A Practical Guide to Evil** by ErraticErrata started out YA and has long since left. Catherine Foundling, recruited by the Black Knight to become the Squire, has gone far and seen amazing things, and the recent chapters have been just gut-punch and moment of awesome packed. There's a lot of meta in this story, and a lot of meta-story. Every trope in the book is played with and analyzed with clear eyes.


  **The Zombie Knight** (George Frost), a serial about a young man who commits suicide... and is then offered a chance to stick around and make a difference, but with superpowers this time, as an ancient reaper's sidekick. Has some very interesting superpowers, which are used in very interesting ways.


  **Worth the Candle** (Alexander Wales), needs no introduction on this subreddit.


  A bunch of other isekai litRPGs that don't get their own line. **Delve, Cinnamon Bun, The Many Lives of Cadence Lee, Eight, New Life of a Summoned Demoness**, (arguably) **Dungeon Crawler Carl, Devil's Foundry, Unbound, Vainquer the Dragon.**


  **Blessed Time** and **Tower of Somnus**, the former a non-isekai timeloop litRPG and the latter a serial-numbers-filed-off Shadowrun Earth being actively quarantined by galactic civilization. Tower of Somnus is probably the best-realized Shadowrun-esque setting I've seen. It understands that Shadowrun as presented in most contexts is absurdism and that if you want to present a literalist world you have to do some work... and it does that work. (Also recommended to me via this subreddit.)

  **Books** (web serials in a different comment):

  Glynn Stewart: 30 or so books of spaaaaace operaaaaaaah milSF across his various serieses plus a fantasy trilogy about goblins. They're exactly what it says on the tin. Well-realized pulp. A lot of this is at least a little bit character driven, which is nice. The math checks out and with the exception of some of his earlier books not considering all of the cool things you can do if you travel FTL, he covers all the usual ground and avoids the usual mistakes.

  **Martha Wells, Network Effect**. A murderbot novel! I love murderbot! Aww, who's a precious terrifying terminator who just wants to hang out with his dumb take-too-many-risks science friends and watch anime. Murderbot is! Seriously, Murderbot is funny but also a great exploration of what it means to be a person, a friend, a teammate, and an AI.


  **Jim Hines, the Libriomancer series**: what if librarian nerd book magic. As a nerd book kind of guy, yes, I loved it. Great for people who, like me, obsess over optimizing "if you could pull items out of books, what's your best option for self-defense".


  **Emma Bull's War for the Oaks**, courtesy of my book club: wow, there are so many things that I only knew as tropes that originated here, and it was really good, too! This is recommend to folks who have a deep connection with rock (as in, the music genre) or who want to read the originator for a huge array of urban-fantasy tropes.


  **Bujold, The Physicians of Vilnoc**: too on the nose, TOO ON THE NOSE. Also, it had basically no Penric-being-Penric. He doesn't even shit-talk his God once. **Masquerade in Lodi**, on the other hand, was fantastic and extremely Penric, so that was nice. These are both quite in-the-head books; they're in a way both whodunnits, though the first one is not a murder, it's a plague.


  **Jo Walton: Lent, Lifelode, Or What You Will**. She's so utterly amazing. I don't even like art museums and she makes me want to visit art museums. How does she even do that? Also, she writes Catholicism, genuine full-faith Catholicism, better than anyone I've ever read. Recommended to anyone who enjoys books that have philosophy in them. Seriously, Jo Walton is the queen of that.


  **Adrian Tchaikovsky: Redemption Blade**. "OK, we killed Sauron... what now?" really good. Really really good. Great grappling with coping with what was lost in the war and what war costs the people and the persons.


  **Mary Robinette Kowal: The Relentless Moon** came out, it's set sort of at the same time as another book in her historical-fiction space race series but completely separate plot. She writes this alternative history with such amazing grace, humanity as humanity warts and wonders and all. To some degree it's a whodunnit, to some degree it's a journey into the past (an alternate, very grounded in history past). This series is extremely emotionally wrenching to me, very good at plucking my heartstrings.


  **T Kingfisher AKA Ursula Vernon: **A Paladin's Grace** (superb) and **A Wizard's Guide to Defensive Baking** (OMG AMAZING). The former hits all of the usual Ursula Vernon "sit down and shut up and let me show you how Paladins should work" buttons that I love so much, and the latter is an excellent look into how to optimize a rather unusual and weak-seeming magic... and also how you can have a child stepping up to be the hero without having them abandoned by their caregivers.


  **Seanan McGuire**: Between the October Daye books, the InCryptid books, and the Wayward Children books, that's like thirty books. Plus a standalone about cheerleaders. Seanan McGuire has a thing for cheerleading. The InCryptid books feature science-minded, thoughtful characters and also the protagonist (of the first two). Of all McGuire's works I'd recommend them for y'all.


  **Tamsyn Muir's Harrow the Ninth**: I literally don't go a week without thinking about this book and I read it back in August. Obviously you should read Gideon the Ninth first, but this is probably my highest-emotional-impact book of 2020. Necromancers in space, sure, but also "How do people break in different ways and how do they manage to keep moving forwards".


  **Katherine Addison, The Angel of the Crows**: Yet another delightful retelling of Sherlock Holmes in a supernatural setting. Yay! It's... Sherlock Holmes-y. What's not to love.


  **Mike Brooks, Rites of Passage (WH40K)**: A decent read, but it would have been a better book in literally any other setting, because WH40K is absolute fucking garbage as a setting. I mention this only because it lets me shit-talk WH40K as a setting, which I literally never get tired of doing.


  **Elizabeth Bear, Machine**: I fucking love this setting, it's so beautifully at the exact most optimistic edge of the realism space. This book was great! Sort-of-transhumanist hard-SF. While there's plenty of cyberpunk out there, it's rare to see something go hard on the solarpunk side of things, and I'd say this (and Ancestral Night) / The Long Way to a Small Angry Planet (and its sequels; not by the same author as this book) are a rarity in taking that approach. Highly recommended; not all science fiction has to be about pewpew-my-engines-go-this-fast-and-my-missiles-go-that-fast.


  **S. L. Huang, the Cas Russell books**: God, Russell is such an ass, but her friends are great and math-as-superpower is great.


  **Andrew Rowe: How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps** is a litRPG critique/sendup of Zelda, and was an entertaining read.


  **Diane Duane**: I'm working through the Young Wizards series. Extremely fun. Mentioned because my introduction to the series came from here.


  **Graydon Saunders, A Mist of Grit and Splinters**. This series starts off with The March North, which is a straight-up military fantasy novel that delivers a radically different setting and set of characters, which get built on with two sorcery school novels. I love, love, love these books. Warning, it's written technically in English, but hoo boy is it an engineer's English.

    Bit of a necro, but cheers for the Commonweal series recommendation, I'm three books in now and loving them.
    ```

    - u/PastafarianGames:
      ```
      Yay! I'm ever so delighted anytime I can successfully shill these books to someone.

      There's a Google Group community of Commonweal fans, you should wander over and say hi once you've finished reading all the books.

  A Song for Two Voices. A reimagining of the Magic's Pawn series from Mercedes lackey's valdemar series, but with a villain who is actually rational and a protagonist who is rational as well.

  It's like vanilla Mercedes Lackey... Except better in all ways.

  "Zoe Punches the Future in the Dick" by David Wong. 
  Certainly not rational, but kind of rationalish in the themes and discussions characters have about how the world works and what drives people. Nice twists and good jokes. Highly recommended.

  Holy shit. I just looked up a bunch of these and they seem right in my wheelhouse. Thank you very much for these which will act as a late Christmas present to me!

  Edit:

  Should probably add some of my own.

  Mother of Learning finished this year:

  Focused on a less-than powerful mage-in-training who is caught in a time loop and has to navigate this interesting setting that’s filled out pretty well. The setting isn’t anything completely original but it combines a lot of more general elements of fantasy world and really merges them into a finished product looks post acceptable and complex. Decently rational on its own with a pretty solid world and relatively simple characters which play out entertaining conflicts in creative ways. Very reminiscent of lots of Progression fantasy, but in a way that’s more complex at satisfying than Numbers-Go-Up even if it takes a bit longer. 
  The author has just now released the definitive premise for his news story which will follow a powerful arch mage in a separate fantasy universe which seems to be much more focused on the political and dramatic it’s of the world and building up an empire rather than individual power


  Worth the Candle speaks for itself.

  I pretty randomly read the Ex-Heroes series by Peter Clines which turned out to be surprisingly fun. Set in its own Marvel/DC-inspired super universe that has fallen way to a zombie apocalypse which scoured the planet. An extremely comic-bookey and absurd premise, but pretty fun and enjoyable and it’s execution. The characters and conflicts stuck with me which is a lot more than I can say about other things I’ve read. The characters are easily enjoyable and grow on you and it really has its own sense of personality which is rare. I was a little iffy on the depiction of a female character in the first book, there was nothing egregious, it just give me some bad vibes, but someone must’ve talk to the author by the second book because I really enjoy her from there on. This author did a really good job at describing the world, and used some relatively simplistic but incredibly effective setting techniques that I’m definitely gonna borrow. I don’t know why, it’s not one of the greatest things I’ve read, but this series really grew on me and I can honestly see myself rereading it in the future. If you’re a fan of comic book movies and want to read a series with likable characters in fantastical scenarios with with decently written, and enjoyable characters, written in a grounded and researched way, this is for you.

  I finally read Cradle by Will Wight and it is underdog, progression fantasy distilled to its purest form. The characters are far enough, the MC isn’t anything to write home about but some of the cast and antagonist are really enjoyable. If want to read a story about a kid coming from nothing and slowly ascending in power to reach the strongest than this might be for you. Inspired by the Cultivation genre, the magic system is relatively simple but it’s fun to think about. This is a pretty straightforward slow burn power fantasy that’s really solid with enjoyable action but nothing really special about it. If you enjoy typical progression Fantasy you WILL enjoy this, otherwise you might want to read it if you’re in the mood for some fun action.

  Honestly, most of the stuff I have read this year that I can remember has been fan fic, and not even the good kind.    


  A book that comes to mind that is better than most would expect is "The house of the Spirits" by Isabel Allende.  Its a magical realism story set in a  South American country and covers three generations of a family while discussing South America in the 1900s.   I never thought to myself that it was great writing prose wise, but it was well built and definitely makes you think book.

  I know it's kind of a classic, but I finally read **Hyperion** by Dan Simmons. And what can I say, I think it deserves its status. It's a really interesting book with a lot of interesting themes and intertwining stories as well as literary references. John Keats being the obvious one, but there's quite a lot of Canterbury Tales too in this story of pilgrims telling each other stories as they progress towards their goal (but being sci-fi, the pilgrimage is on another planet, and the goal is a meeting with some kind of otherworldly, alien, possibly time-transcendent beast that will most likely just kill them all). 

  Problem is, I still haven't gotten around reading the sequel, **The Fall of Hyperion**, mostly for trivial reasons. Namely that the pandemic means I don't commute any more, and that has severely cut into my usual reading habits. Oh well. I really need to find a better balance with the whole "working from home" shtick. I should get around to it before I forget all about the previous book though.

  Oh, on another note, just a curiosity, but I'm currently reading an Italian novel by one Michele Mari, **Io venia pien d'angoscia a rimirarti** ("I came full of anguish to admire you", I don't believe it has an official English translation though). Another book involving a famous romantic poet - this time it's the Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi - but the funny thing is that it's told in the form of a diary written by his (real) brother, and it seems pretty blatant it's a story about... lycanthropy. It's a genuine, not shlocky but actually written with stunningly accurate XIX century prose, book about Giacomo Leopardi - a gloomy, nerdy, hunchback poet whose core philosophy was built upon how much of an evil bitch Nature is to its creatures and who likely died a virgin younger than 40 - dealing with a werewolf. Or *being* a werewolf, I'm not sure yet. Make of that what you will.

  The most interesting work for me was Orson Welles' radio rendition of *War of the Worlds* on [The Mercury Theatre on the Air](https://www.bornalone.org/index.html). Tense, with an artistic touch, and a thought-provoking tone for the ending monologue. *Dracula* was also good. Liked The Mercury Theater way better than his movies, though *Touch of Evil* wasn't bad, and I have a soft spot for *The Stranger*.

  Apparently the world of radio drama which I've never bothered with has some [gems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet,_Please) worth trying.

  *Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!* was interesting enough that I've also started reading [The Feynman Lectures on Physics](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/).

  I've been going through the [Harvard Classics](https://www.bartleby.com/hc/). Special mentions go to John Woolman's *Journal*. Woolman was an American Quaker, and the journal is an interesting and often powerful mix of travel story, musings on conscience, and history, with a touch of Quaker oddity.

  For works posted on this sub, I've taken a liking to *Pokemon: Origin of Species* and *The Flower that Bloomed Nowhere*.

  Just to mention some ordinary novels: *HakoMari* (exceptionally good 1st book, was also one I learned about from here), *The Fountainhead* (better than expected, Ellsworth Toohey was a great villain), *Casino Royale* (interesting characterization of Bond, but inferior to the movie), book 2 of *The Lost Fleet* series (Jack Campbell, writing is, um, not inspired, but I liked Geary's character- controlled, hard-working, a man of integrity), Sanderson's *The Emperor's Soul* (short, focused, liked it better than Mistborn but the ending wasn't perfect), *Ender's Shadow* (a retelling of Ender's Game from Bean's perspective, good, a little uneven, and feels a little like some retconning going on with Bean's character), the first Hornblower novel *The Happy Return / Beat to Quarters* (was simply magic, and was an influence on *Star Trek*- reportedly Patrick Stewart was given a Hornblower novel when he asked about his character).

  Poe's *Masque of the Red Death* was as expected great.

  Things I started but haven't finished yet: Borges (seems to be one of those remarkable names that everyone knows but no-one talks about), William Morris' *The Well at the World's End* (apparently Tolkein and C. S. Lewis had a high opinion of it, its fascinating if you can tolerate the slow pace), *Null-A* (can't say I understand what its all about but its written well). One day I'll finish reading an actual Shakespeare play rather than watching the animated BBC versions. May try to read out Zamiatin's [We](https://mises.org/library/we) before the year ends.
