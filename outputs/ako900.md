## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  The creator of *CORDYCEPS* recently released a new Nanowrimo story by the name of [Dave Scum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SddGHeVfcVa5SCDHHTOA4RlKwnef-Q6IMw_Jqw9I0Mw). He's [expressed disappointment](https://itsbenedict.tumblr.com/post/182357227759/man-i-feel-kind-of-bad-about-how-nanowrimo-went) over how it turned out, but personally I thought it was excellent barring the ending.

  Highly recommended to those interested in reading about a funny man exploiting time travel mechanics in increasingly clever ways in order to save the world.

    Thanks for the recommendation!

    The narrative style wasn't to my tastes but I thought the story was done well. The very ending was ok, but the part before that was really good!
    ```

  So I recently realized that I'm very drawn to stories that play with being very meta-aware. It's hard to define, but it basically boils down to characters who are aware that their lives have tendency to follow literary/narrative rules over normal/every-day reality. But it's not being [Genre Savvy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy), rather it's a step beyond it. [Medium Savvy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness) is close, but it goes too far since I don't want stories where the characters are literally aware of being in a book.

  It's hard to clearly explain what stories have to do to have this quality, but I have list of recommendations that I hope help fill in the inference gap.

  [Game By God: Sludge Reformation](https://korridor.rip/) \- a murder mystery game show with 16 contestants who are well aware of the tropes of their genre.

  [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/) \- where heroic fantasy tropes are actual laws of the world instead of mundane physics and a young girl seeks out to be on top in an evil empire which is crumbling due to Good and Evil being out of balance.

  [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) \- a guy gets thrown into a world of fantasy that was recreated from his DnD sessions. Really plays with the idea of being a character in your own story.

  [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/) \- a girl wakes up with Gamer powers with the classic abilities to level up and increase stats. It has the twist that she's an eroge gamer rather than the classic RPG gamer and she actually takes the time to question and investigate why she has these powers instead of taking them for granted unlike the protagonists of other gamer stories.

  [A Thursday Next Novel](https://www.amazon.com/Thursday-Next-Novel-Book/dp/B00WKNLISI) \- a seven book series where people know they are characters in a story and act as if they are living real lives with the ability to move from story to story. Thursday Next is a Special Operative in literary detection who needs to rescue kidnapped literary characters.

  The following three are all kinda of similar where they are Korean-translated stories where the protagonist are reading a story and then became a character in the story, but they don't do enough with the concept (except Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint). I'm still including the other two since they at least flirt a little with what I'm trying to convey.

  [The Novel's Extra](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/the-novels-extra) \- Author is sucked into his own unfinished story of a modern heroic fantasy world to fight monsters and humans.

  [Trash of the Count's Family](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/trash-of-the-counts-family) \- Reader is sucked into the story of a medieval Asian high fantasy world to survive a coming war and he only read the first five volumes.

  [Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint](https://boxnovel.com/novel/omniscient-readers-viewpoint/) \- Reader is living through a game-like apocalypse where he read the entire series, but there were numerous unanswered questions about the original story. It's the only one out of the three that has the main character actually take the time to question and wonder about why he is in a story.

  Can anyone recommend similar works with themes of meta-awareness?

    Pact by Wildbow fits. There's a lot of intentionally performing a certain role so that you get the narrative power associated with that role.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I agree and I did like Pact more than Twig or Worm while most other readers considered it to be the worst of Wildbow's works. The narrative roles giving power and the overly legalistic karma system was a big reason for me liking Pact the best.

    For a non fantastical TV show recommendation, the sit-com 'Community' is very meta and one of the characters shticks is analysing in-story events as if they're in a tv show. (It's also hilarious imo and i recommend it to anyone who likes really quick, witty, fast paced humour).
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:

      Ooo...I'll have to check it out. I've barely watch any TV recently and the only exceptions were Sherlock Holmes and The Good Place.
      ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        I second the recommendation, and I will mention I'm enjoying TGP for a lot of the same reasons I enjoyed Community (though I think the latter is even better).
        ```

        If you're up for TV shows, there's a good Korean one on Netflix called Dramaworld. It's in English. A American teenager obsessed with Korean dramas suddenly finds herself inserted into a drama story where she has to act out a specific role to keep the story going.

    Personally, took a bit of time for me to get going, but overall enjoyed it.

    Reminded of [Harry Potter and the Natural 20](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20), which I've been rereading; you're already aware of it but for the sake of those who may not be.  A D&D character is translated into the HP universe, and operates using his knowledge of narrative logic as well as D&D rules.  There are two complete "books" and one in progress (but the updates are no longer regular).

    The novels extra, counts family, and readers viewpoint are alll translated novels from chinese and korean source. I am really into this type of premise but the problem is translated novels from korea and china makes it seem like im reading something written by an 8th grader. Which of the 3 has the better reading experience?
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      The Novel's Extra and Count's Family are both hosted on [wuxiaworld.com](https://wuxiaworld.com) which is a site that prides itself on having professional level translation so these two are at least well-written if you like the plots. I usually only read translated books from wuxiaworld because of this.

      Omniscient Reader doesn't have as good of a translator, but the plot and setting is really *novel* in a lot of ways and I found it made up for the not as good translation.

      Depends on which is more important to you: plot or translation quality.

    My favorite rom-com manga of all time, it's probably the first manga I've read that got both laughs and tears out of me!

    The fact it's getting an anime adaption and is getting more popular is awesome too.

  - u/Addictedtobadfanfict:
    ```
    The problem with this manga for me was that there was no world building. I dropped it during the summer festival firework arc and it was still centered around the 4 or 5 of them. Did they ever introduced more world building such as rival schools or rival love interests to make it more shouneny?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      No. The world building is centered entirely around the one school and its inhabitants. And the author hates love triangles. 

      Although you may be joking; I don’t think I ever heard anyone asking for a romcom to be more shonen.

  If you've got a VR headset, I highly recommend [Virtual Virtual Reality](https://store.steampowered.com/app/889480/Virtual_Virtual_Reality/).
  My only gripe with it is after the ending, where >!you ursurp administrator priviledges and acquire the ability ascend the stack of heretofore inaccessible realities above the ones you start out in. The topmost one is some lame tumbleweed minigame. Where I find that thematically it would've been perfect to shut down your actual RL VR headset when you attempt to ascend past the one below it.!<

  Read [The Reluctant Swordman](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53546.The_Reluctant_Swordsman) based on last week's rec thread mention. It was an OK read, but not particularly great; while the adventures are engaging, only one or two characters are interesting at all, and it's hard to cheer for MC who wins mostly by deus ex fiat. Read it if you're looking for an easy action flick and have nothing better to do :P

    If you want a fun sword and sorcery romp, try [Cold Iron](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30344847-cold-iron).

Very well written book, especially the beginning (you don't see that a lot).

  Has anybody here found any rational or rational-adjacent cosmic horror? I recently finished some bloodborne fanfiction and they are really fun, but their cosmic horror aspects are often pretty lacking. A lot of them don't include horror elements and the ones that do merely borrow the aesthetic. Sigh.

  An important part of cosmic horror in my opinion is cultivating a sense of mystery. You can’t just say “ohh look at these tentacles, mankind wasn’t supposed to know about these tentacles, they’ll make you go maaaaaaad!” You’re just borrowing the aesthetic. You have show the reader that these things are mysterious and horrific rather than just saying so or using standard ‘eldritch horror’ signals.

  Lovecraft did a decent job of this in some of his stories and, surprisingly, HPMOR did as well, although it was not the focus of the story and barely received any screentime as result.

  EDIT: I think a rational approach to cosmic horror would work well because you couldn't just blithely accept that the horror elements are inherently mysterious, and as a result you have to do the legwork that lazy attempts at cosmic horror avoid. ie the quintessential rational protagonist when approaching some "eldritch god" might investigate it, with various hypotheses that explain it along the way. Each of these are disproven which helps convince the reader that this might be inherently mysterious after all.

    Try [14](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15062217-14) and [The Fold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23164927-the-fold) by Peter Clines. Both are set in the same metaverse, with different stories and characters. 14 is my favorite, a horror mystery with an apartment that is just a tiny bit off, and every new detail only makes it weirder. The Fold is also very good, but I found the big reveal a bit more predictable.

    The perfect example of what you want is actually the SCP series "There is no Antimemetic Division", and all the subsequent mini-series that followed after it. (Quality dips for spin-offs written by other members of the forum.)

    Anti-memes are anomalies that erase information/memeories about themselves. An amazing premise that the original author realizes to an incredible extent. The best I've ever seen comic horror done.

    Possibly the laundry files, by Charles Stross. The main character is an agent of an organzation that deals with cosmic horrors, I have only read the first two books though so idk about later books. Probably more rational adjaent than explicitly rational.

      There's a blood procurement chapter in *The Rhesus Chart* that's just about the epitome of what I think of when I think of this subreddit. Impeccably researched, reveling in what things look like in the real world, and just about everything that I could ask for in a combination of infodump and investigation.

      I would agree more rational adjacent than rational, though it depends on which book in the series you're talking about.

  I am looking for self-insert fanfiction. I felt like I read all of the good ones and there are thousands of them. The problem with self insert fanfiction is that it is riddled with crack, effortless powerups, mindless fix-it, and harems. Like it was almost *designed* to mainly have all those qualities, *sigh*. I want to read self-insert fanfiction that takes itself seriously and not for it to exist to troll canon characters. More like reading a cosmically kidnapped interdimensional survival guide and less like an OP omniscient god playing with everyone's fate. 


  Sure the self-insert fic can have comedy, fix-it arcs, powerups, and a harem but, only as long as it's moderate  and it comes through to the readers logically. Here is a quote by my favorite self-insert fanfic author, "Every fanfic is wish-fulfillment. The best written ones just make you believe it isn't."-Sir lucifer morning star.


  Here are my favorite self inserts. I would like to think I have good taste but some of these recs can make me seem like a hypocrite. Some fics have the SI to be OP(basically all gamer fics) but, I felt like the premises of the self inserts play out rationally and fairly given the situation. Note that I try to avoid stories with ROBs(random omnipotent beings) because they ruin all sense of narrative causality in a story. IE-*Who cares if I die in this new world. There is a confirmed afterlife. ROB will bail me out. Let me just have a fun adventure*.


  Naruto Self-Inserts.

  [Sanitize-](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize) Female SI, professional doctor reincarnated in the ninja warring clans era. Has no knowledge of Naruto. Very Slow updates.

  to shut the SI down in this fanfic. Slow updates.

  [Walk on Moon- ](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10779196/1/Walk-on-the-Moon) Female SI, Reincarnated as the yamanaka heir. Mixed feelings with this one but I felt like it deserves a recommendation because it's one of the few girl SIs that strive to become a S class ninja. Hiatus.

  [Wilted Irises- ]( https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wilted-irises-naruto-si.52403/) Male SI, reincarnated as the hyuga heir.

  [Sleight Advantage- ](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/sleight-advantage-naruto-reincarnation-si.37698/) Male SI, reincarnated as an average civilian. Joining the ninja academy he must make due with his below average chakra coils so he specializes in magic misdirection. Dead.

  [What doesn't Kill you-](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10264082/1/What-Doesn-t-Kill-You) Female SI, reincarnated as Orichimaru's supposed daughter. Has one of the most realistic and amazing Root induction scenes out there. I highly recommend just for this arc. Dead.

  [I opened my eyes and the world wasn't there-](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358802/1/I-opened-my-eyes-and-the-world-wasn-t-there)Male SI, 65 year old well-educated mathematician reincarnated as a civilian orphan.

  [Tyrant of the Bay-](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/tyrant-of-the-bay-worm-cyoa.14472/ )Reincarnated and later triggered as an overpowered alexandria. Has alot of wish fulfilment and fix-it but it builds up to it and doesn't come out of nowhere. Dead.

  [Going Native-](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/worm-going-native.17415/) Male SI, reincarnated and later triggered with the power to rewind time a couple of seconds. Very fun shard and makes a point to rationally avoid taylor to not butterfly the plot to earth bet's doom. Dead.

  Young Justice/Dc comic self inserts.

  [With this Ring- ](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/) Male SI, transmigrated to the moon orbiting earth with an orange power ring. He proceeds to munchkin and deconstruct the dc universe. Fast updates.

  Harry Potter Self-inserts.

  [Magical Me- ](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/Magical-Me) Male SI body swapped into Professor Lockhart. With the knowledge of the future the SI strives to become an actually useful defense against the dark arts profesor. Dead.

  [Whats Her Name in Hufflepuff](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff) Female SI transmigrated into a 10 year old version herself in the HP universe. There isn’t really any outright characteristic that makes this self insert stand out. It is just everything I was looking for of what would someone logically do being transmigrated to the HP universe. She rationalizes her decisions and she even delves into the topic of childishly arguing with her fellow preteen classmates, being a 30 year old woman, because of her now young hormonal body. Slow updates.

  Star wars.

  [Paths of Ruin-](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/path-of-ruin-star-wars-si.541256/)
  Male SI, transmigrated as a slave in a mining vessel controlled by the sith empire. Honestly everything from Rictus, the author of this self insert, is good. He has like 7 different self inserts but this is his most popular and most fleshed out one. Fast updates.

      Presumably, he hasn't found anything noteworthy or just wants even *more* recommendations. I've seen another thread at SV, too.

      If my eyes see correctly, there are some new recs inside the post, so it seems to get updated with fresh stuff. Since it acts as a recommendation as well as a request, I kinda like this approach.
      ```

    - u/Makin-:

  What would you recommend that updates very regularly (e.g. weekly or more often)?

  &#x200B;

  The only things I have this category are webcomics - I was reading With this Ring and found the daily update schedule added quite a nice element to my day, but I was getting a bit tired of it and decided the recent forum move (and to a lesser extent the events leading to it) was a good prompt to stop. I'm wondering  if there's anything good to replace it with.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Can you be clear on what you want? Just asking for something that updates frequently is too vague, because there's a lot out there that updates regularly.

    Web serials like [Ward](https://www.parahumans.net/) are updating with multiple chapters per week.

    There's fanfiction authors who update their stories on a weekly basis like [Coeur Al'Aran](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6272865/Coeur-Al-Aran) who writes amazing RWBY stories.

    There's wuxia stories on [wuxiaworld.com](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/) and [webnovel.com](https://webnovel.com) (although this site charges for the latest chapters, be warned) that update on a daily basis.

    Your request is too broad. Can you specify what you are interested in that I can recommend something that is updating frequently?
    ```

  - u/boomfarmer:
    ```
    Well, if you frequent this sub you're probably aware of Practical Guide to Evil.

    I'll add the webcomic [Sword Interval](https://m.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/sword-interval/list?title_no=486) as a recommendation for a weekly update with rational characters.

Both are portal fantasy 'uplift' stories, where the MC tries to introduce modern tech to a backwards people. World of Prime is pretty good, but has a rough 1/3 or so of the first book. 

    Destiny's Crucible drags on a bit too long, and I found the ending a bit unsatisfying, but it's decent enough.

  I'm searching for something good to read and would like some suggestions. I'm already reading Practical Guide to Evil, Worth the Candle and Mother of Learning and I like those a lot. So, based os those three, do you guys have any good recomendations that I could like as well?
  ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    These are the three main web serials i read too, having slowly dropped over time all the other serials recommended in this sub. The two best pieces of online fiction that i've read recently that are comparable in quality were actually Harry Potter fanfic:

    Hermoine Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation 

    Applied Cultural Anthropology, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus

    The former is rational/ist and the latter is at at the least rational adjacent. Both are currently incomplete and may remain that way for some time though. Also, if you haven't read through the backlog of Alexander Wales, the author of Worth The Candle, you should. Metropolitan Man and The Dark Wizard of Donkerk are especially great.
