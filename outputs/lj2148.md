## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You live in a fairy tale-esque setting where the Dark One (a local Satan/Loki analogue) is allowed to punish people who transgress against certain culturally mandated standards of behavior. The severity of punishment scales with the degree of transgression, but does not ameliorate the transgression itself - as long as a person continues to go against the expected behaviors, they continue to be open to bad luck, tricks, sickness, monster attacks, etc. sent by the Dark One as punishment. Knowing transgressions are treated more harshly than unknowing transgressions, but even unknowing transgressions can provoke an initial punishment. It is easy to tell if someone is being punished by the Dark One, and religious professionals have the ability to identify the cause of a curse.

  One such standard of behavior has to do with gift-giving: If a free person (not a vassal, a child, a houseguest or a prisoner) is presented with a gift, they are culturally required to accept the gift; to reciprocate with a gift of comparable value; and to refrain from selling, renting or otherwise profiting economically from the gift. The gift-giver is in turn expected to accept (and refrain from profiting off of) the reciprocation-gift and avoid coming into the possession of any physical object which they have gifted away. It is acceptable to re-gift a physical object on to a third party, but not to gift such an object to any prior owner. It is acceptable for subordinate (a vassal, a child, guest or prisoner) to give a gift to one of their superiors (liege, elder, host, jailer) and to expect a reciprocation-gift in return. An oath of vassalage, an unqualified favour or release from either of the same is considered to be a 'comparable' reciprocation-gift no matter what the original gift might have been. The prohibition against using gifts to make a profit apply in full to oaths of vassalage and offered favours, but not to release from the same - if you 'profit' by being released from your duty to pay rents, that doesn't count as 'profit' for the purposes of running afoul of the custom. 

  It is possible to argue with the Dark One and convince to rule one way or another on ambiguous cases, but the Dark One is a malicious sadist and does not care for justice - it only agrees to serve in this custom-enforcing role because doing so lets it hurt people that it would not otherwise be allowed to hurt. As such, it will always pretend to be swayed by whatever seemingly-plausible, easily-articulable and self-consistent set of standards lets it inflict the greatest amount of suffering through the exercise of its office while still being able to pretend to the Sky Father that it is simply upholding its role as God of Retribution with well-intentioned impartiality. Finally, it should be noted that the Dark One is not exempt from these rules and may be summoned on any number of pretexts, only to be presented with a gift and forced to use its Evil God Powers to provide a comparable gift in return.

   * As such an unscrupulous person, what is your best Wicked Plot to abuse the gift-giving rules in order to extract wealth and/or power from the community around you without being exploited in turn? How do you avoid your Wicked Plot being turned around on you by the next person who hears about it?

   * As the Dark One, what sorts of dangerous gifts do you offer to witches who summon you? Assume that the Sky Father will not permit you to use your evil magic to give the mortals anything which they have not learned how to make for themselves - no epidemic diseases, strong AI, nanotechnology, etc.

   * As an average farmer, how do you avoid getting caught up in weird gift magic curse bargains? Assume that you don't have to carry a gift around with you, but that you do have to set off right away to retrieve and present the gift if you promise one to someone under these rules.

    For a unscrupulous person... giving gifts that seem like tiny tokens but are actually worth immense value (made of concealed precious material, useful but hidden magical enchantments, non-obvious high level of craftsmanship, etc.) seems like a clever trick.

    You could give the Witches blackmail information.  Given that you by your evil nature know gifts that are exchanged and when someone breaks the gift rule (and other rules) you surely know a lot of blackmail worthy material.

    For a peasant farmer... one exploit I can think of is a bunch of heavy stones which the entire village agrees have a variety of large values.  Kind of like [Rai Stones](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones).  Whenever evil noble man tries giving a precious item to an innocent peasant, they return the favor with one of their heavy and totally valuable stones (more specifically, the village as a collective gifts an appropriately “valued” Stone to the peasant who in turns gifts the valuable item to the village, then the peasant gifts the stone to the evil nobleman.  The evil nobleman can’t refuse the stone.  Overtime, the village builds up a collection of stones that are “owned” by evil noblemen serving as a reminder that collective action can overcome the oppression of the nobility.  And if any noble tries objecting... they get a extra valuable stone.  If the Dark One shows up to complain that stones aren’t actually valuable... he gets the most valuable stone, valued at an entire kingdom.  As to establishing the stone’s value the village could use various tricks... maybe establish that similarly carved but much smaller stones have a certain value related to their carving and weight through actual usage and then have the giant stones get their immense “value” this way.  Or build up precedents with less valuable stones?  Or use complex financial derivatives?  If the stones have to actually be used, they could use fractions of stones as “barter” items internally to establish value that way (never using using the same fraction twice to maximize accumulation of wealth).

    Also, obvious exploit... what happens if someone dies, or worse, is murdered?  Do outstanding gift obligations get passed on, or fade away, or become Dark Lord fodder?  The Village might be in trouble if someone decides killing all of them is a viable solution, but they could setup a nasty revenge like creating a death obligation worth entire kingdoms by giving away their remaining stones in a collective will.

      With the Rai Stones idea, I feel like you could probably just put up a stone with the owner's name carved into it as an monument to their honour. This has the added advantage that the stone can't even be re-gifted, since it is far less valuable to someone whose name isn't even on the stone. But there's also probably an upper bound to the stone's value unless you're constructing an actual stone building. 

      If someone dies with outstanding debt, they likely rise as a frequently tormented ghost who then harasses passers-by into fulfilling their unfinished obligations.

  By repeatedly (for several hours) using an object in a particular way while focusing on it, you can grant it minor magical powers related to that usage.  These magical powers are generally limited to stuff the object might do normally under particular conditions and the "magic" allows the object to ignore those conditions.

  You can share these objects with people and they retain their powers, but powers that require careful intentions or direction might not be reliable for other people.  To use an example given below, the knife that blinds people with light may turn on the user and blind them if they aren't careful with it.

  * For example, reflect the sunlight off a knife repeatedly, you can allow the knife to emit that same level of light even when not in the sun.  If you also reflected the light into someone's eyes, you could further modify this power to allow the knife's emitted light to automatically target people's eyes and temporarily blind them.
  * For another example... allowing the knife to repeatedly slip out of and into your hand could give the knife the power to jump a few feet into or out of your hand.
  * For a really simple example, have the knife cut smoothly through soft objects like butter or paper for several hours and then you get a knife that can cut through anything like butter or paper.
  * Play a particular song on a recorder as someone falls asleep repeatedly, and the recorder becomes able to put people to sleep whenever someone play that song.  Actually, you could allow the recorder to play itself, since someone playing it is a condition, but then it would not be controllable by other people.
  * A wind suit used in a vertical wind tunnel could allow for upward flight.

  So best usages you can think?  For reselling for money?  For everyday use?  For big impact that you couldn't accomplish without the magic?

  The single most powerful big impact usage I can think of is divination objects... for example use dowsing rods to find arbitrary things or a particular category of things (if you plan to resell them to other people and want to keep the usage reliable) that you already know where they are, then they gain the power to find things that you don't know where they are.

  Edit 1: The object must be directly used by you, ideally something you can wear or carry by hand.  Operating a nuclear power plant is too far of a remove.  Something big and static but directly muscle powered by you is just within reach of your power (requiring more time of use and getting weaker end results), or something small and handheld but with lots of hidden complex systems, like a phone or laptop is also only just barely within this powers limits (granting a book a knowledge granting power would be faster, easier and more effective than granting the same power to a laptop, but the laptop might make up for it with multiple overlapping and interacting powers).

    How minor are we talking? Because being able to put people to sleep with a recorder or a wingsuit which generates magical upward flight seem to be pushing the definition of minor powers. 

    Not to mention if these magical powers don't fade, then it seems you have a bunch of ways to generate free energy. The knife is already generating light and the wingsuit produces gravitational potential energy. If you're allowed to do something similar to the knife with solar mirrors or power satellites beaming microwaves to Earth, then that's free solar energy even when they're not in sunlight. 

    It feels like cheating, but is there anything in your rules which says I can't just run a nuclear power plant for a while and then get energy out of it even when there's no fuel? It's a much bigger scale than upward flight or magical knife sunlight, but I can't see how it's fundamentally different. 

    It feels like there's a bunch of mind control you could achieve too. Play a horror movie on your phone and then even when your phone's not playing you can scare people. Read some educational materials on your laptop for a few hours and you can keep learning from it even when it's not turned on.

      “Minor” refers to the fact that the class of effect is limited by what can be induced by surrounding “conditions”... which I suppose under extreme enough conditions ceases to be minor.  So I guess not so minor?  

      If you want free energy... just take coil of wire as the object, move it through a electromagnetic field repeatedly, and then you can make it output unlimited AC electricity.

      You need to be directly using the object in some way.  So the nuclear power plant is a bit beyond that... so if you want free electricity at industrial scale, turning a giant coil of wire through a magnetic field is your best bet.  

      The mind control is a solid application I didn’t think of... overlap a bunch of minor effects like causing jump scares, helping someone relax, normal hypnosis, vertigo, dizziness, etc into a single object.  

      Getting unlimited knowledge from a book/laptop is an interesting mind bending application.  Depending on how you read the book it might just passively and continuously emit knowledge (related to the books topic), or it might fill your mind with knowledge in response to queries, or some combination of the two.

    I can, over time, magnify the effect of any exercise machines I use. I can, with care and a skipping rope, approach a state of ideal health and fitness automagically.

    If I mess around with neural networks that I write myself on a laptop that I can carry, can I leverage this to end up with strong AI?

  - u/munkeegutz:

    I think that all of the really exciting outcomes of this power come from having multiple effects imparted onto a single object.  For instance, a e-reader which both <passively confers information it contains into your mind>, and <convinces people that its contents are true>.  

    These powers are powerful if you ping-pong between them, but things get extra ctazy if they are used *simultaneously*.  In that case, you can add more and more abilities on an object to make it versatile and potent.  You could have an ebook which 

    * <conveys information at an unrealistic speed> by practicing speed reading, 
    * <is readable by many people simultaneously> by using technology to have several hundred people read it at the same time, 
    * <convinces people of its contents rapidly> by having people read convincing rhetoric from it, 
    * <works without seeing the book>, by having people listen to an automated audiobook playing from the ebook device
    * <has any information needed at any time>, by loading significant information off of the internet
    * <brainwashes people>, by using it as a cult indoctrination tool

    Using these powers together and simultaneously, this produces a powerful large-scale convincing tool - if you can use powers simultaneously

    In the vein of "a knife that cuts",  I'd make:

    - A pen that communicates
    - A clipboard that gathers data
    - A stethoscope that measures health, and a ??? that improves it.
    - A set of weights that makes you stronger
    - A sunlamp that improves mood, and a grow light that grows plants
    - An alarm that notifies people and motivates appropriate action
    - [PPE that protects you](https://youtu.be/aPZ8kEq9nkA?t=20)

    As for *obvious* magic:

    - "perpetual motion machines", including self-charging batteries and all other sources of free energy
    - storage devices, such as a backpack which fits items and can be carried easily 
    - A sieve that separates things according to arbitrarily-defined criteria instead of size
    - Similarly, a compass or plumbob that points towards arbitrary criteria instead of magnetic fields
    - A map which shows the territory
    ```
